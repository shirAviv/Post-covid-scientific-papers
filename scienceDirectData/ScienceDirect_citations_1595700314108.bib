To determine the association between the rs1256031 polymorphism and risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
Materials and Methods
Cases and controls study. 597 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 605 without it participated. Genotyping of the rs1256031 polymorphism of the ERβ gene was performed by real-time PCR using TaqMan assay. For the multivariate analysis, a multiple logistic regression was performed that included the main confounding variables.
Results and conclusion
A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed, adjusting for age, WHR, BMI and gender. The dominant model showed a protective effect compared to the TT genotype (OR = 0.596, IC95% [0.458–0.776]). Discussion. The proportions of native American, European and African ancestry were characterized and no difference was found in the study groups. The protective effect obtained in the dominant model could to be due a regulatory function in the transcription or the processing of the primary transcript. Our result are the first to report an association between the polymorphism rs1256031 and the reduction of the risk of T2D in the Mexican population. The rs1256031 polymorphism show reduced risk of developing T2D and is potential markers for predicting T2D."

To develop an intervention and evaluate its effectiveness in pharmacotherapeutic empowerment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Method
This is an intervention study with before and after evaluation. The intervention was conducted between 2015 and 2016 with users of the Unified Health System (SUS) in Brazil. The study was divided into six stages: initial evaluation, three individual patient-pharmacist meetings every 15 days over 6 weeks, clinical discussion between pharmacists, and final evaluation. At each meeting with the patient, specific themes for empowerment were addressed using educational booklets and pharmaceutical care. Clinical and laboratory evaluations and questionnaires on self-efficacy (IMDSES), self-care (QAD) and distress (PAID-5) were conducted before and three months after the intervention.
Results
47 patients completed the intervention. Glycated hemoglobin of patients had a median reduced from 7.0% to 6.6% after the intervention (p = 0.02). There was a significant difference (p < 0.01) in the reduction in total cholesterol, fasting glycemia, creatinine and blood pressure. Participants showed significant improvements (p < 0.01) in scores related to self-efficacy and self-care and less distress related to T2DM.
Conclusion
The results of the study suggest that the strategy developed is effective in promoting the empowerment of T2DM patients, improved glycemic control and self-care."

To assess the association of dairy consumption and dietary calcium intake with general and abdominal obesity in a large sample of Iranian adults.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, dairy consumption and dietary calcium intake were assessed using a validated dish-based 106-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire in 6582 Iranian adults aged 18–55 years living in Isfahan. A self-administered validated questionnaire was used to collect data on anthropometric measures. Overweight or obesity was considered as body mass index ≥25 kg/m2, and abdominal obesity as waist circumference ≥88 cm for women and ≥102 cm for men.
Results
Mean age of study participants was 36.8 ± 8.1 years. Compared with the lowest quartile, men in the highest quartile of dietary calcium intake had greater odds for general obesity (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03-1.60). This relationship was significant even after adjustment for age and energy intake (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.03-1.60). However, such relationship was not seen in women. No other significant associations were observed between dairy and dietary calcium intake with general or abdominal obesity.
Conclusion
Dietary calcium intake was positively associated with general obesity in men, but not in women. No significant association was seen between dairy consumption and general or central adiposity."

The present study aims to systematically evaluate the literature and perform a meta-analysis on the effects of yoga practice compared to physical exercise in the management of T2DM. Data were obtained using a stepwise search process using keywords in the following online medical databases; PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. All controlled clinical trials involving patients with T2DM, comparing yoga as an intervention with physical exercise and evaluating glycaemic control and other outcomes between the intervention and control groups were included in the analysis. Eight studies were eligible to be included in the systematic review. In total, 842 participants were assigned to a Yoga intervention or a control group with an Exercise intervention and the age range of participants was 30–78 years. A significant reduction in FBG (15.16 mg/dl), PPBG (28.66 mg/dl), HbA1c (0.39%) and BMI (0.71 kg/m2) was noted in the intervention group (‘Yoga’) compared to the control group (‘Physical Exercise’) in the pooled analysis. We did not observe any significant difference between the two groups for lipid parameters, other body composition measures (WC and WHR) and Blood Pressure. In conclusion, our results show that Yoga has beneficial effects on glycaemic control in comparison to physical exercise in T2DM However, individual studies showed considerable heterogeneity. Hence, further well-controlled randomized trials are required prior to drawing conclusions about the benefits of yoga in comparison to physical exercise."

Therefore, PRL level changes in type II diabetes and it can be concluded that PRL can play an important role in metabolic disorders of glucose. The present study is carried out in order to investigate the association between serum levels of PRL and type II DM. Blood samples were taken from 64 females affected by type II diabetes and 70 healthy ones, whose PRL level was measured using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technique. It was a case-control study, and based on the definition dedicated to each group, subjects were assigned to two groups. The patient group included the subjects with type II diabetes while the control group included healthy samples. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (Mann-Whitney test, t-test, and spearman's rho correlation test). According to the results, PRL concentration in the serum of people affected by type II diabetes (5.32 ± 0.36) was significantly (P˂0.05) lower than that of control group (18.38 ± 2.3). The results also showed that in type II diabetes, the level of PRL changes so that the concentration of PRL in the serum of the patients was lower than that of healthy ones. Therefore, PRL concentration in the blood can be related to diabetes."

This study aimed to identify the gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) prevalence of low risk pregnant population at a tertiary referral center by different approaches.
Material and methods
A cross-sectional study using retrospective data between 2007-2017 was conducted. During this period 77227 patients underwent either two step or one step glucose tolerance tests.
Results
The median age of the study population was 27 (15–49). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) testing was evaluated in 144,113 women at the initial antenatal care visit which %21 of these were between 92-126 mg/dL. Of these women %1.25 had FPG>126 mg/dL which showed the prevalence of pregestational diabetes in our cohort. During the study period 74412 women underwent 50-g glucose challenge test where %18 were screen positive and % 2.9 was defined as gestational diabetic without need for further testing (>180 mg/dL). The screening positive patients were sent to 100-g oral glucose tolerance test and the prevalence of GDM with two-step screening was 5.5%. A total of 2815 patients were screened by 75-g glucose tolerance test and the prevalence of GDM with one-step screening was 21%. Overall 4684 patients have been diagnosed as gestational diabetes mellitus with the prevalence of 6.07%.
Conclusion
Fasting plasma glucose >92 mg/dL is challenging in our population due to improper fasting. The FPG dependent GDM prevalence is almost four times higher than two-step glucose screening test results (21.8% vs 5.5%). If FPG levels will be used for diagnosing GDM then the values must be checked in a second laboratory analysis."

Fasting blood glucose is the current protocol for assessing metabolic impairment. However, recent studies have shown young adults may have normal fasting blood glucose levels with underlying irregularities in postprandial glucose regulation, insulin secretion and cortisol release, which causes a pattern of visceral fat accumulation. Visceral fat of the volunteers was assessed using the DXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) full body scanning method; the waist was assessed by taking the circumference at the midpoint between the lower margin of the last palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest to formulate a waist to height ratio (WHtR); fasting glucose levels were measured via point-of-care (POC) finger-stick method using the Abbott Precision blood glucose meter and anxiety levels. The Pearson R correlation test showed significance between GAD-7 and VAT Volume at r = 0.513 VAT Mass r = 0.514 body fat percentage r = 0.407 and Android r = 0.419. This correlation between GAD-7 and VAT Volume and VAT Mass shows the physiological connection between elevated visceral fat and heightened anxiety. High amounts of visceral fat may lead to an increase in insulin and cortisol levels. The study may suggest that increased fasting blood glucose is not necessarily the best predictor of metabolic dysregulation in a population of healthy college students."

Methods
Stress questionnaires - Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale (PSLES), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Sense of Coherence (SOC) - were administered to 500 Newly Detected Diabetes Mellitus (NDDM) cases and 500 Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT) controls recruited following 75 g OGTT. Assessment of stress was completed before the diagnosis of diabetes was revealed to them.
Results
PSLES and PSS scores were significantly higher and SOC score was significantly lower in NDDM subjects compared to those with NGT. PSLES and PSS correlated positively with anthropometric parameters (waist circumference, BMI), glycemic parameters (FPG, 2 hPG, A1C) and HOMA-IR and inversely with HOMA-β whereas SOC correlated inversely with glycemic parameters (FPG, 2 hPG, A1C) and HOMA-IR and positively with HOMA-β. In stepwise logistic regression analysis, SOC emerged as the strongest independent predictor of diabetes (OR: 0.774) after HOMA-IR (OR: 1.621) and BMI (OR: 1.288).

This study was done to assess the risk factors associated with diabetic foot ulcer-free survival in patients with diabetes.
Materials and Methods
Based on a prospective cohort study, ADFC (Ahvaz Diabetic Foot Cohort) study, carried out in a university hospital, all of the patients with diabetes were followed up for new diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). The time of ulcer development was final outcome during two years in the present study. To analyze the data, the variables were first evaluated by univariate analysis. Subsequently variables with P value <0.2 were tested in multivariate analysis, using backward elimination multiple Cox regression.
Results
From among 605 eligible patients of ADFC study, 566 patients without foot ulcer were included for a 2- years follow-up. Thirty subjects (5.3%) developed DFU during the study course none of whom underwent amputation. The DFU-free survival rate was 0.945 over two years of follow-up. In final multivariate Cox regression analysis, the variables which remained in the model and had a statistically significant relationship with time to develop foot ulcer were: dyslipidemia, history of DFU or amputation, nephropathy callus formation in the feet and diabetes duration. Foot deformity and patients' training about self-care of their feet were statistically borderline significant.
Conclusions
The DFU-free survival rate was 0.945 over two years of follow-up. In this study, independent risk factors associated with ulcer-free survival in diabetic foot patients were dyslipidemia, prior history of DFU or amputation, diabetic nephropathy, callus formation in the feet and diabetes duration."

abstract = "Introduction
Renal tubulo-interstitial damage has an important role in the pathogenesis of early diabetic nephropathy. Urinary biomarkers can help in the detection of early nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to estimate the levels of urinary neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin-C in type 2 diabetic patients with early diabetic nephropathy & to compare them with diabetic patients without nephropathy and to correlate urinary NGAL and cystatin-C levels with microalbuminuria in them.
Study design
Cross-sectional comparative study.
Material and methods
The study was conducted on 126 patients with type 2 diabetes along with 30 control subjects attending the outpatient care department of a tertiary care teaching hospital. There were 3 study groups-diabetic patients with microalbuminuria, diabetic patients without albuminuria and control subjects who were non-diabetic without any renal disease. Details on duration of diabetes and glycemic status were obtained from the patients. Urine examination was done for subjects in all the groups to look for microalbuminuria along with estimation of NGAL and cystatin-C levels. Samples were stored at −20 °C in the deep freezer.
Results
Urinary NGAL and cystatin-C levels were significantly elevated in patients with microalbuminuria (228.18 & 3.23 ng/ml) as compared to those without albuminuria (146.12 & 2.61 ng/ml) and in control subjects (26.56 & 0.30 ng/ml). Urinary NGAL and cystatin-C levels showed a linear correlation with microalbuminuria in diabetic patients.
Conclusion
Urinary NGAL and cystatin-C levels were increased in type 2 diabetic patients with early diabetic nephropathy as compared to patients without nephropathy. Urine NGAL and cystatin-C levels also showed a positive correlation with microalbuminuria (urine albumin-creatinine ratio) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Cardiometabolic index (CMI), calculated as the product of waist-to-height ratio and triglycerides-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, has been proposed as a discriminator of diabetes and has been reported to be associated with progression of atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between alcohol drinking and CMI in men with diabetes.
Methods
The subjects were Japanese male workers aged from 35 to 65 years with diabetes mellitus (n = 1411). The subjects were divided by average daily alcohol consumption (g ethanol/day) into 4 categories of alcohol drinking (nondrinkers; light drinkers, < 22; moderate drinkers, ≥ 22 and < 44; heavy drinkers, ≥ 44). CMI and variables comprising CMI were compared in the nondrinker and each of the drinker groups. Age, habits of smoking and regular exercise, and a present history of medication therapy for diabetes were adjusted in each analysis.
Results
Log-transformed CMI was significantly lower in light and moderate drinkers than in nondrinkers. Waist-to-height ratio was significantly lower in moderate drinkers than in nondrinkers, while log-transformed triglycerides was significantly higher in heavy drinkers than in nondrinkers. HDL cholesterol tended to be higher with an increase of alcohol consumption. Odds ratios with their 95% confidence intervals vs. nondrinkers for high CMI were 0.53 (0.36–0.78) in light drinkers, 0.61 (0.46–0.80) in moderate drinkers, and 0.74 (0.55–1.00) in heavy drinkers.
Conclusions
In men with diabetes, CMI is lower in light-to-moderate drinkers than in nondrinkers, and this results mainly from a positive association between alcohol drinking and HDL cholesterol."

The aims of this study is to address the improvement in CRP and adiponectin in obese PCOS and non PCOS after bariatric surgery, and to show that obese PCOS women have a slower rate of improvement when compared to obese non PCOS women.
Methods
This is a prospective case-control study evaluating the effect of weight loss by sleeve gastrectomy among obese PCOS patients.
Results
There was a 36.28% of weight loss among obese PCOS and 33.04% among the control group at 12 months. Both groups showed a significant increase in the adiponectin levels at 3, 6 and 12 months’ post-surgery. The rate of increase was higher in the obese non PCOS women (4.93 ± 1.79–9.79 ± 3.9) compared to obese PCOS women (5.05 ± 1.98–7.25 ± 0.21). The CRP levels decreased with weight loss after the surgery to reach statistical significance at 3 months in obese PCOS group (4.18 ± 3.94, p = 0.048).
Conclusion
The degree of weight loss after surgery was effective in lowering CRP and increasing adiponectin levels in PCOS women. However, this improvement was slower compared to obese non PCOS patients. A genetic predisposition to insulin resistance might explain these findings."

Numerous clinical trials have shown that sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors exert a favorable effect on the indices of renal function (albuminuria, glomerular filtration rate decline over time) and the incidence of hard renal endpoints such as renal death or time to initiation of renal replacement therapy.
Materials and methods
In this review, we describe in detail the evidence regarding the nephroprotective mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors and describe the risk factors that may predispose to the development of acute kidney injury in patients receiving these drugs.
Results
Although the impact of these drugs on renal hemodynamics seems to represent the most important renoprotective mechanism of action, many other effects of these compounds, including beneficial effects on metabolism and blood pressure, have been proposed to contribute to the observed clinical benefit.
Conclusions
SGLT2 inhibitors clearly act beneficially in terms of kidney function with many proposed mechanisms."

To determine the association between serum levels of vitamin B12 and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in a population of euthyroid adults.
Materials and methods
We carried out an analytical cross-sectional study in euthyroid adults of both sexes, who attended the outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru during the 2012–2016 period. Participants were divided into tertiles (low, intermediate and high) according to their serum vitamin B12 values. MetS was defined when three or more metabolic criteria were met by the participants. We elaborated crude and adjusted Poisson regression models to evaluate the association between the serum vitamin B12 tertiles and the presence of MetS. The reported association measure was the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
We analyzed 346 participants, the average age was 38.3 ± 10.8 (SD) years, 117 (33.8%) were males, the serum vitamin B12 median was 364.1 (IQR: 274.2–473.4) pmol/L and the prevalence of MetS was 30.1% (n = 104). In the crude Poisson regression model, we found an association between the serum vitamin B12 tertiles and the presence of MetS, with marginal significance. The association gained statistical significance in the adjusted model by potential confounders; and compared with the low serum vitamin B12 tertile, the prevalence of MetS was 36% lower (aPR = 0.64; 95%CI: 0.43–0.96) among the high tertile group.
Conclusion
Euthyroid participants with elevated levels of serum vitamin B12 showed a lower prevalence of MetS compared to those who had low levels of this marker."

Recent studies have shown that Vitamin D deficiency is very common globally. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with lipid metabolism. A relationship between vitamin D levels and waist circumference (WC) has been observed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D status and metabolic dyslipidemia and the hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 265 healthy Tehran adults. Hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype (HTGWP) was described as serum triacylglycerol concentrations >150 mg/dL and concurrent WC > 88 cm (women) and >102 cm (men). Dyslipidemia was defined as: 1) TG level of >150 mg/dL 2) HDL > 40 mg/dL for men or >50 mg/dL for women, as has been previously described.
Results
Current study’s results demonstrated that HTGWP was significantly associated with weight, age, WC, hip, fat percent, TG, lipid profile, ALT and BMI. We found 77% reduction in the chances of developing metabolic dyslipidemia in suficient satus of vitamin D in compare to deficiency, although the significancy was mariginal, OR: 0.33, 95% CI of 0.09 to 1.21, P = 0.09. However, our results revealed that vitamin D deficiency, compared with normal status, can increase the risk of phenotype 1 (high TG/high WC); OR: 3.86 and 95% CI from 0.86 to 0.99, p for trend = 0.05.
Conclusions
Significant associations were found between vitamin D status and HTGWP. In addition, there was a relationship between vitamin D and lipid profiles. There is a direct correlation between TG and waist circumference in insulin resistance in healthy Tehran adults."

Methods
Type 2 diabetes patients who fasted during Ramadan and were on three or more anti-diabetic medications were studied for two weeks using flash glucose monitoring. The patients were asked to document all episodes of hypoglycaemia and were classified as active or sedentary according to their daytime activity.
Results
The study included 16 patients of whom 10 were active and 6 were sedentary. There were 13 males and 3 females; mean age was 53.4 ± 6.4 years; mean diabetes duration was 15 ± 5.9 years, and mean HbA1C was 7.9 ± 1.3%. Over the two weeks; there were 7.9 episodes of hypoglycaemia recorded per patient; 50% of which were asymptomatic. There was no difference at baseline in age, BMI, HBA1C, diabetes duration, and anti-diabetic medications between the active and sedentary groups. The active group had better glucose control; median blood glucose was (7.1 (5.1–8.5) vs 10.6 (9.6–11.5) mmol p < 0.01), mean estimated HBA1C was (6.2 ± 1.2% vs 8.3 ± 1.0%; p = 0.047).

Ramadan fasting is associated with the risk of acute complications including hypoglycaemia. Therefore, patients' education before Ramadan and follow up during Ramadan is essential for safe fasting.
Objectives
To evaluate the effect of pre-Ramadan education program on biochemical parameters and the risk of hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Methods
A prospective interventional controlled design was carried out on 320 Muslim patients with type 2 diabetes. They were divided into 2 groups; the control group (n = 200) who received standard diabetic care and the intervention group (n = 120) who received focused individualized diabetic education sessions before Ramadan. The study was carried out on 3 phases (before, during and after Ramadan). Post-education change of hypoglycaemia risk and biochemical parameters during Ramadan fasting were the primary outcomes.
Results
Fasting blood glucose decreased significantly during, and after Ramadan in both groups (P < 0.001). Hypoglycaemia during fasting occurred in 4.1% of patients in the intervention group vs. 19.5% in the control group. Post Ramadan reduction of HbA1c < 7% increased statistically significantly in the intervention group (from 20.8% of patients before Ramadan to 55.8% after Ramadan). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased in the intervention group (P = 0.024). The body weight of the patients did not significantly change in both groups.
Conclusion
There was a significant impact of pre-Ramadan educational program on reduction of hypoglycaemic risk and other acute complications, reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and improvement of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Therefore, it is recommended for the fasting patients especially those with high and very high risk during Ramadan."

abstract = "Background
Autophagy is a process devoted to degrade and recycle cellular components inside mammalian cells through lysosomal system. It plays a main function in the pathophysiology of several diseases. In type 2 diabetes, works demonstrated the dual functions of autophagy in diabetes biology. Studies had approved the role of autophagy in promoting different routes for movement of integral membrane proteins to the plasma membrane. But its role in regulation of GLUT4 trafficking has not been widely observed. In normal conditions, insulin promotes GLUT4 translocation from intracellular membrane compartments to the plasma membrane, while in type 2 diabetes defects occur in this translocation.
Method
Intriguing evidences discussed the contribution of different intracellular compartments in autophagy membrane formation. Furthermore, autophagy serves to mobilise membranes within cells, thereby promoting cytoplasmic components reorganisation. The intent of this review is to focus on the possibility of autophagy to act as a carrier for GLUT4 through regulating GLUT4 endocytosis, intracellular trafficking in different compartments, and translocation to cell membrane.
Results
The common themes of autophagy and GLUT4 have been highlighted. The review discussed the overlapping of endocytosis mechanism and intracellular compartments, and has shown that autophagy and GLUT4 utilise similar proteins (SNAREs) which are used for exocytosis. On top of that, PI3K and AMPK also control both autophagy and GLUT4.
Conclusion
The control of GLUT4 trafficking through autophagy could be a promising field for treating type 2 diabetes."

C orrelation studies were established for both biomarkers with adiposity indices [conicity index (CI), waist circumference (WC), weight-to-height (WHtR) ratio, weight-to-hip (WHR) ratio, hip circumference (HC), and body adiposity index (BAI)], hematological indices [red cell distribution width (RDW), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet-to-lymphcyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR)] and atherogenicity indices (atherogenicity index of plasma (AIP = log10TG/HDL-C ratio), TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios].
Results
SIRT1 levels (ng/mL) were markedly lower in both MetS groups (2.12 ± 0.06 and 2.32 ± 0.19, respectively, vs. controls 4.73 ± 0.15; P < 0.05).

Aims
Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the association of the metabolic syndrome risk factors, atherogenic indices and VD in a group of patients attended at a Cardiology Center.
Methods
For this study, we invited 200 patients of both sexes attended in a Cardiology Center (Medical School of Marilia – São Paulo – Brazil). Most were female (n = 111) and aged between 41 and 70 years (from march to august, 2017).
Results
Our results showed that only 20.0% of the patients presented normal levels of VD. Patients with altered values for this vitamin presented significantly higher values for glycemia, HbA1c, Total cholesterol, LDL-c, triglycerides, Castelli Index I, Castelli Index II, Body Mass Index, waist circumference, non-HDL-c and the estimative of the size of the LDL-c particle. Vitamin D correlated negatively with glycemia, HbA1C, triglycerides, atherogenic indices, Body Mass Index, and blood pressure. Multiple Regression Model showed that for an individual to maintain metabolic parameters, at least at borderline values, the levels of VD should be 37.64 that is not in accordance with the reference values.
Conclusions
These results showed a remarkable prevalence of low concentrations of Vitamin D in patients with cardiovascular risk factors."

abstract = "Aim
To study the association of documented hypoglycemia with length of stay, 30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality, among patients with and without diabetes admitted to internal medicine units.
Methods
The electronic medical records of all patients hospitalized in internal medicine departments at E. Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel, between 1/1/2010 and 31/12/2013, were reviewed. Data extracted included all glucose measurements (performed using an institutional blood glucose monitoring system). Patients were considered hypoglycemic if at least one hypoglycemic event was recorded. Regression analysis was used to assess the association between documented hypoglycemia and length of stay, 30-day and one-year mortality. Age, sex, reason for admission, and the Charlson comorbidity index were entered as covariates, and the most conservative model was developed.
Results
The study population included 45,272 patients (mean age 68.9 ± 17.8 years, 49.4% males, 21.0% had diabetes mellitus). The rate of hypoglycemia in the total study population was 7.5% (16.8% among DM patients, 6.0% among patients without diabetes, p < 0.001). Patients with documented hypoglycemia had a longer length of hospital stay (9.3 ± 18.7 vs. 3.1 ± 6.4 days, p < 0.001), as well as higher risk for both 30-day (23.7% vs. 7.0%, p < 0.001) and 1-year mortality (41.6% vs. 15.3%, p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis showed that hypoglycemia significantly increased risk death at one year (HR 2.436, 95% CI 2.298–2.582, p < 0.001) independent of age, sex, the Charlson comorbidity index, DM status and reason for admission.
Conclusion
Documented hypoglycemia is associated with prolonged length of hospital stay and increased risk for both 30-day and 1-year mortality, regardless of diabetes mellitus status."

abstract = "Background
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease and a secreted protein which increases cholesterol levels in plasma via inducing degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) is a member of a family of cell surface proteins in many cells. CD36 is known as fatty acid translocase (FAT) because it imports fatty acids inside cells and participate in triglyceride storage. It has been suggested that PCSK9 regulates CD36 in some tissues.
Methods
Data and serum levels of TSH, FT4, lipid profile and PCSK9 and the expression of CD36 on monocytes from 40 new untreated patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) and 40 age- sex- and BMI-matched euthyroid controls were analyzed in a cross-sectional study. Then the relationships between these parameters were examined.
Results
Patients with SH had higher TSH, FT4, total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and PCSK9 levels than controls. There were significant and positive correlations between serum TSH levels and lipid parameters except HDL-C. PCSK9 had a significant and negative correlation with FT4. No significant correlation could be found in relation to PCSK9 and CD36.
Conclusions
PCSK9 inhibitors are used to reduce blood cholesterol levels as drugs. If it will be proven that PCSK9 can induce CD36 degradation, taking these drugs may have unwanted side effects. This study showed that serum PCSK9 and lipid profile levels increase in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and there is no relationship between PCSK9 and CD36 in these patients."

abstract = "Background
Diabetic foot ulcers are the leading cause of non-traumatic lower extremity amputation. The aim of this study was to establish short-term predictors of lower extremity amputation (LEA) in patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU).
Methods
A retrospective observational study was performed. Patients observed for the first time in a multidisciplinary outpatient diabetic foot clinic during 1-year were reviewed. We examined demographic and clinical data and the occurrence of LEA within 180 days. Bivariate descriptive analysis was performed and three logistic regression models were created to predict short-term LEA.
Results
During 1-year 613 patients were observed for the first time in our diabetic foot clinic. Relevant data and eligibility was available from 479 patients with DFU; 38.41%, 40,71% and 20,88% had neuropathic, neuroischemic and ischemic ulcers, respectively. Considering a follow-up of 180 days, amputation occurred in 10.02% (n = 48) of patients: 3.13% (n = 15) major amputation and 6.89% (n = 33) minor amputation. Independent predictors of short-term LEA included moderate to severe infection [OR 5.23 (IC 95% 2.51–10.80; p < 0.001)], previous history of LEA [OR 3.93 (IC 95% 1.81–8.53; p = 0.001)], peripheral arterial disease [OR 3.51 (IC 95% 1.29–9.58; p = 0.014)] and presence of any walking disability [OR 3.35 (IC 95% 1.58–7.13; p = 0.002)].
Conclusion
In DFU patients the risk of LEA at 180 days is associated to moderate to severe infection at the initial presentation, previous history of LEA, peripheral arterial disease and presence of any walking disability. To prevent future amputations these patients should be identified early and managed by a multidisciplinary team. Level of Clinical Evidence: Level 2."

Hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, accounting for the highest morbidity and mortality among the elderly Jordanian population. This study aimed to evaluate serum lipid and glucose profiles of hypertensive patients and normotensive controls, and determine the risk factors for HTN among elderly population in Jordan.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was carried out among 200 participants, including 111 hypertensive patients and 89 normotensive controls from June to October 2017 in North Jordan. Data were collected on sociodemographic factors, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and lipid profile including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and fasting blood sugar (FBS).
Results
Serum levels of TC, TG, LDL and FBS were higher while HDL levels were lower in hypertensive subjects compared to normotensives (p < 0.01). There were no differences between hypertensive and normotensives patients regarding their age, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and body mass index (BMI). Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were significantly correlated only in normotensive group. Significant associations between blood pressure and biochemical parameters were seen only in the HTN group. Overweight/obesity, abdominal obesity (WHtR), hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL were found as the risk factors for HTN.
Conclusion
from our results, future strategies for preventing dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and, consequently, HTN through modification of risk factors such as lifestyle changes and medical management. It's recommended for patients with HTN to measure the BP, lipid and glucose profiles regularly throughout their primary health care to prevent non-communicable diseases."

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of vision loss in the working age population. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), are molecules involved in extracellular tissue matrix remodelling. They are implicated in the loss of retinal tissue integrity, a major cause of DR, that leads to retinal tissue degradation and apoptosis. This study is therefore, conducted to compare the serum levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in T2DM patients without and with retinopathy, and to evaluate their association with the severity of DR.
Materials and methods
Our study comprised of 2 groups of 41 each. Group A (cases) included T2DM patients with retinopathy and Group B (controls) included T2DM patients without retinopathy. Routine parameters, mainly, fasting blood glucose, and lipid profile were measured using autoanalyzer. Serum MMP-9, TIMP-1, and insulin levels were assessed using ELISA method.
Results and conclusion
Statistically significant increase in the levels of MMP-9, insulin, fasting blood glucose and lipid profile were observed in the serum of T2DM patients with retinopathy, as compared with those without retinopathy. These results help to conclude that rise in MMP-9, and associated serum markers promote disease progress in DR. These findings suggest that the elevations of our study markers in the serum of the type 2 diabetic patients with retinopathy, as compared to those without retinopathy, play important roles in aggravating tissue matrix degradation, supporting DR disease progression."

Hypoglycemia can be considered the most common complication of Diabetes Mellitus treatment. So far, controversial studies have been carried out to examine the impacts of hypoglycemia on the cognitive function.
Methods
This study was conducted as case-control. The case group was 35 patients with Diabetes Mellitus Types I or II hospitalized in Imam Hussein Hospital, Tehran, Iran, who have experienced hypoglycemic attacks (glucose level below 70 mg/dl). The control group consisted of diabetic patients hospitalized in hospital, but they had no history of hypoglycemia. As the blood glucose level became in normal range and the patients’ Mental status became stable, the brain cognitive function was examined using Mini-Mental State test.
Results
The mean age of the subjects in the case and control groups was 56.77, 53.73 years old, respectively. The mean cognitive score in the control and hypoglycemic groups was 29.09 and 25.29, respectively. The mean MMSE cognitive score was significantly diminished in the hypoglycemic group (p < 0.001).

Xultophy is the first fixed co-formulation pen containing insulin degludec and the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue liraglutide, authorized for type 2 diabetes patients since 2014. The aim was to review the clinical effectiveness of Xultophy across two hospitals in Wales.
Methods
Retrospective review of patients commenced on Xultophy between April 2016 and January 2018 was taken. Data related to glycemic control, weight and medication use were collected.
Results
Ninety-one patients were initiated on Xultophy, and 60 patients had follow-up for at least 6 months with a mean age of 57.3 years (47% male). Xultophy was well-tolerated, however, abdominal cramps and nausea limited use in three patients. Baseline HbA1c and weight were 84.7 mmol/mol and 101.5 kg. There were significant HbA1c reductions of 9.9 mmol/mol (p < 0.0001) and 13.4 mmol/mol (p < 0.008) at 6 and 12 months, and non-significant changes in weight. Patients with an HbA1c over 84 mmol/mol showed the greatest HbA1c improvement over 6-months. Those prescribed insulin prior to Xultophy had less significant improvements in HbA1c than those previously prescribed GLP-1 analogues.
Conclusions
There were significant reductions in HbA1c and statistically insignificant weight gain over 12 months. Switching from GLP-1 analogues to Xultophy was associated with a greater HbA1c reduction compared to switching from insulin."

Women are at risk of developing metabolic syndrome as they enter the postmenopausal period. The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in Iranian postmenopausal women. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, 16 national articles published in Persian and English were gathered without time limit. National databases such as SIDs, IranMedex and MagIran, and international databases such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus were used to search the relevant studies. We searched for articles using the keywords “menopause”, “postmenopausal”, “metabolic syndrome”, “MetSyn”, and their combinations. Data were analyzed using the meta-analysis method and the random effects model. Analysis of 16 selected articles with a sample size of 5893 people showed that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in Iranian postmenopausal women was 51.6% (95% CI: 43–60). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome based on ATP III and IDF criteria was 54% (95% CI: 59–63) and 50% (95% CI: 45–56), respectively. Based on the results of univariate meta-regression analysis, the increase in the mean age of postmenopausal women (p = 0.001) and sample size (p = 0.029), the prevalence of metabolic syndrome increased significantly. More than half of postmenopausal women in Iran suffer from metabolic syndrome. Providing training programs for postmenopausal women to prevent and control cardiovascular disease and its complications seems to be necessary."

Several abdominal obesity measures have been used for prediction of 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk but the superiority of these measures remains controversial. The objective of this study was to assess the predictive ability of abdominal obesity measures for risk of CVD events in an Iranian adult population.
Methods
We analyzed the data of population based cross-section study of 567 representative samples of adult population aged 40–70 years in Babol, the north of Iran. The demographic data, the anthropometric measures, lipid profile and cardiometabolic risk factors were measured with standard methods. Waist to hip ratio (WHR), waist to height ratio (WHtR), conicity index(CI), abdominal volume index (AVI) and body mass index(BMI)were calculated. The individual 10-year CVD risk was estimated based on ACC/AHA model. ROC analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic ability of different abdominal obesity measures and body mass index (BMI) in predicting of high risk of CVD events.
Results
About 42.5% of men and 15% of women had at least 10% risk of 10-year cardiovascular events and 21.1% of men and 3.0% of women had ≥20% risk. Except WHR for men, all abdominal obesity measures significant predictors for ≥10% risk CVD risk in both sexes but not BMI. The greater ability of CVD risk prediction was observed by WHtR and CI in both sexes with higher AUC in females compared with men for ≥10% risk.
Conclusion
WHtR and CI are superior indexes in predicting of high risk of CVD events in both sexes."

Hyperglycemia is the driving force for the development of diabetic nephropathy leading to the end stage renal disease. It is well known that in hyperglycaemic condition, serum proteins become glycated through non-enzymatic glycation. With the other risk factors, serum fructosamine may be an important risk factor for kidney impairment. To assess coexistence of frequently documented risk factors of kidney dysfunction with serum fructosamine in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Methods
In this study, total 150 individuals, as control, type2 diabetic patients without complication and with CKD were included. Blood samples were collected from all the samples to estimate blood glucose, HbA1c, serum creatinine, fructosamine levels and lipid profile. Statistical analysis i.e. regression and correlation between serum fructosamine and other documented risk factors for diabetic CKD has been done. P < 0.001 was considered significant.
Results
Serum fructosamine, HbA1c, creatinine levels, cholesterol and LDL were increased significantly (P < 0.001) in diabetic patients with CKD compared to without complications. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and BMI were also significantly higher in diabetic patients compared to control. Serum creatinine, total cholesterol and LDL showed a significant positive correlation but HDL showed a negative correlation with fructosamine in CKD diabetic patients. No significant correlation was found with any risk factors in diabetic patients without complications expect HbA1c.
Conclusion
It is concluded that elevated serum fructosamine level is strongly associated with kidney dysfunction in diabetic patients. As there is a significant link between serum fructosamine and other risk factors for CKD diabetic patients."

To determine whether hs-CRP level and interval change of hs-CRP could predict the development of metabolic abnormalities in healthy subjects in a longitudinal study.
Methods
A cohort of 3748 male who had normal hs-CRP level without evidence of any component of metabolic syndrome were studied. At each visit, hs-CRP level and metabolic abnormalities were measured. Interval change of hs-CRP for each subject was calculated. COX proportional hazard model and logistic regression analysis were used.
Results
Cumulative incidence and incidence density of metabolic syndrome were 3.96% and 7.17 per 1000 person-year, respectively. Cumulative incidence of metabolic syndrome was significantly increased according to hs-CRP tertile level. This significance remained after adjusting age, smoking, drinking, and exercise. Although the hazard ratio of metabolic syndrome for incidence density was increased significantly as hs-CRP increased, such trend disappeared after adjusting for confounding variables. The risk of metabolic syndrome was significantly higher (1.48 times) in the hs-CRP increased group than that in the decreased or unchanged group. This significance remained after controlling for covariates.
Conclusion
Relatively higher hs-CRP level within normal range may predict the increase of metabolic syndrome compared to lower hs-CRP. Increased hs-CRP level may increase the incidence of metabolic syndrome."

abstract = "Backgrounds
Iron deficiency has been studied extensively in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis therapy. However, few studies looked at iron treatment in the non-dialysis chronic kidney disease population.
Methods
Five hundred and eighty patients were studied (247 were diabetic persons). Patients were divided into 4 groups: non-diabetic subjects without CKD, non-diabetic ones with GFR < 60 mL/min, diabetic persons without CKD and diabetic ones with GFR < 60 mL/min). Iron deficiency was diagnosed when serum ferritin level was <100 mg/dl. It was defined as diminished iron availability when ferritin was above 100 mg/dl and serum transferrin saturation (TSAT) was <20%.
Results
Anemia was more frequent in the diabetic CKD patients group (52.4%, p < 0.001). Anemia prevalence was also higher in all CKD patients as well as in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic ones. Iron deficiency was more frequent in diabetic patients. Among CKD diabetic patients the prevalence of iron deficiency was higher than in non-diabetic CKD ones. Diminished iron availability prevalence was higher in non-diabetic patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that only sex and diabetes mellitus were independently associated with iron deficiency.
Conclusions
Anemia was more common in diabetic CKD patients. Diabetes mellitus was independently associated with iron deficiency. Surprisingly, diminished iron availability was not more frequent in diabetic patients. The physio-pathological mechanisms that could explain these findings remain to be elucidated."

These two pathologies form a subset associated with metabolic derangement, popularly termed as metabolic syndrome. Earlier its status and the pathophysiological rationale were largely obscure and hence it was given a rather disguised name – Syndrome X, as an icon of unknown. While initially contemplated to be an endocrine problem associated with insulin resistance, the scientific insight about this pathology has undergone a gradual evolution. Therefore the pathogenic and consequent diagnostic modality consistently changed. Quite fascinatingly its phenomenal conversion from an endocrine etiopathology to an inflammatory pathogenesis has imprinted a paradigm shift.

Besides its role in calcium homeostasis, vitamin D (VD) has an important immuno-mudulation effect. However, its role in autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes is under discussion. This study designed to investigate serum VD status in children and adolescents with and without diabetes.
Materials and methods
In a case-control study, 85 diabetic and 85 non-diabetic control (total 170) aged 1–15 yr. were enrolled. History of breast feeding and vitamin supplementation was obtained; growth indices and serum levels of Calcium, phosphorous, Alkaline-Phosphatase (ALP), Hemoglobin-A1c and VD were measured and analyzed.
Results
The mean values for VD in case and control groups were 12.80 ± 10.59 and 15.85 ± 9.92 nmol/L, respectively (p = 0.057). Serum VD status in these two groups was sufficient in 5.88% and 9.41%, insufficient in 18% and 14%, and deficient in 75.29% and 76.74%, respectively. Compared to the controls, diabetics had more history of breast-feeding (62.35% vs. 42.35%; p = 0.017) and higher serum ALP levels (772.34 ± 309.89 vs. 657.99 ± 395.11 U/L; p = 0.032).
Conclusion
More frequency of breast-feeding, higher serum ALP and mildly lower serum level of VD in diabetics suggests a significant difference in VD status in diabetics compared to the healthy peers indicating a potential role of this deficiency in the disease process."

We measured fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure among 2287 industrial workers (mean age 46 years, men 70%) from selected industries of two southern most Kerala districts using standard protocol in 2009. MS was defined according to international diabetes federation (IDF), Adult Treatment Panel (ATP-III) and American Heart Association(AHA)/National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) criteria (Harmonization). Age-standardized prevalence of MS was assessed for men and women. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to find the associated factors of MS.
Results
Age-standardized prevalence of MS was 14% (men 14%, women 15%), 19% (men 19%, women 21%) and 27% (men 30%, women 21%) as per IDF, ATP-III and Harmonization criteria respectively. Overweight adults were nine times (OR 9.41, 95% CI 7.34–12.06), twelve times (OR 11.80 CI 9.38–14.84), and four times (OR 3.56, CI 2.94–4.29) more likely to have MS compared to their counterparts according to IDF, ATP-III and Harmonization criteria respectively. Older adults and current alcohol users were more likely to have MS compared to their counterparts. Women were more likely to have MS as per IDF and ATP-III criteria.
Conclusions
MS prevalence was high among Industrial workers who generally have good access to health care. Overweight and other predictors of MS need to be addressed to reduce MS prevalence in this population."

Evidence from epidemiological studies suggests an important association between gout and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, to the best of our knowledge, prevalence of metabolic syndrome in gout has not been reported in sub-Saharan African (SSA) settings.
Objectives
The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of MetS in gout in a SSA population.
Method
After prior ethical clearance, we carried out a cross-sectional study involving gout patients in a referral hospital in Douala-Cameroon. Metabolic syndrome was defined using International Diabetes Foundation criteria. Associations between variables were assessed using logistic regression.p <  0.05 was considered significant.
Results
On 174 gout patients (48.3% females) who consented to participate in the study, the median (IQR) age was 55.00 (14.25) years, and the median (IQR) duration of gout was 7.5 (10.0) years. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 54.6% (95% CI: 47.9%–62.8%). One hundred and forty-seven (84.5%) participants had central obesity, 62 (35.6%) raised triglycerides, 79 (45.4%) reduced HDL-C, 129 (74.1%) raised blood pressure, and 85 (48.9%) had raised fasting plasma glucose. On logistic regression analyses, gout patients with metabolic syndrome significantly had a higher body mass index (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02–1.17), and higher levels of serum uric acid (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04).
Conclusions
About 1 out of every 2 gout patients in this population have metabolic syndrome. These gout patients with metabolic syndrome significantly have a higher body mass index, and higher levels of serum uric acid. Cohort studies are required to clearly establish the direction of the relationship between gout and metabolic syndrome."

Fifty-five subjects were obtained with an average age of 54 years, 29 with good glycemic control and 26 with poor glycemic control. All glycemic parameters were worse in poor compared to good glycemic control group (p < 0.05). Similar averages of urea, creatinine, uric acid, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and a lower average of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were found between both groups with statistically non-significant differences (p > 0.05). Main comorbidities were dyslipidemia, hypertension, and nephropathy. Fatty liver disease, urinary tract infection and neuropathy was also reported. Most patients were prescribed with oral anti-diabetics.
Conclusion
Diabetic patients regardless of glycemic control according to current guidelines have a greater average lipid and kidney profile than the optimum target. Therefore both are equally at greater risk for cardiovascular diseases, nephropathy, and other diabetic complications. Greater patient monitoring of these parameters is recommended to lower the risk of comorbidities and complications."

In Malaysia, 61% of dialysis cases are secondary to diabetes. To date, we are still lacking of data on the rate of progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in Malaysia.
Materials and methods
This was a retrospective study conducted at nephrology unit of a tertiary hospital in Kedah. All diabetic ESRD patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were identified and recruited for analysis.
Results
The mean duration of DM to ESRD was found to be 14.37 ± 4.42 years. Mean duration for the onset of diabetic nephropathy was 8.73 ± 3.37 years. There was a relative short duration from diabetic nephropathy to ESRD noted, which was 5.63 ± 2.06 years. The mean duration of DM to ESRD for patients receiving RAAS blocker was found to be 18.23 ± 2.38 years as compared to 11.41 ± 2.94 years for those who did not (95% CI: -0.64 to -2.46). For different type of RAAS blockers, namely ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), there was no significant difference observed pertaining to mean duration of DM to ESRD; 17.89 ± 1.97 years for ACEi and 19.00 ± 4.16 years for ARB (95% CI: -4.74 to 2.52).
Discussion
Time frame from diabetic nephropathy to ESRF among Malaysian population was shorter as compared to findings from other countries with an average period of 15 to 25 years. RAAS blockers should be initiated early in diabetic patients."

abstract = "Aim
To investigate the influence of glycemic variability (GV) on length of stay and in-hospital mortality in non-critical diabetic patients.
Methods
A observation retrospective study was performed. Diabetic patients admitted between January and June 2016 with the diagnosis of community-acquire pneumonia (CAP) and/or acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were enrolled and glycemic control (persistent hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, mean glucose level (MGL) and respective standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV)) were evaluated. Primary outcomes were length of stay and in-hospital mortality.
Results
Data from 242 patients were analyzed. Fifty-eight percent of the patients were male, with a median age of 77 years (min-max, 29–98). Patients had on average 2.1 glucose readings-day and the MGL was 193.3 mg/dl (min-max, 84.3–436.6). Hypoglycemia was documented in 13.4% of the patients and 55.4% had persistent hyperglycemia. The median length of hospital stay was 10 days (min-max, 1–66) and in-hospital mortality was 7.4%. We found a significant higher in-hospital mortality in older patients, with history of cancer and with nosocomial infections. We did not find any correlation between MGL, SD, CV, hypoglycemia or persist hyperglycemia and in-hospital mortality. A longer length of stay was observed in patients with heavy alcohol consumption and nosocomial infections. The length of stay was negatively correlated with the mean glucose level (r2-0.147; p < 0.05) and positively correlated with the coefficient of variation (p 0.162; p < 0.05).
Conclusion
This study confirmed the negative impact of the glycemic variability in the outcomes of diabetic patients admitted with CAP or acute exacerbation of COPD."

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is an adipokine with greater expression in visceral fat and related with insulin resistance (IR). Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is also associated with IR. Our study aims to evaluate DPP4 activity in PCOS.
Materials and Methods
Thirty PCOS patients were compared to 28 healthy women. Body composition by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), plasma activity of DPP4 and biochemical variables were performed. All participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test for insulin and glucose analysis.
Results
DPP4 activity was similar in both groups (PCOS 5823 ± 926 vs Control 5501.8 ± 975; p = 0.20). PCOS patients were more IR with lower levels of SHBG (32 vs 47, p = 0.02) and Matsuda index (15.6 vs 20.4, p = 0.03) and higher HOMA-IR (2.8 vs 1.7, p < 0.01), in addition to increased levels of testosterone (55 vs 25, p < 0.01).

Prehypertension in people with type 2 diabetes is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and lower extremity damages compared to people with normal blood pressure. On the other hand, limited studies have conducted to investigate the effect of DASH diet on blood pressure and prehypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of DASH diet on blood pressure and prehypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Materials and methods
In this clinical trial, 80 patients with diabetes type 2 and prehypertension in the age range of 18–65 years were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 40) and control (n = 40) groups for 12 weeks. The intervention group had DASH diet and the control group received diabetic diet in accordance with the recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) with 24-h dietary recall; systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured before and after study.
Results
Taking DASH diet and diabetic diet for 12 weeks caused significant reduction in systolic blood pressure in the intervention group (P value = 0.003). Diastolic blood pressure showed no significant change in none of the two groups.
Conclusion
Following the DASH diet in patients with prehypertension has beneficial effects in improving systolic blood pressure and can be effective to prevent the development of hypertension. Hence, there are needs for long-term interventions with larger sample size in future studies."

Methods
661 patients 336 females (228 menopausal and 108 premenopausal) and 325 males (237 age> 50 years and 88 age < 50 years) were recruited. HbA1c, ferritin, fasting plasma glucose, hemogram and medical history were recorded. Analysis of variance ANOVA and Pearson’s regression were applied.
Results
patients were divided according gender, age, glycemia and iron status (normal, latent iron deficiency LID, iron deficiency anemia IDA).All groups presented increasing HbA1c values in parallel with iron deficiency, subclinical and anemia, but the level of significance was not homogeneous in the different groups. Controlled premenopausal women HbA1c in normal iron status and IDA groups P = 0.0048, between normal and LID, P = 0.033.

Various studies have demonstrated that the majority of the factors affecting the reluctance of individuals to insulin injections are rooted in psychological factors. Present study aimed to determine relationships between main causes of refusal to insulin injection in diabetic patients and factors such as age, gender, and educational degree of patients.
Material & Methods
This was a descriptive study which was conducted on diabetic patients (n = 505) who need insulin therapy. The data were collected with a questionnaire in following steps. First, the most important causes of patients’ reluctance, in the patients’ opinion, to insulin therapy were determined using the data of the previous studies. In the second step, the patients were asked to express their opinion on each of these factors and the recorded responses were analyzed.
Results
The results of the study showed that fear of ampoules, fear of pain caused by insulin and the embarrassment of patients from injections in public significantly depended on the gender of the patients, so that these factors were much lower in men than women. In addition, these factors in the patients with higher degrees of education led to lower level of refusal to insulin injections. Another factor influencing the reluctance to insulin injections was the forming of a sense of addiction due to daily insulin injections, which was significantly lower among the patients with higher education, but did not have a significant relationship with sex of the patients. In this regard, another factor was fear of hypoglycemia and insulin side effects, which did not have a significant relationship with gender and educational degree. In addition, there was no significant relationship between the patient's age and any of the factors effective in patients' reluctance to insulin injections.
Conclusion
Psychological factors seem to be effective in the emergence of the sense of reluctance to insulin injections. Therefore, not only patients but also the entire society need to receive training and appropriate services to improve their attitude to this issue with a psychological approach and help to solve this problem."

History of gestational diabetes in past pregnancy OR = 3.2[95%CI:1.1, 9.7], a family history of gestational diabetes OR = 3.7 [95%CI:1.1, 11.5], a history of hookah smoking OR = 3.6 [95%CI:1.06, 12.3], being obese before pregnancy OR = 1.9[95%CI:1.01, 3.5], and weight gain during pregnancy OR = 0.5[95%CI:0.2, 0.9], were the most important determinants of gestational diabetes. There were not significant relation between GDM and underlying diseases, history of stillbirth, abortion, twinning, cigarette smoking, alcohol and drug abuse.
Conclusions
In this research modifiable risk factors for gestational diabetes were high BMI before pregnancy, weight gain during pregnancy and history of hookah consumption. We advise that appropriate education, avoiding sedentary lifestyle, diet improvement and advertising which focus on tobacco consumption is playing as an important role in developing the chronic diseases, including GDM."

Smoking cigarettes and diabetes are major public health problems in Sudan. Smoking is associated with insulin resistance and can be associated with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of smoking in individuals with diabetes and associated complications.
Methodology
a descriptive analytical cross-sectional study, included 315 of participants with diabetes. The data collection was performed to gather demographic information, prevalence of smoking and presence of complications. In addition to measurement of blood pressure, weight and height measurement for calculation of body mass index and biochemical tests. Statistical association at p.value of 0.05 was measured using T-test for quantitative data and Chi square test for categorical data.
Results
The overall prevalence of smoking was found to be 33.9%. Smoking was statistically significant associated with being male; increase in age; and being married. HbA1c and triglycerides are significantly associated with smoking (P value = 0.01 and 0.05 respectively); therefore, statistical significance was found with ischemic heart disease(IHD) as well (P value = 0.05). Hypertension, duration of diabetes, low density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol and body mass index (BMI) were not statistically significant with smoking.
Conclusion
Almost third of the population with diabetes are smokers (33.9%). Smoking is statistically associated with IHD, high triglyceride and HbA1c. Therefore, smoking cessation schemes should be advocated by health authorities and the public in Sudan."

abstract = "Background
Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of end stage renal disease worldwide. Early identification of diabetic nephropathy even before appearance of microalbuminuria is a challenge for early prevention of occurrence and progression of this complication. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin is a small protein that belongs to the lipocalin protein. Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin is a promising early marker in different renal problems.
Aim of the work
To measure urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in type 2 diabetic patients and to assess its role as an early marker for diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy.
Patient and methods
The current study included 60 subjects with type 2 diabetes and 20 healthy control subjects. Diabetic subjects were divided into 3 groups according to urinary albumin creatinine ratio; 20 normoalbuminuric patients, 20 micro-albuminuric patients and 20 macroalbuminuric patients. They were subjected to history taking, full clinical examination, fundus examination, anthropometric measurement, urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and urinary albumin creatinine ratio.
Results
Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was higher in all diabetic groups than in the control group, with no difference in between diabetic groups. The difference was of great value when comparing normoalbuminuric group with control as albumin creatinine ratio was not different while the urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was statistically significant (5.94 ± 1.85 ng/dl vs 1.96 ± 0.65, p < 0.001). No correlation was found with retinopathy.
Conclusion
Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin is a sensitive marker for early detection of diabetic nephropathy even in normoalbuminuric patients denoting early tubular damage before microalbuminuria. It is not correlated with retinopathy."

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the influence of antioxidant vitamins on the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic therapy in type 2 diabetic patients (T2DM). This single-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin C and/or E supplementation on the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic therapy in T2DM Palestinian male patients from the Gaza Strip.
Methods
Forty T2DM male patients aged 40–60 years on metformin treatment were randomly divided into four groups, each group received an additional one of the following daily oral supplements for 90 days: placebo; vitamin C; vitamin E and vitamin C plus vitamin E. After overnight fasting, venous blood specimens were collected from all individuals into K3-EDTA tubes and serum tubes for measuring the biochemical and hematological parameters of the study at baseline and after 90 days of vitamins supplementation.
Results
The results revealed that vitamin C and/or E improve fasting blood sugar (FBS), HbA1c, lipid profile, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), reduced glutathione (GSH); and Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QISCI) compared with diabetic patients group that received placebo.
Conclusion
This study provided additional evidence on the beneficial effects of supplementing antioxidant vitamins in T2DM which could improve the clinical condition and attenuate or prevent diabetic pathogenesis and complications that, secondly to poor glycemic control, could attribute to the imbalance between the decline in the endogenous antioxidants and increasing production of the reactive oxygen species leading to the oxidant-mediated damage present in the diabetic context."

Expeditious and precise discerning of bacterial pathogens is a fundamental grail, of clinical diagnostic microbiology. Genotypic detection is a budding substitute to recognize phenotypic culture based processes in bacterial identification.
Aims
We report a comparative evaluation of biochemical and genomic-based assays for exploring the commonest bacterial flora of infected diabetic foot ulcers along with clinical variables of subjects enrolled.
Methods
The pathogens selected (i) Staphylococcus aureus ii) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, iii) Escherichia coli and iv) Klebsiella pneumonia, stood for the most frequent isolates of diabetic foot infection in previous studies from Northern India. Identification of these pathogens were done by conventional assays and polymerase chain reaction.
Results
Of 50 specimens obtained from infected DFUs, 74% of cases were affirmative by bacteriological assays and 90% showed positivity via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among processed samples 44 isolates were detectable through phenotypic analysis and 65 bacteria by species-specific PCR. Thirteen samples and 21 isolates could not be scrutinized by phenotypic identification systems. The most prevalent pathogens identifiable were Klebsiella pneumonia, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.
Conclusions
We have shown that PCR-based diagnostic methods improved the identification compared to conventional methods and highlight the incorporation of PCR due to shorten turnaround time translating into improved clinical outcomes."

This study compared the ability of anthropometric parameters to predict Metabolic Syndrome (MetS).
Methods
Eleven anthropometric parameters: waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), a body shape index (ABSI), body roundness index (BRI), visceral adiposity index (VAI), abdominal volume index (AVI), Conicity Index (CI), body adiposity index (BAI), lipid accumulation product (LAP) and waist circumference-triglyceride index (WTI) were measured and calculated in apparently healthy subjects with and without MetS. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to assess their ability to predict MetS.
Results
Of the 535 subjects recruited 23% had MetS. WC had the largest area under the curve (AUC) in both men (0.814 95% CI 0.721–0.907) and women (0.819 95%CI 0.771–0.867). This did not differ from the AUC of BMI, WHtR, BRI, CI, BAI, LAP in men and BMI, WHtR, BAI, LAP, VAI and WTI in women (P > 0.05). The cutoff point for WC was 89.5 cm and 91.8 cm in men and women respectively. The AUC of WC was the largest in the 40–49 and 60 years and above age groups while the AUC of LAP was the largest for age groups 30–39 and 50–59 years.
Conclusion
Of the 11 anthropometric parameters assessed, the WC was the best at predicting MetS in both men and women. There is need to ascertain the cutoff point and establish landmark for measuring WC especially for the sub Saharan region."

In a cross-sectional case control study, 520 pregnant women involving life after gestational diabetes Ahvaz cohort study (LAGAs) were investigated for risk factors of gestational diabetes mellitus.
Result
The prevalence of overweight and obesity were 40% and25.8% in the GMD group and in 35.8% and 16.2% in the control group respectively (p = 0.002). According to NCEP-ATP III criteria, 16.9% of women with GDM and 6.9% of mothers in the control group had metabolic syndrome in first visit of pregnancy (p < 0.001. Logistic regression showed that there is a significant relationship between maternal age[OR = 1.05(95% CI, 1.01–1.10)] (p = 0.01), previous GDM [OR = 5.60(95% CI, 2.21–14.18)] (p = 0.001), positive family history of diabetes[OR = 1.86(95% CI, 1.19–2.94)] (p = 0.006), pre-pregnancy BMI [OR = 1.05(95% CI, 1.007–1.11)] (p = 0.04) and metabolic syndrome in first visit of pregnancy[OR = 2.34 (95% CI, 1.038–5.30)] (p = 0.04) with GDM.
Conclusion
Factors including maternal age, previous GDM, family history of diabetes, pre-pregnancy BMI reported in previous studies around the world. A significant association between metabolic syndrome in the first visit of pregnancy and GDM is novel finding of this study. Therefore screening of pre-pregnancy metabolic syndrome in women at risk of gestational diabetes is recommended."

Those with MetS had higher apoB (1.27 V s 1.19 mmol/L; p = 0.001), apoB/AI (0.80 V s 0.75; p = 0.001), non-HDL cholesterol (NHDLC) (4.15 V s 3.98 mmol/L; p = 0.002),and triglycerides (1.51 V s 1.31 mmol/L; p < 0.001) and lower apoAI (1.58 V s 1.60 mmol/L; p = 0.03) and HDLC (1.02 V s 1.16 mmol/L, p < 0.001). ApoB and apoB/AIlevels increased significantly as the number of MetS components increased. ApoB and apoB:AI ratio were independently associated with MetS and components.
Conclusion
MetS showed a high prevalence among young Sri Lankans with diabetes. Elevated apoB is commonly clustered with other risk indicators in MetS."

To compare the clinical and glycemic profile as well as pregnancy complications and infant mortality among diabetic mothers in Indonesia.
Materials and Methods
Data was obtained from medical records of Internal-Medicine Clinic in Hermina Podomoro General Hospital during the period January-December 2015. Subjects were grouped into good and poor outcome groups based on infant mortality.
Results
Forty-five subjects were obtained with an average age of 31 years, 41 had gestational diabetes mellitus while 4 had pregestational diabetes. Twenty-one patients had high-risk pregnancies (age >30 years or <20 years). No maternal mortalities were reported, only 6 pregnancies were complicated with infant death. Comorbidities mainly found were preeclampsia, anemia and urinary tract infection. Most patients delivered through caesarian section. Almost all of them were treated with insulin. Comparison between both groups showed that those with poor outcomes have a significantly higher body mass index prior to pregnancy, higher body weight prior and after pregnancy as well as worse glycemic profile.
Conclusion
Diabetes in pregnancy has been found to increase rates of infant mortality. This study showed that patients with poor glycemic control are at a greater risk of infant mortality. Therefore increased monitoring and prenatal care as well as optimal glycemic control for patients with diabetes in pregnancy is recommended. Optimal glycemic control will lead to diabetic mothers with pregnancies of equal risk and similar outcomes to those of normal patients."

abstract = "Background
Metabolic syndrome (MS) is considered one of the major worldwide epidemics. It accounts for billions of cardiovascular disease events and deaths. Till now, major basics of MS are not fully clarified. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-α (PPARα) displays a ligand-activated transcription factor. It is involved in the regulation of many metabolic processes including inflammation, lipid, and glucose metabolism. Therefore, this study investigated the leucocytic expression of PPARα in a metabolic patient in comparison to healthy controls.
Methods
100 subjects with MS were recruited, in addition to 100 subjects without any obvious metabolic disorders as healthy controls. Expression of PPARα and CD 36 were analyzed on different leucocytic populations using optimized flow-cytometric analysis. Correlations of the expression of both indexes with different clinical and laboratory parameters were analyzed.
Results
The eosinophilic expression of PPARα was found to be lower in subjects with MS in comparison to the healthy controls (p value 0.001). Also, PPARα expression, on most of the leucocytic populations, was inversely correlated with waist circumferences among the study populations.
Conclusion
Circulated eosinophilic expression of PPARα protein is reduced in MS subjects. This conclusion may explain the endothelial dysfunction and obesity associated with MS, as well as it may help in the management of this worldwide health problem."

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is a new adipokine increased in central obesity and related to insulin resistance (IR). Postmenopausal (PM) state may be associated with increase in body weight and central fat distribution. We hypothesize that DPP4 is increased in PM women.
Materials and methods
Twenty-two non-obese PM and 22 non-obese premenopausal women (PreM), were evaluated. DPP4 activity, lipid profile, HbA1c, FSH, estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured; an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and IR calculated. Body composition was assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Correlations between DPP4 and the anthropometric and metabolic variables and body fat distribution were studied.
Results
DPP4 activity was not different between the two groups (PM 5309 ± 650 vs PreM 5387 ± 704 RLU; p = 0,70). In the PM group there was a significant correlation between DPP4 and body weight (r = 0,498; p = 0,03; n = 22) and trunk fat (r = 0,477; p = 0,03; n = 21).

Obesity represents one of the common medical disorders that carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Insertion of intragastric balloon is one of the recently introduced lines of treatment of obesity. It allows patients to sense abdominal fullness and reduce their food intake. However, gastric ulceration may be a serious adverse effect that may be associated with intragastric balloon insertion.
Aim
To assess the role of silent helicobacter pylori infection in intragastric balloon-induced ulcers and to explore the possible methods for amelioration of this effect.
Methods
Thirty patients were divided into 2 equal groups; one of them received triple therapy for helicobacter pylori eradication and the other group received placebo treatment. Then, they underwent intragastric balloon insertion. After removal of the balloon, gastroscopy was performed to evaluate the gastric mucosal lesions, if present.
Results
There was significant decrease in the incidence of gastric erosions and ulcerations in the group that received triple therapy for helicobacter pylori eradication compared to the group that received placebo treatment.
Conclusion
Eradication of silent helicobacter pylori infection may represent a promising hope to decrease the incidence and improve symptoms of gastric erosions and ulceration that may be associated with intragastric balloon insertion."

Rhabdomyolysis is considered by some studies as a rare complication of a common disorder of diabetic ketoacidosis, while others consider it as not so uncommon. The mechanism is still not clear but can be attributed to a number of factors like acidosis, hyperglycemia and electrolyte disturbances especially hypophosphatemia and hypokalaemia. Missing it may lead to more serious complications and may prolong and/or complicate full recovery of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Aim
The aim of this study was to measure the incidence of rhabdomyolysis among patients presented with diabetic ketoacidosis in the emergency department of Baghdad Teaching hospital, its relation to the severity of diabetic ketoacidosis and the associated electrolytes disturbances.
Patients and methods
This is a cross sectional study carried out in the emergency department of Baghdad teaching hospital/Iraq; where 43 patients with type1 diabetes presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis were included. Diabetic ketoacidosis was classified into mild, moderate and severe, and the incidence of rhabdomyolysis was calculated accordingly. Full blood investigations, urinary ketones and arterial blood gasses were done.
Results
Rhabdomyolysis was found in 3 (6.98%) patients with more severe acidosis and urinary ketones in the setting of moderate and severe diabetic ketoacidosis. Statistically significant finding was observed with the duration of diabetes, higher serum creatinine, higher serum potassium, higher serum chloride, severe acidosis and urinary ketones.
Conclusions
Rhabdomyolysis incidence in this study was 6.98% of patients with more severe acidosis, urinary ketones in the setting of moderate to severe diabetic ketoacidosis and with longer duration of diabetes."

abstract = "Introduction
Dementia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two of the epidemics of our time; in which insulin resistance (IR) is playing the central role. Epidemiological studies found that different types of dementia development may be promoted by the presence of T2DM.
Objectives
We aimed in this review to highlight the role of insulin and the IR in the brain as a pathophysiological factor of dementia development and also to expand our understanding of T2DM as a mediator of IR in the brain and to review the possible mechanisms of action that may explain the association.
Methodology
A critical review of the relevant published English articles up to 2018, using PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, ADI, and WHO database was carried out. Keywords were included insulin resistance, T3DM, T2DM, dementia, brain insulin resistance were used.
Conclusion
The rapidly increased prevalence of dementia concurrently with T2DM and obesity need urgent action to illustrate guidelines for prevention, modifying, and treatment based on mechanistic studies."

abstract = "Background
Probiotics have beneficial effect on obesity related disorders in animal models. Despite a large number of animal data, randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) concluded that probiotics have a moderate effect on glycemic control-related parameters. However, effect of probiotics on insulin resistance are inconsistent.
Aim
In a double-blind single center RCT, effect of alive multistrain probiotic vs. placebo on insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes patient were assessed.
Methods
A total of 53 patients met the criteria for inclusion. They were randomly assigned to receive multiprobiotic “Symbiter” (concentrated biomass of 14 probiotic bacteria genera Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Propionibacterium) or placebo for 8-weeks administered as a sachet formulation. The primary main outcome was the change HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance) which calculated using Matthews et al.’s equation. Secondary outcomes were the changes in glycemic control-related parameters, anthropomorphic variables and cytokines.
Results
Supplementation with alive multiprobiotic for 8 weeks was associated with significant reduction of HOMA-IR from 6.85 ± 0.76 to 5.13 ± 0.49 (p = 0.047), but remained static in the placebo group. With respect to our secondary outcomes, HbA1c insignificant decreased by 0.09% (p = 0.383) and 0.24% (p = 0.068) respectively in placebo and probiotics groups. However, in probiotic responders (n = 22, patient with decrease in HOMA-IR) after supplementation a significant reduction in HbA1c by 0.39% (p = 0.022) as compared to non-responders was observed. In addition, from markers of chronic systemic inflammatory state only TNF-α and IL-1β changes significantly after treatment with probiotics.
Conclusion
Probiotic therapies modestly improved insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes."

abstract = "Hypoglycemia is an essential issue for diabetic patients and considered a limiting factor in the glycemic management. Heterogeneity of the diseases in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus can affect the frequency of hypoglycemia, especially when the patient has cardiovascular diseases. There are several factors that lead to hypoglycemia including sulfonylurea therapy, insulin therapy, delaying or missing a meal, physical exercise, or alcohol consumption. Long-term studies reported that repeated hypoglycemia could increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. During Ramadan fasting, diabetic patients have high incidence of hypoglycemia. Therefore, focused education about hypoglycemia in routine life of diabetic patients and during fasting in Ramadan is important to reduce the complications."
