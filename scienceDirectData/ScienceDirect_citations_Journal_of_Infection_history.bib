Despite increased knowledge acquired over recent decades, no treatment has shown effectiveness in the management of organ damage in HCT allografts. This review summarizes the current knowledge on BKPyV, from the virus constitution to the pathophysiology and immune-related mechanisms. We next focus on BKPyV-induced HC in HCT to discuss the benefit of monitoring BKPyV viruria and viremia in the management of patients. At last, we review currently used therapeutics, along with future promising therapies to propose clinical and practical guidelines and further interesting research areas."

Objectives
Primary pyomyositis is a bacterial infection of skeletal muscle first recognized in tropical regions of the world but needing characterization in temperate climates.
Methods
This population-based study used the Healthcare Utilization Project/Nationwide Inpatient Sample database to characterize the trends of pyomyositis admissions in the United States from 2002–2014 using ICD-9 diagnostic codes.
Results
We found a concerning more than three-fold increase in the incident pyomyositis admissions over our study period. The median length of stay was over twice as long compared to other hospitalized patients. Patients with pyomyositis were younger and more likely to be male and Black. There were more cases in the West and South compared to Midwest and Northeast. Age-adjusted odds ratios revealed significant association of pyomyositis with HIV, types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, hematologic malignancy, organ transplant, malnutrition, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and rheumatoid arthritis. The most commonly identified bacterial diagnosis was Staphylococcus aureus. Pseudomonas species were the most commonly identified gram-negative bacteria.
Conclusion
This nationwide review of pyomyositis in the United States suggests a concerning increase in incidence and provides information on the trends, demographics, risk factors, and causative organisms for pyomyositis in the United States."

Objectives
Surveillance of antimicrobial use (AMU), antimicrobial consumption (AMC), antimicrobial resistance (AMR), healthcare-associated infection (HAI), and AMR burden are usually measured by time-consuming and expensive multiple separate longitudinal surveys. This study aimed to investigate feasibility and benefit of integrated one-day surveillance to estimate and monitor these parameters.
Methods
Integrated one-day surveillance of AMU, AMC, AMR, HAI, and AMR burden among hospitalized patients in 183 hospitals in Thailand was conducted. Parameter data was collected for each patient who received antibiotic on a survey day.
Results
AMU prevalence was 51.5% among 23,686 hospitalized patients. The most commonly used antibiotic for infection prophylaxis and treatment was cefazolin and ceftriaxone, respectively. The most common infection was pneumonia. Community-associated infection (CAI) was observed in 64.9%, and 34.1% had HAI. Prevalence of AMR was highest in A. baumannii infection. AMR in bacteria was more prevalent among HAI than among CAI. Consumption of all antibiotics was 18,103 defined daily doses. HAI prevalence was 14.0%. Health and economic burden were much higher in patients with antibiotic-resistant infection.
Conclusions
Integrated one-day surveillance of these important parameters among hospitalized patients is feasible and can be used for estimation and monitoring from the facility-level to the national-level in resource-limited settings."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic. This systematic review compares mortality risk factors including clinical, demographic and laboratory features of COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The aim is to provide new strategies for COVID-19 prevention and treatment.
Methods
We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis, using five databases to compare the predictors of death for COVID-19, SARS and MERS. A random-effects model meta-analysis calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Results
845 articles up through 11/4/2020 were retrieved, but only 28 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that males had a higher likelihood of death than females (OR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.56–2.13). Age (OR = 7.86, 95% CI 5.46–11.29), diabetes comorbidity (OR = 3.73, 95% CI 2.35–5.90), chronic lung disease (OR = 3.43, 95% CI 1.80–6.52) and hypertension (OR = 3.38, 95% CI 2.45–4.67) were the mortality risk factors. The laboratory indicators lactic dehydrogenase (OR = 37.52, 95% CI 24.68–57.03), C-reactive protein (OR = 12.11, 95% CI 5.24–27.98), and neutrophils (OR = 17.56, 95% CI 10.67–28.90) had stronger correlations with COVID-19 mortality than with SARS or MERS mortality. Consolidation and ground-glass opacity imaging features were similar among COVID-19, SARS, and MERS patients.
Conclusions
COVID-19′s mortality factors are similar to those of SARS and MERS. Age and laboratory indicators could be effective predictors of COVID-19 mortality outcomes."

abstract = "Introduction
Management of the COVID-19 pandemic is hampered by long delays associated with centralised laboratory PCR testing. In hospitals this leads to poor patient flow and nosocomial transmission and so rapid, accurate diagnostic tests are urgently required. The FebriDx is a point-of-care test that detects an antiviral host response protein in finger prick blood within 10 min, but its accuracy for the identification of COVID-19 is unknown.
Methods
We performed a real-world diagnostic accuracy study of FebriDx in hospitalised patients during the first wave of the pandemic. Measures of diagnostic accuracy were calculated based on FebriDx results compared to the reference standard of SARS-CoV-2 PCR on combined nose and throat swabs. A multivariable predictive model including FebriDx, age, sex, and clinical characteristics was developed and underwent internal validation.
Results
FebriDx was performed on 251 patients and gave a valid result in 248. 118 of 248 (48%) were PCR positive for COVID-19. FebriDx results were available after 10 min compared with 1.7 (1.6 to 2.1) hours with point-of-care PCR testing and 23.4 (17.2 to 31.1) hours with laboratory PCR testing. Sensitivity of FebriDx for the identification of COVID-19 was 93% (110/118; 95% CI 87 to 97%) and specificity was 86% (112/130; 95%CI 79 to 92%). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.73 (95%CI 4.37 to 10.37) and 0.08 (95%CI 0.04 to 0.15) respectively. In the multivariate model age, sex and other clinical features did not contribute significantly to the effect of the FebriDx result in distinguishing patients with and without COVID-19.
Conclusions
During the first wave of the pandemic, FebriDx had high accuracy for the identification of COVID-19 in hospitalised adults and could be deployed as a front door triage tool.

Objectives:
We aimed to evaluate the role of rapid serological tests in the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
Methods:
This retrospective study enrolled 16 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and 58 COVID-19 negative patients at a medical center in Taiwan over a 3-month period. Serial serum samples were collected and tested for antibody response using four point-of-care (POC) lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) (ALLTEST 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test, Dynamiker 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test, ASK COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test, and Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test). Time-dependent detection sensitivity and timeliness of seroconversion were determined and compared between the four POC rapid tests.
Results:
The overall sensitivity and specificity of the four tests for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after 3 weeks of symptom onset were 100% and 100%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the rapid tests used for detection of IgM and IgG separately and those used for detection of combined total antibody (mainly IgM/IgG). There was no significant difference between the four POC rapid tests in terms of time required for determining seroconversion of COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 with pneumonia demonstrated shorter seroconversion time than those without pneumonia.
Conclusion:
Though the POC antibody rapid tests based on LFIA showed reliable performance in the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, the results of these tests should be interpreted and applied appropriately in the context of antibody dynamic of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 patients complicated with pneumonia exhibited earlier anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response than COVID-19 patients without pneumonia."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The outbreak of coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread to many places outside Wuhan. Previous studies on COVID-19 mostly included older hospitalized-adults. Little information on infectivity among and characteristics of youngsters with COVID-19 is available.
Methods
A cluster of 22 close-contacts of a 22-year-old male (Patient-Index) including youngsters with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized close-contacts testing negative for severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Anhui Province, China was prospectively-traced.
Results
Since January 23, 2020, we enrolled a cluster of eight youngsters with COVID-19 (median age [range], 22 [16–23] years; six males) originating from Patient-Index returning from Wuhan to Hefei on January 19. Patient-Index visited his 16-year-old female cousin in the evening on his return, and met 15 previous classmates in a get-together on January 21. He reported being totally asymptomatic and were described by all his contacts as healthy on January 19-21. His very first symptoms were itchy eyes and fever developed at noon and in the afternoon on January 22, respectively. Seven youngsters (his cousin and six classmates) became infected with COVID-19 after a-few-hour-contact with Patient-Index. None of the patients and contacts had visited Wuhan (except Patient-Index), or had any exposure to wet-markets, wild-animals, or medical-institutes within three months. For affected youngsters, the median incubation-period was 2 days (range, 1–4). The median serial-interval was 1 day (range, 0–4). Half or more of the eight COVID-19-infected youngsters had fever, cough, sputum production, nasal congestion, and fatigue on admission. All patients had mild conditions. Six patients developed pneumonia (all mild; one bilateral) on admission. As of February 20, four patients were discharged.
Conclusions
SARS-CoV-2-infection presented strong infectivity during the incubation-period with rapid transmission in this cluster of youngsters outside Wuhan. COVID-19 developed in these youngsters had fast onset and various nonspecific atypical manifestations, and were much milder than in older patients as previously reported."

In previous influenza pandemics, bacterial co-infections have been a major cause of mortality. We aimed to evaluate the burden of co-infections in patients with COVID-19.
Methods
We systematically searched Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, LILACS and CINAHL for eligible studies published from 1 January 2020 to 17 April 2020. We included patients of all ages, in all settings. The main outcome was the proportion of patients with a bacterial, fungal or viral co-infection. .
Results
Thirty studies including 3834 patients were included. Overall, 7% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients had a bacterial co-infection (95% CI 3-12%, n=2183, I2=92·2%). A higher proportion of ICU patients had bacterial co-infections than patients in mixed ward/ICU settings (14%, 95% CI 5-26, I2=74·7% versus 4%, 95% CI 1-9, I2= 91·7%). The commonest bacteria were Mycoplasma pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. The pooled proportion with a viral co-infection was 3% (95% CI 1-6, n=1014, I2=62·3%), with Respiratory Syncytial Virus and influenza A the commonest. Three studies reported fungal co-infections.
Conclusions
A low proportion of COVID-19 patients have a bacterial co-infection; less than in previous influenza pandemics. These findings do not support the routine use of antibiotics in the management of confirmed COVID-19 infection."

Methods
Retrospective study recruiting 2559 patients from 17 hospitals. Distribution of HBV genotypes, as well as sex, age, geographical origin, mode of transmission, HDV-, HIV- and/or HCV-coinfection, and treatment were recorded.
Results
1924 chronically HBV native Spanish patients have been recruited. Median age was 54 years (IQR: 41-62), 69.6% male, 6.3% HIV-coinfected, 3.1% were HCV-coinfected, 1.7% HDV-co/superinfected. Genotype distribution was: 55.9% D, 33.5% A, 5.6% F, 0.8% G, and 1.9% other genotypes (E, B, H and C). HBV genotype A was closely associated with male sex, sexual transmission, and HIV-coinfection. In contrast, HBV genotype D was associated with female sex and vertical transmission. Different patterns of genotype distribution and diversity were found between different geographical regions. In addition, HBV epidemiological patterns are evolving in Spain, mainly because of immigration. Finally, similar overall rates of treatment success across all HBV genotypes were found.
Conclusions
We present here the most recent data on molecular epidemiology of HBV in Spain (GEHEP010 Study). This study confirms that the HBV genotype distribution in Spain varies based on age, sex, origin, HIV-coinfection, geographical regions and epidemiological groups."

Methods
This is a retrospective study of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to February 18, 2020. Compare the clinical characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged patients.
Results
A total of 56 patients were enrolled 18 elderly patients (32.14%), and 38 young and middle-aged patients (67.86%). The most common symptoms in both groups were fever, followed by cough and sputum. Four patients in the elderly group received negative pressure ICU for mechanical ventilation, and five patients in the young and middle-aged group. One patient died in the elderly group (5.56%), and two patients died in the young and middle-aged group (5.26%). The PSI score of the elderly group was higher than that of the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with PSI grades IV and V was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.05). The proportion of multiple lobe involvement in the elderly group was higher than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and there was no difference in single lobe lesions between the two groups.

We provide here bio-informatic, evolutionary analysis of 351 available sequences of its genome with the aim of mapping genome structural variations and the patterns of selection.
Methods
A Maximum likelihood tree has been built and selective pressure has been investigated in order to find any mutation developed during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that could potentially affect clinical evolution of the infection.
Finding
We have found in more recent isolates the presence of two mutations affecting the Non-Structural Protein 6 (NSP6) and the Open Reding Frame10 (ORF 10) adjacent regions. Amino acidic change stability analysis suggests both mutations could confer lower stability of the protein structures.
Interpretation
One of the two mutations, likely developed within the genome during virus spread, could affect virus intracellular survival. Genome follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 spread is urgently needed in order to identify mutations that could significantly modify virus pathogenicity."

A total of 132 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020 to February 26, 2020 were collected. The dynamic changes of blood SAA, CRP, PCT, WBC, Lymphocyte (L), PLT, CT imaging, and disease progression were studied. All patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study; The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020.
Results
COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SAA and CRP levels, while L count decreased, and PCT, WBC, and PLT were in the normal range. As disease progressed from mild to critically severe, SAA and CRP gradually increased, while L decreased, and PLT, WBC, and PCT had no significant changes; ROC curve analysis suggests that SAA/L, CRP, SAA, and L count are valuable in evaluating the severity of COVID-19 and distinguishing critically ill patients from mild ones; Patients with SAA consistently trending down during the course of disease have better prognosis, compared with the patients with SAA continuously rising; The initial SAA level is positively correlated with the dynamic changes of the serial CT scans. Patient with higher initial SAA level are more likely to have poor CT imaging.
Conclusions
SAA and L are sensitive indicators in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Monitoring dynamic changes of SAA, combined with CT imaging could be valuable in diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
HIV-infection increases the risk to progress to active-tuberculosis (TB). Detection of latent TB infection (LTBI) is needed to eventually propose preventive-therapy and reduce TB reservoir. QuantiFERON-TB Plus (QFT-Plus)-test identifies LTBI. Currently, only two studies on QFT-Plus accuracy in HIV-infected-population are available in high TB-endemic-countries. Therefore we aimed to evaluate the effect of HIV-infection on QFT-Plus accuracy to detect LTBI in a low TB-endemic-country.
Methods
We enrolled 465 participants, among the 167 HIV-infected-persons: 32 with active-TB (HIV-TB), 45 remote-LTBI (HIV-LTBI) and 90 at low M. tuberculosis (Mtb)-infection risk. Among the 298 HIV-uninfected-persons: 170 with active-TB, 76 recent-LTBI, 34 remote-LTBI and 18 with low Mtb-infection risk.
Results
QFT-Plus sensitivity was similar in TB regardless of HIV-status. CD4-count did not influence the distribution of IFN-γ values in HIV-TB and HIV-LTBI. Moreover HIV-LTBI and HIV-uninfected remote LTBI had a similar proportion of results in the uncertain range (IFNγ ≥0.2 ≤ 0.7 IU/ml) differently from those LTBI-persons reporting recent-exposure (p = 0.016). Cytometry results demonstrated that CD8-response was similar in HIV-infected- and -uninfected-persons whereas CD4-response was impaired in HIV-infected-persons (p = 0.011).
Conclusions
HIV-infection does not affect QFT-Plus response in active-TB, whereas the time of exposure influences the proportion of uncertain-results in LTBI."

We conducted a cross-sectional study in Hong Kong community to estimate the carriage prevalence, associated factors and genotypes of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE).
Methods
Seemingly healthy subjects were asked to provide nasal, handprint and stool samples from March to April 2017. Isolates were characterized by molecular methods. We used multivariable logistic regression models within a generalized estimating equation framework to identify risk factors for ESBL-E carriage. Characteristics of MRSA/CPE carriage were summarized.
Results
The prevalence of ESBL-E, MRSA and CPE were 52.8% (104/197), 2.5% (5/197) and 0.5% (1/197) respectively. Most ESBL-E isolates were E. coli (85.6%; 113/132). Most ESBL genes belonged to blaCTX−M-G9 (68.9%) and blaTEM (53.0%) types. Self-reported antibiotic consumption (≥2 courses) in the past six months was associated with ESBL-E carriage (adjusted odds ratio: 4.71–5.47).
Conclusions
Abundance of ESBL-E in the community are causes of concern, and antibiotic use is associated with its carriage. Presence of MRSA and CPE in community members without clear healthcare exposure hints on a change in their epidemiology. This study establishes a baseline to formulate infection control policies and future studies in combating antimicrobial resistance."

Non-HIV immunocompromised patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) have lower fungal load than those with AIDS, potentially affecting the accuracy of diagnostic biomarkers. Therefore, we investigated the performance of serum (1,3)-Beta-d-Glucan (BDG) in conjunction with quantitative Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR (qPCR) in non-HIV cancer patients.
Methods
We reviewed records of non-HIV cancer patients and classified them as definite, probable, or possible PCP cases, according to clinicoradiological features, microscopy findings, and qPCR results in bronchoscopy specimens. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of serum BDG and its correlation with qPCR results.
Results
We identified 101 PCP patients (73 definite/probable, 28 possible) and 74 controls. Correlation of BDG and qPCR was low among all 101 qPCR-positive patients (Spearman's = 0.38) and in definite/probable PCP cases (Spearman's = 0.18). Considering all qPCR-positive patients, BDG showed consistently low sensitivity at different cutoffs. Among definite/probable cases, the diagnostic accuracy of BDG remained poor, yet slightly improved with high qPCR thresholds (AUC = 0.86 at ≥2000 DNA copies/mL). BDG had a low PPV but excellent NPV across different qPCR and BDG cutoffs.
Conclusions
BDG and qPCR levels correlate poorly in non-HIV cancer patients with PCP. BDG diagnostic performance is suboptimal but a negative test may be useful to rule out PCP in this population."

abstract = "Objectives
A recently released new QuantiFERON (QFT) product, QFT TB Gold plus (QFT-plus), is optimized for both CD4 and CD8 responses and reported to have higher sensitivity compared to the former QFT-3 G. Previously, using supernatants of QFT-3 G, we and others have demonstrated that cytokines other than IFN-γ may be useful in diagnosing tuberculosis. The present study aimed to identify cytokines that are useful for accurately diagnosing active tuberculosis by using QFT-plus and compared the data to those with QFT-3 G.
Methods
Eighty-three active tuberculosis patients and 70 healthy control subjects who were examined by QFT at Tokyo National Hospital from June 2017 to July 2018 were enrolled. QFT-3 G and QFT-plus were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. At the same time, blood cell culture supernatants were collected and assayed for their cytokine levels using R&D Systems Luminex Assay and MAGPIX System. The levels of cytokines were compared between different antigen-containing tubes (3 G Ag, TB1 and TB2 tubes), as well as between the patients and the control subjects. ROC curves were drawn, and the AUCs were calculated.
Results
Five cytokines, i.e., IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10 and MIP-1β, produced by human blood cells in three independent tubes containing different tuberculosis antigens were higher in the 3 G Ag tube compared to both the TB1 and TB2 tubes. Further, when the TB1 and TB2 tubes were compared, TB2 showed greater production of only PDGF-BB, and less production of IL-6 and TNF-α. For diagnosing active tuberculosis, the levels of IP-10 were superior to the level of IFN-γ based on showing a larger AUC for ROC curves in our present study setting. Finally, the levels of IFN-γ, IL-1RA, IL-2, IP-10, MCP-1 and MIP-1β were distinctly different between the active tuberculosis patients and healthy controls.
Conclusions
In summary, there was no cytokine that was higher in the tubes of QFT-plus compared to the tube of QFT-3 G, suggesting inferiority of QFT-plus antigens to 3 G Ag in terms of elicitation of cytokine production. Our results also suggest the usefulness of cytokines that showed a significant difference between the active tuberculosis patients and the healthy controls—namely, IFN-γ, IL-1RA, IL-2, IP-10, MCP-1 and MIP-1β—for diagnosing tuberculosis, but the roles of these cytokines in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis need to be elucidated (UMIN000035253)."

The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia is globally concerning. We aimed to investigate the clinical and CT features in the pregnant women and children with this disease, which have not been well reported.
Methods
Clinical and CT data of 59 patients with COVID-19 from January 27 to February 14, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, including 14 laboratory-confirmed non-pregnant adults, 16 laboratory-confirmed and 25 clinically-diagnosed pregnant women, and 4 laboratory-confirmed children. The clinical and CT features were analyzed and compared.
Findings
Compared with the non-pregnant adults group (n = 14), initial normal body temperature (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]), leukocytosis (8 [50%] and 9 [36%]) and elevated neutrophil ratio (14 [88%] and 20 [80%]), and lymphopenia (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]) were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (n = 16) and clinically-diagnosed (n = 25) pregnant groups. Totally 614 lesions were detected with predominantly peripheral and bilateral distributions in 54 (98%) and 37 (67%) patients, respectively. Pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the predominant presence in 94/131 (72%) lesions for the non-pregnant adults. Mixed consolidation and complete consolidation were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (70/161 [43%]) and clinically-diagnosed (153/322 [48%]) pregnant groups than 37/131 (28%) in the non-pregnant adults (P = 0·007, P < 0·001). GGO with reticulation was less common in 9/161 (6%) and 16/322 (5%) lesions for the two pregnant groups than 24/131 (18%) for the non-pregnant adults (P = 0·001, P < 0·001). The pulmonary involvement in children with COVID-19 was mild with a focal GGO or consolidation. Twenty-three patients underwent follow-up CT, revealing progression in 9/13 (69%) at 3 days whereas improvement in 8/10 (80%) at 6–9 days after initial CT scans.
Interpretation
Atypical clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 could increase the difficulty in initial identification. Consolidation was more common in the pregnant groups. The clinically-diagnosed cases were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement. CT was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and timely therapeutic effects evaluation for the cases with epidemic and clinical features of COVID-19 with or without laboratory confirmation. The exposure history and clinical symptoms were more helpful for screening in children versus chest CT."

abstract = "Objectives
SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays are needed for serological surveys and as a complement to molecular tests to confirm COVID-19. However, the kinetics of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly described and relies on the performance of the different serological tests.
Methods
In this study, we evaluated the performance of six CE-marked point-of-care tests (POC) and three ELISA assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 by exploring seroconversions in hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Results
Both the ELISA and POC tests were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least half of the samples collected seven days or more after the onset of symptoms. After 15 days, the rate of detection rose to over 80% but without reaching 100%, irrespective of the test used. More than 90% of the samples collected after 15 days tested positive using the iSIA and Accu-Tell® POC tests and the ID.Vet IgG ELISA assay. Seroconversion was observed 5 to 12 days after the onset of symptoms. Three assays suffer from a specificity below 90% (EUROIMMUN IgG and IgA, UNscience, Zhuhai Livzon).
Conclusions
The second week of COVID-19 seems to be the best period for assessing the sensitivity of commercial serological assays. To achieve an early diagnosis of COVID-19 based on antibody detection, a dual challenge must be met: the immunodiagnostic window period must be shortened and an optimal specificity must be conserved."

A 31-year-old man presented with cryptococcal meningitis (CM) without typical clinical characteristics, but with abnormal walking, difficult leg lifting and frequent falling. He was admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital. After multiple tests failed to identify the pathogen, single-cell sequencing (scS) was used to test the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Comparing the sequence obtained from single-cell sequencing with the reference database, it was found that the infection was caused by Cryptococcus gattii sensu stricto (AFLP4/VGI genotype). Cryptococcus is difficult to cultivate from complex body fluids. The etiological agent of this patient was identified and the patient was treated. This is the first case in which scS was used to detect and identify fungal pathogen after conventional testing failed to identify the cause of the disease. This report demonstrates that the scS approach can be used to generate fungal genome sequences directly from the CSF of a CM patient. The scS technology could become a powerful tool to precise detect microscopically visible but uncultured pathogens in clinical samples."

To investigate the characteristics and prognostic factors in the elderly patients with COVID-19.
Methods
Consecutive cases over 60 years old with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Feb 6, 2020 were included. The primary outcomes were death and survival till March 5. Data of demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, laboratory tests and complications were collected and compared for different outcomes. Cox regression was performed for prognostic factors.
Results
339 patients with COVID-19 (aged 71±8 years,173 females (51%)) were enrolled, including 80 (23.6%) critical, 159 severe (46.9%) and 100 moderate (29.5%) cases. Common comorbidities were hypertension (40.8%), diabetes (16.0%) and cardiovascular disease (15.7%). Common symptoms included fever (92.0%), cough (53.0%), dyspnea (40.8%) and fatigue (39.9%). Lymphocytopenia was a common laboratory finding (63.2%). Common complications included bacterial infection (42.8%), liver enzyme abnormalities (28.7%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (21.0%). Till Mar 5, 2020, 91 cases were discharged (26.8%), 183 cases stayed in hospital (54.0%) and 65 cases (19.2%) were dead. Shorter length of stay was found for the dead compared with the survivors (5 (3–8) vs. 28 (26–29), P < 0.001). Symptoms of dyspnea (HR 2.35, P = 0.001), comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (HR 1.86, P = 0.031) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 2.24, P = 0.023), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (HR 29.33, P < 0.001) were strong predictors of death. And a high level of lymphocytes was predictive of better outcome (HR 0.10, P < 0.001).
Conclusions
High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderly COVID-19 patients. Rapid disease progress was noted in the dead with a median survival time of 5 days after admission. Dyspnea, lymphocytopenia, comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome were predictive of poor outcome.

To understand SARS-Co-V-2 infection and transmission in UK nursing homes in order to develop preventive strategies for protecting the frail elderly residents.
Methods
An outbreak investigation involving 394 residents and 70 staff, was carried out in 4 nursing homes affected by COVID-19 outbreaks in central London. Two point-prevalence surveys were performed one week apart where residents underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had relevant symptoms documented. Asymptomatic staff from three of the four homes were also offered SARS-CoV-2 testing.
Results
Overall, 26% (95% CI 22–31) of residents died over the two-month period. All-cause mortality increased by 203% (95% CI 70–336) compared with previous years. Systematic testing identified 40% (95% CI 35–46) of residents as positive for SARS-CoV-2, and of these 43% (95% CI 34–52) were asymptomatic and 18% (95% CI 11–24) had only atypical symptoms; 4% (95% CI −1 to 9) of asymptomatic staff also tested positive.
Conclusions
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in four UK nursing homes was associated with very high infection and mortality rates. Many residents developed either atypical or had no discernible symptoms. A number of asymptomatic staff members also tested positive, suggesting a role for regular screening of both residents and staff in mitigating future outbreaks."

abstract = "Objectives
Postnatal outcome in fetuses with congenital cytomegalovirus infection (cCMV) varies from asymptomatic infection to severe neurodevelopmental impairment. Αntenatal biomarkers of long-term clinical outcome, have yet to be established. Α systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to examine whether prenatal cerebral ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in cCMV fetuses may predict clinical outcome.
Methods
PubMed and the Web of Science were systematically searched to identify studies reporting on any prenatal US and/or MRI imaging of fetuses with cCMV as well as their postnatal clinical outcome. All reported associations between imaging and postnatal clinical outcome were systematically extracted. Where appropriate, the reported associations were quantitatively synthesized within Bayesian random-effects meta-analyses.
Results
A total of 1336 studies were screened to identify 26 eligible observational studies. Overall, 4181 fetuses were studied, of which 1518 had been diagnosed with cCMV. All studies performed fetal US while in 14 (54%) MRI was also performed. Studies substantially varied in timing of fetal imaging, reporting of abnormalities, definition of poor outcome and statistical analysis. Among studies reporting on statistical significance, 6/6 for US and 3/4 for MRI identified significant associations between imaging findings and outcome. In our meta-analyses, within isolated abnormalities, only microcephaly had greater than 95% probability of being associated with poor outcome (OR 26.7; 95% CI, 1.44–1464.5; I2, 19%). Effect sizes for US were higher than those for MRI findings.
Conclusions
Although studies displayed significant heterogeneity in both methodology and analytical decisions, it became evident that when both prenatal cerebral US and MRI are normal the negative predictive value of poor outcome is high. This is important for clinicians when consulting pregnant women. Need to standardize practices and definitions become evident.

abstract = "Objectives
To summarize the available evidence on the diagnostic performance for invasive aspergillosis (IA) in non-hematological, non-solid organ transplantation critically ill patients of the following: (i) existing definitions of IA (developed either for classical immunocompromised populations or for non-immunocompromised critically ill patients); (ii) laboratory tests; (iii) radiology tests.
Methods
A systematic review was performed by evaluating studies assessing the diagnostic performance for IA of a definition/s and/or laboratory/radiology test/s vs. a reference standard (histology) or a reference definition.
Results
Sufficient data for evaluating the performance of existing definitions and laboratory tests for the diagnosis of IA in critically ill patients is available only for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Against histology/autopsy as reference, the AspICU definition showed a promising diagnostic performance but based on small samples and applicable only to patients with positive respiratory cultures. Studies on laboratory tests consistently indicated a better diagnostic performance of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) galactomannan (GM) than serum GM, and a suboptimal specificity of BALF and serum (1,3)-β-D-glucan.
Conclusions
Evidence stemming from this systematic review will guide the discussion for defining invasive aspergillosis within the FUNDICU project. The project aims to develop a standard set of definitions for invasive fungal diseases in critically ill, adult patients."

We observed great heterogeneity in antibody detection post-symptom onset. The median antibody detection time was between 8 and 10 days according to the manufacturers. All the tests showed a sensitivity of 60 to 80% on day 10 and 100% on day 15. In addition, a single cross-reaction was observed with other human coronavirus infections.

Respiratory and intestinal tract were two primary target organs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, detailed characterization of the host-virus interplay in infected human lung and intestinal epithelial cells is lacking.
Methods
We utilized immunofluorescence assays, flow cytometry, and RT-qPCR to delineate the virological features and the innate immune response of the host cells against SARS-CoV-2 infection in two prototype human cell lines representing the human pulmonary (Calu3) and intestinal (Caco2) epithelium when compared with SARS-CoV.
Results
Lung epithelial cells were significantly more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. However, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced an attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines induction and type I and type II IFN responses. A single dose of 10 U/mL IFN-β (IFNβ) pretreatment potently protected both Calu3 and Caco2 against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 was more sensitive to the pretreatment with IFNβ and IFN inducer than SARS-CoV in Calu3.
Conclusions
Despite robust infection efficiency in both the human lung and intestinal epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 could attenuate the virus-induced pro-inflammatory response and IFN response. Pre-activation of the type I IFN signaling pathway primed a highly efficient antiviral response in the host against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could serve as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic maneuver to COVID-19 patients."

To examine the association between bacterial-viral co-occurrence in the nasopharynx and the risk of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in young children living in resource-limited settings.
Methods
A case-control study was conducted between January and December 2017 in Moshi, Tanzania. Children 2–59 months with CAP and healthy controls were enrolled. RSV and Influenza A/B were detected with a standardized polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, and a simplified real-time quantitative PCR method, without sample pre-processing, was developed to detect bacterial pathogens in nasopharyngeal samples.
Results
A total of 109 CAP patients and 324 healthy controls were enrolled. Co-detection of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae in nasopharyngeal swabs was linked with higher odds of CAP (aOR=3.2, 95% CI=1.1–9.5). The majority of the H. influenzae isolated in cases and controls (95.8%) were non-typeable. Of the viruses examined, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was most common (n = 31, 7.2%) in cases and controls. Children with RSV had 8.4 times higher odds to develop pneumonia than healthy children (aOR=8.4, 95%CI= 3.2 – 22.1).
Conclusions
Co-occurence of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae in the nasopharynx was strongly associated with CAP. The high prevalence of non-typeable H. influenzae might be a sign of replacement as a consequence of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccination."

abstract = "Objectives
A large number of healthcare workers (HCWs) were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan.
Methods
We collected 626 surface swabs within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan in the mist of the COVID-19 outbreak between February 7 - February 27, 2020. Dacron swabs were aseptically collected from the surfaces of 13 hospital function zones, five major objects, and three major PPE. The SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected by reverse transcription-PCR.
Results
The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit specialized for taking care of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) (31.9%), Obstetric Isolation Ward specialized for pregnant women with NCP (28.1%), and Isolation Ward for NCP (19.6%). We classified the 13 zones into four contamination levels. The most contaminated objects were self-service printers (20.0%), desktop/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%). Both hand sanitizer dispensers (20.3%) and gloves (15.4%) were the most contaminated PPE.
Conclusion
Our findings emphasize the urgent need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention among HCWs during the outbreak of COVID-19."

Background
Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical characteristics. We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19.
Methods
In this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of follow-up was February 25, 2020.
Results
Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2–7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12–20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8–11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P <0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10–12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P <0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR = 0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission.
Conclusions
The majority of COVID-19 cases are mild. The clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19."

We describe the investigation of a Campylobacter outbreak linked to contamination of an untreated, groundwater derived drinking water supply.
Methods
We analysed epidemiological data collected from clinician-confirmed diarrheal cases and estimated the total burden of Havelock North cases using an age-adjusted cross-sectional telephone survey. Campylobacter isolates from case fecal specimens, groundwater samples, and sheep fecal specimens from paddocks adjacent to the drinking water source were whole genome sequenced.
Findings
We estimate between 6260 and 8320 cases of illness including up to 2230 who lived outside the reticulation area, were linked to the contaminated water supply. Of these, 953 cases were physician reported, 42 were hospitalized, three developed Guillain-Barré syndrome, and Campylobacter infection contributed to at least four deaths. Of the 12 genotypes observed in cases, four were also observed in water, three were also observed in sheep and one was also observed in both water and sheep.
Interpretation
The contamination of the untreated reticulated water supply occurred following a very heavy rainfall event which caused drainage of sheep feces into a shallow aquifer. The existence of a routine clinical surveillance system for campylobacteriosis facilitated identification of the outbreak, recovery of clinical isolates, and early testing of the water for pathogens. Genotyping of the Campylobacter jejuni helped define the source of the outbreak and confirm outbreak periods and cases. Expected increases in heavy rainfall events and intensification of agriculture mean that additional safeguards are needed to protect populations from such drinking water outbreaks.

abstract = "Objectives
To describe demographic features, clinical outcomes and diagnostic delay amongst patients with extra-spinal articular tuberculosis (TB) in a low-incidence setting.
Methods
Cases of TB treated at our institution between 2004 and 2014 were identified via the London TB register (LTBR). Demographic features of extra-spinal articular TB cases were compared to controls with TB at all other sites. For articular cases (excluding individuals <16 years or with spinal TB without peripheral joint involvement) clinical data were retrospectively collected.
Results
6,146 TB patients were identified over the study period; 146 (2.4%) cases had extra-spinal articular infection. There was no difference in median age between extra-spinal articular TB cases and controls with TB at other sites (31 vs 32 years, p = 0.57). Articular cases were more likely to be male (70.6% vs 59.5%, p = 0.007), Bangladeshi (28.7% vs 18.0%) or Pakistani (24.0% vs 16.1%) and were less likely to be Black-African (9.5% vs 19.8%) (p < 0.001). 93 cases were included in the case series; 85 (88.5%) were migrants and 83 (89.2%) were South Asian. Knee and elbow joints were affected in 22 (23.7%) and 18 (19.4%) cases respectively. The median durations of pre-healthcare and healthcare associated delay were 16 and 6 weeks respectively. Where mycobacterial culture was performed, 57/75 (76%) were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 86 (92.5%) cases received standard quadruple therapy for a median of 6 months (IQR 6–9). Recurrence of TB infection occurred in 4 (4.3%) cases and there were no TB related deaths. Seven (7.6%) cases required surgical intervention.
Conclusions
Extra-spinal articular TB more commonly affected men and people of South Asian ethnicity. Significant diagnostic delays were identified, including avoidable healthcare-associated delays."

Objectives
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a known cause of morbidity among young children, while RSV-related disease in the elderly is not fully recognized. Several RSV candidate vaccines for infants, pregnant women and adults are under development. We aimed to estimate nationwide age-specific hospitalizations and seasonal trends, to help determine the optimal age for vaccination.
Methods
Hospitalizations with a primary RSV-related diagnoses were retrieved from the National Hospital Database for the years 2000-2017. Data were analyzed by year, month and age group to determine hospitalization rates and seasonal trends.
Results
During the analysis period, 39,156 hospitalizations received primary RSV-related ICD-9 diagnostic codes. The highest mean yearly hospitalization rate occurred among infants <1 year of life (1,218.4 per 100,000). Within the first year of life, the highest mean yearly hospitalization rate was observed in the second month of life (3,541.5 hospitalizations per 100,000). Hospitalization rates for individuals ≥5 years old increased during the study period, primarily among patients ≥65 years of age, reaching hospitalization rate of 9 per 100,000 in 2017. A clear seasonal pattern was observed.
Conclusions
An effective vaccine for infants and pregnant women has the potential to reduce hospitalizations burden. RSV-related hospitalizations burden among adults requires additional research"

abstract = "Background
Significant nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated. Understanding the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage amongst HCWs at work is necessary to inform the development of HCW screening programmes to control nosocomial spread.
Methods
Cross-sectional ‘snapshot’ survey from April-May 2020; HCWs recruited from six UK hospitals. Participants self-completed a health questionnaire and underwent a combined viral nose and throat swab, tested by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 with viral culture on majority of positive samples.
Findings
Point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage across the sites was 2.0% (23/1152 participants), median cycle threshold value 35.70 (IQR:32.42–37.57). 17 were previously symptomatic, two currently symptomatic (isolated anosmia and sore throat); the remainder declared no prior or current symptoms. Symptoms in the past month were associated with threefold increased odds of testing positive (aOR 3.46, 95%CI 1.38–8.67; p = 0.008). SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from only one (5%) of nineteen cultured samples. A large proportion (39%) of participants reported symptoms in the past month.
Interpretation
The point-prevalence is similar to previous estimates for HCWs in April 2020, though a magnitude higher than in the general population. Based upon interpretation of symptom history and testing results including viral culture, the majority of those testing positive were unlikely to be infectious at time of sampling. Development of screening programmes must balance the potential to identify additional cases based upon likely prevalence, expanding the symptoms list to encourage HCW testing, with resource implications and risks of excluding those unlikely to be infectious with positive tests.

Objectives:
To explore the association between nontyphoidal salmonellosis (NTS) and the risk of acute ischemic stroke (IS) by using a nationwide, population-based study.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study using claim data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), patients aged 18 years and older with histories of NTS (N = 1618) were included from January 1, 2000-December 31, 2012, and the non-NTS group (N = 6472) without NTS were matched by propensity score. The follow-up period was defined as the time from the initial diagnosis of NTS to the date of development of IS, death or 31 December, 2013. Patients previously diagnosed with stroke were excluded. The Cox proportional hazard model with robust sandwich estimator was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of IS after adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates.
Results:
The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for the NTS group compared with the non-NTS group was 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10–1.65) for overall stroke. Furthermore, the NTS cohort had an increased risk of IS compared to the non-NTS groups (aHR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.14–1.78). Stratified analysis showed that compared with propensity score matched non-NTS group, subjects aged ≥65 years, female, those with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD, cancer and heart failure had higher risk of developing stroke. A 1.93-fold significant increase risk for stroke was observed during the first 3–12 months of follow-up (95% CI, 1.07–3.48).
Conclusions:
Patients with NTS is associated with increased risk of developing ischemic stroke compared with non-NTS patients. Timely and mindful treatment plan about NTS may be a milestone to stroke prevention especially in some subpopulation."

In addition, the concordance of whole blood samples and plasma showed Cohen's kappa value of 0.93, which represented the almost perfect agreement between two types of samples. In conclusion, serological ICG strip assay in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection is both sensitive and consistent, which is considered as an excellent supplementary approach in clinical application."

Background
Brain abscess is an uncommon condition, but carries high mortality. Current treatment guidelines are based on limited data. Surveillance of clinical, radiological and microbiology data is important to inform patient stratification, interventions, and antimicrobial stewardship.
Methods
We undertook a retrospective, observational study of patients with brain abscess, based on hospital coding, in a UK tertiary referral teaching hospital. We reviewed imaging data, laboratory microbiology, and antibiotic prescriptions.
Results
Over a 47 month period, we identified 47 adults with bacterial brain abscess (77% male, median age 47 years). Most of the abscesses were solitary frontal or parietal lesions. A microbiological diagnosis was secured in 39/47 (83%) of cases, among which the majority were of the Streptococcus milleri group (27/39; 69%), with a predominance of Streptococcus intermedius (19/27; 70%). Patients received a median of 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics (most commonly ceftriaxone), with variable oral follow-on regimens. Ten patients (21%) died, up to 146 days after diagnosis. Mortality was significantly associated with increasing age, multiple abscesses, immunosuppression and the presence of an underlying cardiac anomaly.
Conclusion
Our data suggest that there has been a shift away from staphylococcal brain abscesses, towards S. intermedius as a dominant pathogen. In our setting, empiric current first line therapy with ceftriaxone remains appropriate on microbiological grounds and narrower spectrum therapy may sometimes be justified. Mortality of this condition remains high among patients with comorbidity. Prospective studies are required to inform optimum dose, route and duration of antimicrobial therapy."

abstract = "Summary
Genomic surveillance of bacterial meningitis pathogens is essential for effective disease control globally, enabling identification of emerging and expanding strains and consequent public health interventions. While there has been a rise in the use of whole genome sequencing, this has been driven predominately by a subset of countries with adequate capacity and resources. Global capacity to participate in surveillance needs to be expanded, particularly in low and middle-income countries with high disease burdens. In light of this, the WHO-led collaboration, Defeating Meningitis by 2030 Global Roadmap, has called for the establishment of a Global Meningitis Genome Partnership that links resources for: N. meningitidis (Nm), S. pneumoniae (Sp), H. influenzae (Hi) and S. agalactiae (Sa) to improve worldwide co-ordination of strain identification and tracking. Existing platforms containing relevant genomes include: PubMLST: Nm (31,622), Sp (15,132), Hi (1935), Sa (9026); The Wellcome Sanger Institute: Nm (13,711), Sp (> 24,000), Sa (6200), Hi (1738); and BMGAP: Nm (8785), Hi (2030). A steering group is being established to coordinate the initiative and encourage high-quality data curation. Next steps include: developing guidelines on open-access sharing of genomic data; defining a core set of metadata; and facilitating development of user-friendly interfaces that represent publicly available data."

Objectives
Understanding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) mode of host cell recognition may help to fight the disease and save lives. The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition.
Methods
In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike.
Results
Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain β (SBDβ). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDβ of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor.
Conclusions
We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78. Region IV is the main driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol. These nine residues can be used to develop therapeutics specific against COVID-19."

Objectives
Global tuberculosis (TB) control is restricted by the failure to detect an estimated 3.3 million TB cases annually. In the majority of TB endemic settings, sputum smear microscopy is used to diagnose TB, but this test is insensitive for TB in its early stages. The objective of this study is to establish a concise gene signature that discriminates between individuals with early TB disease, latent TB infection (LTBI) and those without infection.
Methods
This is a case control study nested within a cluster-randomised trial of population screening for active TB using Xpert MTB/RIF. Whole blood samples from 303 participants with active TB (97), LTBI (92) and uninfected individuals (114) were subject to transcriptomic analysis of selected target genes based on a systematic review of previous studies.
Results
Analysis of 82 genes identified a pattern of differentially expressed genes in TB disease. A seven gene signature was identified that distinguished between TB disease and no TB disease with an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80–0.91), and between TB disease from LTBI with an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82–0.93).
Conclusion
This gene signature accurately distinguishes early TB disease from those without TB disease or infection, in the context of community-wide TB screening. It could be used as a non-sputum based screening tool or triage test to detect prevalent cases of TB in the community."

Recent studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be found in fecal specimens of COVID-19 patients, but the sample size is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of these patients according to their clinical characteristics.
Methods
MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and three Chinese biomedical databases were searched up to 25 March 2020 with no language restriction. We included original observational studies that reported the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of COVID-19 patients. Two separate reviewers conducted the review. Metaprop was adopted to conduct a meta-analysis of prevalence with variances stabilized by Freeman-Tukey Double Arcsine Transformation. A random-effects model was used. Heterogeneity across different studies was computed using Cochran's Q test and chi square statistics.
Results
From 17 studies, the pooled detection rate of fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 43.7% (95% CI 32.6%-55.0%) and 33.7% (95% C.I. 33.7%, 95% C.I. 20.1%-48.8%) by patient and number of specimens as a unit count, respectively. Female individuals (59.6% vs. 53.5%), those who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms (77.1% vs. 57.7%), and patients with more severe disease (68.3% vs. 34.6%) tended to have a higher detection rate.
Discussion
A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients carry SARS-CoV-2 in their intestinal tract. Feces being a self-collected specimen bears a potential to improve case identification in community, especially for young children where proper respiratory sampling at home is difficult. Specific infection control strategies focusing on spread via fecal contamination and faulty toilet drainage are urgently needed."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to escalate. There is urgent need to stratify patients. Understanding risk of deterioration will assist in admission and discharge decisions, and help selection for clinical studies to indicate where risk of therapy-related complications is justified.
Methods
An observational cohort of patients acutely admitted to two London hospitals with COVID-19 and positive SARS-CoV-2 swab results was assessed. Demographic details, clinical data, comorbidities, blood parameters and chest radiograph severity scores were collected from electronic health records. Endpoints assessed were critical care admission and death. A risk score was developed to predict outcomes.
Findings
Analyses included 1,157 patients. Older age, male sex, comorbidities, respiratory rate, oxygenation, radiographic severity, higher neutrophils, higher CRP and lower albumin at presentation predicted critical care admission and mortality. Non-white ethnicity predicted critical care admission but not death. Social deprivation was not predictive of outcome. A risk score was developed incorporating twelve characteristics: age>40, male, non-white ethnicity, oxygen saturations<93%, radiological severity score>3, neutrophil count>8.0 x109/L, CRP>40 mg/L, albumin<34 g/L, creatinine>100 µmol/L, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and chronic lung disease. Risk scores of 4 or higher corresponded to a 28-day cumulative incidence of critical care admission or death of 40.7% (95% CI: 37.1 to 44.4), versus 12.4% (95% CI: 8.2 to 16.7) for scores less than 4.
Interpretation
Our study identified predictors of critical care admission and death in people admitted to hospital with COVID-19. These predictors were incorporated into a risk score that will inform clinical care and stratify patients for clinical trials."

Objectives
To determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in a subset of patients consulting for primarily isolated acute (<7 days) loss of smell and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of olfactory/gustatory dysfunction for COVID-19 diagnosis in the overall population tested for COVID-19 in the same period.
Methods
Prospective multicentric cohort study in four olfactory ENT units and a screening center for COVID-19.
Results
i) Among a subset of 55 patients consulting for primarily loss of smell, we found that 51 (92.7%) had a COVID-19 positive test (median viral load of 28.8 cycle threshold). Loss of smell was mostly total (anosmia), rarely associated with nasal obstruction but associated with a taste disorder in 80%. Olfactory dysfunction occurred suddenly, either as first complaint. The majority of patients (72.9%) partially recovered the sense of smell within 15 days. ii) In a population of 1824 patients tested for COVID-19, the positive predictive value and the specificity of loss of smell and/or taste were 78.5% and 90.3% respectively (sensitivity (40.8%), negative predictive value (63.6%)).
Conclusions
Self-reported loss of smell had a high predictive positive value to identify COVID-19. Making this sign well known publicly could help to adopt isolation measures and inform potential contacts."

In areas of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak worldwide mean air pollutants concentrations vastly exceed the maximum limits. Chronic exposure to air pollutants have been associated with lung ACE-2 over-expression which is known to be the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between air pollutants concentration (PM 2.5 and NO2) and COVID-19 outbreak, in terms of transmission, number of patients, severity of presentation and number of deaths.
Methods
COVID-19 cases, ICU admissions and mortality rate were correlated with severity of air pollution in the Italian regions.
Results
The highest number of COVID-19 cases were recorded in the most polluted regions with patients presenting with more severe forms of the disease requiring ICU admission. In these regions, mortality was two-fold higher than the other regions.
Conclusions
From the data available we propose a “double-hit hypothesis”: chronic exposure to PM 2.5 causes alveolar ACE-2 receptor overexpression. This may increase viral load in patients exposed to pollutants in turn depleting ACE-2 receptors and impairing host defences. High atmospheric NO2 may provide a second hit causing a severe form of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE-2 depleted lungs resulting in a worse outcome."

abstract = "SUMMARY
Neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia worldwide and is associated with high case fatality rates and serious life-long complications among survivors. Twelve serogroups are recognised, of which six (A, B, C, W, X and Y) are responsible for nearly all cases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). The incidence of IMD and responsible serogroups vary widely both geographically and over time. For the first time, effective vaccines against all these serogroups are available or nearing licensure. Over the past two decades, IMD incidence has been declining across most parts of the world through a combination of successful meningococcal immunisation programmes and secular trends. The introduction of meningococcal C conjugate vaccines in the early 2000s was associated with rapid declines in meningococcal C disease, whilst implementation of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine across the African meningitis belt led to near-elimination of meningococcal A disease. Consequently, other serogroups have become more important causes of IMD. In particular, the emergence of a hypervirulent meningococcal group W clone has led many countries to shift from monovalent meningococcal C to quadrivalent ACWY conjugate vaccines in their national immunisation programmes. Additionally, the recent licensure of two protein-based, broad-spectrum meningococcal B vaccines finally provides protection against the most common group responsible for childhood IMD across Europe and Australia. This review describes the global IMD epidemiology across each continent and trends over time, the serogroups responsible for IMD, impact of meningococcal immunisation programmes and future needs to eliminate this devastating disease."

Purpose
To investigate the clinical and imaging characteristics of computed tomography (CT) in novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Materials and methods
A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed.
Results
Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to moderate fever (<39.1 °C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis.
Conclusion
CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved. CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment of NCP."

Results
A total of 28 studies consisting of 7736 HCV-infected patients and 14061 control subjects without liver diseases were included. Compared to controls, circulating vitamin D levels were significantly lessened in HCV-infected patients (mean difference, MD=−14.15, 95% CI: −20.51 to −7.80). Remarkably decreased circulating vitamin D was found in the patients with severe fibrosis (MD=−3.38, 95% CI: −4.51 to −2.25), non-achieving SVR (MD=−2.99, 95%CI: −5.55 to −0.42), and advanced inflammation (MD=−4.68, 95% CI: −8.50 to −0.86).

Among stringently-defined otitis prone children deficiencies in fundamental immune defense mechanisms have been identified that contribute to the propensity of young children to experience recurrent AOM. Dysfunction in innate immune responses that cause an immunopathological impact in the nasopharynx have been discovered including inadequate proinflammatory cytokine response and poor epithelial cell repair. Adaptive immunity defects in B cell function and immunologic memory resulting in low levels of antibody to otopathogen-specific antigens allows repeated infections. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell function and memory defects significantly contribute. The immune profile of an otitis prone child resembles that of a neonate through the first year of life. Immunologic deficits in otitis prone children cause them to be unusually vulnerable to viral upper respiratory infections and respond inadequately to routine pediatric vaccines."

Since its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 has been spread throughout China before becoming a global pandemic. In Beijing, family clusters are the main mode of human-human transmission accounting for 57.6% of the total confirmed cases.
Method
We present the epidemiological and clinical features of the clusters of three large and one small families.
Result
Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly through contact with index case, and a total of 22/24 infections were observed. Among those infected, 20/22 had mild symptoms and only two had moderate to severe clinical manifestations. Children in the families generally showed milder symptoms. The incubation period varied from 2 to 13 days, and the shedding of virus from the upper respiratory tract lasted from 5 to over 30 days. A prolonged period of virus shedding (>30 days) in upper respiratory tract was observed in 6/24 cases.
Conclusion
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly in the form of family clusters. While the infection rate is high within the cluster, the disease manifestations, latent period, and virus shedding period varied greatly. We therefore recommend rigorously testing contacts even during the no-symptom phase and consider whether viral shedding has ceased before stopping isolation measures for an individual."

abstract = "Objectives
We aimed to assess the clinical relevance of the marketed pan-mucorales real-time PCR assay MucorGenius® (Pathonostics) on pulmonary specimens relative to that of in-house PCR assays and conventional mycology for the diagnosis of mucormycosis.
Methods
In total, 319 pulmonary samples from severely immunosuppressed patients at risk for invasive mold disease (IMD) were retrospectively included. Direct examination, mycological culture, and PCR testing were performed using three genus-specific in-house mucorales real-time PCR assays and MucorGenius®PCR. Results from Aspergillus testing, including galactomannan and PCR, were also collected.
Results
The 319 patients were graded according to modified EORTC-MSG criteria as proven/probable mucormycosis (n=6), proven/probable invasive aspergillosis (IA) (n=63), Aspergillus–mucorales co-infections (n=4), possible IMD (n=152), and excluded IMD (n=94). The in-house and MucorGenius®PCR assays were positive for 33 (10.3%) and 27 (8.5%) samples, respectively, whereas culture was positive for only 10 (3.1%). The in-house and MucorGenius®PCR assays showed a sensitivity of 100% (10/10) and 90% (9/10) and a specificity of 95.7% and 97.9%, respectively. Both PCR assays allowed the detection of mucorales DNA in samples from 10 possible cases and six IA, all missed by culture.
Conclusions
MucorGenius® showed good performance, despite missing some low fungal burden. Combining mucorales PCR with EORTC-MSG criteria greatly improved the diagnosis of mucormycosis."

In this study, we evaluated the antiviral effects and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol in patients with the 2019-nCoV disease (COVID-19). Fifty patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were divided into two groups: including lopinavir/ritonavir group (34 cases) and arbidol group (16 cases). Lopinavir/ritonavir group received 400 mg/100mg of Lopinavir/ritonavir, twice a day for a week, while the arbidol group was given 0.2 g arbidol, three times a day. Data from these patients were retrospectively analyzed. The cycle threshold values of open reading frame 1ab and nucleocapsid genes by RT-PCR assay were monitored during antiviral therapy. None of the patients developed severe pneumonia or ARDS. There was no difference in fever duration between the two groups (P=0.61). On day 14 after the admission, no viral load was detected in arbidol group, but the viral load was found in 15(44.1%) patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. Patients in the arbidol group had a shorter duration of positive RNA test compared to those in the lopinavir/ritonavir group (P<0.01). Moreover, no apparent side effects were found in both groups. In conclusion, our data indicate that arbidol monotherapy may be superior to lopinavir/ritonavir in treating COVID-19."

Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Beijing. We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing.
Methods
We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS.
Findings
By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service. Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively. The median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male. 192 (73.3%) patients were residents of Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%). The median incubation period was 6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days. As of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%.
Interpretation
On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19 infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases in Beijing. Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality rate. The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.

We evaluated the effectiveness of IGRA-based isoniazid (INH) treatment with the diagnostic value of quantitative IGRA titer for post-transplant tuberculosis (TB) in kidney transplant (KT) recipients.
Methods
All adult KT recipients were enrolled from January 2014 to December 2017. The development of TB after KT was observed, stratified by quantitative IGRA results as well as by IGRA results with/without INH treatment.
Results
Of 1150 KT recipients, 322 (28%) revealed positive IGRA results (≥0.35 IU/mL) and 12 (1.0%) developed TB. Seven (3.2%) of 217 patients with positive IGRA without INH developed TB, whereas none of 105 patients with positive IGRA with INH developed TB (rate difference −1616 per 100,000 person-years, P = 0.016) and 5 (0.6%) of 828 patients with negative or indeterminate IGRA developed TB (rate difference −1388 per 100,000 person-years, P<0.001). Among the 217 positive IGRA patients without INH, 6 (6.4%) of 94 patients who had positive IGRA titer>2.96 IU/mL developed TB, whereas one (0.8%) of 123 patients who had positive IGRA titer≤2.96 IU/mL developed TB (rate difference 2964 per 100,000 person-years, P = 0.017).
Conclusions
IGRA-based INH treatment with risk stratification by quantitative IGRA results appears to be effective to prevent the development of TB in KT recipients."

Objectives
The intestinal microbiota develops in early infancy and is essential for health status early and later in life. In this review we focus on the effect of prenatal and intrapartum maternally administered antibiotics on the infant intestinal microbiota.
Methods
A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and EMBASE. All studies reporting effect on diversity or microbiota profiles were included.
Results
A total of 4.030 records were encountered. A total of 24 articles were included in the final analysis. Infants from mothers exposed to antibiotics during delivery showed a decreased microbial diversity compared to non-exposed infants. The microbiota of infants exposed to antibiotics was characterised by a decreased abundance of Bacteriodetes and Bifidobacteria, with a concurrent increase of Proteobacteria. These effects were most pronounced in term vaginally born infants.
Conclusion
Maternal administration of antibiotics seems to have profound effects on the infant gut microbiota colonisation. Interpretation of microbiota aberrations in specific populations, such as preterm and caesarean born infants, is complicated by multiple confounding factors and by lack of high quality studies and high heterogeneity in study design. Further research is needed to investigate the potential short- and long-term clinical consequences of these microbial alterations."

Objectives
To identify new potential host biomarkers in blood to discriminate between active TB patients, uninfected (NoTBI) and latently infected contacts (LTBI).
Methods
A blood cell count was performed to study parent leukocyte populations. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and a multi-parameter flow cytometry assay was conducted to study the distribution of basal and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-stimulated lymphocytes. Differences between groups and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were investigated to assess the diagnostic accuracy.
Results
Active TB patients presented higher Monocyte-to-lymphocyte and Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios than LTBI and NoTBI contacts (p<0.0001; AUC>0.8). Lymphocyte subsets with differences (p >0.05; AUC >0.7) between active TB and both contact groups include the basal distribution of Th1/Th2 ratio, Th1-Th17, CD4+ Central Memory (TCM) or MAIT cells. Expression of CD154 is increased in Mtb-activated CD4+ TCM and Effector Memory T cells in active TB and LTBI compared to NoTBI. In CD4+ T cells, expression of CD154 showed a higher accuracy than IFNγ to discriminate Mtb-specific activation.
Conclusions
We identified different cell subsets with potential use in tuberculosis diagnosis. Among them, distribution of CD4 TCM cells and their expression of CD154 after Mtb-activation are the most promising candidates."

To use mathematical models to predict the epidemiological impact of lifting the lockdown in London, UK, and alternative strategies to help inform policy in the UK.
Methods
A mathematical model for the transmission of SARS-CoV2 in London. The model was parametrised using data on notified cases, deaths, contacts, and mobility to analyse the epidemic in the UK capital. We investigated the impact of multiple non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and combinations of these measures on future incidence of COVID-19.
Results
Immediate action at the early stages of an epidemic in the affected districts would have tackled spread. While an extended lockdown is highly effective, other measures such as shielding older populations, universal testing and facemasks can all potentially contribute to a reduction of infections and deaths. However, based on current evidence it seems unlikely they will be as effective as continued lockdown. In order to achieve elimination and lift lockdown within 5 months, the best strategy seems to be a combination of weekly universal testing, contact tracing and use of facemasks, with concurrent lockdown. This approach could potentially reduce deaths by 48% compared with continued lockdown alone.
Conclusions
A combination of NPIs such as universal testing, contact tracing and mask use while under lockdown would be associated with least deaths and infections. This approach would require high uptake and sustained local effort but it is potentially feasible as may lead to elimination in a relatively short time scale."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Colonisation with Streptococcus pneumoniae can lead to invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia. Pneumococcal acquisition and prevalence of colonisation are high in children. In older adults, a population susceptible to pneumococcal disease, colonisation prevalence is reported to be lower, but studies are heterogeneous.
Methods
This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence of, and risk factors for, pneumococcal colonisation in adults ≥ 60 years of age (PROSPERO #42016036891). We identified peer-reviewed studies reporting the prevalence of S. pneumoniae colonisation using MEDLINE and EMBASE (until April 2016), excluding studies of acute disease. Participant-level data on risk factors were sought from each study.
Findings
Of 2202 studies screened, 29 were analysable: 18 provided participant-level data (representing 6290 participants). Prevalence of detected pneumococcal colonisation was 0–39% by conventional culture methods and 3–23% by molecular methods. In a multivariate analysis, colonisation was higher in persons from nursing facilities compared with the community (odds ratio (OR) 2•30, 95% CI 1•26–4•21 and OR 7•72, 95% CI 1•15–51•85, respectively), in those who were currently smoking (OR 1•69, 95% CI 1•12–2•53) or those who had regular contact with children (OR 1•93, 95%CI 1•27–2•93). Persons living in urban areas had significantly lower carriage prevalence (OR 0•43, 95%CI 0•27–0•70).
Interpretation
Overall prevalence of pneumococcal colonisation in older adults was higher than expected but varied by risk factors. Future studies should further explore risk factors for colonisation, to highlight targets for focussed intervention such as pneumococcal vaccination of high-risk groups.

No funding was required."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Interferons (IFNs) play multifunctional roles in host defense against infectious diseases by inducing IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, little is known about how ISGs regulate host immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, the major cause of tuberculosis (TB).
Methods
We thus profiled the potential effects and mechanisms of eight Mtb-induced ISGs on Mtb infection by RNA interference in human macrophages (Mφs) derived from peripheral blood monocytes (hMDMs) and THP-1 cell line derived Mφs (THP-1-Mφs).
Results
MxA silencing significantly decreased intracellular Mtb infection in Mφs. Mechanistically, MxA silencing promoted inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α production, and induced NF-κB p65 activation. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB p65 activation or gene silencing of NF-κB p65 blocked the increased production of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α and restored Mtb infection by MxA silencing. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of TAK1 and IKKα/β blocked NF-κB p65 activation and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by MxA silencing. Isoniazid (INH) treatment and MxA silencing could promote TAK1-IKKα/β-NF-κB signaling pathway activation and combat Mtb infection independently.
Conclusions
Our results reveal a novel role of MxA in regulating TAK1-IKKα/β-NF-κB signaling activation and production of antimicrobial inflammatory cytokines upon Mtb infection, providing a potential target for clinical treatment of TB."

Methods
The data of COVID-19 patients until March 20, 2020 were retrieved from four databases. We statistically analyzed the risk factors of critical/mortal and non-critical COVID-19 patients with meta-analysis.
Results
Thirteen studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 3027 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male, older than 65, and smoking were risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19 (male: OR = 1.76, 95% CI (1.41, 2.18), P < 0.00001; age over 65 years old: OR =6.06, 95% CI(3.98, 9.22), P < 0.00001; current smoking: OR =2.51, 95% CI(1.39, 3.32), P = 0.0006).

Conclusion
Male, aged over 65, smoking patients might face a greater risk of developing into the critical or mortal condition and the comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory diseases could also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. Clinical manifestation such as fever, shortness of breath or dyspnea and laboratory examination such as WBC, AST, Cr, PCT, LDH, hs-cTnI and D-dimer could imply the progression of COVID-19."

In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (age≥18years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without Invasive ventilation, diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020. Patients, diagnosed after Jan 17, 2020, were given oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group for 5–21 days. The primary endpoint was a negative conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis(day7, day14), and assessed whether the pneumonia was progressing or improving by chest CT (day7).
Results
We analyzed 16 patients who received oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and 17 who oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group, and both initiated after diagnosis. Baseline clinical, laboratory, and chest CT characteristics were similar between groups. The SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected for 12(75%) of 16 patients’ nasopharyngeal specimens in the combination group after seven days, compared with 6 (35%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p < 0·05). After 14 days, 15 (94%) of 16 and 9 (52·9%) of 17, respectively, SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected (p < 0·05). The chest CT scans were improving for 11(69%) of 16 patients in the combination group after seven days, compared with 5(29%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p < 0·05).
Conclusion
In patients with COVID-19, the apparent favorable clinical response with arbidol and LPV/r supports further LPV/r only."

Objective
To better inform efforts to treat and control the current outbreak with a comprehensive characterization of COVID-19.
Methods
We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CNKI (Chinese Database) for studies published as of March 2, 2020, and we searched references of identified articles. Studies were reviewed for methodological quality. A random-effects model was used to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's test.
Results
43 studies involving 3600 patients were included. Among COVID-19 patients, fever (83.3% [95% CI 78.4–87.7]), cough (60.3% [54.2–66.3]), and fatigue (38.0% [29.8–46.5]) were the most common clinical symptoms. The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated C-reactive protein (68.6% [58.2–78.2]), decreased lymphocyte count (57.4% [44.8–69.5]) and increased lactate dehydrogenase (51.6% [31.4–71.6]). Ground-glass opacities (80.0% [67.3–90.4]) and bilateral pneumonia (73.2% [63.4–82.1]) were the most frequently reported findings on computed tomography. The overall estimated proportion of severe cases and case-fatality rate (CFR) was 25.6% (17.4–34.9) and 3.6% (1.1–7.2), respectively. CFR and laboratory abnormalities were higher in severe cases, patients from Wuhan, and older patients, but CFR did not differ by gender.
Conclusions
The majority of COVID-19 cases are symptomatic with a moderate CFR. Patients living in Wuhan, older patients, and those with medical comorbidities tend to have more severe clinical symptoms and higher CFR."

Objectives
To assess, whether S. aureus nasal colonization is a risk factor for infections in patients with durable ventricular assist device (VAD).
Methods
Prospective, single-centre, cohort study (i) ascertaining S. aureus nasal colonization status of patients admitted for VAD-implantation and detecting time to first episode of VAD-specific or -related infection according to International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria during follow-up and (ii) comparing whole genomes of S. aureus from baseline colonization and later infection.
Results
Among 49 patients (17 colonized, 32 non-colonized), S. aureus VAD-infections occurred with long latency after implantation (inter quartile range 76–217 days), but occurred earlier (log-rank test P = 0.006) and were more common (9/17, 52.9% vs. 4/32, 12.5%, P = 0.005; incidence rates 2.81 vs. 0.61/1000 patient days; incidence rate ratio 4.65, 95% confidence interval 1.30–20.65, P = 0.009) among those nasally colonized with S. aureus before implantation. We found a similar but less pronounced effect of colonization status when analysing its effect on all types of VAD-infections (10/17, 58.8% vs. 7/32, 21.9%, P = 0.01). These findings remained robust when adjusting for potential confounders and restricting the analysis to ‘proven infections’. 75% (6/8) of paired S. aureus samples from colonization and VAD-infection showed concordant whole genomes.
Conclusions
In patients with durable VAD, S. aureus nasal colonization is a source of endogenous infection, often occurring months after device-implantation and affecting mostly the driveline. Hygiene measures interrupting the endogenous route of transmission in VAD-patients colonized with S. aureus long-term may about half the burden of infections and require clinical scrutiny."

abstract = "Importance
An ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has exhibited significant threats around the world. We found a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subsets and an increase of inflammatory cytokines of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in clinical practice.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective, single-center observational study of in-hospital adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Hubei Provincial Hospital of traditional Chinese and Western medicine (Wuhan, China) by Mar 1, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory information, especially T lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were reported. For patients who died or discharge from hospital, the associations of T lymphocyte subsets on admission were evaluated by univariate logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), warning values to predict in-hospital death were assessed by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves.
Results
A total of 187 patients were enrolled in our study from Dec 26, 2019 to Mar 1, 2020, of whom 145 were survivors (discharge = 117) or non-survivors (in-hospital death ==28). All patients exhibited a significant drop of T lymphocyte subsets counts with remarkably increasing concentrations of SAA, CRP, IL-6, and IL-10 compared to normal values. The median concentrations of SAA and CRP in critically-ill patients were nearly 4- and 10-fold than those of mild-ill patients, respectively. As the severity of COVID-19 getting worse, the counts of T lymphocyte drop lower.28 patients died in hospital, the median lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell and B-cell were significantly lower than other patients. Lower counts (/uL) of T lymphocyte subsets lymphocyte (<500), CD3+T-cell (<200), CD4+ T-cell (<100), CD8+ T-cell (<100) and B-cell (<50) were associated with higher risks of in-hospital death of CIVID-19. The warning values to predict in-hospital death of lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell, and B-cell were 559, 235, 104, 85 and 82, respectively.
Conclusion
We find a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subset is positively correlated with in-hospital death and severity of illness. The decreased levels of T lymphocyte subsets reported in our study were similar with SARS but not common among other virus infection, which may be possible biomarkers for early diagnosis of COVID-19. Our findings may shed light on early warning of high risks of mortality and help early intervention and treatment of COVID-19."

Objectives
To summarise the evidence on the detection pattern and viral load of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of an infection (including any asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic phase), and the duration of infectivity.
Methods
A systematic literature search was undertaken in PubMed, Europe PubMed Central and EMBASE from 30 December 2019 to 12 May 2020.
Results
We identified 113 studies conducted in 17 countries. The evidence from upper respiratory tract samples suggests that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaks around symptom onset or a few days thereafter, and becomes undetectable about two weeks after symptom onset; however, viral loads from sputum samples may be higher, peak later and persist for longer. There is evidence of prolonged virus detection in stool samples, with unclear clinical significance. No study was found that definitively measured the duration of infectivity; however, patients may not be infectious for the entire duration of virus detection, as the presence of viral ribonucleic acid may not represent transmissible live virus.
Conclusion
There is a relatively consistent trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 viral load over the course of COVID-19 from respiratory tract samples, however the duration of infectivity remains uncertain."

Beginning in June 2017, numerous dengue virus (DENV) infections occurred in the Jining City of Shandong Province, formerly a dengue-free region in East China. We sought to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of this outbreak.
Methods
We reviewed the clinical records and epidemiological data regarding a case series of patients diagnosed with DENV in Jining City, from June 30 to September 14, 2017. Diagnosis was confirmed by molecular method, culture, or rapid diagnostic tests. Sequencing of the DENV envelope gene or the whole viral genome was performed for 11 patients. Additionally, neutralizing antibodies against DENV was measured among patients and residents from their same villages.
Results
Data from 150 patients were evaluated in this outbreak. None were diagnosed with dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. The patients’ ages ranged between 2–88 years (median 51 years, [IQR=37.5–64.3]), and 100 (66.7%) were female. Epidemiological analyses implicated a man who had visited Saudi Arabia as the likely source of the outbreak. Phylogenetic studies identified DENV serotype 1. Most of the patients demonstrated increases of neutralizing antibody titers one year after infection compared with titers three months after infection. The residents living in dengue-affected villages had a significant higher seroprevalence of 21.2% (95%CI 16.9-25.5) than residents (3.2%, 95%CI-0.36-6.7) living in a non-dengue-affected village.
Conclusions
This report documents the first dengue outbreak in Shandong Province, China, in more than 60 years. It underscores the need for medical providers to record patients’ travel histories and to consider dengue in their differential diagnoses."

These HCWs were immediately under quarantine for 14 days as soon as they were identified as close contacts. The nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected on the first and 14th day of the quarantine, while the serum samples were obtained on the 14th day of the quarantine. With the assay of enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and microneutralization assay, 17.14% (18/105) of HCWs were seropositive, while their swab samples were found to be SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative. Risk analysis revealed that wearing face mask could reduce the infection risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.127, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.017, 0.968), while when exposed to COVID-19 patients, doctors might have higher risk of seroconversion (OR, 346.837, 95% CI 8.924, 13479.434), compared with HCWs exposed to colleagues as well as nurses and general service assistants who exposed to patients.

Prompted by international targets for elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV), we set out to characterise individuals with HBV monoinfection vs. those coinfected with HBV/HIV, to evaluate the impact of therapy and to guide improvements in clinical care.
Methods
We report observational data from a real world cross-sectional cohort of 115 adults with chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB), at a university hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. HIV coinfection was present in 39 (34%) subjects. We recorded cross-sectional demographic, clinical and laboratory data.
Results
Compared to those with HIV coinfection, HBV monoinfected adults were less likely to be HBeAg-positive (p=0.01), less likely to have had assessment with elastography (p<0.0001), and less likely to be on antiviral treatment (p<0.0001); they were more likely to have detectable HBV viraemia (p=0.04), and more likely to have features of liver disease including moderate/severe thrombocytopaenia (p=0.007), elevated bilirubin (p=0.004), and elevated APRI score (p=0.02). Three cases of hepatocellular carcinoma all arose in HBV monoinfection.

Purpose
Aimed to characterize the CT imaging and clinical course of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia.
Methods
Asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid testing in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively enrolled. The characteristics of CT imaging and clinical feature were collected and analyzed.
Results
58 asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between Jan 1, 2020 and Feb 23, 2020 were enrolled. All patients had history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. On admission, patients had no symptoms and laboratory findings were normal. The predominant feature of CT findings in this cohort was ground glass opacity (GGO) (55, 94.8%) with peripheral (44, 75.9%) distribution, unilateral location (34, 58.6%) and mostly involving one or two lobes (38, 65.5%), often accompanied by characteristic signs. After short-term follow-up, 16 patients (27.6%) presented symptoms with lower lymphocyte count and higher CRP, mainly including fever, cough and fatigue. The evolution of lesions on CT imaging were observed in 10 patients (17.2%). The average days of hospitalization was19.80±10.82 days, and was significantly longer in progression patients (28.60±7.55 day).
Conclusion
CT imaging of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia has definite characteristics. Since asymptomatic infections as “covert transmitter”, and some patients can progress rapidly in the short term. It is essential to pay attention to the surveillance of asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. CT scan has great value in screening and detecting patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in the highly suspicious, asymptomatic cases with negative nucleic acid testing."

Face mask usage by the healthy population in the community to reduce risk of transmission of respiratory viruses remains controversial. We assessed the effect of community-wide mask usage to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
Methods
Patients presenting with respiratory symptoms at outpatient clinics or hospital wards were screened for COVID-19 per protocol. Epidemiological analysis was performed for confirmed cases, especially persons acquiring COVID-19 during mask-off and mask-on settings. The incidence of COVID-19 per million population in HKSAR with community-wide masking was compared to that of non-mask-wearing countries which are comparable with HKSAR in terms of population density, healthcare system, BCG vaccination and social distancing measures but not community-wide masking. Compliance of face mask usage in the HKSAR community was monitored.
Findings
Within first 100 days (31 December 2019 to 8 April 2020), 961 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed in HKSAR. The COVID-19 incidence in HKSAR (129.0 per million population) was significantly lower (p<0.001) than that of Spain (2983.2), Italy (2250.8), Germany (1241.5), France (1151.6), U.S. (1102.8), U.K. (831.5), Singapore (259.8), and South Korea (200.5). The compliance of face mask usage by HKSAR general public was 96.6% (range: 95.7% to 97.2%). We observed 11 COVID-19 clusters in recreational ‘mask-off’ settings compared to only 3 in workplace ‘mask-on’ settings (p = 0.036 by Chi square test of goodness-of-fit).
Conclusion
Community-wide mask wearing may contribute to the control of COVID-19 by reducing the amount of emission of infected saliva and respiratory droplets from individuals with subclinical or mild COVID-19."

Objectives
Guidelines recommend routine testing for latent TB infection (LTBI) in people living with HIV. However there are few cost-effectiveness studies to justify this in contemporary high resource, low TB/HIV incidence settings. We sought to assess the uptake, yield and cost-effectiveness of testing for latent and active TB.
Methods
Adults attending an ambulatory HIV clinic in London, UK were prospectively recruited by stratified selection and tested for TB infection using symptom questionnaires, chest radiograph (CXR), tuberculin skin test (TST), T-Spot.TB and induced sputum. From this, 30 testing strategies were compared in a cost-effectiveness model including probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation.
Results
219 subjects were assessed; 95% were using antiretroviral therapy (ART). Smear negative, culture positive TB was present in 0.9% asymptomatic subjects, LTBI in 9%. Only strategies testing those from subSaharan Africa with a TST or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) with or without CXR, or testing those from countries with a TB incidence of >40/100,000 with TST alone were cost-effective using a £30,000/QALY threshold.
Conclusions
Cost-effectiveness analysis in an adult HIV cohort with high ART usage suggests there is limited benefit beyond routine testing for latent TB in people from high and possibly medium TB incidence settings."

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection causes a spectrum of respiratory tract disease, and may be a significant pathogen in the context of immunocompromise. Here, we report direct-from-sample metagenomic sequencing of HMPV using Oxford Nanopore Technology.
Methods
We applied this sequencing approach to 25 respiratory samples that had been submitted to a clinical diagnostic laboratory in a UK teaching hospital. These samples represented 13 patients under the care of a haematology unit over a 20-day period in Spring 2019 (two sampled twice), and ten other patients elsewhere in the hospital between 2017–2019.
Results
We generated HMPV reads from 20/25 samples (sensitivity 80% compared to routine diagnostic testing) and retrieved complete HMPV genomes from 15/20 of these. Consensus sequences from Nanopore data were identical to those generated by Illumina, and represented HMPV genomes from two distinct sublineages, A2b and B2. Sequences from ten haematology patients formed a unique genetic group in the A2b sublineage, not previously reported in the UK. Among these, eight HMPV genomes formed a cluster (differing by ≤3 SNPs), likely to reflect nosocomial transmission, while two others were more distantly related and may represent independent introductions to the haematology unit.
Conclusion
Nanopore metagenomic sequencing can be used to diagnose HMPV infection, although more work is required to optimise sensitivity. Improvements in the use of metagenomic sequencing, particularly for respiratory viruses, could contribute to antimicrobial stewardship. Generation of full genome sequences can be used to support or rule out nosocomial transmission, and contribute to improving infection prevention and control practices."

Objectives
Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population. However, limited data was available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reactivation. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.
Methods
Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb. 10, 2020.
Results
All 55 patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%) patients who discharged from hospital presented with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. One of the 5 patients had progressive lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56 × 109 cells per L) and progressive neutrophilia (from 4.5 to 18.28 × 109 cells per L). All 5 reactivated patients presented normal aminotransferase levels. Throat swab samples from the 5 reactivated patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, indicating all positive for the virus.
Conclusions
Findings from this small group of cases suggested that there was currently evidence for reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and there might be no specific clinical characteristics to distinguish them."

The study was aimed at investigating the characteristics of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and serum cytokines in children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia.
Methods
Children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia or with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia were included. Data including lymphocyte subsets and serum cytokines were collected and analyzed.
Results
56 patients were included in the study, 40 children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia and 16 children with RSV pneumonia. Compared with children with RSV pneumonia, patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia had higher count of CD3+8+ lymphocyte, higher percentages of CD3+, CD3+8+ lymphocytes and a lower percentage of CD19+ lymphocyte. The serum IL-10 level was significantly higher in children with RSV pneumonia. One 2019-nCoV pneumonia child who was with an obvious increase of IL-10 developed severe pneumonia.
Conclusions
Immune response played a very important role in the development of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The effective CD8+ T cell response might influence the severity of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The adaptable change in IL-10 level might contribute to the relatively mild pneumonia symptoms in children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia and bacterial co-infection might be a risk factor of severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia."

Methods
We collected the required data from “Public Health Emergency Reporting Management Information System”, epidemiological questionnaires for the cases, and laboratories.
Results
The cluster involved four generations, each of which was transmitted to the next generation during the incubation period. The time was 2–7 days, 6–7days, 3–8 days and 9 days prior to onset. As of March 11, the fourth-generation cases had no symptoms. Combined with the epidemiological data, we inferred that the source of the cluster was caused by the first-generation, who contacted with more than ten Wuhan people during the annual meeting from January 15 to 16. Two cases in this cluster were tested positive again during isolation and observation after discharge.
Conclusions
We determined incubation period was infectious, and confirmed that it was contagious 9 days before the onset. The patients who were discharged might need to be observed for a period of time. This study was useful for the practical work, such as in the investigation of close contacts."

The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) has globally increased and spread to the community. No clinical score is available to select carriers in whom these organisms can be empirically targeted at ICU admission.
Methods
We prospectively assessed between 2009 and 2017 the prevalence of ESBL-PE infection in carriers at ICU admission. A logistic regression was used to determine independent risk factors associated with ESBL-PE infection, and to build a clinical risk score.
Results
Of the 8,061 admissions over the study 7-year period, 745 (9%) patients were ESBL-PE carriers at admission, of whom 395 had infections at ICU admission including 59 (15%) who had culture-proven ESBL-PE related infection. By multivariable analysis, age >60 years, cirrhosis, being on broad-spectrum antibiotics within the past three months, urinary or intra-abdominal source of infection, and the absence of chronic pulmonary disease, were the five independent factors associated with ESBL-PE infection in carriers. A clinical risk score ranging from 0 to 7 was built based on these variables, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.82 (95% CI 0.78–0.86); p <0.001. The prevalence of ESBL-PE infection for clinical risk scores of 0–1, 2–3, 4–5, or 6–7 was 0%, 4%, 26%, and 49%, respectively. The negative predictive value when Mondor ESBL risk score is <4 was 97%.
Conclusion
ESBL-PE related infection was not common in carriers at ICU admission. A clinical risk score may spare ESBL-PE carriers with lower risk of ESBL-PE infection at ICU admission unnecessary empiric carbapenem therapy."

Objectives
In France, cervical cancer screening is based on human papillomavirus (HPV) testing on cervical samples (women aged 30-65) and cytological examination of Pap smears (25-29), but screening coverage is unsatisfactory. The CapU3 study aimed to propose urinary HPV testing on 13,535 women aged 35 to 65 who had not had a Pap smear since 2010.
Methods
High-risk HPV (HR-HPV) detection was performed using a real-time PCR (Anyplex II HPV 28 Detection, Seegene®). Women with HR-HPV positive results were encouraged to have a cervical smear as soon as possible to detect the presence of cervical lesions.
Results
The participation rate was 15.4%. Out of the 1,915 analyzed specimens, 1,711 and 190 were negative and positive, respectively, for at least 1 HR-HPV genotype. HR-HPV genotypes other than HPV-16 or HPV-18 were mostly detected as HPV-53 (23.7%) and HPV-68 (14.2%). A satisfactory gynecological follow-up was observed for HPV-positive women (92.1%). 23 abnormal smears were observed and eight high-grade cytological lesions after colposcopy and biopsy were diagnosed.
Conclusions
As home HPV urinary testing is non-invasive and does not require medical attention, this method may be an alternative for women who are reluctant to have a Pap smear and thus extend screening coverage."

abstract = "Background/aim
From 2007 through 2010, the Netherlands experienced the largest recorded Q fever outbreak to date. People living closer to Coxiella burnetii infected goat farms were at increased risk for acute Q fever. Time spent outdoors near infected farms may have contributed to exposure to C. burnetii. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate whether hours/week spent outdoors, in the vicinity of previously C. burnetii infected goat farms, was associated with presence of antibodies against C. burnetii in residents of a rural area in the Netherlands.
Methods
Between 2014-2015, we collected C. burnetii antibody serology and self-reported data about habitual hours/week spent outdoors near the home from 2494 adults. From a subgroup we collected 941 GPS tracks, enabling analyses of active mobility in the outbreak region. Participants were categorised as exposed if they spent time within specified distances (500m, 1000m, 2000m, or 4000m) of C. burnetii infected goat farms. We evaluated whether time spent near these farms was associated with positive C. burnetii serology using spline analyses and logistic regression.
Results
People that spent more hours/week outdoors near infected farms had a significantly increased risk for positive C. burnetii serology (time spent within 2000m of a C. burnetii abortion-wave positive farm, OR 3.6 (1.2-10.6)), compared to people spending less hours/week outdoors.
Conclusions
Outdoor exposure contributed to the risk of becoming C. burnetii serology positive. These associations were stronger if people spent more time near C. burnetii infected farms. Outdoor exposure should, if feasible, be included in outbreak investigations."

To better characterize the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolic profile of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) cases using a South African paediatric cohort.
Methods
1H-NMR metabolomics was used to analyse the CSF of a South African paediatric cohort. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to compare a homogeneous control group with a well-defined TBM group.
Results
Twenty metabolites were identified to discriminate TBM cases from controls. As expected, reduced glucose and elevated lactate were the dominating discriminators. A closer investigation of the CSF metabolic profile yielded 18 metabolites of statistical significance. Ten metabolites (acetate, alanine, choline, citrate, creatinine, isoleucine, lysine, myo-inositol, pyruvate and valine) overlapped with two other prior investigations. Eight metabolites (2-hydroxybutyrate, carnitine, creatine, creatine phosphate, glutamate, glutamine, guanidinoacetate and proline) were unique to our paediatric TBM cohort.
Conclusions
Through strict exclusion criteria, quality control checks and data filtering, eight unique CSF metabolites associated with TBM were identified for the first time and linked to: uncontrolled glucose metabolism, upregulated proline and creatine metabolism, detoxification and disrupted glutamate–glutamine cycle in the TBM samples. Associated with oxidative stress and chronic neuroinflammation, our findings collectively imply destabilization, and hence increased permeability, of the blood–brain barrier in the TBM cases."

The modified T-SPOT.TB assay was performed in 499 participants (243 ATB and 256 LTBI) and another 322 participants (162 ATB and 160 LTBI) who were diagnosed in Qiaokou (training) and Caidian (validation) cohort respectively.
Results
The mean spot sizes (MSS) of early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) spot-forming cells (SFC) of T-SPOT.TB assay in ATB patients was significantly higher than that in LTBI individuals. 1.0 × 105 was the optimal number of cells added to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) well for obtaining more accurate TB-specific antigen to phytohaemagglutinin (TBAg/PHA) ratio. The area under the curve of the diagnostic model by combination of ESAT-6 SFC MSS and modified TBAg/PHA ratio in distinguishing ATB from LTBI was 0.959 in training cohort, with a sensitivity of 90.12% and a specificity of 91.02% when a cutoff value of 0.46 was used. This diagnostic model showed similar performance in the validation cohort. The area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.962, 93.21%, and 90.00%, respectively. Further flow cytometry analysis showed that ESAT-6 stimulation induced a significantly higher mean fluorescence intensity of IFN-γ+ cells in lymphocytes compared with culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10) stimulation. In contrast, CFP-10 stimulation induced a significantly higher percentage of IFN-γ+ cells in lymphocytes compared with ESAT-6 stimulation.
Conclusions
The combination of the MSS of ESAT-6 SFC and the modified TBAg/PHA ratio of T-SPOT.TB assay showed great value in discriminating ATB from LTBI."

Background
2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic. Under such circumstance pregnant women are also affected significantly.
Objective
This study aims to observe the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women who have been confirmed with COVID-19.
Methods
The research objects were 55 cases of suspected COVID-19 pregnant women who gave a birth from Jan 20th 2020 to Mar 5th 2020 in our hospital-a big birth center delivering about 30,000 babies in the last 3 years. These cases were subjected to pulmonary CT scan and routine blood test, manifested symptoms of fever, cough, chest tightness or gastrointestinal symptoms. They were admitted to an isolated suite, with clinical features and newborn babies being carefully observed. Among the 55 cases, 13 patients were assigned into the confirmed COVID-19 group for being tested positive sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) via maternal throat swab test, and the other 42 patients were assigned into the control group for being ruled out COVID-19 pneumonia based on new coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control program(the 7th edition).
Results
There were 2 fever patients during the prenatal period and 8 fever patients during the postpartum period in the confirmed COVID-19 group. In contrast, there were 11 prenatal fever patients and 20 postpartum fever patients in the control group (p>0.05). Among 55 cases, only 2 case had cough in the confirmed group. The imaging of pulmonary CT scan showed ground- glass opacity (46.2%, 6/13), patch-like shadows(38.5%, 5/13), fiber shadow(23.1%, 3/13), pleural effusion (38.5%, 5/13)and pleural thickening(7.7%, 1/13), and there was no statistical difference between the confirmed COVID-19 group and the control group (p>0.05). During the prenatal and postpartum period, there was no difference in the count of WBC, Neutrophils and Lymphocyte, the radio of Neutrophils and Lymphocyte and the level of CRP between the confirmed COVID-19 group and the control group(p<0.05). 20 babies (from confirmed mother and from normal mother) were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 examination by throat swab samples in 24 h after birth and no case was tested positive.
Conclusion
The clinical symptoms and laboratory indicators are not obvious for asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 pregnant women. Pulmonary CT scan plus blood routine examination are more suitable for finding pregnancy women with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection, and can be used screening COVID-19 pregnant women in the outbreak area of COVID-19 infection."

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The host-directed therapy is a promising strategy for TB treatment that synergize with anti-TB treatment drugs. In this study, we found that the anti-chronic lymphocytic leukemia drug, ibrutinib, inhibited the growth of intracellular Mtb in human macrophages. Mechanisms studies showed that ibrutinib treatment significantly decreased p62 and increased LC3b proteins in Mtb infected macrophages. In addition, ibrutinib increased LC3b colocalization with intracellular Mtb and auto-lysosome fusion. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by using siRNA targeting ATG7 abolished the effect of ibrutinib-mediated suppression of intracellular Mtb. Next, we found that ibrutinib induced autophagy was through inhibition of BTK/Akt/mTOR pathway. Finally, we confirmed that ibrutinib treatment significantly reduced Mtb load in mediastinal node and spleen of Mtb infected mice. In conclusion, our data suggest that ibrutinib is a potential host-directed therapy candidate against TB."

Several studies have described the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19), indicating severe patients tended to have higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Whether baseline NLR could be an independent predictor of in-hospital death in Chinese COVID-19 patients remains to be investigated.
Methods
A cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to February 29 was retrospectively analyzed. The baseline data of laboratory examinations, including NLR, were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were developed to assess the independent relationship between the baseline NLR and in-hospital all-cause death. A sensitivity analysis was performed by converting NLR from a continuous variable to a categorical variable according to tertile. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted as well.
Results
245 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analyses, and the in-hospital mortality was 13.47%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that there was 8% higher risk of in-hospital mortality for each unit increase in NLR (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.08; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01 to 1.14; P = 0.0147). Compared with patients in the lowest tertile, the NLR of patients in the highest tertile had a 15.04-fold higher risk of death (OR = 16.04; 95% CI, 1.14 to 224.95; P = 0.0395) after adjustment for potential confounders. Notably, the fully adjusted OR for mortality was 1.10 in males for each unit increase of NLR (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.19; P = 0.016).
Conclusions
NLR is an independent risk factor of the in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients especially for male. Assessment of NLR may help identify high risk individuals with COVID-19."

Background and rationale
Some studies of hospitalized patients suggested that the risk of death and/or severe illness due to COVID-19 is not associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers (ARBs). Nevertheless, some controversy still exists and there is limited information of the ACEIs/ARBs effect size on COVID-19 prognosis.
Aim and Methods
We aimed to measure the effect of ACEIs and/or ARBs on COVID-19 severe clinical illness by a meta-analysis. Literature search included all studies published since the COVID-19 outbreak began (December 2019) until May 9, 2020. We analyzed information from studies that included tested COVID-19 patients with arterial hypertension as comorbidity prior to hospital admission and history of taking ACEIs, ARBs, or ACEIs/ARBs.
Results
We included 16 studies that involved 24,676 COVID-19 patients, and we compared patients with critical (n = 4134) vs. non-critical (n = 20,542) outcomes. The overall assessment by estimating random effects shows that the use of ACEIs/ARBs is not associated with higher risk of in-hospital-death and/or severe illness among hypertensive patients with COVID-19 infection. On the contrary, effect estimate shows an overall protective effect of RAAS inhibitors/blockers (ACEIs, ARBs, and/or ACEIs/ARBs) with ∼ 23 % reduced risk of death and/or critical disease (OR: 0.768, 95%CI: 0.651-0.907, p=0.0018). The use of ACEIs (OR:0.652, 95%CI:0.478-0.891, p=0.0072) but not ACEIs/ARBs (OR:0.867, 95%CI:0.638-1.179, p =NS) or ARBs alone (OR:0.810, 95%CI:0.629-1.044, p=NS) may explain the overall protection displayed by RAAS intervention combined.
Conclusion
RAAS inhibitors might be associated with better COVID-19 prognosis."

Findings during the 2009 pandemic suggest severe maternal infection with pandemic influenza had adverse perinatal health consequences. Limited data exist evaluating the perinatal health effects of severe seasonal influenza and non-influenza infections during pregnancy.
Methods
A retrospective cohort of pregnant women from Australia, Canada, Israel, and the United States was established using birth records to identify pregnancies and birth outcomes and hospital and laboratory testing records to identify influenza and non-influenza associated acute respiratory or febrile illness (ARFI) hospitalizations. ARFI hospitalized women were matched to non-hospitalized women (1:4) by country and season of conception. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate the relative risk (aRR) of preterm birth (PTB), small-for-gestational-age (SGA), and low birthweight (LBW) birth, adjusting for pre-existing medical conditions, maternal age, and parity.
Results
950 pregnant women hospitalized with an ARFI were matched with 3,800 non-hospitalized pregnant women. Compared to non-hospitalized women, risk of PTB was greater among women hospitalized with influenza-associated ARFI (aRR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.15–2.15) and non-influenza ARFI (aRR: 2.78; 95% CI: 2.12–3.65). Similar results were observed for LBW; there were no associations with SGA birth.
Conclusions
ARFI hospitalization during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of PTB and LBW."

Objectives
Polyomavirus (PyV) infections have been associated with different diseases. BK (BKPyV), JC (JCPyV) and simian virus 40 (SV40) are the three main PyVs whose primary infection occurs early in life. Their vertical transmission was investigated in this study.
Methods
PyV sequences were analyzed by the digital droplet PCR in blood, serum, placenta, amniotic fluid, vaginal smear from two independent cohorts of pregnant females and umbilical cord blood (UCB) samples. IgG antibodies against the three PyVs were investigated by indirect E.L.I.S.As with viral mimotopes.
Results
DNAs from blood, vaginal smear and placenta tested BKPyV-, JCPyV- and SV40-positive with a distinct prevalence, while amniotic fluids were all PyVs-negative. A prevalence of 3%, 7%, and 3% for BKPyV, JCPyV and SV40 DNA sequences, respectively, was obtained in UCBs. Serum IgG antibodies from pregnant females reached an overall prevalence of 62%, 42% and 17% for BKPyV, JCPyV and SV40, respectively. Sera from newborns (UCB) tested IgG-positive with a prevalence of 10% for BKPyV/JCPyV and 3% for SV40.
Conclusions
In this investigation, PyV vertical transmission was revealed by detecting PyV DNA sequences and IgG antibodies in samples from females and their offspring suggesting a potential risk of diseases in newborns."

Methods: Respiratory samples were collected from the respiratory tract of CF patients (n=294) over a period of 12 months. In addition to the usual microbiological investigation, HRV-RNA detection and typing were performed by RT-PCR and sequencing. HRV viral load and TLRs levels were measured by RT-Real Time PCR. Results: HRV-RNA was detected in 80 out of 515 respiratory samples (15.5%) with a similar rate in all age groups (0-10 years, 11-24 years, ≥25 years). Patients infected with different HRV A, B and C species exhibited higher levels of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8 as compared to HRV negative patients. Moreover, the expression level of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8 correlated with high level of HRV viral load. HRV positive patients co-colonized by Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed also enhanced amounts of TLR2 and TLR2/4-mRNAs expression respectively. In the case of presence of both bacteria, TLR2, TLR4, TLR8 and TLR9 levels are elevated in positive HRV patients. Conclusions: TLRs, especially TLR2 and TLR4, increased in HRV positive CF individuals and varies according to the presence of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and both bacteria."

A single dose of doxycycline after a tick bite can prevent the development of Lyme borreliosis in North America, but extrapolation to Europe is hampered by differences in Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies and tick species. We assessed the efficacy of prophylaxis after a tick bite in Europe.
Methods
We conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial, administering a single dose of 200 mg doxycycline within 72 hours after removing an attached tick from the skin, compared to no treatment. Potential participants ≥ 8 years of age who reported a recent tick bite online were invited for the study. After informed consent, they were randomly assigned to either the prophylaxis or the no-treatment group. Participants in the prophylaxis group were asked to visit their general practitioner to administer the antibiotics. All participants were followed up by online questionnaires. Our primary outcome was the development of physician-confirmed Lyme borreliosis in a modified-intention-to-treat analysis. This study is registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR3953) and is closed.
Results
Between April 11, 2013, and June 10, 2015, 3538 potential participants were randomized, of whom 1689 were included in the modified-intention-to-treat analysis. 10 cases of Lyme borreliosis were reported out of 1041 participants (0•96 %) in the prophylaxis group, and 19 cases out of 648 no-treatment participants (2•9 %), resulting in a relative risk reduction of 67% (95% CI 31 – 84%), and a number-needed-to-treat of 51 (95% CI 29 - 180). No serious adverse events were reported.
Conclusions
This primary care-based trial provides evidence that a single dose of doxycycline can prevent the development of Lyme borreliosis after an Ixodes ricinus tick bite."

High pneumococcal carriage density is a risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and transmission, but factors that increase pneumococcal carriage density are still unclear.
Methods
We undertook a cross-sectional study to evaluate the microbial composition, cytokine levels and pneumococcal carriage densities in samples from children presenting with an influenza-like illness (ILI) and asymptomatic healthy controls (HC).
Results
The proportion of children harbouring viral organisms (Relative risk (RR) 1.4, p=0.0222) or ≥4 microbes at a time (RR 1.9, p<0.0001), was higher in ILI patients than HC. ILI patients had higher IL-8 levels in nasal aspirates than HC (median [IQR], 265.7 [0 – 452.3] vs. 0 [0 – 127.3] pg/ml; p = 0.0154). Having an ILI was associated with higher pneumococcal carriage densities compared to HC (RR 4.2, p<0.0001).
Conclusion
These findings suggest that children with an ILI have an increased propensity for high pneumococcal carriage density. This could in part contribute to increased susceptibility to IPD and transmission in the community."

Chinese pediatricians are working on the front line to fight COVID-19. They have published a great amount of first-hand clinical data. Collecting their data and forming a large sample for analysis is more conducive to the recognition, prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in children. The epidemic prevention and control experience of Chinese pediatricians should be shared with the world.
Methods
By searching Chinese and English literature, the data of 406 children with COVID-19 in China were analyzed.
Results
It was found that the clustered incidence of children's families is a dynamic transmission feature; the incidence is low; asymptomatic infections and mild cases account for 44.8%, with only 7 cases of critical illness; laboratory examination of lymphocyte counts is not reduced, as it is for adults; chest CT findings are less severe than those for adults. These presentations are the clinical features of COVID-19 in children. Only 55 of the 406 cases were tested by anal swab for virus nucleic acid, 45 of which were positive, accounting for 81.8% of stool samples.
Conclusion
There are more children than adults with asymptomatic infections, milder conditions, faster recovery, and a better prognosis. Some concealed morbidity characteristics also bring difficulties to the early identification, prevention and control of COVID-19. COVID-19 screening is needed in the pediatric fever clinic, and respiratory and digestive tract nucleic acid tests should be performed. Efforts should be made to prevent children from becoming a hidden source of transmission in kindergartens, schools or families. Furthermore, China's experience in treating COVID-19 in children has led to faster recovery of sick children."

As the novel SARS-CoV-2 pandemic occurred, no specific treatment was yet available. Inflammatory response secondary to viral infection might be the driver of severe diseases. We report the safety and efficacy (in terms of overall survival and hospital discharge) of the anti-IL6 tocilizumab (TCZ) in subjects with COVID-19.
Methods
This retrospective, single-center analysis included all the patients consecutively admitted to our Hospital with severe or critical COVID-19 who started TCZ treatment from March 13th to April 03rd, 2020. A 1:2 matching to patients not treated with TCZ was performed according to age, sex, severity of disease, P/F, Charlson Comorbidity Index and length of time between symptoms onset and hospital admittance. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests to compare the groups were applied. Kaplan Meier probability curves and Cox regression models for survival, hospital discharge and orotracheal intubation were used.
Results
Seventy-four patients treated with TCZ were matched with 148 matched controls. They were mainly males (81.5%), Caucasian (82.0%) and with a median age of 59 years. The majority (69.8%) showed critical stage COVID-19 disease. TCZ use was associated with a better overall survival (HR 0.499 [95% CI 0.262–0.952], p = 0.035) compared to controls but with a longer hospital stay (HR 1.658 [95% CI 1.088–2.524], p = 0.019) mainly due to biochemical, respiratory and infectious adverse events.
Discussion
TCZ use resulted potentially effective on COVID-19 in terms of overall survival. Caution is warranted given the potential occurrence of adverse events.
Financial support
Some of the tocilizumab doses used in the subjects included in this analysis were provided by the “Multicenter study on the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia” (EudraCT Number: 2020-001110-38) supported by the Italian National Agency for Drugs (AIFA).

Many different risk factors have been associated with the development of SD, one of which is obesity. In many countries where DENV is endemic, obesity is becoming more prevalent, therefore SD is becoming an increased public health concern. However, there is a paucity of research on the mechanistic links between obesity and SD. This is a narrative review based on original research and reviews sourced from PubMed and Google Scholar. Four key areas could possibly explain how obesity can promote viral pathogenesis. Firstly, obesity downregulates AMP-Protein Kinase (AMPK), which leads to an accumulation of lipids in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that facilitates viral replication. Secondly, the long-term production of pro-inflammatory adipokines found in obese individuals can cause endothelial and platelet dysfunction and can facilitate SD. Thirdly, obesity could also cause endothelial dysfunction in addition to chronic inflammation, through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and possible damage to the glycocalyx found in the endothelium. Finally, obesity has several effects on immunomodulation that reduces NK cell function, B and T cell response and increased pre-disposition to stronger pro-inflammatory cytokine responses after viral infection. Together, these effects can lead to greater viral proliferation and greater tissue damage both of which could contribute to SD. The four mechanisms outlined in this review can be taken as reference starting points for investigating the link between obesity and SD, and to discover potential therapeutic strategies that can potentially reduce disease severity."

Objectives
This study analyzed salivary samples of COVID-19 patients and compared the results with their clinical and laboratory data.
Methods
Salivary samples of 25 COVID-19 patients were analyzed by rRT-PCR. The following data were collected: age, sex, comorbidities, drugs. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ultrasensitive reactive C protein (usRCP) values were registered on the same day when a salivary swab was collected. Prevalence of positivity in saliva and association between clinical data and the cycle threshold as a semiquantitative indicator of viral load were considered.
Results
Twenty-five subjects were recruited into this study, 17 males and 8 females. The mean age was 61.5 +/− 11.2 years. Cardiovascular and/or dysmetabolic disorders were observed in 65.22% of cases. All the samples tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, while there was an inverse association between LDH and Ct values. Two patients showed positive salivary results on the same days when their pharyngeal or respiratory swabs showed conversion.
Conclusions
Saliva is a reliable tool to detect SARS-CoV-2. The role of saliva in COVID-19 diagnosis could not be limited to a qualitative detection of the virus, but it may also provide information about the clinical evolution of the disease."

Little is known about COVID-19 outside Hubei. The aim of this paper was to describe the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.
Methods
In this retrospective cohort study, 149 RT-PCR confirmed positive patients were consecutively enrolled from January 17th to February 10th, 2020 in three tertiary hospitals of Wenzhou. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 15th, 2020.
Findings
A total of 85 patients had Hubei travel/residence history, while another 49 had contact with people from Hubei and 15 had no traceable exposure history to Hubei. Fever, cough and expectoration were the most common symptoms, 14 patients had decreased oxygen saturation, 33 had leukopenia, 53 had lymphopenia, and 82 had elevated C-reactive protein. On chest computed tomography (CT), lung segments 6 and 10 were mostly involved. A total of 287 segments presented ground glass opacity, 637 presented mixed opacity and 170 presented consolidation. Lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung with a patchy form. No significant difference was found between patients with or without Hubei exposure history. Seventeen patients had normal CT on admission of these, 12 had negative findings even10 days later.
Interpretation
Most patients presented with a mild infection in our study. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed opacity with predominance in the lower lung is highly suspicious of COVID-19 in the first week of disease onset. Nevetheless, some patients can present with a normal chest finding despite testing positive for COVID-19. Funding: We did not receive any fundings."

SARS-CoV-2 infection has now a global resonance. Data on how COVID-19 is affecting immunocompromised patients are however few. With our study we aimed to systematically review the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 cases in children and adults with immunosuppression, to evaluate outcomes in this special population.
Methods
A systematic review of literature was carried out to identify relevant articles, searching the EMBASE, Medline, and Google Scholar databases. Studies reporting data on pre-defined outcomes and related to immunosuppressed adults and children with SARS-CoV-2 were included.
Results
Sixteen relevant articles were identified with 110 immunosuppressed patients, mostly presenting cancer, along with transplantation and immunodeficiency. Cancer was more often associated with a more severe course, but not necessarily with a bad prognosis. Our data show that both children and adults with immunosuppression seem to have a favorable disease course, as compared to the general population.
Conclusion
Immunosuppressed patients with COVID-19 seem to be few in relation to the overall figures, and to present a favorable outcome as compared to other comorbidities. This might be explained by a hypothetical protective role of a weaker immune response, determining a milder disease presentation and thus underdiagnosis. Nevertheless, surveillance on this special population should be encouraged."

Background
Reactive arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Guillain-Barré syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease may be sequelae of Campylobacter or non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infections. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and antibiotics may increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections (GII); however, their impact on sequelae onset is unclear. We investigated the incidence of sequelae, their association with antibiotics and PPI prescription, and assessed the economic impact on the NHS.
Methods
Data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink for patients consulting their GP for Campylobacter or NTS infection, during 2000–2015, were linked to hospital, mortality, and Index of Multiple Deprivation data. We estimated the incidence of sequelae and deaths in the 12 months following GII. We conducted logistic regression modelling for the adjusted association with prescriptions. We compared differences in resource use and costs pre- and post-infection amongst patients with and without sequelae.
Findings
Of 20,471 patients with GII (Campylobacter 17,838), less than 2% (347) developed sequelae, with IBS (268) most common. Amongst Campylobacter patients, those with prescriptions for PPI within 12 months before and cephalosporins within 7-days before/after infection had elevated risk of IBS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.1, 1.5–2.9) and (aOR 3.6, 1.1–11.7) respectively. Campylobacter sequelae led to ∼ £1.3 million, (£750,000, £1.7 million) in additional annual NHS expenditure.
Interpretation
Sequelae of Campylobacter and NTS infections are rare but associated with increased NHS costs. Prior prescription of PPI may be a modifiable risk factor. Incidence of sequelae, healthcare resource use and costs are essential parameters for future burden of disease studies."

abstract = "Objective
Antibiotics change the composition of the intestinal microbiota. The magnitude of the effect of antibiotics on the microbiota and whether the effects are short-term or persist long-term remain uncertain. In this review, we summarise studies that have investigated the effect of antibiotics on the composition of the human intestinal microbiota.
Methods
A systematic search was done to identify original studies that have investigated the effect of systemic antibiotics on the intestinal microbiota in humans.
Results
We identified 129 studies investigating 2076 participants and 301 controls. Many studies reported a decrease in bacterial diversity with antibiotic treatment. Penicillin only had minor effects on the intestinal microbiota. Amoxicillin, amoxcillin/clavulanate, cephalosporins, lipopolyglycopeptides, macrolides, ketolides, clindamycin, tigecycline, quinolones and fosfomycin all increased abundance of Enterobacteriaea other than E. coli (mainly Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp.). Amoxcillin, cephalosporins, macrolides, clindamycin, quinolones and sulphonamides decreased abundance of E. coli, while amoxcillin/clavulante, in contrast to other penicillins, increased abundance of E. coli. Amoxicllin, piperacillin and ticarcillin, cephalosporins (except fifth generation cephalosporins), carbapenems and lipoglycopeptides were associated with increased abundance of Enterococcus spp., while macrolides and doxycycline decreased its abundance. Piperacillin and ticarcillin, carbapenems, macrolides, clindamycin and quinolones strongly decreased the abundance of anaerobic bacteria. In the studies that investigated persistence, the longest duration of changes was reported after treatment with ciprofloxacin (one year), clindamycin (two years) and clarithromycin plus metronidazole (four years). Many antibiotics were associated with a decrease in butyrate or butryrate-producing bacteria.
Conclusion
Antibiotics have profound and sometimes persisting effects on the intestinal microbiota, characterised by diminished abundance of beneficial commensals and increased abundance of potentially detrimental microorganisms. Understanding these effects will help tailor antibiotic treatment and the use of probiotics to minimise this ‘collateral damage’."

abstract = "Summary
Avian-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) and their subsequent adaptation to humans are of great concern to public health. Surveillance and early warning of AIVs with the potential to infect humans and pandemic potential is crucial. In this study, we determined whether adaptive evolution occurred in human-isolated H5 viruses. We evaluated all available genomes of H5N1 and H5N6 avian influenza A virus. Firstly, we systematically identified several new mutations in H5 AIV that might be associated with human adaptation using a combination of novel comparative phylogenetic methods and structural analysis. Some changes are the result of parallel evolution, further demonstrating their importance. In total, we identified 102 adaptive evolution sites in eight genes. Some residues had been previously identified, such as 227 in HA and 627 in PB2, while others have not been reported so far. Ten sites from four genes evolved in parallel but no obvious positive selection was detected. Our study suggests that during infection of humans, H5 viruses evolved to adapt to their new host environment and that the sites of adaptive/parallel evolution might play a role in crossing the species barrier and are the response to new selection pressure. The results provide insight to implement early detection systems for transitional stages in H5 AIV evolution before its potential adaptation for humans. Author summary line The prerequisite of surveillance and early warning of avian influenza viruses with the potential to infect humans depends on the identification of human-adaptation related mutations. In this study, we used a novel approach combining both phylogenetic and structural analysis to identify possible human-adaptation related mutations in H5 AIVs. Previous studies reported human-adaptation related mutations and some novel mutations exhibiting parallel evolution. Our result provides new insights into how AIVs adapt to humans by point mutations."

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the primary etiologic agent of liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV elevated infection rates are mostly due to the lack of an accurate and accessible screening and diagnosis, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Conventional HCV diagnostic algorithm consists of a serological test followed by a nucleic acid test. This sequence of tests is time consuming and not affordable for low-resource settings. Nanotechnology have introduced new promising tests for the diagnose of infectious diseases. Based on the employment of nanoparticles and other nanomaterials which lead to highly sensitive and specific nanoscale tests, most of them target pathogen genome. Implementation of nanoscale tests, which are affordable, portable and easy to use by non-specialized personal, would improve HCV diagnosis algorithm. In this review, we have summed up the current emerging nanotechnology tools, which will improve actual screening and treatment programs, and help to reach HCV elimination proposal."

Cross-infection between unrelated neonates was reported in 19 clusters involving an early-onset (<7 days of life; n = 3), late-onset (7–90 days; n = 13) index case or colonized infant (n = 3) followed by one or more late-onset cases (median serial interval 9 days (IQR 3–17, range 0–50 days, n = 45)); linkage was determined by phage typing in 3 clusters, PFGE/MLST/PCR in 8, WGS in 4, non-molecular methods in 4. Postulated routes of transmission in neonatal clusters were via clinical personnel and equipment, particularly during periods of crowding and high patient-to-nurse ratio. Of 4 adult clusters, one was attributed to droplet spread between respiratory cases, one to handling of haemodialysis catheters and two unspecified. Conclusions: Long intervals between cases were identified in most of the clusters, a characteristic which potentially hinders detection of GBS hospital outbreaks without enhanced surveillance supported by genomics."

Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci; GBS) is an uncommon cause of bacterial meningitis in adults.
Methods
We reviewed literature published between 1975 and 2018. Studies were included if they reported age, sex and outcome of patients above 16 years of age with cerebrospinal fluid culture (CSF) positive for GBS.
Results
Sixty-seven articles describing 141 patients were included. Median age was 56 years (IQR 41–66); 52% were male. Fifty-three patients (38%) were immunocompromised and CSF leakage was reported in 9 (10%) of 88 immunocompetent patients. Sixty-two patients (44%) had extra-meningeal foci of infection, most commonly endocarditis, which occurred in 14 patients (12%). Twenty-eight patients (23%) were described as previously healthy. Forty-four (31%) of the 141 patients died, after a median duration of 5 days after admission. Death was associated with advanced age and an immunocompromised state.
Conclusion
GBS meningitis in adults mainly occurs in those with underlying conditions such as immunocompromised state, CSF leakage, and endocarditis. These conditions should be actively sought for in adults with GBS meningitis."

Diagnostic prediction models have been developed to assess the likelihood of bacterial meningitis (BM) in patients presented with suspected central nervous system (CNS) infection. External validation in patients suspected of meningitis is essential to determine the diagnostic accuracy of these models.
Methods
We prospectively included patients who underwent a lumbar puncture for suspected CNS infection. After a systematic review of the literature, we applied identified models for BM to our cohort. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, area under the curve (AUC) and, if possible, we evaluated the calibration of the models.
Results
From 2012-2015 we included 363 episodes. In 89 (24%) episodes, the patient received a final diagnosis of a CNS infection, of whom 27 had BM. Seventeen prediction models for BM were identified. Sensitivity of these models ranged from 37% to 100%. Specificity of these models ranged from 44% to 99%. The cerebrospinal fluid model of Oostenbrink reached the highest AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91–0.997). Calibration showed over- or underestimation in all models.
Conclusion
None of the existing models performed well enough to recommend as routine use in individual patient management. Future research should focus on differences between diagnostic accuracy of the prediction models and physician's therapeutic decisions."

Prioritisation of oral bedaquiline over the injectable agents in the treatment of multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the World Health Organisations (WHO) 2019 guidelines prompted this UK analysis of cost implications. The objective was to estimate the costs of amikacin versus bedaquiline in MDR TB treatment regimens using a historical cohort where the injectable agents were the standard of care.
Methods
This was a retrospective study using a known cohort of UK patients treated with an injectable agent, with data available on resource use, costs for the use of amikacin were compared with those for bedaquiline, based on recommended monitoring for bedaquiline.
Results
The estimated cost of treatment per patient had mean (sd) of £27,236 (4952) for the observed injectable group, £30,264 (3392) and 36,309 (3901) for the 6 and 8 month amikacin groups, and £31,760 (2092) for the bedaquiline group. The cost in the bedaquiline group was £30,772 (1855) with a 10% reduction and £27,079 (1234) with a 33% reduction in-patient stay.
Conclusions
In most scenarios, bedaquiline is close to cost neutral compared with injectable therapy, especially if, as expected, some reduction in duration of admission is possible as a result of bedaquiline's more rapid culture conversion."

There is a lack of studies comparing clinical outcomes among retrospective versus prospective cohorts of allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-HCT) recipients with community acquired respiratory virus (CARV) infections.
Methods
We compare outcomes in two consecutive cohorts of allo-HCT recipients with CARV infections. The retrospective cohort included 63 allo-HCT recipients with 108 CARV infections from January 2013 to April 2016 who were screened and managed following standard clinical practice based on influenza and respiratory syncytial virus rapid antigen detection methods. The prospective cohort was comprised of 144 consecutive recipients with 297 CARV episodes included in a prospective interventional clinical surveillance program (ProClinCarvSur-P) based on syndromic multiplex PCR as first-line test from May 2016 to December 2018 at a single transplant center.
Results
CARV infections in the retrospective cohort showed more severe clinical features at the time of diagnosis compared to the prospective cohort (fever 83% vs. 57%, hospital admission 69% vs. 28% and lower respiratory tract 58% vs. 31%, respectively, p ≤ 0.002 for all comparisons). Antiviral therapy was more commonly prescribed in the prospective cohort (69 vs. 43 treated CARV episodes), particularly at the upper respiratory tract disease stage (34 vs. 12 treated CARV episodes). Three-month all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the retrospective cohort (n = 23, 37% vs. n = 10, 7%, p < 0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that recipients included in ProClinCarvSur-P had lower mortality rate [odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.12–0.7, p = 0.01].
Conclusion
This study report on outcome differences when reporting retrospective vs. prospective CARV infections after allo-HCT. Recipients included in a ProClinCarvSur-P had lower mortality."

S. aureus isolates from nasal, perineal, and oropharyngeal swabs before and through 12 months post-vaccination were identified.
Results
Baseline S. aureus colonization prevalence was 30.6% (any site), with nasal carriage (27.0%) more common than oropharyngeal/perineal (3.2% each). Following initial vaccination (low-dose: 102; mid-dose: 101; high-dose: 101; placebo: 102) and booster (low-dose: 45; mid-dose: 44; high-dose: 27; placebo: 181), placebo and SA3Ag groups showed similar S. aureus carriage through 12 months. Most colonized participants (74.0%) were colonized by single spa types. Placebo and SA3Ag groups had similar persistence of colonization, with 19.6–30.7% due to single spa types. Acquisition was observed in mid- and high-dose recipients (∼20%) and low-dose and placebo recipients (∼12%). Vaccination resulted in substantial increases in antibodies to all 3 antigens, irrespective of carriage status.

Introduction
Pneumococcal outbreaks are rare but they still occur, particularly in closed settings usually involving vulnerable groups. We undertook a systematic review to identify strategies for controlling pneumococcal outbreaks since the licensure of higher-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs).
Methods
A systematic literature search was performed for pneumococcal outbreaks published since 2010. A cluster was defined as two or more cases of severe pneumococcal disease in a closed setting within 14 days.
Results
Eleven reports were identified, including seven caused by serotypes in both the 13-valent PCV (PCV13) and the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23); two were due to a PCV13-only serotype (6A) and one each by a PCV13-related serotype (6C) and a non-vaccine serotype (15A). Eight reported infection control measures, including reinforcing hand washing, respiratory hygiene and patient cohorting. PPV23 was used in five outbreaks, while PCV13 and both vaccines were used in one outbreak each. Different antibiotics were used for chemoprophylaxis in eight outbreaks.
Conclusions
Most pneumococcal outbreaks are currently caused by vaccine-preventable serotypes, and PPV23 is the preferred vaccine in more than half the outbreaks. Early implementation of infection control measures is important, and antibiotic chemoprophylaxis should be considered for high-risk individuals."

Objectives
The aim was to analyze differences in clinical presentation, etiology, management, and outcome between immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients with acute bacterial meningitis (ABM).
Methods
Data were extracted from 1056 adult ABM patients prospectively registered in the national Swedish quality register for ABM during 2008–2017. Primary endpoint was 30-day mortality and secondary endpoints 90-day mortality and unfavorable outcome.
Results
An immunocompromised state was observed in 352 (33%) of the 1056 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae dominated in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients (53% in both groups), whereas L monocytogenes occurred in 11% and 2%, respectively. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for 30-day mortality in immunocompromised compared to immunocompetent patients was 1.68 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07–2.63). Adjusted for age, sex, and mental status on admission the OR was 1.34 (CI: 0.82–2.21). Adjusted also for time to antibiotic treatment and corticosteroids the OR was 1.10 (CI: 0.59–2.05), and in patients without Listeria meningitis 0.98 (CI: 0.50–1.90). Although, the ORs were higher for 90-day mortality and unfavorable outcome the effects of adjustments were similar.
Conclusion
Mortality in immunocompromised patients with ABM is only moderately increased unless caused by Listeria. This difference is further reduced in patients given early antibiotic treatment and adjunctive corticosteroids.

abstract = "Objective
Candida auris has recently emerged as a global cause of multidrug resistant fungal outbreaks. An outbreak occurred at a tertiary care center in London in 2016. Transmission characteristics, interventions, patient outcomes and cost of resources are described.
Methods
Outbreak interventions included patient isolation, contact screening, single-use equipment, environmental screening and decontamination, staff education, and enhanced surveillance. Risk factors for infection were recorded. Survival probabilities of patients with C. auris and other Candida bloodstream infections (BSI) were calculated. Antifungal susceptibility and epidemiological typing were performed. Actual and opportunity costs of interventions were determined.
Results
34 patients acquired the organism including 8 with BSI. Clinical infection was significantly associated with prolonged hospital stay, haemodialysis and antifungal therapy. Variable susceptibility to amphotericin and the triazoles was seen and isolates clustered with the South Asian strains. No significant difference was detected in the survival probabilities of C. auris BSI compared to other candidemias. Outbreak control cost in excess of £1 million and £58,000/month during the subsequent year.
Conclusion
C. auris outbreaks can be controlled by a concerted infection control strategy but can be expensive. Transmission maybe prolonged due to patient movements and unidentified transmission mechanisms."

The long-term dynamics of antibody responses in patients with influenza A(H7N9) virus infection are not well understood.
Methods
We conducted a longitudinal serological follow-up study in patients who were hospitalized with A(H7N9) virus infection, during 2013–2018. A(H7N9) virus-specific antibody responses were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralization (NT) assays. A random intercept model was used to fit a curve to HAI antibody responses over time. HAI antibody responses were compared by clinical severity.
Results
Of 67 patients with A(H7N9) virus infection, HAI antibody titers reached 40 on average 11 days after illness onset and peaked at a titer of 290 after three months, and average titers of ≥80 and ≥40 were present until 11 months and 22 months respectively. HAI antibody responses were significantly higher in patients who experienced severe disease, including respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, compared with patients who experienced less severe illness.
Conclusions
Patients with A(H7N9) virus infection who survived severe disease mounted higher antibody responses that persisted for longer periods compared with those that experienced moderate disease. Studies of convalescent plasma treatment for A(H7N9) patients should consider collection of donor plasma from survivors of severe disease between 1 and 11 months after illness onset."

Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (SM) is increasingly identified in intensive care unit (ICU). This study aim to identify risk factors for SM ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and whether it affects ICU mortality
Methods
Two nested matched case-control studies were performed based in OUTCOMEREA database. The first episodes of SM-VAP patients were matched with two different control groups: VAP due to other micro-organisms (VAP-other) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa VAP (Pyo-VAP). Matching criteria were the hospital, the SAPS II, and the previous duration of mechanical ventilation (MV).
Results
Of the 102 SM-VAP patients (6.2% of all VAP patients), 92 were matched with 375 controls for the SM-VAP/other-VAP matching and 84 with 237 controls for the SM-VAP/Pyo-VAP matching. SM-VAP risk factors were an exposition to ureido/carboxypenicillin or carbapenem during the week before VAP, and respiratory and coagulation components of SOFA score upper to 2 before VAP. SM-VAP received early adequate therapy in 70 cases (68.6%). Risk factors for Day-30 were age (OR = 1.03; p < 0.01) and Chronic heart failure (OR = 3.15; p < 0.01). Adequate treatment, either monotherapy or combination of antimicrobials, did not modify mortality. There was no difference in 30-day mortality, but 60-day mortality was higher in patients with SM-VAP compared to Other-VAP (P = 0.056).
Conclusions
In a large series, independent risk factors for the SM-VAP were ureido/carboxypenicillin or carbapenem exposure the week before VAP, and respiratory and coagulation components of the SOFA score > 2 before VAP. Mortality risk factors of SM-VAP were age and chronic heart failure. Adequate treatment did not improve SM-VAP prognosis."

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a main global public health problem. However, a systematic review of TB resistance epidemiology in Africa is wanting.
Methods
A comprehensive systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect for English research articles reporting on the molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex resistance in Africa from January 2007 to December 2018 was undertaken.
Results and conclusion
Qualitative and quantitative synthesis were, respectively, undertaken with 232 and 186 included articles, representing 32 countries. TB monoresistance rate was highest for isoniazid (59%) and rifampicin (27%), particularly in Zimbabwe (100%), Swaziland (100%), and Sudan (67.9%) whilst multidrug resistance (MDR) rate was substantial in Zimbabwe (100%), Sudan (34.6%), Ivory Coast (24.5%) and Ethiopia (23.9%). Resistance-conferring mutations were commonly found in katG (n = 3694), rpoB (n = 3591), rrs (n = 1272), inhA (n = 1065), pncA (n = 1063) and embB (n = 705) in almost all included countries: S315G/I/N/R/T, V473D/F/G/I, Q471H/Q/R/Y, S303C/L etc. in katG; S531A/F/S/G, H526A/C/D/G, D516A/E/G etc. in rpoB; A1401G, A513C etc. in rrs; -15C→T, -17G→A/T, -16A→G etc. in inhA; Ins456C, Ins 172 G, L172P, C14R, Ins515G etc. in pncA. Commonest lineages and families such as T (n = 8139), LAM (n = 5243), Beijing (n = 5471), Cameroon (n = 3315), CAS (n = 2021), H (n = 1773) etc., with the exception of T, were not fairly distributed; Beijing, Cameroon and CAS were prevalent in South Africa (n = 4964), Ghana (n = 2306), and Ethiopia/Tanzania (n = 799/635), respectively. Resistance mutations were not lineage-specific and sputum (96.2%) were mainly used for diagnosing TB resistance using the LPA (38.5%), GeneXpert (17.2%), whole-genome sequencing (12.3%) and PCR/amplicon sequencing (9%/23%). Intercountry spread of strains was limited while intra-country dissemination was common. TB resistance and its diagnosis remain a major threat in Africa, necessitating urgent action to contain this global menace."

Objective
Neisseria lactamica has an important influence on carriage and antimicrobial susceptibility of N. meningitidis, a major pathogen of septicemia and meningitis. In China, quinolone resistance is highly prevalent in N. meningitidis but unknown in N. lactamica. This study investigates the carriage rate, sequence type, and ciprofloxacin resistance of N. lactamica in children in China.
Methods
During 2014–2016, throat swabs were collected from 2,239 children in Shanghai. The ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations of the isolates were determined by the agar dilution method.
Results
The overall carriage rate of N. lactamica was higher (8.9%) than that of N. meningitidis (0.9%) and peaked at two years (37.1%). The resistance frequency of N. lactamica to ciprofloxacin was 98.5% (197/200). There were 65 sequence types (STs). Clonal complex (cc) 640 (45.5%) dominated, while ST-14031 was predominant (37%, 74/200). All isolates possessed a GyrA mutation; 17 isolates (8.5%) harbored additionally a ParC mutation. Assigned to 39 different alleles, the gyrA sequences from these N. lactamica isolates formed an N. lactamica cluster, which also included eight alleles from N. meningitidis.
Conclusion
The N. lactamica isolates in China showed distinct characteristics with lower genetic diversity and a much higher prevalence of quinolone resistance than in other countries."

Objectives
Pregnant women represent a category at high risk of severe measles infection, that negatively affects the fetus as well. A systematic review of clinical outcomes of measles infection in gravid subjects and a meta-analysis of antibodies prevalence among pregnant women was conducted.
Methods
MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched up to 18 June 2018. The screening focused on: (i) articles describing the outcome of measles in pregnancy, synthesized in a descriptive fashion; (ii) articles addressing the measles seroprevalence in cohorts of gravid women, analysed quantitatively.
Results
Twenty-nine articles met inclusion criteria. A total of 420 cases of measles in gravid subjects were described, from 1941 to 2012. Among women, 18 deaths (4.3%) occurred, and the most frequent complication was pneumonia (75/420, 17.9%). Prematurity was the most important complication concerning fetal outcomes (55 out of 410 cases with available data, 13.4%). The random-effects pooled seroprevalence of measles in 20,546 gravid women worldwide was 89.3% (95% CI: 87.3–91.1%), that decreased, although not in a statistically significant way, over time (p = 0.54).
Conclusions
Measles infection in pregnancy is dangerous both for the mother and the foetus. Antibody seroprevalence among gravid women on a global scale is lower than the herd immunity threshold."

Predominating serogroups are B and C, followed by A, and cases attributable to serogroups W, X and Y are emerging. Available vaccines differ between countries, are generally not included in immunization programs and provided to high-risk groups only. Available vaccines include both conjugate and polysaccharide vaccines; however, current data and GMI recommendations advocate the use of conjugate vaccines, where possible, due to the ability to interrupt the acquisition of carriage. Ongoing carriage studies are expected to inform vaccine effectiveness and immunization schedules. Additionally, IMD prevention and control should be guided by monitoring outbreak progression and the emergence and international spread of strains and antibiotic resistance through use of genomic analyses and implementation of World Health Organization initiatives. Protection of high-risk groups (such as those with complement deficiencies, laboratory workers, migrants and refugees) is recommended."

Objectives
The globally distributed “Beijing” lineage of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been associated with outbreaks worldwide. Laboratory based studies have suggested that Beijing lineage may have increased fitness; however, it has not been established whether these differences are of epidemiological significance with regards to transmission. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review of epidemiological studies of tuberculosis clustering to compare the transmission dynamics of Beijing lineages versus the non-Beijing lineages.
Methods
We systematically searched Embase and MEDLINE before 31st December 2018, for studies which provided information on the transmission dynamics of the different M. tuberculosis lineages. We included articles that conducted population-based cross-sectional or longitudinal molecular epidemiological studies reporting information about extent of transmission of different lineages. The protocol for this systematic review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CDR42018088579).
Results
Of 2855 records identified by the search, 46 were included in the review, containing 42,700 patients from 27 countries. Beijing lineage was the most prevalent and highly clustered strain in 72.4% of the studies and had a higher likelihood of transmission than non-Beijing lineages (OR 1·81 [95% 1·28–2·57], I2 = 94·0%, τ2 = 0·59, p < 0·01).
Conclusions
Despite considerable heterogeneity across epidemiological contexts, Beijing lineage appears to be more transmissible than other lineages."

Objectives
To analyze the clinical and economic burden of community-acquired (CA) or community-onset healthcare-associated (COHCA) multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections requiring hospitalization.
Methods
Case-control study. Adults admitted with CA or COHCA MDR infections were considered cases, while those admitted in the same period with non-MDR infections were controls. The matching criteria were source of infection and/or microorganism. Primary outcome was 30-day clinical failure. Secondary outcomes were 90-day and 1-year mortality, hospitalization costs and resource consumption.
Results
194 patients (97 cases and 97 controls) were included. Multivariate analysis identified age (odds ratio [OR], 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01–1.14) and SOFA score (OR, 1.45, CI95%, 1.15–1.84) as independent predictors of 30-day clinical failure. Age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.09, 95%CI, 1.03–1.16) was the only factor associated with 90-day mortality, whereas age (HR 1.06, 95%CI, 1.03–1.09) and Charlson Index (HR 1.2, 95%CI, 1.07–1.34) were associated with 1-year mortality. MDR group showed longer hospitalization (p<0.001) and MDR hospitalization costs almost doubled those in the non-MDR group. MDR infections were associated with higher antimicrobial costs.
Conclusions
Worse economic outcomes were identified with community-onset MDR infections. MDR was associated with worse clinical outcomes but mainly due to higher comorbidity of patients in MDR group, rather than multidrug resistance."

Objectives
To measure the effect of probenecid, fasting and fed, on flucloxacillin pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints.
Methods
Flucloxacillin 1000 mg orally was given to 11 volunteers alone while fasting (‘flucloxacillin alone’), and with probenecid 500 mg orally while fasting (‘probenecid fasting’) and with food (‘probenecid fed’). Flucloxacillin pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints were compared.
Results
Probenecid, fasting and fed, increased free plasma flucloxacillin area under the concentration-time curve (zero to infinity) ∼1.65-fold (p < 0.01) versus flucloxacillin alone. Probenecid fed prolonged time to peak flucloxacillin concentrations ∼2-fold versus the other two regimens (p < 0.01). Probenecid fasting or fed increased free flucloxacillin concentrations exceeding 30%, 50% and 70% of the first 6, 8 and 12 h post-dose by 1.58- to 5.48-fold compared with flucloxacillin alone. As an example of this pharmacodynamic improvement, the probability of target attainment of free concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration for Staphylococcus aureus (0.5 mg/L) for 50% of a 6-hour dose interval was > 80% for flucloxacillin plus probenecid (fasting or fed) and < 20% for flucloxacillin alone.
Conclusions
Probenecid increased flucloxacillin exposure, with predicted pharmacodynamic effects greater than pharmacokinetic effects because of the altered shape of the concentration-time curve. Probenecid may improve the applicability of oral flucloxacillin regimens."

To compare immunoglobulin levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of neonates exposed to Zika virus (ZIKV) during foetal life (cases) with levels in CSF of control neonates.
Methods
We identified 16 neonates who underwent lumbar puncture (LP), during the ZIKV epidemic (December/2015 to March/2016) whose mothers reported ZIKV clinical symptoms during gestation (cases). Congenital microcephaly was defined as head circumference ≤31.9 cm (boys) and ≤31.5 cm (girls) for term neonates, or ≤2 standard deviations below the mean for premature (<37 weeks) neonates. Subsequently, we identified neonates who underwent LP in the same lab and fulfilled criteria to be controls: age ≤4 days, CSF white blood cell count ≤8/mm3, CSF protein ≤132 mg/dL, CSF red blood cell count ≤1,000/mm3, neither central nervous system illness, nor congenital infection, nor microcephaly. CSF immunoglobulin concentrations were measured by mass spectrometry.
Results
13 controls were included. IgM, IgA, IgG, IgK, and IgL were significantly higher among cases (p < 0.001). Eight (50%) ZIKV exposed infants had congenital microcephaly. These showed the strongest immunoglobulin elevation of the IgM and IgA classes.
Conclusion
Neonates exposed to ZIKV infection during gestation present with elevated distinct immunoglobulins in CSF, both in cases that developed microcephaly and in cases that did not."

Human leishmaniasis can be severe and fatal, yet in the Mediterranean region only a small percentage of infections progress to clinical disease. We evaluated the percentage of asymptomatic Leishmania infection in the Bologna province, northeastern Italy.
Methods
We examined the presence of specific antibodies by Western Blot (WB) and parasitic DNA by real time PCR in peripheral blood of 240 blood donors residing in the Bologna province.
Results
Anti-Leishmania IgG were detected by WB in 27 subjects (11.2%, 95% CI 7%-15%), while Leishmania kinetoplast DNA was detected in peripheral blood specimens of 4 out of 240 donors (1.7%, 95% CI 0.2%-3.2%). Overall, the prevalence of Leishmania infection in the blood donor cohort was 12.5%, thus indicating an elevated cumulative exposure to the Leishmania parasite in the examined municipality.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that a surveillance system for monitoring Leishmania infection in blood donors and/or strategies of protozoan inactivation in whole blood should be taken into consideration in areas with circulation of the Leishmania parasite."

To determine occurrence of residual rotavirus (RV) disease in different age groups in Finland after five to nine years of high coverage (≥90%) mass-vaccination with RotaTeqⓇ vaccine, and to examine the vaccine effect on circulating genotypes.
Methods
Since 2013 all clinical laboratories in the country were obliged to send RV positive stool samples for typing. RVs were genotyped by RT-PCR for VP7 and VP4 proteins, sequenced and compared to reference strains.
Results
RV continued to circulate throughout the study period at low level with a small increase in 2017–2018. There were three age-related clusters: young children representing primary or secondary vaccine failures, school-age children who may not have been vaccinated, and the elderly. Genotype distribution differed from the pre-vaccination period with a steady decline of G1P[8], emergence of G9P[8] and especially more recently G12P[8]. In the elderly, G2P[4] was predominant but was also replaced by G12P[8] in 2017–18.
Conclusions
RV vaccination with a high coverage keeps RV disease at low level but does not prevent RV circulation. New RV genotypes have emerged replacing largely the previously predominant G1P[8]. Increase of overall RV activity with emergence of G12P[8] in the latest follow-up season 2017–18 might be a potential alarm sign."

Enterobacter is among the main etiologies of hospital-acquired infections. This study aims to identify the risk factors of acquisition and attributable mortality of Enterobacter bacteremia.
Methods
Observational, case-control study for risk factors and prospective cohort for outcomes of consecutive cases with Enterobacter bacteremia. This study was conducted in five hospitals in Spain over a three-year period. Matched controls were patients with negative blood cultures and same sex, age, and hospitalization area.
Results
The study included 285 cases and 570 controls. E. cloacae was isolated in 198(68.8%) cases and E. aerogenes in 89(31.2%). Invasive procedures (hemodialysis, nasogastric tube, mechanical ventilation, surgical drainage tube) and previous antibiotics or corticosteroids were independently associated with Enterobacter bacteremia. Its attributable mortality was 7.8%(CI95%2.7–13.4%), being dissimilar according to a McCabe index: non-fatal=3.2%, ultimately fatal=12.9% and rapidly fatal=0.12%. Enterobacter bacteremia remained an independent risk factor for mortality among cases with severe sepsis or septic shock (OR 5.75 [CI95%2.57–12.87], p<0.001), with an attributable mortality of 40.3%(CI95%25.7–53.3). Empiric therapy or antibiotic resistances were not related to the outcome among patients with bacteremia.
Conclusions
Invasive procedures, previous antibiotics and corticosteroids predispose to acquire Enterobacter bacteremia. This entity increases mortality among fragile patients and those with severe infections. Antibiotic resistances did not affect the outcome."

There are a lack of consistency among articles in regards to the evolution of peripheral immune biomarkers after HCV therapy. We aimed to detect the most relevant changes in peripheral immune biomarkers among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) following peg-IFN-α/ribavirin therapy and to evaluate its normalization with respect to an HIV-monoinfected control group.
Methods
We performed a prospective cohort study in 99 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with samples at baseline (HIV/HCV-b-group) and at week 24 after SVR (HIV/HCV-f-group). We also used a control group of 39 HIV-monoinfected patients (HIV-group) negative for HCV and HBV infections, and who had undetectable HIV viral load and CD4+ >500 cells/mm3. Peripheral T cell subsets were assessed by flow cytometry and plasma biomarkers by immunoassays.
Results
HIV/HCV-coinfected patients had higher values of in IL-10, IL-4, IP-10, IL-8, IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-12p70, TNF-α, sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, and sTNFR-1 than HIV control subjects, both at the beginning and at the end of follow-up. Moreover, three biomarkers (CD4+CD38+, telomere length, and IL-1RA) were normalized in relation to the control group at the end of follow-up (the HIV/HCV-b group had higher values and the HIV/HCV-f group had similar values as the HIV-group). Additionally, LPS, IL-2, and IL-17A levels were higher in the HIV/HCV-f group than the HIV-group (24 weeks after SVR). During the follow-up, HIV/HCV-coinfected patients had a significant decrease by the end of follow-up in CD8+CD45RA−CD28+, CD4+CD38+, CD4+CD25+CD127−/low, CD4+CD25+CD127−/low CD45RA−, FABP2, LBP, IP-10, sVCAM1. Only CD4+CD38+ was normalized.
Conclusion
HIV/HCV-patients showed a slight improvement in the overall profile of immune biomarkers after achieving SVR."

Viral fitness plays an important role in HIV-1 evolution, transmission and pathogenesis. However, how mutations accumulated during early infection affect viral fitness has not been well studied.
Methods
Paired infectious molecular clones (IMCs) for transmitted/founder (T/F) and 6-month (6-mo) viruses post infection were generated from 10 infected individuals to investigate the impact of accumulated mutations on viral fitness by comparing 6-mo viruses to their cognate T/F viruses.
Results
All ten 6-mo viruses were less fit than their cognate T/F viruses. Moreover, the fitness losses of the 6-mo viruses correlated with the decrease in viral loads from the peak of viremia.
Conclusion
These results show that the mutations accumulated during half a year post infection collectively reduce viral fitness and thereby contribute to lowering viral loads."

keywords = "Tuberculosis, Bedaquiline, Drug resistance, AtpE, Mmpr(Rv0678)",
abstract = "Objectives
Bedaquiline is an effective drug used to treat MDR and XDR tuberculosis, providing high cure rates in complex therapy. Mutations in the mmpR (rv0678) and atpE genes are associated with reduced susceptibility to bedaquiline and have been identified in both in vitro selected strains and clinical isolates. However, the phenotypic criteria used to detect bedaquiline resistance have yet to be established due to the collection of few clinical isolates from patients receiving bedaquiline-containing treatment regimens.
Methods
One hundred eighty-two clinical isolates from 74 patients receiving bedaquiline and 163 isolates from 107 patients not exposed to bedaquiline were analysed. The bedaquiline MICs were tested using serial dilutions on 7H11 agar plates and the Bactec MGIT 960 system. The mmpR and atpE genes were sequenced by Sanger sequencing.
Results
The 7H11 agar method allowed for rapid discrimination between mutated and wild-type isolates and between exposed and non-exposed isolates. Seventy-three percent of bedaquiline-exposed isolates, as well as 91% of isolates with mutations, had an elevated bedaquiline MIC (≥ 0.12 mg/L on 7H11 media) compared to the reference isolates (89% had an MIC ≤ 0.03 mg/L). Previously reported in vitro-selected mutants (E61D and A63P) and novel AtpE substitutions (G25S and D28G) were observed in the clinical isolates. Substitutions in codon 63 of AtpE were likely associated with a higher bedaquiline MIC. Five new cases of pre-existing reduced susceptibility to bedaquiline, accompanied by mmpR mutations in most isolates, without a history of bedaquiline treatment were identified.
Conclusions
Bedaquiline treatment leads to an elevated bedaquiline MIC and the acquisition of mmpR and atpE gene mutations in tuberculosis strains. The standardisation of bedaquiline phenotypic susceptibility testing is urgently needed based on observed discrepancies between our study and previous studies and differences in solid and liquid media MIC determinations."

Objectives
The nature of past cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in multiple sclerosis (MS) populations is relatively unexplored. Relationships between CMV infection markers and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection markers in a UK resident population of people with MS (PwMS) and controls have been investigated.
Methods
CMV and EBV nuclear antigen-1(EBNA-1)/virus capsid antigen (VCA) IgG levels were determined for 78 MS patients and anonymised controls by enzyme immunoassays. CMV IgG levels were expressed as Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) units/ml (U/ml) and EBNA-1/VCA IgG levels as enzyme units/ml.
Results
CMV IgG seroprevalence was lower (p = 0.0003) in PwMS (35.9% [95%CI: 25.2–46.5]) compared to controls (62.9% [95%CI:54.4–71.4). CMV IgG geometric mean levels in PwMS (353 PEI U/ml [95%CI:272–457]) were lower (p = 0.03) compared to the controls (492 PEI U/ml [95%CI:405–599]). EBNA-1 IgG levels were higher (p < 0.0001) in PwMS compared to the controls and were lower (p = 0.238) in CMV seropositive PwMS (49.4 units/ml [95%CI:32.2–75.6]) compared to CMV seronegative PwMS (65.4 units/ml [95%CI:53.4–80.1]). These effects were not apparent with EBV VCA IgG.
Conclusions
Several aspects of CMV and EBV infection in PwMS appear to differ compared to controls. The potential immunomodulatory effect of CMV infection on MS disease and potential interactions with EBV require further investigation."

In the peri-elimination setting, the positive predictive value of trachomatous inflammation–follicular (TF), the primary marker used to determine need for antibiotics for trachoma, is suboptimal. Here, three non-TF measures are used to compare two regions where TF prevalence exceeds the threshold for intervention, but where the Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) prevalence is different.
Methods
Population prevalence of trachoma was measured in Vanuatu (n = 3470) and Kiribati (n = 2922). Dried blood spots (DBS) and conjunctival photographs were collected from every survey participant, and conjunctival swabs were collected from those aged 1–9 years. Individuals were tested for blood anti-Pgp3 antibodies, Ct DNA at the conjunctiva and severity of conjunctival scarring.
Results
The prevalence of TF in 1–9-year-olds was 16.5% in Vanuatu and 38.2% in Tarawa. 7% of people aged ≥1 year in Vanuatu had conjunctival scarring compared to 27% in Tarawa. The prevalence of ocular Ct infection in 1–9-year-olds was 1.5% in Vanuatu and 27.4% in Tarawa. The seroconversion rate amongst 1–9-year-old children in Vanuatu and Tarawa was 0.018 and 0.197 events per child per year, respectively.
Conclusions
Comparing Vanuatu to Tarawa demonstrates several markers that could be used to differentiate the trachoma status of populations in these (and other) locations."

abstract = "Background
The epidemiology of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is continuously changing in incidence, age distribution and/or the expansion of new strains of Neisseria meningitidis. The epidemiology of IMD due to group W (IMDW) has changed recently at a global level with the emergence of isolates belonging to the clonal complex ST-11 (CC11) derived from the South America-UK strain. A more recent change has been detected in France with the emergence of a new genotype distinct from CC11 that we aimed to analyse.
Methods
Epidemiological and microbiological surveillance data in France were used in combination with whole genome sequencing (WGS) to detect emerging phenotypes and genotypes of IMD causing strains, and their susceptibility to immunity induced by the 4CMenB vaccine. Transgenic mice expressing the human transferrin were used to analyse the virulence of emerging strain isolates by direct comparison with CC11 isolates.
Findings
Our data showed a local increase of IMDW isolates in north France since 2013. The isolates belonged to ST-9316 and few were ST-11 isolates. WGS clustered ST-9316 isolates together and were distantly separated from the isolates of the clonal complex ST-11 (CC11). Unlike cases due to W/CC11 isolates, cases due to W/ST-9316 isolates were mostly observed amongst infants under the age of 1 year but with lower mortality compared to W/CC11 cases. Genomic comparison showed that the W/ST-9316, unlike W/CC11 isolates, lacked the hmbR gene encoding the haemoglobin receptor that is a virulence factor involved in the acquisition of iron from haemoglobin. W/ST-9316 further showed lower virulence in mice compared to W/CC11 isolates.
Interpretation
We report the emergence of a novel sequence type (ST-9316) mostly associated with serogroup W, and exhibiting a lower virulence and a distinct age specific incidence profile than W/CC11 isolates. Surveillance requires powerful approaches combining WGS and pathophysiological analysis to adapt control measures."

abstract = "Background
Mycobacterium chimaera, one of the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) members, was recently identified using modern gene sequencing analysis. Unlike M. avium and M. intracellulare, little is known about the clinical features, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and treatment outcomes of M. chimaera lung disease.
Methods
This study was conducted in a medical center from December 2012 to July 2015. Patients who fulfilled the 2007 ATS/IDSA diagnostic criteria for nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease were enrolled. M. chimaera isolates were identified based on the findings of sequencing of rpoB gene, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the 16S–23S rRNA gene, and the heat-shock protein 65 gene (hsp65). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 13 antimicrobial agents were determined.
Results
During the study period, 247 patients with MAC lung disease were identified, and 11.3% (28/247) of the patients had lung disease caused by M. chimaera. Among these patients, 17 (60.7%) were female, and their median age was 72.5 (40–100) years. All M. chimaera isolates were susceptible to clarithromycin and rifabutin. All the isolates were resistant to moxifloxacin and only 10 (35.7%) and 2 (7.1%) were susceptible to amikacin and linezolid, respectively. Of the nine patients who received macrolide-based regimens, more achieved radiographic resolution than those treated with non-macrolide-based regimens (66.7% vs. 15.8%, P = 0.013), and they tended to have better survival (P = 0.10).
Conclusions
A substantial portion (11.3%) of MAC lung disease cases were caused by M. chimaera, and treatment with macrolide-based regimens resulted in better clinical outcomes for patients with M. chimaera lung disease."

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of hospitalization in young children, but there are little data on RSV infections in early childhood in the community. We conducted a prospective population-based birth-cohort study to determine the rates and characteristics of RSV infections in young children.
Methods
We followed 923 children for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) from birth to age 24 months with daily diaries and study clinic visits. Nasal swab samples were obtained at the onset of ARIs and analyzed for RSV by RT-PCR and antigen tests. The rates of RSV infections and associated outcomes were estimated.
Results
RSV was detected in 289 (6%) of 4728 ARIs with a nasal sample. The mean estimated annual rate of RSV infections was 37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 35–38) per 100 children at age 0–24 months. For RSV-associated outcomes, the estimated annual rates per 100 children were 34 (95% CI, 32–37) physician visits, 16 (95% CI, 15–17) antibiotic treatments, 12 (95% CI, 11–13) acute otitis media, and 6 (95% CI, 4–7) wheezing illnesses. The prevalence of RSV was 0.6% in asymptomatic children.
Conclusions
RSV infections impose a high burden of disease in healthy young children in the community."

Backgrounds
Reliable non-invasive methods for measuring body temperature are essential for the diagnosis and monitoring of infectious disease.
Methods
This study used Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and the Bland- Altman plot to analyse the agreement between temperature measurements using an ingestible capsule sensor, a skin sensor and two non-invasive peripheral temperature measurements (axillary and infrared non-contact), collected from a population of febrile patient admitted for infectious disease.
Results
Of the 77 febrile patients screened, 26 patients were enrolled. The ICC between axillary temperature measurements (Taxi) vs. non-contact measurements (Tno-c) were 0.34 [−0.18; 0.63], 0.87 [0.55; 0.94] between Taxi vs. ingestible capsule measurements (Tcap) and 0.12 [−0.09; 0.37] between Taxi vs. Tetac. The mean difference between Taxi vs Tno-c was −1.18 °C with limits of agreement (LoA) from −2.96 to 0.58 °C. The mean difference between Taxi vs Tcap was 0.48 °C, with LoA from −0.60 to 1.56 °C. The mean difference between Taxi vs Tetac was −4.23 °C with LoA from −7.22 to −1.23 °C.
Conclusions
Ingestible capsule measurements are reliable enough to adequately estimate the core body temperature in clinical practice. Its non-invasiveness, and the real-time remote control offer new opportunities for future research into fever during infectious diseases."

Objective
To describe an injecting network of PWID living in an isolated community on the Isle of Wight (UK) and the results of a agent-based simulation, testing the effect of Hepatitis C (HCV) treatment on transmission.
Method
People who inject drugs (PWID) were identified via respondent driven sampling and recruited to a network and bio-behavioural survey. The injecting network they described formed the baseline population and potential transmission pathways in an agent-based simulation of HCV transmission and the effects of treatment over 12 months.
Results
On average each PWID had 2.6 injecting partners (range 0–14) and 137 were connected into a single component. HCV in the network was associated with a higher proportion of positive injecting partners (p = 0.003) and increasing age (p = 0.011). The treatment of well-connected PWID led to significantly fewer new infections of HCV than treating at random (10 vs. 7, p<0.001). In all scenarios less than one individual was re-infected.
Conclusion
In our model the preferential treatment of well-connected PWID maximised treatment as prevention. In the real-world setting, targeting treatment to actively injecting PWID, with multiple injecting partners may therefore represent the most efficient elimination strategy for HCV."

Apheresis has been used as adjunctive treatment of severe falciparum malaria, loiasis and babesiosis. This systematic review aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of apheresis in the treatment of these conditions.
Methods
MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE and CINAHL databases were searched to identify studies published between January 1969 and March 2018 involving patients treated using apheresis for severe falciparum malaria, loiasis or babesiosis. Data extracted included details about the apheresis intervention, populations, study methods and outcomes relating to efficacy and safety.
Results
A total of 67 publications met the inclusion criteria and were included in the data synthesis, 36 for malaria (70 cases), 17 for babesiosis (22 cases) and 14 for loiasis (34 cases). Publications were case reports, case series, and cohort studies; there were no randomised controlled trials identified. Potential publication bias was considered to be high.
Conclusions
Systematic review of the literature suggests that apheresis may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of patients hospitalised for babesiosis, and prior to chemotherapy in loiasis with microfilarial count >8000 parasites/mL. Data does not support the use of apheresis in patients with severe falciparum malaria."

Objectives
We conducted a systematic meta-analysis to evaluate the incidence, temporal trends and potential risk factors for prosthetic joint infection (PJI) following primary total shoulder replacement (TSR) and elbow replacement (TER).
Methods
Longitudinal studies reporting infection outcomes following primary TSR or TER were sought from MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library up to June 2019. Incidence rates and relative risks (with 95% CIs) were calculated.
Results
The search identified 105 eligible articles (108 non-overlapping studies). There were 631,854 TSRs (1,751 PJIs) and 17,485 TERs (525 PJIs). The pooled PJI incidence following TSR was 0.61% (0.34–0.93) over a follow-up period of 1.1 years. The corresponding incidence following TER was 2.53% (1.99–3.12) over a follow-up period of 3.3 years. Shoulder and elbow PJI incidence declined from the 1990s to 2010 and beyond. Males, younger age (<75 years), previous shoulder surgery, reverse TSR, rotator cuff arthropathy and inpatient TSR increased shoulder PJI risk. For TER, high body mass index, psychiatric illness, and previous elbow surgery increased PJI risk.
Conclusions
Shoulder and elbow PJI may be on a temporal decline. Caution should be taken for patients at high PJI risk following primary TSR such as younger males and patients with a previous shoulder surgery."

To map genomic diversity of Measles virus (MeV) isolates collected during 2009–2017 from ten states of India.
Methods
Genome sequencing of Indian isolates and comparative genomics with global MeV using phylogeny, population stratification and selection pressure approaches were performed.
Results
The first report of complete genome sequences of forty-three Indian MeV isolates belonging to genotypes D4 (eight) and D8 (thirty-five). Three Indian isolates mapped to named strains D4-Enfield, D8-Villupuram and D8-Victoria. Indian D4 isolates deviate from standard genome length due to indels in M-F intergenic region. Estimated nucleotide substitution rates of Indian MeV derived using genome and individual genes are lower than that of global isolates. Phylogeny revealed genotype-based temporal clustering, suggesting existence of two lineages of D4 and three lineages of D8 in India. Absence of spatial clustering suggests role of cross-border travel in MeV transmission.
Conclusions
Evolutionary analyses suggest the need for surveillance of MeV in India, particularly in view of diversified trajectories of D4 and D8 isolates. This study contributes to global measles epidemiology and indicates no major impact on antigenicity in Indian isolates, thereby substantiating the use of current vaccines to meet measles elimination target of 2023 set by World Health Organization for South-East Asia Region."

Methods
We conducted a retrospective study of adult patients who underwent lung transplantation (2013–2016) at our hospital. Donor-derived bacterial infection was defined as the isolation of the same bacteria with identical antibiotic susceptibility patterns in the recipient and the perioperative cultures from the donor during the first month posttransplantation. We utilized a preventive antibiotic strategy adapted to the bacteria identified in donor cultures using systemic and nebulized antibiotics.
Results
252 lung transplant recipients and 243 donors were included. In 138/243 (56.8%) donors, one bacterial species was isolated from at least one sample; graft colonization (118/243; 48.6%), blood cultures (5/243; 2.1%) and the contamination of preservation fluids (56/243; 23%). Multidrug-resistant bacteria were isolated from 12/243 (4.9%) donors; four Enterobacterales, four Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, three Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. There was no transmission of these multidrug-resistant bacteria. Donor-derived infections, primarily tracheobronchitis due to non-MDR bacteria, were diagnosed in 7/253 (2.9%) recipients, with good clinical outcomes.

Objectives
Exposure to cigarette smoke impacts on the virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) by mechanisms including induction of biofilm formation. Most studies, however, have focused on individual strains of the pneumococcus. Accordingly, the current study has investigated the commonality of the pneumococcal stress response to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC), using five different strains of the pathogen.
Methods
Following exposure to CSC at final concentrations of 80 and 160 µg mL−1 during a 16 h incubation period, biofilm formation was measured using a crystal violet-based spectrophotometric procedure. Expression of stress genes seemingly linked to biofilm formation viz. hk11 and rr11 [histidine kinase and response regulator of the two-component regulatory system 11 (TCS11) respectively], cat eff (cation efflux system protein), abc (ATP-binding component of an ATP-binding cassette transporter) and 2005-hyp (hypothetical gene) was measured by sequential extraction of RNA, cDNA synthesis and real-time qPCR.
Results
Exposure of all five strains of the pneumococcus to CSC, resulted in significant biofilm formation, as well as induction of all five test stress genes.
Conclusions
Augmentation of induction of selective stress genes and biofilm formation are common, possibly linked, responses of various serotypes of the pneumococcus to CSC, favouring both persistence of the pathogen and decreased efficacy of antibiotics."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) typically presents as meningitis, septicaemia or both. Atypical clinical presentations are rare but well-described. We aimed to assess the relationship between meningococcal capsular group, age, clinical presentation, diagnosis and outcome among IMD cases diagnosed in England during 2014.
Methods
Public Health England conducts enhanced national surveillance of IMD in England. Clinical data for laboratory-confirmed MenB, MenW and MenY cases in ≥5 year-olds were used to classify presenting symptoms, diagnosis and outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent associations between meningococcal capsular group, clinical presentation, gender, age and death.
Results
In 2014, there were 340 laboratory-confirmed IMD cases caused by MenB (n = 179), MenW (n = 95) and MenY (n = 66). Clinical presentation with meningitis alone was more prevalent among MenB cases (28%) and among 15–24 year-olds (20%), whilst bacteraemic pneumonia was most prevalent among MenY cases (26%) and among ≥65 year-olds (24%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded preceding or during presentation in 15% (40/269) cases with available information, including 5% (7/140) MenB, 17% (8/47) MenY and 30% (25/82) MenW cases. Upper respiratory tract symptoms were reported in 16% (22/141) MenB, 23% (11/47) MenY and 31% (26/84) MenW cases. Increasing age was also independently associated with bacteraemic meningococcal pneumonia, with no cases among 5–14 year-olds compared to 24% in ≥65 year-olds. Case fatality rates increased with age but no significant associations with death were identified.
Conclusions
Healthcare professionals should be aware of the atypical clinical presentations associated with the less prevalent meningococcal capsular groups in different age-groups."

Guidelines for antibiotic treatment of acute cholecystitis are based on studies using culture techniques for microbial identification. Microbial culture has well described limitations and more comprehensive data on the microbial spectrum may support adjustments of these recommendations. We used next generation sequencing to conduct a thorough microbiological characterization of bile-samples from patients with moderate and severe acute cholecystitis.
Methods
We prospectively included patients with moderate and severe acute cholecystitis, undergoing percutaneous or perioperative drainage of the gall bladder. Bile samples were analyzed using both culture and deep sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA and rpoB genes and the fungal ITS2-segment. Clinical details were evaluated by medical record review.
Results
Thirty-six patients with moderate and severe acute cholecystitis were included. Bile from 31 (86%) of these contained bacteria (29) and/or fungi (5) as determined by sequencing. Culture identified only 40 (38%) of the 106 microbes identified by sequencing. In none of the 15 polymicrobial samples did culture detect all present microbes. Frequently identified bacteria often missed by culture included oral streptococci, anaerobic bacteria, enterococci and Enterobacteriaceae other than Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli.
Conclusions
Culture techniques display decreased sensitivity for the microbial diagnostics of acute cholecystitis leaving possible pathogens undetected."

Objective
To assess survival and identify predictors of survival more than 30-days after discharge in a cohort of consecutive patients diagnosed with pneumococcal pneumonia.
Methods
Observational study including all consecutive immunocompetent adult patients surviving more than 30-days after hospitalization. The bacteriological diagnosis was based on the results of urinary antigen testing and/or blood culture. Life expectancy was calculated for each patient considering their sex, age and date of discharge.
Results
We included 1114 patients that survived more than 30- days after discharge. Of them, 431 (38.6%) died during follow-up (median follow-up of 6.7 years). Age, history of cancer, liver disease, chronic renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, atrial arrhythmia and coronary disease, red cell distribution width (RDW) > 15%, positive blood culture, hematocrit < 30% and living in a nursing home were independent risk factors for reduced long-term survival after hospital discharge. Cumulative 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 93.9%, 85.3% and 76%, respectively. Among non-survivors, 361 (83.8%) died earlier than expected given their life expectancy.
Conclusions
Survival after hospital discharge is mainly associated with age and comorbidities. The findings of bacteremia and elevated RDW on admission could help identify patients at high risk of long-term mortality."

In multiple countries, endovascular/disseminated Mycobacterium chimaera infections have occurred in post-cardiac surgery patients in association with contaminated, widely-distributed cardiac bypass heater-cooler devices. To contribute to long-term characterization of this recently recognized infection, we describe the clinical course of 28 patients with 3–7 years of follow-up for survivors.
Methods
Identified at five hospitals in the United States 2010–2016, post-cardiac surgery patients in the cohort had growth of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)/M. chimaera from a sterile site or surgical wound, or a clinically compatible febrile illness with granulomatous inflammation on biopsy. Case follow-up was conducted in May 2019.
Results
Of 28 patients, infection appeared to be localized to the sternum in four patients. Among 18 with endovascular/disseminated infection who received combination anti-mycobacterial treatment and had sufficient follow-up, 39% appeared to have controlled infection (>12 months), 56% died, and one patient is alive with relapsed bacteremia. While the number of patients is small and interpretation is limited, four (67%) of six patients who had cardiac prosthesis removal/replacement appeared to have controlled infection compared to three (25%) of 12 with retained cardiac prosthesis (p >0.14; Fisher's exact test).
Conclusions
Given poor response to treatment and potential for delayed relapses, post-cardiac surgery M. chimaera infection warrants aggressive treatment and long-term monitoring."

Background
Neisseria meningitidis is a rare cause of acute bacterial conjunctivitis but can progress to invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in the case and their close contacts. There is, however, a lack of consensus on the clinical and public health management of primary meningococcal conjunctivitis (PMC).
Methods
We searched Ovid MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE and NHS evidence (up to June 2019) for all publications relating to meningococcal conjunctivitis to provide an evidence-base for developing guidelines for the management of PMC cases and their close contacts.
Results
The review identified a 10–29% risk of IMD among PMC cases within two days of onset of eye infection (range: 3 h to 4 days). In one study, the risk of IMD in PMC cases treated with systemic antibiotics was 19 times lower than topical antibiotics alone (p = 0.001). IMD among close contacts of PMC cases is uncommon but potentially fatal. Whether meningococcal vaccination for PMC cases or close contacts provides any additional benefit is unclear.
Conclusions
Systemic antibiotic treatment significantly reduces the risk of invasive disease in PMC cases, while antibiotic chemoprophylaxis for close contacts will reduce their risk of secondary IMD. These findings need to be highlighted in relevant clinical and public health guidelines."

Objectives
To evaluate the complement related pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) PTX3, MBL, CL-11, ficolin-2 and -3, along with the established marker CRP, to predict 28-day mortality and disease severity of sepsis in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
Methods
In a single-center, prospective, observational study 547 patients were included over a period of 18 months. Blood samples were obtained at admission to the ICU and the following 4 days.
Results
PTX3 baseline levels were significantly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors, whereas MBL and ficolin-2 levels were significantly lower in non-survivors compared to survivors. A PTX3 level above the median was independently associated with 28-day mortality in the adjusted analysis including age, sex, chronic disease and immunosuppression (HR 1.87, 95% CI [1.41–2.48], p < 0.0001), while a MBL level above the median was associated with increased chance of survival (HR 0.75, 95% CI [0.57–0.98], p = 0.034). Ficolin-2 was only borderline significant (HR 0.79, 95% CI [0.60–1.03], p = 0.084). In a ROC analysis PTX3 was superior to CRP in predicting septic shock.
Conclusions
PTX3, MBL and CRP levels were independently associated with 28-day mortality in ICU patients. PTX3 was a better marker of septic shock compared to CRP."

Dissemination of methicillin-resistant-Staphylococcus aureus/(MRSA) is a worldwide concern both in hospitals [healthcare-associated-(HA)-MRSA] and communities [community-associated-(CA)-MRSA]. Knowledge on when and where MRSA colonization is acquired and what clones are involved is necessary, to focus efforts for prevention of hospital-acquired MRSA-infections.
Methods
A prospective/longitudinal cohort study was performed in eight Argentina hospitals (Cordoba/ October-December/2014). Surveillance cultures for MRSA (nose-throat-inguinal) were obtained on admission and at discharge. MRSA strains were genetically typed as CA-MRSAG and HA-MRSAG genotypes.
Results
Overall, 1419 patients were screened and 534 stayed at hospital for ≥3 days. S. aureus admission prevalence was 30.9% and 4.2% for MRSA. Overall MRSA acquisition rate was 2.3/1000 patient-days-at-risk with a MRSA acquisition prevalence of 1.96% (95%CI: 1.0%-3.4%); 3.2% of patients were discharged back to community with MRSA. CA-MRSAG accounted for 84.6% of imported, 100.0% of hospital-acquired and 94% of discharged MRSA strains. Most imported and acquired MRSA strains belonged to two major epidemic CA-MRSA clones spread in Argentina: PFGEtypeI-ST5-IVa-t311-PVL+ and PFGEtypeN/ST30-IVc-t019-PVL+.
Conclusions
CA-MRSA clones, particularly ST5-IV-PVL+ and ST30-IV-PVL+, with main reservoir in the community, not only enter but also are truly acquired within hospital, causing healthcare-associated-hospital-onset infections, having a transmission capacity greater or similar than HA-MRSAG. This information is essential to develop appropriate MRSA infection prevention-control programs, considering hospital and community."

abstract = "Summary
Purpose
Prognostic biomarkers help triage initial patients and inform targeted therapy selection. Here, we explored the role of progranulin (PGRN)—implicated in processes ranging from inflammation to neurodegeneration—in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
Methods
A prospective observational cohort study was conducted during 2017. Patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation and/or had septic shock and were discharged from the hospital were cohort II. Those who died at the hospital were cohort III. Remaining patients discharged from the hospital were cohort I. The primary endpoint was that patients progressed to served as cohort II; the secondary endpoint was that patients progressed to served as cohort III. Serum PGRN levels were detected by ELISA.
Results
A total of 280 patients constituted the study cohort. 194 (69.3%) were categorized into cohort I, 61 (21.8%) were categorized into cohort II, and 25 (8.9%) were categorized into cohort III. Serum PGRN levels were increased in CAP patients, independently of etiology. Adjusting for clinical parameters, the odds ratios (95%CI) of cohort III and combined cohort II–III were 34.968 (3.743–326.692) and 3.741 (1.496–9.351), respectively, comparing lowest-to-highest quartile PGRN levels. PGRN exhibited high accuracy in predicting 30-day mortality, with AUC 0.862. PGRN combined with CURB-65 or PSI significantly improved prediction performance. Cox proportional regression analysis showed PGRN was an independent predictor for 30-day mortality risk. Cox survival curves confirmed PGRN ≥89.51 ng/mL had a significantly higher mortality rate than PGRN <89.51 ng/mL.
Conclusion
Higher PGRN levels at admission were associated with higher odds of poor prognosis. PGRN can improve the prognostic power of CURB-65 or PSI, so PGRN could be apparently a prognostic biomarker for assisting triage of CAP patients."

abstract = "Objectives
For the past decade, the epidemic of multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) stays high in China. We investigated the possible driving forces behind the epidemics from phylogenetic and historical perspectives.
Methods
420 representative strains were selected from the first national drug resistance survey based on their genotypes, drug susceptibility patterns and geographic information. We reconstructed the phylogeny by whole genome sequencing and compared it to the global phylogeny including MDR outbreaks reported in other settings. We estimated the historical trajectory of population dynamics by Bayesian Skygrid plot for all strains and MDR-TB alone. Integrating geographic information and mutations in drug resistance related genes, we investigated the spatial scale of transmission, recent selection of drug resistant mutant, and mechanism for fitness restoration.
Results
Three new subgroups within Beijing clade are described for the first time, but none of the MDR-TB outbreak strains reported in other high MDR-TB burden settings is identified. The overall epidemics experienced two successive phases of expansion at different rates between 1660s and 1950s, followed by a sharp decline till today. Four fifths of the clustered MDR-TB strains suggest transmission of DR strains and nearly half suggest recent selection of (additional) mutations in rpoB. Among all identified transmission events, about one fifth occurred between far distant locations. Possible intergenic and intragenic compensatory mutations both presented in our dataset at comparable frequencies.
Conclusions
MDR-TB epidemic in China is not yet driven by the spread of a few highly successful clonal expansions but by repeated emergence of smaller and currently less successful clusters. However, internal migration and undertreatment could escalate MDR-TB epidemic. To prevent generating of drug resistance and restoration of fitness as well as to stop transmission of MDR-TB at early stage, national TB control program needs to strengthen management of floating populations and promote universal drug susceptibility testing in China."

Aside from essential nutrients, immune cells and bioactive components, breast milk also contains a diverse range of microbes, which are important for maintaining mammary and infant health. In this review, we summarise studies that have investigated the composition of the breast milk microbiota and factors that might influence it. We identified 44 studies investigating 3105 breast milk samples from 2655 women. Several studies reported that the bacterial diversity is higher in breast milk than infant or maternal faeces. The maximum number of each bacterial taxonomic level detected per study was 58 phyla, 133 classes, 263 orders, 596 families, 590 genera, 1300 species and 3563 operational taxonomic units. Furthermore, fungal, archaeal, eukaryotic and viral DNA was also detected. The most frequently found genera were Staphylococcus, Streptococcus Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas, Bifidobacterium, Corynebacterium, Enterococcus, Acinetobacter, Rothia, Cutibacterium, Veillonella and Bacteroides. There was some evidence that gestational age, delivery mode, biological sex, parity, intrapartum antibiotics, lactation stage, diet, BMI, composition of breast milk, HIV infection, geographic location and collection/feeding method influence the composition of the breast milk microbiota. However, many studies were small and findings sometimes contradictory. Manipulating the microbiota by adding probiotics to breast milk or artificial milk offers an exciting avenue for future interventions to improve infant health."

Neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia, with death often occurring rapidly after onset of the first symptoms. Later death can also occur, but may be due to other causes, such as underlying comorbidities. The study aimed to assess the timing and cause of death in patients with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) prior to the introduction of two new meningococcal immunisation programmes in England.
Methods
Public Health England (PHE) conducts IMD surveillance in England through its national meningococcal reference unit. Laboratory-confirmed IMD cases diagnosed during 2008–2015 were linked to weekly and annual electronic death registration records as well as the Patient Demographic Service (PDS) database.
Results
Overall, 6734 of 6808 (99%) laboratory-confirmed IMD cases matched to PDS, including 668 fatalities. Of these, 667 linked to an annual death registration record compared to 405 reports linked to weekly death registrations. In total, 429/667 (64%) of all deaths and 428/502 (85%) of IMD-related deaths occurred within one day of diagnosis. In total, 498/667 (75%) deaths had occured by 30 days after IMD diagnosis and 98% (490/498) of these were IMD-related. Serogroup B contributed to 64% (323/502) of IMD-related deaths, followed by serogroup W (84/502, 17%) and serogroup Y (70/502, 14%). Deaths occurring after 30 days were less likely to be IMD-related, mainly amongst ≥65 year-olds, with malignancy, chronic respiratory and cardiac conditions predominating.
Conclusions
Most IMD-related deaths occurred within a day of diagnosis and nearly all IMD-related deaths occurred within 30 days of diagnosis. The rapidity of death highlights the importance of prevention through vaccination."

abstract = "Objective
The objective of this works was to assess the global prevalence of multidrug-resistance among A. baumannii causing hospital-acquired (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and describe its associated mortality.
Methods
We performed a systematic search of four databases for relevant studies. Meta-analysis was done based on United Nations geoscheme regions, individual countries and study period. We used a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence and mortality estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), weighted by study size.
Results
Among 6445 reports screened, we identified 126 relevant studies, comprising data from 29 countries. The overall prevalence of multidrug-resistance among A. baumannii causing HAP and VAP pooled from 114 studies was 79.9% (95% CI 73.9–85.4%). Central America (100%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (100%) had the highest prevalence, whereas Eastern Asia had the lowest (64.6%; 95% CI, 50.2–77.6%). The overall mortality estimate pooled from 27 studies was 42.6% (95% CI, 37.2–48.1%).
Conclusions
We observed large amounts of variation in the prevalence of multidrug-resistance among A. baumannii causing HAP and VAP and its mortality rate among regions and lack of data from many countries. Data from this review can be used in the development of customized strategies for infection control and antimicrobial stewardship."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Although primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitos, Zika virus (ZIKV) can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, due to the fact that some of the infected donors can establish asymptomatic viremia. ZIKV seroprevalence in Brazilian blood donors is unknown. The main reason for this gap in the knowledge originates from the difficulty in evaluating ZIKV humoral immunity due to antigenic cross-reactivity between the different Brazilian flaviviruses and, in particular, dengue virus (DENV). The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-ZIKV IgG prevalence in blood donors from the Northeast region of the São Paulo State, Brazil, which experienced a ZIKV outbreak in 2016.
Methods
We evaluated the ZIKV seroprevalence using the NS1 anti-ZIKV IgG test (Euroimmun), followed by confirmation of the positive and borderline results using the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT). ZIKV seroprevalence was estimated by testing plasma samples collected in 2015 (before the ZIKV outbreak), 2016 (during the outbreak) and 2017 (after the outbreak). In order to investigate possible antigenic cross – reactivity between ZIKV and DENV we also included samples that were taken well before the ZIKV outbreak, in years 2010 and 2013.
Results
The results obtained by the Euroimmun anti-ZIKV IgG test demonstrated ZIKV seroreactivity in 2015, 2016, and 2017 with prevalences of 5.3%, 12.8% and 13.2%, respectively. The inclusion of blood donor samples from 2010 to 2013, demonstrated anti-ZIKV IgG reactivity only for 2013 (1.7%). The PRNT testing of the ZIKV positive and borderline ELISA reacting samples generated positive results only for the years of 2016 and 2017 (prevalences of 5.6% and 9.1%) which coincided with the introduction of ZIKV in our region.
Conclusions
Our results estimate for the first time the ZIKV seroprevalence among Brazilian blood donors from a region with apparently extensive ZIKV circulation and which, at the same time, is highly endemic for DENV. We detected relatively low ZIKV seroprevalence in blood donors from the studied region probably due to the lower intensity of the outbreak compared to other Brazilian locations. Our study adds to the global understanding of ZIKV circulation and the herd immunity of the exposed population."

Two Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (NmB) vaccines are licensed in the United States. To estimate their potential coverage, we examined the vaccine antigen diversity among meningococcal isolates prior to vaccine licensure.
Methods
NmB vaccine antigen genes of invasive isolates collected in the U.S. from 2009 to 2014 were characterized by Sanger or whole-genome sequencing.
Results
During 2009–2014, the predominant antigen types have remained similar to those reported in 2000–2008 for NmB and 2006–2008 for NmC, NmY, with the emergence of a few new types. FHbp of subfamily B or variant 1 (B/v1) remained prevalent among NmB whereas FHbp of subfamily A or variant 2 and 3 (A/v2-3) were more prevalent among non-NmB. FHbp peptide 1 (B24/1.1) remains the most prevalent type in NmB. Full-length NadA peptide was detected in 26% of isolates, primarily in NmB and NmW. The greatest diversity of NhbA peptides was detected among NmB, with p0005 as the most prevalent type.
Conclusions
The prevalence and diversity of the NmB vaccine antigens have remained stable with common antigen types persisting over time. The data collected prior to NmB vaccine licensure provide the baseline to understand the potential impact of NmB vaccines on antigen diversity and strain coverage."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
Few data exist regarding the impact of antimicrobial stewardship programs on antifungal use. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a comprehensive long-term antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) focused on antifungal use.
Methods
During a 9-year period, we quarterly assessed antifungal consumption, incidence density of hospital-acquired candidemia, Candida spp. distribution, antifungal resistance, and crude death rate per 1000 occupied bed days (OBDs) of hospital-acquired candidemia. We performed segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series.
Results
A significant change in trend was observed for antifungal consumption, with a sustained reduction of -0.87% per quarter (95% confidence interval [CI], −1.36 −0.38, p < 0.001), accounting for a final reduction of −38.4%. The main reduction was produced in fluconazole, with a sustained reduction of −1.37% per quarter (95%CI, −1.96 −0.68, p<0.001). The incidence density of hospital-acquired candidemia decreased, with a change in slope of −5.06% cases per 1000 OBDs per year (95%CI, −8.23 −1.77, p = 0.009). The 14-day crude death rate per 1000 OBDs dropped from 0.044 to 0.017 (−6.36% deaths per 1000 OBDs per year; 95%CI, −13.45 −1.31, p = 0.09).
Conclusions
This ASP has succeeded in optimizing the use of antifungal with a long-lasting reduction without increasing the incidence, neither the mortality, of hospital-acquired candidemia."

Here, we report the characteristics and outcomes of 39 patients with active HBV infection and B-cell NHL collected retrospectively in France and Italy. We also compared their characteristics with those of HCV-positive patients with NHL. The gender ratio (M/F) was 3.3 and the median age at NHL diagnosis, 59 years. The pathological distribution was 24 (62%) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) and 15 (38%) other lymphomas subtypes: marginal zone lymphoma (n = 6), follicular lymphoma (n = 3), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 2), Burkitt's lymphoma (n = 1), and not otherwise specified low-grade B-NHL (n = 3). Treatment included antiviral therapy for 35 patients (90%). Twenty-two (92%) DLBCL patients received an R-CHOP or R-CHOP-like regimen, leading to complete remission for 18 (75%).At one year, 21 DLBCL patients (88%) were alive, and 13 other B-cell lymphoma patients (87%) were alive. This European study underscores the predominance of DLBCL among patients with active HBV infection and their similar outcomes to non-HBV infected patients with DLBCL when treated with R-CHOP and antivirals."

this study aims to identify the potential marker for hepatic cystic echinococcosis (CE) activity.
Methods
totally 97 CE patients and 47 health control (HC) subjects were included. Based on the ultrasound (US) images, CE patients were further categorized as active CE (ACE; 52 cases) and inactive CE (IACE; 45 cases). The sST2 and IL (interleukin)-33 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Univariate, multivariate and subgroup analysis were performed. The relationship between sST2 and CE activity was analyzed by the smooth curve fitting. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was also performed.
Results
the serum sST2 level in the CE patients was significantly higher than the HC subjects. Moreover, there was significant difference in the serum sST2 level between the ACE and IACE group. However, no significant difference was observed in the IL-33 level between the ACE and IACE groups. Univariate analysis showed that CE activity was significantly correlated with the sST2 level when the sST2 was greater than 1496.6 pg/mL. Multivariable analysis after adjustment for potential confounding factors, and subgroup analysis showed that sST2 had independent effect on CE activity. ROC curve showed that sST2 could differentially diagnose CE activity at the cut-off value of 1246.550 pg/mL with an AUC of 0.770.
Conclusion
the sST2 could be used as a biomarker for hepatic CE activity. High levels of sST2 suggest that the hepatic CE is more likely to be active. Our findings have important guiding significance for the diagnosis of CE activity and the choice of treatment methods."

To elucidate the effects of meteorological variations on the activity of influenza A and B in 11 sites across different climate regions.
Methods
Daily numbers of laboratory-confirmed influenza A and B cases from 2011–2015 were collected from study sites where the corresponding daily mean temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and daily precipitation amount were used for boosted regression trees analysis on the marginal associations and the interaction effects.
Results
Cold temperature was a major determinant that favored both influenza A and B in temperate and subtropical sites. Temperature-to-influenza A, but not influenza B, exhibited a U-shape association in subtropical and tropical sites. High relative humidity was also associated with influenza activities but was less consistent with influenza B activity. Compared with relative humidity, absolute humidity had a stronger association - it was negatively associated with influenza B activity in temperate zones, but was positively associated with both influenza A and B in subtropical and tropical zones.
Conclusion
The association between meteorological factors and with influenza activity is virus type specific and climate dependent. The heavy influence of temperature on influenza activity across climate zones implies that global warming is likely to have an impact on the influenza burden."

Clinicians have increasingly adopted the widespread use of topical agents to manage chronic wound infections, despite limited data on their effectiveness in vivo. This study sought to evaluate the evidence for commonly employed topical agents used in wounds for the purpose of treating chronic infections caused by biofilm.
Method
We included in vitro, animal and human in vivo studies where topical agents were tested for their efficacy against biofilms, for use in wound care. For human studies, we only included those which utilised appropriate identification techniques for visualising and confirming the presence of biofilms.
Result
A total of 640 articles were identified, with 43 included after meeting eligibility. In vitro testing accounted for 90% (n = 39) of all included studies, five studies using animal models and three human in vivo studies. Sixteen different laboratory models were utilised, with the most frequent being the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC™) / well plate assay (38%, n = 15 of 39). A total of 44 commercially available topical agents were grouped into twelve categories with the most commonly tested agents being silver, iodine and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB). In vitro results on efficacy demonstrated iodine as having the highest mean log10 reductions of all agents (4.81, ±3.14).
Conclusion
There is large disparity in the translation of laboratory studies to researchers undertaking human trials relating to the effectiveness of commercially available topical agents. There is insufficient human in vivo evidence to definitively recommend any commercially available topical agent over another for the treatment of chronic wound biofilms. The heterogeneity identified between study designs (in vitro to in vivo) further limits the generalisability of results."

To estimate the time-dependent measles effective reproduction number (Rt) as an indicator of the impact of three outbreak response vaccination (ORV) campaigns on measles transmission during a nationwide outbreak in Guinea.
Methods
Rt represents the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a partially immune population during a given time period. Measles Rt was estimated using daily incidence data for 3952 outbreak-associated measles cases in Guinea in 2017 for the time periods prior to, between, and following each of three ORV campaigns using a simple and extensible mathematical model.
Results
Rt was estimated to be above the threshold value of 1 during the initial growth period of the outbreak until the first ORV campaign began on March 13 (Rt = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.55–1.67). It subsequently dropped below 1 and remained <1 through the end of the year (range: 0.71–0.91), although low levels of transmission persisted.
Conclusions
Reduction in Rt coincided with implementation of the ORV campaigns, indicating success of the campaigns at maintaining measles transmission intensity below epidemic growth levels. However, persistent measles transmission remains an issue in Guinea due to insufficient levels of herd immunity. Estimation of Rt should be further leveraged to help decision makers and field staff understand outbreak progress and the timing and type of vaccination efforts needed to halt transmission."

Microbiological diagnosis is essential during clinical management of focal infections. Metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) has been reported as a promising diagnostic tool in infectious diseases. However, little is known about the clinical utility of mNGS in focal infections.
Methods
We conducted a single-center retrospective study to investigate impact of mNGS on focal infection diagnosis and compared it with conventional methods, including culture, pathological examination, Xpert MTB/RIF, etc. 98 suspected focal infections cases were enrolled, and medical records were reviewed to determine their rates of detection, time-to-identification, and clinical outcomes.
Results
mNGS showed a satisfying diagnostic positive percent agreement of 86.30% (95% CI: 75.79–92.88%) in a variety of tissues, compared to 45.21% (95% CI: 33.68–57.24%) for culture and 57.53% (95% CI: 45.43–68.84%)f for conventional methods (p < 0.0125), and detected an extra 34 pathogenic microorganisms. Time requirement for pathogen identification using mNGS ranges from 31 h to 55 h, which showed an advantage over culture. (82.36 h; 95%CI: 65.83, 98.89; P < 0.05)
Conclusions
mNGS showed promising potential in pathogenic diagnosis during focal infections and might enable clinicians to make more timely and targeted therapeutic decisions."

To assess herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) epidemiology in Africa.
Methods
This systematic review was conducted per the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Findings were reported following the PRISMA guidelines. Research questions were addressed using random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions.
Results
Forty-three overall (and 69 stratified) HSV-1 seroprevalence measures, and 18 and eight proportions of HSV-1 viral detection in genital ulcer disease (GUD) and in genital herpes, respectively, were extracted from 37 reports. Pooled mean seroprevalence was 67.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 54.7–78.5%) in children, and 96.2% (95% CI: 95.0–97.3%) in adults. Across age groups, pooled mean was 44.4% (95% CI: 29.9–59.3%) in ≤5 years-old, 85.6% (95% CI: 81.0–89.6%) in 6–15 years-old, 93.3% (95% CI: 89.2–96.6%) in 16–25 years-old, and 93.8% (95% CI: 84.6–99.4%) in >25 years-old. Age explained 78.8% of seroprevalence variation. Pooled mean proportion of HSV-1 detection was 0.4% (95% CI: 0.0–1.5%) in GUD, and 1.2% (95% CI: 0.0–4.0%) in genital herpes.
Conclusions
HSV-1 is universally prevalent in Africa, at higher levels than other regions, with no evidence for declines in seroprevalence in recent decades. Nearly every person acquires the infection in childhood through oral-to-oral transmission, before sexual debut. Sexual oral-to-genital and genital-to-genital transmission appear very limited."

abstract = "Objectives
Travel-associated infections are challenging to diagnose because of the broad spectrum of potential aetiologies. As a proof-of-principle study, we used MNGS to identify viral pathogens in clinical samples from returning travellers in a single center to explore its suitability as a diagnostic tool.
Methods
Plasma samples from 40 returning travellers presenting with a fever of ≥38°C were sequenced using MNGS on the Illumina MiSeq platform and compared with standard-of-care diagnostic assays.
Results
In total, 11/40 patients were diagnosed with a viral infection. Standard of care diagnostics revealed 5 viral infections using plasma samples; dengue virus 1 (n = 2), hepatitis E (n = 1), Ebola virus (n = 1) and hepatitis A (n = 1), all of which were detected by MNGS. Three additional patients with Chikungunya virus (n = 2) and mumps virus were diagnosed by MNGS only. Respiratory infections detected by nasal/throat swabs only were not detected by MNGS of plasma. One patient had infection with malaria and mumps virus during the same admission.
Conclusions
MNGS analysis of plasma samples improves the sensitivity of diagnosis of viral infections and has potential as an all-in-one diagnostic test. It can be used to identify infections that have not been considered by the treating physician, co-infections and new or emerging pathogens.
Summary
Next generation sequencing (NGS) has potential as an all-in-one diagnostic test. In this study we used NGS to diagnose returning travellers with acute febrile illness in the UK, highlighting cases where the diagnosis was missed using standard methods."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) have already demonstrated clinical benefits. However, their effectiveness or safety in immunocompromised hosts needs to be proved.
Methods
An ecologic quasi-experimental study was performed from January 2009 to June 2017 in the Oncology department of a tertiary-care hospital. A stable program of Infectious Diseases consultation (IDC) already existed at this unit, and an educational ASP was added in 2011. Its main intervention consisted of face-to-face educational interviews. Antibiotic consumption was assessed through quarterly Defined Daily Doses (DDD) per 100 occupied bed-days. Mortality was evaluated in patients with bloodstream infections through the quarterly incidence density per 1000 admissions, and the annual mortality rates at 7 and 30-days. Time-trends were analysed through segmented-regression analysis, and the impact of the ASP was assessed through before-after interrupted time-series analysis.
Results
Mortality significantly decreased throughout the study period (−13.3% annual reduction for 7-day mortality rate, p < 0.01; −8.1% annual reduction for 30-day mortality, p = 0.03), parallel to a reduction in antibiotic consumption (quarterly reduction −0.4%, p = 0.01), especially for broader-spectrum antibiotics. The before-after study settled a significant inflexion point on the ASP implementation for the reduction of antibiotic consumption (change in level 0.95 DDD, p = 0.71; change in slope −1.98 DDD per quarter, p < 0.01). The decreasing trend for mortality before the ASP also continued after its implementation.
Conclusions
The combination of an ASP with IDC improved antibiotic use among patients with cancer, and was accompanied by a reduction of mortality of bacteraemic infections. Implementation of the ASP was necessary to effectively change antibiotic use."

The association of current smoking with influenza infection is not widely recognised. The aim of this systematic review was to summarise published evidence and quantify the risk of influenza infection in tobacco smokers compared to non-smokers.
Methods
We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and Web of Science, from inception to 7 November 2017, to identify relevant randomised control trials, cohort and case-control studies. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. We included studies defining influenza as a clinical syndrome and those using confirmatory microbiological tests. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were estimated by using random effects model.
Results
The mean quality score across the nine included studies (n = 40,685 participants) was 5.4 of 9 (SD 1.07). Current smokers were over 5 times more likely to develop laboratory-confirmed influenza than non-smokers (pooled OR 5.69 (95% CI 2.79–11.60), 3 studies). For studies reporting the occurrence of an influenza-like illness (ILI), current smokers were 34% more likely to develop ILI than non-smokers (pooled OR 1.34 (95% CI 1.13–1.59), 6 studies).
Conclusion
Current smokers have an increased risk of developing influenza compared to non-smokers. The association was strongest in studies examining cases with laboratory confirmed influenza."

An outbreak of an uncommon emm type (emm66.0) of group A streptococcus (GAS) occurred in England and Wales between January 2016 and May 2017, involving 52 individuals who were homeless or injecting drugs users. In order to investigate the outbreak, epidemiological and network analysis were performed; moreover 55 isolates (32 outbreak, 5 non-outbreak and 13 historical – 2005–2015) were tested with whole genome sequencing (WGS), antimicrobial resistance determination, Bayesian evolutionary analysis (BEAST). Forty one isolates (including 32 outbreak strains) belonged to a single emm66.0 clade (average SNP difference 6.6; range 0–16 SNPs) separate from the other isolates and two strains previously considered part of the outbreak (SNP average: 5876; range 93–8417 SNPs). Antibiotic resistance was not detected in the outbreak clone. No common source of infection was identified. WGS confirmed expansion of an emm66.0 clone in a hard-to-reach population and enabled refinement of the initial case definition."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Listeria monocytogenes-associated endovascular infections are not well characterized.
Methods
Retrospective study of 71 culture-proven cases reported to the French National Reference Center for Listeria from 1993 to 2018.
Results
Seventy-one cases were identified: 42 with vascular aneurysms/prosthetic infections, 27 with endocarditis, 2 with both. Fifty-eight were men (82%); median age was 75 years [46–92]; 93% reported co-morbidities (66/71), including 50% with immunosuppressive conditions. Vascular infections consisted of infected aneurysms (68%) or prosthetic graft infections (32%); vascular rupture was reported in 25/42 (60%). Tissue samples grew L. monocytogenes in 98% (43/44) and blood cultures in 64% (27/42). Endocarditis cases involved prosthetic or native valves or intracardiac devices in respectively 62% (18/29), 28% (8/29) and 10% (3/29). Infected valves were aortic (62%, 16/26), mitral (31%, 8/26) or both (8%, 2/26); 38% patients required surgery; 45% displayed heart failure; 17% had concomitant neurolisteriosis. In-hospital mortality in vascular infections was 12% (5/42) and 41% (12/29) for Lm-associated endocarditis.
Conclusions
Endovascular listeriosis is a rare but severe infection. It manifests as vascular infections and endocarditis, mostly in older patients with vascular or cardiac valve prosthetic devices and co-morbidities. Mortality in Lm-associated endocarditis is twice higher than with other pathogens, requiring prompt recognition and treatment."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
A second wave of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (HPAIV) H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 has spread globally, causing outbreaks among wild birds and domestic poultry since autumn 2016. The circulation and evolutionary dynamics of the virus remain largely unknown.
Methods
We performed surveillance for H5N8 in Qinghai Lake in China since the emergence of the virus (from 2016 to 2018). By analyzing recovered viruses in Qinghai Lake and all related viruses worldwide (449 strains), we identified the genotypes, estimated their genesis and reassortment, and evaluated their global distribution and transmission.
Results
Through surveillance of wild migratory birds around Qinghai Lake between 2016 and 2018, we revealed that the H5N8 was introduced into Qinghai Lake bird populations (QH-H5N8), with distinct gene constellations in 2016 and 2017. A global analysis of QH-H5N8-related viruses showed that avian influenza viruses with low pathogenicity in wild birds contributed to the high diversity of genotypes; the major reassortment events possibly occurred during the 2016 breeding season and the following winters.
Conclusions
Continued circulation of QH-H5N8-related viruses among wild birds has resulted in the global distribution of high genotypic diversity. Thus, these viruses pose an ongoing threat to wild and domestic bird populations and warrant continuous surveillance."

Objectives
To improve our understanding of the global epidemiology of common respiratory viruses by analysing their contemporaneous incidence at multiple sites.
Methods
2010–2015 incidence data for influenza A (IAV), influenza B (IBV), respiratory syncytial (RSV) and parainfluenza (PIV) virus infections were collected from 18 sites (14 countries), consisting of local (n = 6), regional (n = 9) and national (n = 3) laboratories using molecular diagnostic methods. Each site submitted monthly virus incidence data, together with details of their patient populations tested and diagnostic assays used.
Results
For the Northern Hemisphere temperate countries, the IAV, IBV and RSV incidence peaks were 2–6 months out of phase with those in the Southern Hemisphere, with IAV having a sharp out-of-phase difference at 6 months, whereas IBV and RSV showed more variable out-of-phase differences of 2–6 months. The tropical sites Singapore and Kuala Lumpur showed fluctuating incidence of these viruses throughout the year, whereas subtropical sites such as Hong Kong, Brisbane and Sydney showed distinctive biannual peaks for IAV but not for RSV and PIV.
Conclusions
There was a notable pattern of synchrony of IAV, IBV and RSV incidence peaks globally, and within countries with multiple sampling sites (Canada, UK, Australia), despite significant distances between these sites."

Although serogroup W ST-11 complex (cc11) (W:cc11) Neisseria meningitidis has been widespread in China over the past ten years, its origin and genetic relatedness has not yet been described. In this study, we described the genetic relatedness and discuss the possible origin of Chinese W:cc11 isolates by comparing their genome sequences with those of other cc11 strains globally. Comparative genomic analysis with geo-temporally diverse cc11 isolates showed that the Chinese W:cc11 isolates exclusively formed two closely related subclusters within a distinct sublineage (proposed as the Chinese-strain sublineage) of lineage 11.1 close to the interface between the Hajj-strain sublineage and the South American-strain sublineage. Several isolates from Africa and Europe were closely related to the Chinese subclusters which were largely segregated from one another among distinct provinces of China. No alleles were identified that were unique to the Chinese isolates as a whole, though each subcluster possessed unique alleles differentiating itself from the other subcluster as well as closely related isolates within the extended sublineage. Three genes differentiated the two subclusters with allele combinations that were each present among the non-Chinese isolates within the wider sublineage. These results indicate that the Chinese W:cc11 isolates formed part of a previously undescribed W:cc11 sublineage that is closely related to, but distinct from, the Hajj-strain sublineage and South American-strain sublineage. The geographical source of the Chinese subclusters was indeterminate based on available data."

abstract = "Objectives
The CURB-65 is a severity score to predict mortality secondary to community acquired pneumonia and is widely used to identify patients who can be managed as outpatients. However, whether CURB-65 can be applicable to COVID-19 patients for the decision of outpatient treatment is still unknown.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective single-centre study assessing the performance of the CURB-65 to predict the risk of poor outcome, defined as the need for mechanical ventilation and/or death, among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The association between the CURB-65 and the outcome was assessed by a univariable Cox proportional hazard regression model.
Results
A total of 279 patients were hospitalized between March 15th and April 14th, 2020. According to the CURB-65, 171 (61.3%) patients were considered at low risk (CURB-65 01), 66 (23.7%) at intermediate risk (CURB-65=2), and 42 (15.1%) had high risk of 30-day mortality (CURB-65 35). During the study period, 88 (31.5%) patients had a poor outcome. The CURB-65 was strongly associated with a poor outcome (Pfor linear trend <0.001). However, among patients with a CURB-65 of 01, thus considered at low risk, 36/171 (21.1%) had a poor outcome.
Conclusions
Our study suggests that the applicability of CURB-65 to guide the decision of inpatient or outpatient care is scarce, as it does not safely identify patients who could be managed as outpatients."

Adjunctive rifampicin did not reduce failure/recurrence/death as a composite endpoint in the ARREST trial of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, but did reduce recurrences. We investigated clinically-defined 14-day treatment failure, and recurrence and S. aureus-attributed/unattributed mortality by 12-weeks to further define their predictors.
Methods
A post-hoc exploratory analysis using competing risks models was conducted to identify sub-groups which might benefit from rifampicin. A points-based recurrence risk score was developed and used to compare rifampicin's benefits.
Results
Recurrence was strongly associated with liver and renal failure, diabetes and immune-suppressive drugs (p < 0.005); in contrast, failure and S. aureus-attributed mortality were associated with older age and higher neutrophil counts. Higher SOFA scores predicted mortality; higher Charlson scores and deep-seated initial infection focus predicted failure. Unexpectedly, recurrence risk increased with increasing BMI in placebo (p = 0.04) but not rifampicin (p = 0.60) participants (pheterogeneity = 0.06). A persistent focus was judged the primary reason for recurrence in 23(74%). A 5-factor risk score based on BMI, Immunosuppression, Renal disease, Diabetes, Liver disease (BIRDL) strongly predicted recurrence (p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Rifampicin reduces recurrences overall; those with greatest absolute risk reductions were identified using a simple risk score. Source control and adequate duration of antibiotic therapy remain essential to prevent recurrence and improve outcomes."

Background
There is an urgent need for new tools for the diagnosis of TB. We evaluated the usefulness recently described host biomarkers in supernatants from the newest generation of the QuantiFERON test (QuantiFERON Plus) as tools for the diagnosis of active TB.
Methods
We recruited individuals presenting at primary health care clinics in Cape Town, South Africa with symptoms requiring investigation for TB disease, prior to the establishment of a clinical diagnosis. Participants were later classified as TB or other respiratory diseases (ORD) based on the results of clinical and laboratory tests. Using a multiplex platform, we evaluated the concentrations of 37 host biomarkers in QuantiFERON Plus supernatants from study participants as tools for the diagnosis of TB.
Results
Out of 120 study participants, 35(29.2%) were diagnosed with active TB, 69(57.5%) with ORD whereas 16(13.3%) were excluded. 14(11.6%) of the study participants were HIV infected. Although individual host markers showed potential as diagnostic candidates, the main finding of the study was the identification of a six-marker biosignature in unstimulated supernatants (Apo-ACIII, CXCL1, CXCL9, CCL8, CCL-1, CD56) which diagnosed TB with sensitivity and specificity of 73.9%(95% CI; 51.6–87.8) and 87.6%(95% CI; 77.2–94.5), respectively, after leave-one-out cross validation. Combinations between TB-antigen specific biomarkers also showed potential (sensitivity of 77.3% and specificity of 69.2%, respectively), with multiple biomarkers being significantly different between TB patients, Quantiferon Plus Positive and Quantiferon Plus negative individuals with ORD, regardless of HIV status.
Conclusions
Biomarkers detected in QuantiFERON Plus supernatants may contribute to adjunctive diagnosis of TB."

Objectives
The risk of kidney dysfunction on the WHO recommended first line regimens containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) without protease inhibitors (PI) remains unclear in Asian patients, especially those with low body weight.
Methods
Using data collected in a multicenter clinical trial in Thailand and proportional hazard regression models, we compared the risk of a >25% estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reduction in HIV naïve patients initiating TDF or zidovudine (AZT) containing non-PI regimen.
Results
Of 640 patients included in the analysis, 461 (72%) received a TDF-containing regimen for a median 6.7 years and 179 (28%) an AZT-containing regimen for 6.5 years. The risk of a >25% eGFR reduction was not associated with treatment (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84–1.47, P = 0.46). In multivariate analysis, the risk of >25% eGFR reduction form baseline was associated with body weight at baseline (HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.48–3.02 for <48 kg patients and HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.20–2.25 for 48–59.9 kg patients, compared to those with >60 kg, P < 0.001) and hypertension (HR 4.03, 95% CI 2.0–8.0, P < 0.001). The effect of baseline weight on >25% eGFR reduction did not significantly vary with treatment (P = 0.27).
Conclusions
The risk of eGFR reduction was not higher on TDF- versus AZT-based non-PI regimens. Although the risk of eGFR reduction was greater for patients of lower body weight, this risk was not significantly increased by TDF."

abstract = "Summary
Estimated 2017 tuberculosis (TB) incidence is 10 million and mainly depends on the reservoir of individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI). QuantiferonⓇ-TB Gold in-Tube (QFT-GIT) is one of the tests used for LTBI detection. Since 2015 a new version, QuantiferonⓇ-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) is available.
Objectives
To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy for TB of QFT-Plus compared to QFT-GIT.
Methods
PubMed and Scopus were used to detect records related to predefined strings from 2015 to 2018. Full text articles dealing with the sensitivity and/or specificity of the QFT-Plus vs. QFT-GIT for active-TB and LTBI detection were analyzed. Scientific quality and risk of bias were assessed using QADAS-2.
Results
We selected 15 articles. Studies were mainly observational and cross-sectional, performed in 8 countries. Sample size differed in the TB group (27 to 164) compared to LTBI group (29 to 1031). Pooled sensitivity of QFT-Plus for active-TB was 0.94 (0.91 and 0.95 for TB1 and TB2, respectively), whereas pooled specificity for healthy status was 0.96. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for LTBI was 0.91 and 0.95, respectively.
Conclusions
We show that QFT-Plus is more sensitive compared to QFT-GIT for detecting M. tuberculosis infection, mainly due to TB2 responses."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Polymyxins (i.e., polymyxin B and colistin) are used as a last-line therapy to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae. Worryingly, polymyxin resistance in K. pneumoniae is increasingly reported worldwide. This study identified the genetic variations responsible for high-level colistin resistance in MDR K. pneumoniae clinical isolates.
Methods
Sixteen MDR K. pneumoniae isolates were obtained from stool samples of 8 patients before and after colistin treatment. Their genomes were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq to determine genetic variations.
Results
Fifteen of 16 isolates harboured ISKpn26-like element insertion at nucleotide position 75 of mgrB, abolishing its negative regulation on phoPQ; while colistin-susceptible ATH7 contained intact mgrB and phoQ. Interestingly, each of the 7 mgrB-disrupted, colistin-susceptible isolates contained a nonsynonymous substitution in PhoQ (G39S, L239P, N253T or V446G), potentially impairing its function and intergenically suppressing the effect caused by mgrB inactivation. Additionally, three of the 7 corresponding mgrB-disrupted, colistin-resistant isolates harboured a secondary nonsynonymous substitution in PhoQ (N253P, D438H or T439P).
Conclusions
This is the first report of phoQ mutations in mgrB-disrupted, colistin-susceptible K. pneumoniae clinical isolates. We also discovered multiple phoQ mutations in mgrB-disrupted, colistin-resistant strains. Our findings highlight the multifaceted molecular mechanisms of colistin resistance in K. pneumoniae."

Objectives
Systematic review of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) prevalence among rifampicin (RIF)-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) patients in 34 provinces of China was conducted to correlate RIF resistance with concurrent isoniazid (INH) resistance.
Methods
Database searches (PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal, Wanfang), identified drug resistance surveillance studies conducted between January 1, 2000 and June 30, 2018. Of 1554 records, random-effects meta-analysis of 34 studies of adequate methodological quality yielded 108,366 TB cases for MDR-TB prevalence analysis of RR-TB cases.
Results
MDR-TB prevalence among RR-TB cases varied from 57% (Xinjiang; 95% CI 47%, 67%) to 95% (Taiwan; 95% CI 92%, 98%), for a pooled national rate of 77% (95% CI 75%, 80%). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed greater MDR-TB prevalence in previously treated versus new RR-TB cases (P < 0.001), with no significant differences of regional initial drug resistance rates or sampling methods. Regional MDR-TB prevalence among RR-TB cases was lowest (69%) in the Northeast Region (95% CI 65%, 73%) and highest (90%) in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan (95% CI 81%, 98%).
Conclusions
In China, ∼77% of RR-TB cases are MDR-TB. Thus, RIF resistance cannot effectively predict MDR-TB. Highly variable RR-TB prevalence across China warrants improved TB management."

abstract = "Objectives
We evaluated the treatment outcome in late acute (LA) periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) treated with debridement and implant retention (DAIR) versus implant removal.
Methods
In a large multicenter study, LA PJIs of the hip and knee were retrospectively evaluated. Failure was defined as: PJI related death, prosthesis removal or the need for suppressive antibiotic therapy. LA PJI was defined as acute symptoms <3 weeks in patients more than 3 months after the index surgery and with a history of normal joint function.
Results
445 patients were included, comprising 340 cases treated with DAIR and 105 cases treated with implant removal (19% one-stage revision (n = 20), 74.3% two-stage revision (n = 78) and 6.7% definitive implant removal (n = 7). Overall failure in patients treated with DAIR was 45.0% (153/340) compared to 24.8% (26/105) for implant removal (p < 0.001). Difference in failure rate remained after 1:1 propensity-score matching. A preoperative CRIME80-score ≥3 (OR 2.9), PJI caused by S. aureus (OR 1.8) and implant retention (OR 3.1) were independent predictors for failure in the multivariate analysis.
Conclusion
DAIR is a viable surgical treatment for most patients with LA PJI, but implant removal should be considered in a subset of patients, especially in those with a CRIME80-score ≥3."

Objectives
Loss of body weight, a manifestation of cachexia, is frequently found in patients with Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (MAC-LD) and known as a prognostic determinant. However, the involvement of body composition changes in the prognosis of patients with MAC-LD remains unclear.
Methods
The cross-sectional-area of the erector spinea muscle (ESMCSA) and mean attenuation of the erector spinae muscles (ESMMA) in patients with MAC-LD, as determined by computed tomography imaging, were measured in two independent cohorts (137 and 111 patients, respectively).
Results
Patients with MAC-LD showed significantly smaller ESMCSA together with lower body mass index (BMI), but no difference in ESMMA in both cohorts compared with controls. Smaller ESMCSA, body mass index decline, and decreased ESMMA were associated with worse survival in the patients. Among them, decreased ESMMA showed prognostic significance in the multivariate analyses. Importantly, assessment by ESMMA together with BMI successfully divided the patients into three groups with distinct prognoses.
Conclusion
Changes in body composition, especially decreased ESMMA, had prognostic significance in patients with MAC-LD. Additionally, combined assessment of ESMMA and BMI accurately predicted the prognosis of MAC-LD, which may be a helpful tool for disease management."

Objectives
To evaluate the effect of oral antimicrobial suppression on the outcome of streptococcal periprosthetic joint infection (PJI).
Methods
Consecutive patients with streptococcal PJI receiving antimicrobial suppression for >6 months were prospectively included and compared to a retrospective control group without suppression. Outcome was assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared by the log-rank Mantel-Cox test. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors associated with treatment failure.
Results
Of 69 streptococcal PJI episodes (37 knee, 31 hip and one shoulder PJI), 43 (62%) were caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci and 26 (38%) by viridans group streptococci. Debridement and prosthesis retention was performed in 27 (39%), one-stage exchange in 5 (7%), multi-stage exchange in 31 (44%) and prosthesis removal in 6 patients (9%). 24 patients (35%) were treated with antimicrobial suppression receiving oral amoxicillin (n = 22), doxycycline (n = 1) or clindamycin (n = 1). After a median follow-up of 13 months (range, 0.5–111 months), 38 of 65 patients (58%) were infection-free. Suppressive antimicrobial treatment was associated with higher success rate compared with no suppression (93% vs. 57%, p = 0.002), representing the only significant independent factor preventing treatment failure.
Conclusions
Long-term antimicrobial suppression was associated with significantly better treatment outcome and should be strongly considered in streptococcal PJI."

Objective
Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent bacterial pathogen isolated in subjects with Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) worldwide. Limited data are available regarding the current global burden and risk factors associated with drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) in CAP subjects. We assessed the multinational prevalence and risk factors for DRSP-CAP in a multinational point-prevalence study.
Design
The prevalence of DRSP-CAP was assessed by identification of DRSP in blood or respiratory samples among adults hospitalized with CAP in 54 countries. Prevalence and risk factors were compared among subjects that had microbiological testing and antibiotic susceptibility data. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify risk factors independently associated with DRSP-CAP.
Results
3,193 subjects were included in the study. The global prevalence of DRSP-CAP was 1.3% and continental prevalence rates were 7.0% in Africa, 1.2% in Asia, and 1.0% in South America, Europe, and North America, respectively. Macrolide resistance was most frequently identified in subjects with DRSP-CAP (0.6%) followed by penicillin resistance (0.5%). Subjects in Africa were more likely to have DRSP-CAP (OR: 7.6; 95%CI: 3.34-15.35, p<0.001) when compared to centres representing other continents.
Conclusions
This multinational point-prevalence study found a low global prevalence of DRSP-CAP that may impact guideline development and antimicrobial policies."

Objectives
Central nervous system (CNS) infections account for considerable death and disability every year. An urgent research priority is scaling up diagnostic capacity, and introduction of point-of-care tests. We set out to assess current evidence for the application of mass spectrometry (MS) peptide sequencing in identification of diagnostic biomarkers for CNS infections.
Methods
We performed a systematic review (PROSPEROCRD42018104257) using PRISMA guidelines on use of MS to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for diagnosing CNS infections. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane for articles published from 1 January 2000 to 1 February 2019, and contacted experts. Inclusion criteria involved primary research except case reports, on the diagnosis of infectious diseases except HIV, applying MS to human CSF samples, and English language.
Results
4,620 papers were identified, of which 11 were included, largely confined to pre-clinical biomarker discovery, and eight (73%) published in the last five years. 6 studies performed further work termed verification or validation. In 2 of these studies, it was possible to extract data on sensitivity and specificity of the biomarkers detected by ELISA, ranging from 89–94% and 58–92% respectively.
Conclusions
The findings demonstrate feasibility and potential of the methods in a variety of infectious diseases, but emphasise the need for strong interdisciplinary collaborations to ensure appropriate study design and biomarker validation."

abstract = "Aim
This study quantified changes in the microbiology of osteomyelitis over a ten year period from a single centre within the UK with regard to infection with multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria and susceptibility of antimicrobial regimens.
Method
Patients with chronic osteomyelitis undergoing definitive surgery from 2013–2017 were inluded (n = 223). Microbiology was compared to patients in a cohort from 2001–2004, using the same diagnostic criteria, and same deep tissue sampling technique (n = 157). Clinical features associated with MDR bacterial infection were analysed using logistic regression.
Results
Both cohorts had similar baseline characteristics. Despite a similar proportion of Staphylococcus aureus in both cohorts, the rate of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection was lower in 2013–2017 compared to 2001–2004 (11.4% vs 30.8% of Staphylococcus aureus, p = 0.007). However, the proportion of MDR infections was similar in both cohorts (15.2% versus 17.2%). Metalwork was associated with MDR infection (unadjusted OR 5.0; 95% CI: 1.15 to 22.0). There was no change in resistance to glycopeptide / meropenem combination treatment (2.2% vs 2.5%, p > 0.9).
Conclusions
In this centre, rates of MRSA osteomyelitis have fallen by two thirds, over the past 10 years, in line with the reducing rate of MRSA bacteraemia nationally. A history of metalwork may predict MDR infection. A glycopeptide with an anti-pseudomonal carbapenem remains the post-operative empiric systemic regimen of choice. Resistance patterns support the use of a glycopeptide with an aminoglycoside in local antibiotic therapy."

Objectives
Data on meningitis epidemiology in high HIV-prevalence African settings following antiretroviral therapy scale-up are lacking. We described epidemiology of adult meningitis in Botswana over a 16-year period.
Methods
Laboratory records for adults undergoing lumbar puncture (LP) 2000–2015 were collected, with complete national data 2013–2014. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings and linked HIV-data were described, and national incidence figures estimated for 2013–2014. Temporal trends in meningitis were evaluated.
Results
Of 21,560 adults evaluated, 41% (8759/21,560) had abnormal CSF findings with positive microbiological testing and/or pleocytosis; 43% (3755/8759) of these had no confirmed microbiological diagnosis. Of the 5004 microbiologically-confirmed meningitis cases, 89% (4432/5004) were cryptococcal (CM) and 8% (382/5004) pneumococcal (PM). Seventy-three percent (9525/13,033) of individuals undergoing LP with identifiers for HIV registry linkage had documented HIV-infection. Incidence of LP for meningitis evaluation in Botswana 2013–2014 was 142.6/100,000 person-years (95%CI:138.3–147.1); incidence of CM was 25.0/100,000 (95%CI:23.2–26.9), and incidence of PM was 2.7/100,000 (95%CI:2.4–3.1). In contrast to previously reported declines in CM incidence with ART roll-out, no significant temporal decline in pneumococcal or culture-negative meningitis was observed.
Conclusions
CM remained the predominant identified aetiology of meningitis despite ART scale-up. A high proportion of cases had abnormal CSF with negative microbiological evaluation."

Objectives
bloodstream infections (BSI) due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) have been increasingly observed among hospitalized patients.
Methods
prospective, observational study conducted among 12 large tertiary-care hospitals, across 7 Italian regions. From June 2017 to June 2018 all consecutive hospitalized patients with bacteremia due to MDR-AB were included and analyzed in the study.
Results
During the study period 281 episodes of BSI due to MDR-AB were observed: 98 (34.8%) episodes were classified as primary bacteremias, and 183 (65.2%) as secondary bacteremias; 177 (62.9%) of them were associated with septic shock. Overall, 14-day mortality was observed in 172 (61.2%) patients, while 30-day mortality in 207 (73.6%) patients. On multivariate analysis, previous surgery, continuous renal replacement therapy, inadequate source control of infection, and pneumonia were independently associated with higher risk of septic shock. Instead, septic shock and Charlson Comorbidity Index >3 were associated with 14-day mortality, while adequate source control of infection and combination therapy with survival. Finally, septic shock, previous surgery, and aminoglycoside-containing regimen were associated with 30-day mortality, while colistin-containing regimen with survival.
Conclusions
BSI caused by MDR-AB represents a difficult challenge for physicians, considering the high rates of septic shock and mortality associated with this infection."

keywords = "Infective endocarditis, Cell-derived microparticles;mortality, Bacterial infections",
abstract = "Summary
Objectives
To characterize the plasmatic profile of cell-derived microvesicles (MVs) at diagnosis and during the treatment of patients with infective endocarditis (IE).
Methods
Blood samples from 57 patients with IE were obtained on 3 consecutive moments: upon admission (T0), at 2 weeks (T1), and at the end of treatment (T2), and were compared with 22 patients with other bacterial infections. MPs were measured by flow cytometry and labeled for specific cell markers of CD45 (leukocytes), CD66b (neutrophils), CD14 (monocytes), CD41a (platelets), CD51 (endothelial cells), CD3 (T lymphocyte) and CD235a (erythrocytes).
Results
MVs from platelets (pltMVs), leukocytes (leukMVs), neutrophils (neutMVs), monocytes (monoMVs) and lymphocytes (lymphMVs) were significantly more elevated in the patients with IE, compared to the patients with other bacterial infections, despite comparable age, sex, blood counts and C-reactive protein levels. MVs values revealed a relatively stable pattern over time in IE, except for a significant increase in leukMVs and neutMVs in T1. LeukMVs (p = 0.011), neutMVs (p = 0.010), monoMVs (p = 0.016) and lymphMVs (p = 0.020), measured at admission, were significantly higher in IE patients that died during hospitalization in comparison with those that survived. In a multivariable analyses, the levels of neutMVs remained as an independent factor associated with mortality (odds ratio 2.203; 95% confidence interval 1.217 - 3.988; p = 0.009), adjustment for heart failure during the treatment.
Conclusions
Plasma levels of pltMVs, leukMVs, neutMVs, monoMVs and lymphMVs were significantly more elevated in patients with IE than in patients with other bacterial infections at hospital admission. Furthermore, neutMVs at admission have been identified as an independent predictor of mortality in patients with IE. Thus, cell derived MPs may become an important tool in the differential diagnosis and mortality risk assessment early in the course of IE suspected cases."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is an increasing problem worldwide, but particularly problematic in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) due to limitations of resources for surveillance of CRE and infection prevention and control (IPC).
Methods
A point prevalence survey (PPS) with screening for colonisation with CRE was conducted on 2233 patients admitted to neonatal, paediatric and adult care at 12 Vietnamese hospitals located in northern, central and southern Vietnam during 2017 and 2018. CRE colonisation was determined by culturing of faecal specimens on selective agar for CRE. Risk factors for CRE colonisation were evaluated. A CRE admission and discharge screening sub-study was conducted among one of the most vulnerable patient groups; infants treated at an 80-bed Neonatal ICU from March throughout June 2017 to assess CRE acquisition, hospital-acquired infection (HAI) and treatment outcome.
Results
A total of 1165 (52%) patients were colonised with CRE, most commonly Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 805), Escherichia coli (n = 682) and Enterobacter spp. (n = 61). Duration of hospital stay, HAI and treatment with a carbapenem were independent risk factors for CRE colonisation. The PPS showed that the prevalence of CRE colonisation increased on average 4.2% per day and mean CRE colonisation rates increased from 13% on the day of admission to 89% at day 15 of hospital stay. At the NICU, CRE colonisation increased from 32% at admission to 87% at discharge, mortality was significantly associated (OR 5·5, P < 0·01) with CRE colonisation and HAI on admission.
Conclusion
These data indicate that there is an epidemic spread of CRE in Vietnamese hospitals with rapid transmission to hospitalised patients."

Although acute respiratory illness (ARI) is a leading cause of hospitalization among young children, few data are available about cost of hospitalization in middle-income countries. We estimated direct and indirect costs associated with severe ARI resulting in hospitalization among children aged <10 years in El Salvador and Panama through the societal perspective.
Methods
During 2012 and 2013, we surveyed caregivers of children hospitalized with ARI about their direct medical (i.e., outpatient consultation, medications, hospital fees), non-medical (transportation, childcare), and indirect costs (lost wages) at discharge and 7 days after discharge. We multiplied subsidized hospital bed costs derived from administrative data by hospitalization days to estimate provider costs.
Results
Overall, 638 children were enrolled with a median age of 12 months (IQR 6–23). Their median length of hospitalization was 4 days (IQR 3–6). In El Salvador, caregivers incurred a median of US$38 (IQR 22–72) in direct and indirect costs per illness episode, while the median government-paid hospitalization cost was US$118 (IQR 59–384) generating an overall societal cost of US$219 (IQR 101–416) per severe ARI episode. In Panama, caregivers incurred a median of US$75 (IQR 39–135) in direct and indirect costs, and the health-care system paid US$280 (IQR 150–420) per hospitalization producing an overall societal cost of US$393 (IQR 258–552).
Conclusions
The cost of severe ARI to caregivers and the health care system was substantive. Our estimates will inform models to estimate national costs of severe ARI and cost-benefit of prevention and treatment strategies."

Objectives
To describe the epidemiology and prognostic impact of pneumonia in acute ischemic stroke patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.
Methods
Retrospective analysis from a prospective multicenter cohort study of critically ill patients with acute ischemic stroke requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at admission. Impact of pneumonia was investigated using Cox regression for 1-year mortality, and competing risk survival models for ICU mortality censored at 30-days.
Results
We included 195 patients. Stroke was supratentorial in 62% and 64% of patients had a Glasgow coma scale score <8 on admission. Mortality at day-30 and 1 year were 56%, and 70%, respectively. Post-stroke pneumonia was identified in 78 (40%) patients, of which 46/78 (59%) episodes were present at ICU admission. Post-stroke pneumonia was associated with an increase in 1-year mortality (adjusted HR 1.49, 95%CI [1.01–2.20]). Post-stroke pneumonia was not associated with ICU mortality but was associated with a 1.6-fold increase in ICU length of stay (CSHR 0.62 [0.39–0.99], p = 0.06).
Conclusions
In ischemic stroke patients requiring invasive ventilation, pneumonia occurred in 40% of cases and was associated with a 49% increase in 1-year mortality. Post-stroke pneumonia did not impact day-30 mortality but increased ICU length of stay."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
New biomarkers reflecting the degree of immunosuppression in transplant recipients are needed to provide an optimal personalized balance between rejection and infection risks.
Methods
For this purpose, we investigated TTV viremia dynamics in 66 kidney transplant recipients followed up for two years after transplantation, in relation to BK virus infection and graft rejection.
Results
After transplantation, TTV viremia rose by ≥2 log10 copies/mL from baseline to month 3, then declined by ≥1 log10 copies/mL thereafter. Higher TTV viremia was associated with recipients of a deceased donor, a lower count of CD8+ T cells and a higher BKV viremia. Importantly, TTV loads were significantly lower in KTR who would later display graft rejection; indeed, patients with TTV viremia lower than 3.4 log10 copies/mL at transplantation or lower than 4.2 log10 copies/mL at month 1 had a higher risk of developing graft rejection in the two following years (hazard ratio (HR) at D0 = 7.30, p = 0.0007 and HR at M1 = 6.16, p = 0.001).
Conclusions
TTV viremia measurement at early times post transplantation predicts graft rejection and would represent a useful tool to improve kidney transplant monitoring."

To investigate the widely concerned issue about positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results after discharge in patients recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Methods
We identified seven cases of COVID-19 who was readmitted to hospital because of positive RT-PCR after discharge, including three pediatrics and four young adult patients.
Results
Six patients had positive rectal swabs but negative throat swabs, and one patient had positive throat swabs. All the patients continued to be asymptomatic and had unchanged chest computed tomography from previous images. The time from hospital discharge to positive RT-PCR after recovery was 7–11 days. The time from positive to negative rectal swabs was 5-23 days.
Conclusion
The study might suggest the positive RT-PCR after recovery did not mean disease relapse or virus reinfection. Adding RT-PCR test of rectal swabs to the criteria for discharge or discontinuation of quarantine might be necessary."

Introduction
There is scarce information on the prognosis of urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp).
Objetive
To investigate the association between KPC-Kp aetiology and clinical failure and all cause mortality and to explore the impact of inappropriate empirical treatment.
Material and methods
This is a retrospective observational study of hospitalized patients with UTI due to K. pneumoniae. We explored clinical failure at day 21 and 30-day all-cause mortality using different models of adjusted analysis.
Results
We analyzed 142 episodes of UTI; 46 episodes (32.4%) were due to KPC-Kp and 96 episodes (67.6%) were due to non-KPC-Kp strains (62 wild type and 34 EBSL producer). Clinical failure was more frequent in the KPC-Kp group (41.3% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.001). KPC-Kp aetiology and inappropriate empirical therapy were associated in the non-adjusted analysis with clinical failure. When analysed in separate adjusted models, both were found to be associated; inappropriate empirical treatment (OR 2.51; 95% CI, 1.03–6.12; p = 0.04) and KPC-Kp (OR 2.73; 95% CI, 1.03–7.22; p = 0.04) were associated with increased risk of failure. All-cause 30-day mortality was higher in patients with KPC-Kp UTI (39.1% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.002). Bacteraemia was more frequent in patients with KPC-Kp etiology (23.9% vs. 10.4%; p = 0.034). In both cases, the association was not confirmed in the adjusted analysis.
Conclusion
KPC-Kp UTI is associated with higher clinical failure and may be due to an increase in inappropriate empirical treatment."

Noroviruses are a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) outbreaks worldwide. This study examined the epidemiology and genetic characteristics of norovirus outbreaks in Beijing, China.
Methods
Epidemiological data and fecal specimens were collected through the AGE outbreak surveillance system in Beijing. GI and GII genogroup noroviruses were detected and genotyped. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
Results
Between September 2014 and August 2017, 762 AGE outbreaks were reported in Beijing, of which 661 (86.7%) were laboratory-confirmed as norovirus. Most norovirus outbreaks were reported during the spring (66.9%, 442/661), occurred in kindergartens and elementary schools (92.3%, 610/661), and were caused by GII genogroup noroviruses (95.6%; 632/661). The genotypes of the norovirus strains were determined in 468 outbreaks, and GII.P16-GII.2 and GII.P17-GII.17 strains were the most commonly identified. GII.P17-GII.17 and GII.P16-GII.2 strains predominated in 2014–2015 and 2016–2017 outbreaks, respectively. GII.P16-GII.2 noroviruses were responsible for a steep increase in AGE outbreaks in Beijing: 549 norovirus outbreaks were reported from 2016 to 2017, 9.2 times the number that occurred during the previous year.
Conclusions
Norovirus causes a large disease burden in Beijing, and the prevalence of non-GII.4 noroviruses presents a new challenge for the development of vaccines."

Objectives
To identify human-to-human transmission of H7N9 avian influenza virus, we investigated a hospital cluster combined with family cluster in this study.
Methods
We obtained and analyzed clinical, epidemiological and virological data from the three patients. RT-PCR, viral culture and sequencing were conducted for determination of causative pathogen.
Results
The index case presented developed pneumonia with fever after exposure to chicken in a poultry farm. Case A presented pneumonia with high fever on day 3 after she shared a hospital room with the index case. Case B, the father of the index case, presented pneumonia with high fever on day 15 after he took care of the index case. H7N9 virus circulated in the local farm to which the index case was exposed. Full genomic sequence of virus showed 99.8–100% identity shared between the index case and case A or case B. Compared to the earliest virus of Anhui, a total of 29 amino acid variation sites were observed in the 8 segments.
Conclusions
A hospital cluster combined with family cluster of H7N9 avian influenza infection was identified. Air transmission resulted in the hospital cluster possibly. A poultry farm was the initially infectious source of the cluster."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Optimal dosage regimens of colistin for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTI) are unknown. Colistimethate sodium (CMS), the inactive prodrug of colistin, is mainly excreted in urine and converts to colistin after filtration by glomeruli, suggesting that concentrations of colistin in urine could be much higher than in plasma. Therefore, there is a need to optimize dosage regimens of intravenous CMS for UTI. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between AUC/MIC of formed colistin and clinical outcomes in patients with UTI caused by extremely drug resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Methods
This prospective, observational cohort study involved patients with UTI caused by XDR P. aeruginosa. Clinical cure, bacteriological clearance and acute kidney injury (AKI) were analyzed. Steady-state colistin plasma concentrations (Css) were measured using HPLC. Based on the PK/PD of colistin in neutropenic mouse thigh infection models with P. aeruginosa, the optimal AUC/MIC should be ≥60 mg·h/L. According to the pharmacokinetics (PK) in critically-ill patients, the Css target of formed colistin in plasma was 2.5 mg/L.
Results
Thirty-three patients were included (24 lower UTI and 9 pyelonephritis). The MIC50 and MIC90 values for colistin were 0.5 and 2 mg/L respectively. Nineteen patients (57.6%) received colistin monotherapy (84.2% lower UTI and 15.8% pyelonephritis). Of these, clinical cure was achieved in 89.5% of cases. Among patients with clinical cure and monotherapy, only 5 (29.4%) attained an optimal plasma AUC/MIC and only 1 (5.9%) the therapeutic level of formed colistin (2.5 mg/L). However, 10 (58.8%) patients showed colistin plasma concentrations above the MIC of the isolated P. aeruginosa. Microbiological eradication was achieved in 76.9% of patients. AKI at the end of treatment was present in 29.4% of patients.
Conclusions
The currently recommended dosage regimens of CMS showed high efficacy for the treatment of lower complicated UTI caused by XDR P. aeruginosa in non-critically ill patients and in the case of low MIC values, but also a considerable nephrotoxicity rate. Our data suggest that the use of lower CMS doses for lower UTI should be investigated in future studies to minimize the unnecessary nephrotoxicity."

Objectives
We prospectively evaluated the use of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimens to assess their added incremental value to pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic strategies used currently in a high-burden urban setting in China.
Methods
A prospective study was conducted of patients with presumptive pulmonary TB registered at the Fifth Hospital of Suzhou between March 2018 and July 2018. BALF samples from patients with initial Xpert-negative sputum results were tested to diagnose TB.
Results
Of 440 participants, 316 (71.8%) were initially diagnosed with TB from sputum, including 245 (55.7%) definitive TB cases based on a positive culture and/or Xpert result(s) and 71 (16.1%) positive cases based on clinical diagnosis. Of 153 patients with initial positive cultures, a significantly higher proportion were confirmed as TB-positive using Xpert (94.1%) versus smear microscopy (45.8%, P < 0.01). Xpert testing of BALF from 182 Xpert-negative cases exhibited greater detection sensitivity (97.4%) than did smear microscopy (23.4%, P < 0.01). Meanwhile, 74.1% of TB patients initially diagnosed as TB-negative via smear microscopy were identified using Xpert testing of BALF at reduced diagnostic cost/patient (from USD 266.9 to 171.5).
Conclusions
BALF samples added incremental value to pulmonary TB diagnostic strategies for patients with Xpert-negative sputum. Xpert outperformed smear microscopy for tubercle bacilli detection in both sputum and BALF."

abstract = "Objective
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) has a sumptuous repertoire of effector molecules to counter host defenses. Some of these antigens inhibit autophagy but the exact mechanism of this inhibition is poorly understood.
Methods
Purified protein derivative (PPD) was fractionated using 10 (PPD 10, antigenic molecular weight > 10 kDa) and 3 (PPD 3, mol. weight > 3 kDa) kDa cutters. Effect of these fractions on Calcimycin-induced autophagy and intracellular mycobacterial viability was then studied using different experimental approaches.
Result
We found significant downregulation of autophagy by PPD 3 pre-treatment in Calcimycin-treated dTHP-1 cells compared to PPD 10. This reduction in autophagy also corroborated with the enhanced survival of mycobacteria in macrophages. We demonstrate that recombinant early secreted antigenic target 6 (rESAT-6) is responsible to inhibit Calcimycin-induced autophagy and enhance intracellular survival of mycobacteria. We also show that pre-treatment with rESAT-6 upregulates microRNA (miR)-30a-3p expression and vis-a-vis downregulates miR-30a-5p expression in Calcimycin-treated dTHP-1 cells. Transfection studies with either miR-30a-3p inhibitor or miR-30a-5p mimic clearly elucidated the opposing roles of miR-30a-3p and miR-30a-5p in rESAT-6 mediated mycobacterial survival through autophagy inhibition.
Conclusion
Taken together, our result evidently highlights that rESAT-6 enhances intracellular survival of mycobacteria by modulating miR-30a-3p and miR-30a-5p expression."

To describe and analyze the differences between infections in children with febrile neutropenia (FN) treated for solid tumor or blood cancer.
Methods
A prospective study included all episodes of FN in children from April 2007 to April 2016 in 2-pediatric cancer centers in France. Medical history, clinical and laboratory data available at admission and final microbiological data were collected. The proportion of FN, severe infection, categories of microorganisms and outcomes were compared between the two groups. The presumed gateway of the infection was a posteriori considered and evaluated.
Results
We analyzed 1197 FN episodes (mean age: 8 years). 66% of the FN episodes occurred in children with blood cancer. Severe infections were identified in 23.4% of episodes overall. The rate of severe infection (28.4% vs. 10.4%), types of microorganisms and the need for a management in intensive care unit (2.6% vs. 0.5%) was significantly different between children with blood cancer and solid tumor. Digestive or respiratory presumed gateway of the infections was less frequent for patients with solid tumor.
Conclusion
Given these important microbiological and clinical differences, it may be appropriate to consider differently the risk of severe infection in these two populations and therefore the management of FN."

To compare the efficacy of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) for 8 weeks (SL8) versus a 12-week course of SOF/LDV (SL12) among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients in clinical practice. In addition we compared sustained virological response (SVR) rates achieved with SL8 in HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients in a real life setting.
Methods
HCV-infected patients were retrospectively selected from the HEPAVIR-DAA and GEHEP-MONO real-life prospective cohorts if they fulfilled the following criteria: 1) Infected with genotype 1; 2) Treatment with SL8 or SL12; 3) Treatment naïve prior to receiving SL8 or SL12; 4) Absence of cirrhosis; 5) Baseline HCV RNA<6 × 106 IU/mL; 6) Reached the scheduled time-point for SVR (SVR12) assessment. SVR12 and relapse rates of HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were compared on an intention to treat basis. The responses with SL8 and SL12 were also compared.
Results
In the SL8 group, 107 (51%) HCV-monoinfected and 102 (49%) HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were included. One hundred and sixty-four (43%) HCV-monoinfected subjects and 220 (57%) HIV/HCV-coinfected patients received SL12. SVR12 rates for HIV/HCV-coinfected patients treated with SL8 vs SL12 were SVR12 92.2% vs. 97.3% (p = 0.044) and the respective relapse rates were 4.9% vs. 0.5% (p = 0.013). SVR12 rates for SL8 among HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were: 96.3% vs. 92.2% (p = 0.243), respectively. The corresponding relapse rates were 0.9% vs. 4.9% (p = 0.112).
Conclusion
HIV/HCV-coinfected patients reach high rates of SVR12 with SL8, although lower than with SL12, mainly due to a higher probability of relapse. SVR12 rates with SL8 are numerically lower and the proportion of relapses higher in HIV/HCVcoinfected patients than in HCV-monoinfected subjects."

A survey of laboratory testing capabilities for systemic fungal pathogens was undertaken in the UK, to identify where improved compliance with published standards and guidelines is required and to inform antifungal stewardship (AFS). The survey captured information from laboratories in the UK on diagnostic capacity for invasive fungal diseases (IFD), including identification, serology, molecular diagnostics and susceptibility testing. The survey was circulated in March 2017 through key networks. Of 154 laboratories providing diagnostic mycology services in the UK, 80 (52%) responded to the survey. Results indicated that 85% of respondents identified fungal isolates from high risk patients to species level, and that many laboratories (78%) could access local susceptibility testing for yeasts, whereas 17% could for Aspergillus species. However, direct microscopy was only used in 49% as a first line investigation on samples where it would be appropriate. A low number of respondents identified yeasts cultured from intravascular line tips to species level (63%) and even fewer fully identified urine isolates from critically ill patients (42%) or the immunocompromised (39%). Less than half of respondents advised therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for flucytosine. Few laboratories had access to local β-glucan (4%) or galactomannan (20%) testing. The survey highlights that the current level of fungal diagnostics in the UK is below accepted best practice with an urgent need to improve across many diagnostic areas including the timely accessibility of fungal biomarkers, susceptibility testing and provision of TDM testing. Improvements are important to facilitate the delivery of diagnostic driven AFS strategies as well as appropriate management of IFD."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
The administration of antibiotics in infections caused by Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) strains, such as O157:H7, was and remains controversial, as it has been associated with the development of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). We conducted a literature review to better examine this association.
Methods
We searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases for relevant articles, using the key words: ``haemolytic uraemic syndrome'', ``Shiga toxin'', ``E. coli O157:H7'', ``E. coli O104:H4'', ``STEC colitis'', ``STEC antibiotics'', ``STEC fosfomycin'', ``STEC trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole'', ``STEC fluoroquinolones'', ``STEC ciprofloxacin'', ``STEC rifaximin'', ``STEC gentamycin'', ``STEC colistin'', “Shiga toxin binding agent”, “Shiga toxin monoclonal antibody” and ``STEC Japan epidemic''.
Results
Numerous studies report that antibiotics increase the risk of HUS development, while others report that antibiotics do not have any effect or can even reduce the rate of HUS development in STEC infections. The infecting STEC strain, the type of antibiotic as well as the timing of its administration appear to significantly affect the development of HUS in a STEC infected patient.
Conclusions
It appears that, while some antibiotics such as b-lactams and TMP/SMX may be detrimental, others appear to be safe and can prevent the development of HUS. Of note, fosfomycin appears to be the antibiotic with the most positive results from clinical studies, and may be able to avert HUS development, especially if administered within the first two or three days from diarrhoea onset. Fluoroquinolones have also shown positive outcomes in clinical studies, despite demonstrating unfavourable results in in vitro studies. Other agents, such as colistin, gentamycin and rifamycins, have shown promising results in in vitro studies and require further evaluation."

abstract = "Objectives
Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) poise significant risk to human health and the poultry industry. We evaluated the transmission risk along the poultry supply chain.
Methods
During October 2015 and July 2016, four rounds of cross-sectional surveys were performed to characterize AIV spread in farms, transport vehicles, slaughterhouses, wholesale and retail live poultry markets (LPMs). Poultry cloacal and oral swabs, environmental swabs, bioaerosol samples and human sera were collected. Poultry and environmental samples were tested for AIVs by rRT-PCR, further subtyped by next generation sequencing. Previous human H9N2 infections were identified by hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization tests. Logistic regression was fitted to compare AIV transmission risk in different settings.
Results
AIVs was detected in 23.9% (424/1771) of the poultry and environmental samples. AIV detection rates in farms, transport vehicles, wholesale and retail LPMs were 4.5%, 11.1%, 30.3% and 51.2%, respectively. 5.2%, 8.3% and 12.8% of the poultry workers were seropositive in farms, wholesale and retail LPMs, respectively. The regression analysis showed that virus detection and transmission risk to human increased progressively along the poultry supply chain.
Conclusions
Strengthening control measures at every level along the poultry supply chain, using a one health approach, is crucial to control AIV circulation."

Objectives
to prospectively evaluate the incidence and the clinical relevance on hematopoietic reconstitution of HHV-6 infection in autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) recipients.
Methods
HHV-6 DNA load was measured in whole blood specimens once during the 7 days before stem cell re-infusion and once a week after transplantation until hematopoietic recovery. Active HHV-6 infection was defined by 2 consecutive positive DNA loads.
Results
from July 2012 to February 2015, 196 adult patients undergoing ASCT were enrolled. Twenty-two (11.2%) patients developed active HHV-6 infection with a cumulative incidence of 19% at 40 days after transplantation. The onset of active HHV-6 infection occurred with a median of 13 days after stem cell re-infusion. HHV-6 infection was associated with an increased frequency of non-infectious complications (OR = 5.05; 95%CI 1.78–14.32; P < 0.001). Moreover, the severity of these non-infectious complications was higher in recipients exhibiting HHV-6 infection (OR = 4.62; 95%CI 1.32–16.2; p < 0.01). Delayed neutrophils 10 (IQR: 8–14) vs 8 (IQR: 6–11) days and platelets recoveries 15 (IQR: 11.8–18.5) vs 8 (IQR: 4–14) days were observed in patients with active HHV-6 infection compared to non-infected ones.
Conclusions
in this study, 11.2% ASCT recipients presented active HHV-6 infection associated with significantly delayed hematologic reconstitution."

Objectives
The diagnosis of osteoarticular tuberculosis (TB) remains challenging and results in under- or over-diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate performance of the novel next-generation Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) in comparison to culture and Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) for osteoarticular TB diagnosis in high burden settings.
Methods
Osteoarticular TB suspected cases were enrolled consecutively during June 2017 to June 2018 at Beijing Chest Hospital and their pus specimens were subjected to smear, culture, Xpert and Xpert Ultra. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was conducted for all of the recovered isolates. The performances of Xpert Ultra and Xpert were evaluated using composite reference standard (CRS) as gold standard, which included clinical, laboratory, histopathological, radiological and ≥6 months’ follow-up data.
Results
In total, 186 patients were recruited, and 132 of them were diagnosed with osteoarticular TB according to CRS. The direct head-to-head performance comparison for M. tuberculosis detection showed that Xpert Ultra (90.91%, 120/132) produced a higher sensitivity than Xpert (78.79%, 104/132, P = 0.006) and culture (39.39%, 52/132, P < 0.001). When Xpert Ultra outcomes were integrated, the percentage of confirmed osteoarticular TB case increased from 84.09% (111/132) to 93.94% (124/132). The specificities of Xpert and Xpert Ultra were 100% (34/34) and 97.06% (33/34), respectively. Both Xpert Ultra and Xpert accurately identified all of the 9 rifampicin (RIF)-resistant and 38 RIF-sensitive cases defined by phenotypic DST. Therefore, Xpert Ultra was 100% concordant with phenotypic DST for the detection of RIF resistance.
Conclusions
Xpert Ultra detected significantly more osteoarticular TB cases than Xpert or culture, making it a useful tool for rapid diagnosis of osteoarticular TB."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The ResPOC study demonstrated that syndromic molecular point-of-care testing (POCT) for respiratory viruses was associated with early discontinuation of unnecessary antibiotics compared to routine clinical care. Subgroup analysis suggests these changes occur predominantly in patients with exacerbation of airways disease. Use of molecular POCT for respiratory viruses is becoming widespread but there is a lack of evidence to inform the choice between multiplex syndromic panels versus POCT for influenza only.
Materials/methods
We evaluated patients from the ResPOC study with exacerbation of asthma or COPD who were treated with antibiotics. The duration of antibiotics and proportion with early discontinuation were compared between patients testing positive and negative for viruses by POCT, and controls. Patients testing positive for viruses by POCT were compared according to virus types.
Results
118 patient with exacerbation of airways disease received antibiotics in the POCT group and 111 in the control group. In the POCT group 49/118 (42%) patients tested positive for viruses. Of those testing positive for viruses 17/49 (35%) had early discontinuation of antibiotics versus 9/69 (13%) testing negative and 7/111 (6%) of controls, p<0.0001. Of those positive for viruses by POCT 10/49 (20%) were positive for influenza, 21/49 (43%) for rhinovirus and 18/49 (37%) for other viruses. The proportion with early discontinuation of antibiotics was not different between the virus types (p = 0.34).
Conclusions
This data suggests that syndromic molecular POCT for respiratory viruses should be favoured over POCT for influenza alone in adults with exacerbation of airways disease."

abstract = "Background
Invasive infections due to Haemophilus influenzae are infrequent following the implementation of vaccination against H. influenzae of serotype b. However, their changing epidemiology may not be clear due to a lack of appropriate genotyping methods combined with antibiotic susceptibility analyses which do not discriminate invasive and non-invasive isolates. We aimed to describe recent epidemiological trends of invasive H. influenzae infections in France and explore the microbiological characteristics of invasive versus non-invasive isolates.
Methods
All culture- and PCR-confirmed cases due to H. influenzae isolated from a sterile site, that were received at the French national reference centre for H. influenzae during the year 2017 (n = 138) were characterized by whole genome sequencing (WGS), serotyping and antibiotic susceptibility testing. We also included 100 isolates that were received from non-invasive infections.
Findings
Most of the non-invasive isolates were non-typeable (99%) and this proportion was significantly less among invasive isolates 75%, p < 0.0001). Serotype f was the most frequently observed but serotypes b and a were also present among invasive isolates. WGS analysis suggested a serotype b to a capsule switching event. Non-typeable isolates showed extensive heterogeneity. Antibiotic susceptibility testing indicated that 24% of the invasive isolates were resistant to ampicillin but this percentage was significantly higher (51%, p < 0.001) among the non-invasive isolates. Moreover, the proportion of beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant isolates (BLNAR) was significantly higher among non-invasive isolates compared to that of invasive isolates (24% versus 7%, p < 0.001). BLNAR isolates were linked to modification in the ftsI gene encoding the penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3). In particular, ftsI alleles that harboured the mutations D350N, S357N, M377I and S385T were resistant to ampicillin and third generation cephalosporins. These isolates were more frequent among non-invasive isolates.
Interpretation
Our data suggest that invasive H. influenzae isolates differed phenotypically and genotypically from non-invasive isolates. The high proportion of ampicillin resistance by mutation in ftsI among non-invasive isolates may suggest a biological cost of these mutations on the function of PBP3 that can lead to lower bacterial invasiveness. WGS should be used routinely for the characterization of H. influenzae isolates in order to reliably follow the emergence, spread and mechanism of antibiotic resistance."

Objectives
Although it has been reported that Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) inhibits Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in mice, how it counteracts with mycobacterial infection in human remains largely obscure. This study was conducted to investigated the effect of IRF1 on Mtb infection in human macrophages (Mϕs).
Methods
We thus investigated the IRF1 expression by using PBMC and monocytes of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients and human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) and THP-1-derived macrophages (THP-1-Mϕ). We used gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches to explore the role of IRF1 on Mtb infection.
Results
IRF1 was significantly induced in PBMC and monocytes of pulmonary TB patients in vivo and in human Mϕs in vitro. We demonstrated that IRF1 protects Mϕs from Mtb infection. Concurrently, IRF1 promotes the expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TNF-α and IL-8, indicating IRF1-mediated activation of innate immunity upon Mtb infection. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches have demonstrated that IRF1 suppresses the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6K) cascade to exert its anti-Mtb effect.
Conclusions
The discovery of a novel function of IRF1 in facilitating anti-mycobacterial effect through suppressing mTOR/p70 S6K signaling in Mϕs may provide a promoting therapeutic target for tuberculosis."

Synovial fluid leukocyte count is the current standard test for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). As D-lactate is almost exclusively produced by bacteria, it represents a useful biomarker for bacterial infection. We evaluated the performance of synovial fluid D-lactate for the diagnosis of PJI and compared it with the synovial fluid leukocyte count.
Methods
Consecutive patients with joint aspiration of a prosthetic hip, knee or shoulder joint were prospectively included. PJI was diagnosed according to the working criteria of the European Bone and Joint Infection Society (EBJIS). The synovial fluid D-lactate was determined spectrophotometrically at 570 nm, synovial fluid leukocytes were counted by flow cytometry. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic performance of investigated parameters.
Results
Of 148 patients, 44 (30%) were diagnosed with PJI and 104 (70%) with aseptic failure. For diagnosis of PJI, the sensitivity of synovial fluid D-lactate (at cut-off 1.263 mmol/l) was 86.4% [95% CI, 75.0–95.5%] and the specificity was 80.8% [95% CI, 73.1–88.5%]. The AUCs of D-lactate concentration and leukocyte count were 90.3% [95% CI 85.7–95.0%] and 91.0% [95% CI 85.1–96.8%], respectively (p = 0.8). Virulence of the pathogen did not influence the D-lactate concentration (p = 0.123). The synovial fluid erythrocyte concentration correlated with D-lactate in patients with aseptic failure (ρ = 0.339, p <0.01).
Conclusion
Synovial fluid D-lactate showed similar performance to the leukocyte count for diagnosis of PJI. Advantages of D-lactate test are requirement of low synovial fluid volume, short turnaround time and low cost."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Due to paucity of evidence to guide management of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections national and international guidelines make disparate recommendations.
Methods
The outcomes of allo-HSCT recipients with RSV infection between 2015 and 2017 were assessed using the following treatment stratification; upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) being actively monitored and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) treated with short courses of oral ribavirin combined with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 2 g/kg).
Results
During the study period 49 RSV episodes were diagnosed (47% URTI and 53% LRTI). All patients with URTI recovered without pharmacological intervention. Progression from URTI to LRTI occurred in 15%. Treatment with oral ribavirin given until significant symptomatic improvement (median 7 days [3–12]) and IVIG for LRTI was generally well tolerated. RSV-attributable mortality was low (2%).
Conclusions
In this cohort study, we demonstrate that active monitoring of allo-HSCT patients with RSV in the absence of LRTI was only associated with progression to LRTI in 15% of our patients and therefore appears to be a safe approach. Short course oral ribavirin in combination with IVIG was effective and well-tolerated for LRTI making it a practical alternative to aerosolised ribavirin. This approach was beneficial in reducing hospitalisation, saving nursing times and by using oral as opposed to nebulised ribavirin."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Annual seasonal influenza vaccine manufacturing cycles align with temperate country seasonality in each hemisphere, yet influenza seasonality is poorly defined for many countries. The study introduces a novel and universal approach to defining and classifying seasonality that can be used to classify any country's influenza vaccine cycle alignment.
Methods
Countries reporting to the World Health Organization's FluNet influenza virology database in 90% of weeks during 2011 through 2017 were included. A smoothed, standardised, average proportion of influenza occurring in each week of the year was used to determine degree of seasonality based on the range of average weekly variation. The proportion of activity occurring May through October was used to align influenza activity with a hemisphere's vaccine manufacturing cycle.
Results
From 84 included countries, there were 2,239,208 positive influenza results, of which 26% were influenza type B. Degree of seasonality was moderately positively correlated with absolute value of latitude (r = 0.69, p < 0.0001). Latitude was strongly negatively correlated with the proportion of influenza occurring during May through October (r = –0.83, p < 0.0001). Thirteen countries (12% of the included global population), mainly in tropical zones, had influenza occurrence aligned with the opposite hemisphere's influenza vaccine manufacturing cycle. In tropical zones, concordance in the degree of seasonality and vaccine cycle alignment within regions and between adjacent countries was limited. In temperate zones, on average, influenza B peaked four weeks later than A.
Conclusions
Influenza activity in many countries aligns with the vaccine manufacturing cycle of the opposite hemisphere. In tropical regions, there is limited scope for grouping countries for vaccine distribution and administration."

Synovial fluid C-reactive protein (syCRP) has been recently described as a new biomarker in preoperative diagnostics to identify periprosthetic joint infections (PJI). The aim of this study was to evaluate syCRP in a large cohort of patients with suspected PJI and to calculate the optimal cut-off to diagnose PJI.
Methods
Between September 2015 and June 2017, we prospectively included patients with suspected PJI, in which syCRP was additionally measured along with routine preoperative diagnostic serum and synovial biomarkers. We analysed the sensitivity and specificity of syCRP using receiver operating characteristic curves.
Results
We included 192 cases (hip n = 80, knee n = 91, shoulder n = 21) with a final diagnosis of PJI in 26 cases (14.0%). Combined for all joints, the syCRP values were significantly higher in the PJI group than in the no PJI group (median: 13.8 vs. 0 mg/l; p < 0.001). The optimal cut-off (Youden Index: 0.71) for the PJI diagnosis combined for all joints was at a syCRP value of 2.9 mg/l with a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 82%, and a negative predictive value of 98%.
Conclusions
SyCRP features high negative predictive value but is not useful as a single diagnostic parameter in suspected periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)."

Human genomic mapping has advanced molecular medicine health care and created a transformative paradigm shift towards Precision Medicine. In 2015, President Obama launched the PM initiative, encapsulated as “unique individualized data-driven treatments”. Since then, this field is rapidly advancing both curative treatment and disease prevention by accounting for both individual and environmental variability. While a substantial evidence for accelerating adoption of Precision Medicine in other spheres of medicine exists, application of Precision Medicine in infectious diseases is far more complex. One of the most warranted applications of precision healthcare is in the management and treatment of Drug-resistant Tuberculosis. Application of Precision Medicine to Drug-resistant Tuberculosis could potentially change the landscape of treatment and prevention of a disease affecting vulnerable patients in impoverished communities. Poorly diagnosed and treated Drug-resistant Tuberculosis not only leads to increased mortality and morbidity but also increased transmission of DR-TB strains, fuelling ongoing high incidence rates and further infection. A Precision medicine model using individual clinical case histories used in conjunction with Mycobacterium Tuberculosis infection genomic data will better guide health care practitioners in more appropriate drug selection, and an individualized management approach. This viewpoint deliberates the intricacies of adopting a PM approach in the management of DR-TB. If applied correctly, we postulate that the research, application, and deployment of PM in DR-TB management may address the fundamental rule of PM in infectious disease: to treat the correct patient, at the correct time, with the correct drug."

Objectives
To analyse the demographic trends, clinical features and treatment of non-perinatal listeriosis cases over a ten year period and identify mortality-associated risk factors.
Methods
Reported laboratory-confirmed non-pregnancy associated cases of listeriosis between 2006 and 2015 in England were included and retrospectively analysed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors for mortality.
Results
1357/1683 reported cases met the inclusion criteria. Overall all-cause mortality was 28.7%; however, mortality rates declined from 42.1% to 20.2%. Septicaemia was the most common presentation 69.5%, followed by CNS involvement 22.4%. CNS presentations were significantly associated with age < 50 years, and septicaemia with older age. Age > 80 years (OR 3.32 95% CI 1.92–5.74), solid-organ malignancy (OR 3.42 95% CI 2.29-5.11), cardiovascular disease (OR 3.30 95% CI 1.64–6.63), liver disease (OR 4.61 95% CI 2.47–8.61), immunosuppression (OR 2.12 95% CI 1.40-3.21) and septicaemia (OR 1.60 95% CI 1.17–2.20) were identified as independent mortality risk factors.
Conclusions
High risk groups identified in this study should be the priority focus of future public health strategies aimed at reducing listeriosis incidence and mortality."

Objectives
We assessed the diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) in comparison to Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) for the detection of paucibacillary tuberculosis (TB).
Methods
Smear-negative sputum, pleural fluid and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected from TB suspects at Beijing Chest Hospital (Beijing, China) and were examined using smear, Xpert and culture. Xpert Ultra was tested using specimens stored at −80 °C. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was conducted for all of the isolates recovered. The performances of Xpert Ultra and Xpert were evaluated using composite reference standard (CRS) as gold standard, which included clinical, laboratory, histopathological, radiological and follow-up features.
Results
Totally 689 cases were included. The direct head-to-head diagnostic performance comparison showed higher sensitivity of Xpert Ultra in contrast with Xpert among 292 smear-negative pulmonary TB (PTB) (70.89% vs 57.88%, P = 0.001), 108 tuberculous pleurisy (61.11% vs 34.26%, P<0.001), and 43 tuberculous meningitis (44.19% vs 18.60%, P = 0.011). The percentage of definite PTB, tuberculous pleurisy and tuberculous meningitis increased from 67.12% to 78.77%, 61.11% to 69.44% and 23.26% to 51.16%, respectively after integrating Xpert Ultra outcomes. The specificity of Xpert Ultra and Xpert was 96.75% (238/246) and 98.37% (242/246), respectively. Xpert Ultra and Xpert performed similarly in detecting rifampicin resistance.
Conclusion
Xpert Ultra has higher sensitivity but relatively reduced specificity compared with Xpert in diagnosis of paucibacillary TB. Performing Xpert Ultra would improve the definite diagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous pleurisy and tuberculous meningitis."

Objectives
: The main objective of this manuscript is to discuss our present knowledge of the relationships between dysbiosis and paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). The therapeutic role of the methods currently used to re-establish normal gut microbiota composition is also analysed.
Methods
: PubMed was used to search for all of the studies published from January 2008 to June 2018 using the key words: “Crohn's disease” and “gut dysbiosis” or “microbiota” or “microbioma” or “probiotic” and “children” or “paediatric”. More than 100 articles were found, but only those published in English or providing evidence-based data were included in the evaluation.
Results
: Gut microbiota are primary actors in CD's pathogenesis. The new techniques developed in metagenomics allow us to reveal new details of microbiota composition in healthy subjects and CD patients, and to elucidate the link between microbiota and numerous pathologies, such as obesity, allergies and type 1 diabetes mellitus.
Conclusion
: Discoveries on the role of gut microbiota could potentially disclose new therapeutic options for CD treatment and improve the existing therapies. Further studies are needed to facilitate the diagnosis and tailor the therapy of a pathology that is an increasing burden on public health."

We sought to determine the prevalence, molecular epidemiology, and factors associated with Staphylococcus aureus environmental surface and pet colonization in households of children with community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA–MRSA) infection.
Methods
Between 2012 and 2015, 150 children with CA–MRSA infections and their household contacts and pets were enrolled in this cross-sectional study in metropolitan Saint Louis, MO. Cultures to detect S. aureus were collected from 3 anatomic sites of household members, 2 dog/cat sites, and 21 environmental surfaces in each household. Molecular epidemiology of S. aureus isolates was determined via repetitive-sequence PCR. Generalized linear models were developed to identify factors associated with S. aureus/MRSA household contamination.
Results
MRSA was recovered from environmental surfaces in 69 (46%) households (median 2 surfaces [range 1–18]). The enrollment infecting strain type was the most common strain recovered from the environment in most (64%) households. In generalized linear models, factors associated with a higher proportion of MRSA-contaminated environmental surfaces were household member MRSA colonization burden, MRSA as the dominant S. aureus strain colonizing household members, more strain types per household member, index case African–American race, and renting (vs. owning) the home. Of 132 pets, 14% were colonized with MRSA. Pets whose primary caretaker was MRSA-colonized were more likely to be MRSA-colonized than pets whose primary caretaker was not MRSA-colonized (50% vs. 4%, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Household environments and pet dogs and cats serve as reservoirs of MRSA. Household member MRSA colonization burden predicts environmental MRSA contamination. Longitudinal studies will inform the directionality of household transmission."

The newly emerged highly pathogenic (HP) H7N9 avian influenza virus during Wave Five has caused 28 human infections, while differences in disease severity between low pathogenic (LP)- and HP-H7N9 human infections remain unclear.
Methods
Clinical data, concentrations of serum cytokines, dynamics of virus shedding and PaO2/FiO2 from patients infected with LP-H7N9 (n = 7, LP group) and HP-H7N9 (n = 5, HP group) viruses during Wave Five were compared. In addition, critical mutations associated with H7N9 virulence in mammal/human were analyzed.
Results
Lymphopenia, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase were common features, with higher incidences of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in the LP group. The acute phase of both groups was accompanied with elevated cytokines associated with disease severity, including MIF, MCP-1 and IP-10. Diffuse exudation of the lungs and consolidation were observed from all patients. The dynamics of virus shedding and PaO2/FiO2 were similar between both groups. Notably, a higher prevalence of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) resistance in the HP-H7N9 virus was found.
Conclusions
Our results indicate that this newly emerged HP-H7N9 virus caused similar disease severity in humans compared with LP-H7N9 virus, while higher case fatality rate and prevalence of NAI-resistance in human HP-H7N9 infections were of great concern."

Objectives
Hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV3) is responsible for acute and chronic liver disease in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. HEV was recently found in the urine of some acutely and chronically genotype 4-infected patients.
Methods
We examined the urinary excretion of HEV3 by 24 consecutive SOT recipients at the acute phase of HEV hepatitis and characterized the excreted virus.
Results
Urinary HEV RNA was detected in 12 (50%) of the 24 transplanted patients diagnosed with HEV hepatitis. Urinary HEV antigen (Ag) was detected in all but one of the patients (96%). The density of RNA-containing HEV particles in urine was low (1.11-1.12 g/cm3), corresponding to lipid-associated virions. The urinary HEV RNA/Ag detected was not associated with impaired kidney function or de novo proteinuria. Finally, there was more HEV Ag in the serum at the acute phase of HEV infection in SOT recipients whose infection became chronic.
Conclusions
HEV3 excreted via the urine of SOT recipients at the acute phase of HEV hepatitis has a lipid envelope. Renal function was not impaired. While urinary HEV Ag was a sensitive indicator of HEV infection, only acute phase serum HEV Ag indicated the development of a chronic infection."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Non-meningococcal, non-gonococcal Neisseria spp. are typically commensal and rarely cause invasive disease. Eculizumab is a terminal complement inhibitor that increases susceptibility to meningococcal disease, but data on disease caused by typically-commensal Neisseria spp. are lacking. This series describes postmarketing reports of typically-commensal Neisseria spp. disease in patients receiving eculizumab.
Methods
We searched the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and medical literature for reports of commensal Neisseria spp. disease in patients receiving eculizumab, from eculizumab U.S. approval (2007) through January 31, 2018.
Results
We identified seven FAERS reports (including one case also reported in the literature) of non-meningococcal, non-gonococcal Neisseria disease, including N. sicca (mucosa)/subflava (n = 2), N. cinerea (n = 2), N. sicca (mucosa) (n = 1), N. mucosa (n = 1, with concurrent alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus bacteremia), and N. flavescens (subflava) (n = 1). Four cases had sources of patient immunosuppression in addition to eculizumab. Three patients had sepsis (n = 2) or septic shock (n = 1). Five patients were bacteremic. All patients were hospitalized; the infections resolved with antibiotics.
Conclusions
Our search identified seven cases of disease from typically commensal Neisseria spp. in eculizumab recipients. These findings suggest that any Neisseria spp. identified from a normally sterile site in an eculizumab recipient could represent true infection warranting prompt treatment."

Objectives
A case-control study was performed (2015–2017) to identify risk factors for acute hepatitis E in the Netherlands.
Methods
A questionnaire on potential sources of hepatitis E virus (HEV) exposure, health and socio-demographics was completed by 376 patients with acute hepatitis E, and 1534 controls matched for age, gender and region of residence.
Results
Traditional Dutch dry raw sausages of pork muscle meat, called “cervelaat”, “snijworst”, and “boerenmetworst” were reported by 72% of the patients, and 46% of controls (aOR 3.0; 95%CI 2.2–4.1), with a population attributable fraction (PAF) of 48%. Direct contact with pigs and working with a septic tank were strong risk factors (aOR 3.1; 95%CI 1.3–7.3 and aOR 6.9; 95%CI 1.2–40.8, respectively), with a low PAF (2% and 1%, respectively). Host risk factors were pre-existing liver disease (aOR 3.8; 95%CI 2.0–7.1), diabetes (aOR 2.1; 95%CI 1.4–3.2), immunosuppressive medication (aOR 2.5; 95%CI 1.5–4.1), and gastric acid inhibitors (aOR 2.3; 95%CI 1.7–3.1).
Conclusions
Dry raw pork sausages were the major source of HEV infection among our study population. The prevalence and cause of HEV contamination in these pork muscle meat products require further investigation. Infrequently reported, yet strong risk factors were contact with pigs, or a septic tank."

We aimed to assess the characteristics, outcomes and costs of septic shock complicating Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).
Methods
Characteristics of SLE patients experiencing a septic shock in France from 2010 to 2015 were analyzed through the French medico-administrative database. Factors associated with the 1-year post-admission mortality were analyzed, the crude 1-year survival of SLE patients experiencing septic shock was compared to those admitted for another reason, and we compared the 1-year outcome associated with SLE septic shock survival to a matched SLE ICU control population.
Results
Among 28,522 SLE patients, 1068 experienced septic shock. The 1-year mortality rate was 43.4%. Independently of the severity, an associated Sjögren syndrome was the only specific SLE phenotype associated with mortality (HR 1.392[1.021–1.899]). Within one year, post-septic shock survivors (n = 738) were re-admitted 6.42[17.3] times with total cost of € 14,431[20,444]. Unmatched analysis showed that the outcome of patients admitted in ICU for septic shock was poorer than that of patients admitted in ICU or hospital for another disease. However, 1-year healthcare use of septic shock survivors was not different from the other ICU survivors when matched on severity.
Conclusions
Septic shock is a frequent and severe complication among SLE patients even if it is not associated with more healthcare use than another episode of same severity."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Information on genetic determinants of chlorhexidine tolerance (qacA carriage and MIC) in vitro is available, although evidence of the clinical impact and mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated why, following chlorhexidine intervention, prevalent epidemic MRSA ST22 and ST36 clones declined at an ICU, whilst an ST239-TW clone did not. The chlorhexidine tolerant ST239-TW phenotypes were assessed for their protein binding, cell adhesion and intracellular uptake potential.
Methods
Six ST22, ST36 and ST239-TW bloodstream infection isolates with comparable chlorhexidine MICs were selected from a 2-year outbreak in an ICU at Guy's and St. Thomas’ Hospital. Isolates were tested for fibrinogen and fibronectin binding, and adhesion/internalization into human keratinocytes with and without biocide.
Results
Binding to fibrinogen and fibronectin, adhesion and intracellular uptake within keratinocytes (P < 0.001) and intracellular survival in keratinocytes under chlorhexidine pressure (ST22 3.18%, ST36 4.57% vs ST239-TW 12.79%; P < 0.0001) was consistently higher for ST239-TW.
Conclusions
We present evidence that MRSA clones with similarly low in vitro tolerance to chlorhexidine exhibit different in vivo susceptibilities. The phenomenon of S. aureus adhesion and intracellular uptake into keratinocytes could therefore be regarded as an additional mechanism of chlorhexidine tolerance, enabling MRSA to evade infection control measures."

Objectives
Since the risk of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) may depend on the setting, we aimed to determine the associations of risk factors of MDR-TB across different regions.
Methods
A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed with Pubmed and Embase databases. Information was retrieved on 37 pre-defined risk factors of MDR-TB. We estimated overall Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio as a measure of the association.
Results
Factors of previous TB disease and treatment are the most important risk factors associated with MDR-TB. There was also a trend towards increased risk of MDR-TB for patients 40 years and older, unemployed, lacking health insurance, smear positive, with non-completion and failure of TB treatment, showing adverse drug reaction, non-adherent, HIV positive, with COPD and with M. Tuberculosis Beijing infection. Effect modification by geographical area was identified for several risk factors such as male gender, married patients, urban domicile, homelessness and history of imprisonment.
Conclusions
Assessment of risk factors of MDR-TB should be conducted regionally to develop the most effective strategy for MDR-TB control. Across all regions, factors associated with previous TB disease and treatment are essential risk factors, indicating the appropriateness of diagnosis, treatment and monitoring are an important requirements."

Our objective was to develop a model that predicts a patient's risk of developing invasive mould disease (IMD) within 60 days of admission for treatment of a haematological malignancy.
Methods
We analysed 19 risk factors for IMD in a cohort of 1944 adult patients with haematological malignancies over 4127 admissions at a haematology referral centre in Northern Italy (2007-2016). We used a multivariable logistic regression to estimate the 60-day probability of developing probable or proven IMD. The model was internally validated using a bootstrap resampling procedure.
Results
The prevalence of IMD was 3.3% (90 probable cases, 43 proven cases). Seven risk factors were retained in the final risk model: (1) uncontrolled malignancy, (2) high-risk chemotherapy regimen, (3) high-dose corticosteroids, (4) severe lymphopenia, (5) CMV reactivation or disease, (6) prolonged neutropenia, and (7) a history of previous IMD within 90 days. The model displayed good calibration and discrimination in both the derivation (aROC 0.85, 95% CI 0.84-0.86) and validation (aROC 0.83 95% CI 0.79-0.89) populations.
Conclusions
Our model differentiated with 85% accuracy whether or not patients developed IMD within 60-days of admission. Individualized risk assessment, aided by validated prognostic models, could assist IMD management and improve antifungal stewardship."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
The heavy use of antibiotics in farm animals contributes to the enrichment and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in “one-health” settings. Numerous ARGs have been identified in livestock-associated environments but not in Chinese live poultry markets (LPMs).
Methods
We collected 753 poultry fecal samples from LPMs of 18 provinces and municipalities in China and sequenced the metagenomes of 130 samples. Bioinformatic tools were used to construct the gene catalog and analyze the ARG content. PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing were used to survey the distribution of mcr-1 gene in all 753 fecal samples.
Results
We found that a low number of genes but a high percentage of gene functions were shared among the poultry, human and pig gut gene catalogs. The poultry gut possessed 539 ARGs which were classified into 235 types. Both the ARG number and abundance were significantly higher in poultry than that in either pigs or humans. Fourteen ARG types were found present in all 130 samples, and tetracycline resistance (TcR) genes were the most abundant ARGs in both animals and humans. Moreover, 59.63% LPM samples harbored the colistin resistance gene mcr-1, and other mcr gene variants were also found.
Conclusions
We demonstrated that the Chinese LPMs is a repository for ARGs, posing a high risk for ARG dissemination from food animals to humans under such a trade system, which has not been addressed before."

Objectives
To examine the impact of Australia's single dose infant varicella vaccination program, we assessed single dose varicella vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing hospitalised disease using two methods.
Methods
Clinically confirmed varicella cases from the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) sentinel network were age-matched to 20 controls obtained from the Australian Immunisation Register. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate VE and compared with estimates obtained using our second approach.
Results
There were 78 hospitalised varicella cases during the post vaccine introduction period from January 2008 to December 2015, who were eligible for funded varicella vaccination. Median age at onset was 4.5 years and more than half (59%) were vaccinated. The majority of children received one vaccine brand (Varilrix, GSK). The estimated case-control VE for one dose of vaccine against hospitalised varicella was 64.7% (95% CI: 43.3–78.0%); estimates using the screening method were not significantly different. Exclusion of children who were immunocompromised did not significantly alter VE estimates.
Conclusions
Although Australia's program has impacted on the burden of varicella disease, single dose VE against varicella hospitalisation is only moderate. Greater reductions in varicella disease could potentially be achieved by incorporation of a second vaccine dose into the program to minimise breakthrough disease and interrupt virus circulation."

Objectives
To study the frequency of vertically acquired occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI).
Methods
We investigated 44 children born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive mothers. They received HBV vaccine directly after birth and at 2, 6 and 52 weeks of age; eight with HBeAg-positive mothers also received hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG). HBV DNA was analyzed in blood collected at 6 weeks and 12 months of age, and HBV antibodies at 12 and 18 months of age.
Results
HBV DNA, but not HBsAg or anti-HBc, was detected at 12 months of age in three children. The viral sequences were almost identical with HBV DNA from their mothers who all were HBeAg-positive and had received tenofovir during pregnancy. Follow-up at 5–7 years age showed that one of the three children had become seropositive for HBsAg and anti-HBc. This child and one of the other two had detectable HBV DNA at the follow-up, with whole genome sequences identical to those in HBV from their mothers.
Conclusions
Mothers-to-child transmission of HBV can, despite adequate prophylaxis, lead to OBI which may later develop into overt HBV infection. Whether such infections are of clinical importance needs to be further investigated."

abstract = "The recent emergence of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-1 poses a substantial clinical threat to the severe infections caused by CRE (Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacteriaceae), as the treatment failure of the mcr-1-positive CRE “Superbug” most likely occurs by using the combination of carbapenem and polymixins. Therefore, our study aims to seek a potent MCR-1 inhibitor to fight this infection. A checkerboard MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) assay, time-killing assay, MPNP (Modified rapid polymyxin Nordmann/Poirel) test, combined disk test and molecular modelling analysis were performed on different mcr-1-positive strains to confirm the synergistic effects of the combination of colistin and osthole (OST). And a thigh mouse infection model was also used to evaluate such synergies. We identified that OST regained the bactericidal activity of polymyxins (FIC (Fractional Inhibitory Concentration) index = 0.11±0.04 − 0.29±0.10) against mcr-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae including Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The in-vitro time-killing assays showed that either OST or polymyxins failed to eradicate mcr-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae, but the combination eliminated mcr-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae by 3–7-h post-inoculation. The mouse infection model demonstrated that the combination therapy significantly reduced the bacterial load in the thighs following subcutaneous administration. Our results established that OST is a promising natural compound that could be used to extend the life of polymyxins and to tackle the inevitability of serious infections caused by polymyxin-resistant bacteria."

Objectives
To date no definitive cut-off value for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA load in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid specimens has been established to discriminate between CMV pneumonia and pulmonary CMV DNA shedding in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients.
Methods
The current retrospective study is aimed at assessing the range of CMV DNA loads quantified in BAL fluid specimens from allo-HSCT patients with pneumonia in which different microorganisms were causally involved.
Results
A total of 144 BAL specimens from 123 patients were included. CMV DNA was detected in 56 out of 144 BAL fluid specimens and the median CMV DNA load from patients in whom CMV pneumonia was unlikely or could be tentatively ruled out was 1210 (31–68, 920) IU/ml. The frequency of CMV DNA detection and median CMV DNA loads were comparable, irrespective of the attributable cause of pneumonia. Detection of CMV DNA loads in BAL fluid specimens >500 IU/ml was independently associated with pneumonia-attributable mortality.
Conclusions
The current study highlights the difficulty in establishing universal CMV DNA load thresholds in BAL fluid specimens for distinguishing between CMV pneumonia and pulmonary CMV DNA shedding, and suggests that the presence of CMV DNA in BAL fluid specimens beyond a certain level may have a deleterious impact on patient outcome."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remains an important cause of healthcare-associated infections. Here, we describe the development of methicillin-resistant isolates among nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus (SA) infections in Germany between 2007 and 2016.
Methods
We analyzed data from the voluntary German national nosocomial Infection Surveillance System. Data on bloodstream infections (BSI) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) were derived from intensive care units (ICU), whereas data on surgical site infections (SSI) were collected from surgical departments (SD). Univariate analysis was performed on trend of proportion, while multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for MRSA-infections.
Results
Data of 1218 ICU and 1,556 SD were included. Overall, a decrease in the proportion of MRSA among all nosocomial SA-infections from 32.8% to 20.0% was noted. MRSA decreased from 37.1% to 21.8% (p = 0.01) for BSI, from 38.7% to 19.2% for LTRI (p < 0.01) and. from 21.1% to 7.4% (p < 0.01) in SSI. Logistic regression revealed that SA-infections in Mecklenburg Western-Pomerania were more likely caused by MRSA (Odds ratio (OR): 2.5; 95% CI: 1.7, 3.6).
Conclusion
We observed a significant reduction of the proportion of nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus infections due to MRSA in Germany over the course of the last 10 years."

Objectives
We assessed the impact of MALDITOF-MS on the timeliness of optimal antimicrobial therapy through a parallel-arm randomised controlled trial in two hospitals in Vietnam.
Methods
We recruited patients with a pathogen (bacterial or fungal) cultured from a normally sterile sample. Samples were randomly assigned (1:1) to identification by MALDITOF-MS or conventional diagnostics. The primary outcome was the proportion on optimal antimicrobial therapy within 24 h of positive culture, determined by a blinded independent review committee. Trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02306330).
Results
Among 1005 randomised patients, pathogens were isolated from 628 (326 intervention, 302 control), with 377 excluded as likely contaminants or discharged/died before positive culture. Most isolates were cultured from blood (421/628, 67.0%). The proportion receiving optimal antimicrobial therapy within 24 h (the primary outcome) or 48 h of growth was not significantly different between MALDITOF-MS and control arms (135/326, 41.4% vs 120/302, 39.7%; Adjusted Odds ration (AOR) 1.17, p = 0.40 and 151/326, 46.3% vs 141/302, 46.7%; AOR 1.05 p = 0.79, respectively).
Conclusions
MALDITOF-MS, in the absence of an antimicrobial stewardship programme, did not improve the proportion on optimal antimicrobial therapy at 24 or 48 h after first growth in a lower-middle income setting with high rates of antibiotic resistance."

Objectives
To assess the utility of the neutrophil:lymphocyte (NLR), lymphocyte:monocyte (LMR) and platelet:lymphocyte ratios (PLR) as infection biomarkers.
Methods
PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched to identify eligible articles. Studies of diagnosis, severity or outcome were included. PROSPERO systematic review registration CRD42017075032.
Results
Forty studies were included, reporting on bacterial and viral infections, malaria, and critical illness due to sepsis. Ten studies reported an association of higher NLR with bacteraemia, supported by meta-analysis of patient-level data (five studies, n = 3320; AUC 0.72, p<0.0001) identifying a cut-off of >12.65. Two studies reported an association with lower LMR and diagnosis of influenza virus infection in patients with respiratory tract infection. Meta-analysis of patient-level data (n = 85; AUC 0.66, p = 0.01) identified a cut-off of ≤2.06. The directionality of associations between NLR and outcomes in heterogeneous cohorts of critically ill adults with sepsis varied. Potential clinical utility was also demonstrated in pneumonia (NLR), pertussis (NLR), urinary tract infection (NLR), diabetic foot infections (NLR) and Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (PLR). Longitudinal measurement of LMR during respiratory virus infection reflected symptoms and NLR during sepsis and bacteraemia predicted mortality.
Conclusions
Peripheral blood leucocyte ratios are useful infection biomarkers, with the most evidence related to diagnosis of bacteraemia and influenza virus infection. In critical illness due to sepsis, a signal towards an association with NLR and outcomes exists, and NLR should be evaluated in future stratification models. Longitudinal measurement of ratios during infection could be informative. Overall, these biomarkers warrant further recognition and study in infectious diseases."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Sepsis is an overwhelming systemic inflammatory response for which no satisfactory therapeutic drug is available. Previous studies have shown that autophagy is involved in the cytokine storm and vascular leakage that occur during sepsis. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of autophagy inhibitors against bacterial infection-induced sepsis.
Methods
Cytokine production and phagocytosis of bacteria by human leukocytes and the permeability of endothelial cells were determined after the co-incubation of cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Escherichia coli in the presence or absence of autophagy inhibitors in vitro. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of the autophagy inhibitors in E. coli-infected mice were analysed.
Results
In the presence of the autophagy inhibitors, the LPS-triggered cytokine secretion of human leucocytes and LPS (or LPS-conditioned medium from leucocytes)-induced endothelial hyperpermeability were significantly reduced. Moreover, the inhibition of autophagy enhanced the clearance of E. coli by leucocytes in vitro. Finally, we demonstrated that post-treatment but not pretreatment with an autophagy inhibitor (hydroxychloroquine) completely protected mice against E. coli infection-induced lethality by simultaneously reducing cytokine production and vascular leakage and enhancing bacterial clearance.
Conclusions
These results suggest that autophagy plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for sepsis."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Q fever fatigue syndrome (QFS) is a state of prolonged fatigue following around 20% of acute Q fever cases. It is thought that chronic inflammation plays a role in its etiology. To test this hypothesis we measured circulating cytokines and the ex-vivo cytokine production in patients with QFS and compared with various control groups.
Materials/methods
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), whole blood, and serum were collected from 20 QFS patients, 19 chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients, 19 Q fever seropositive controls, and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Coxiella-specific ex-vivo production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and interferon (IFN) was measured, together with a total of 92 circulating inflammatory proteins.
Results
PBMCs of QFS patients produced more IL-6 (P = 0.0001), TNFα (P = 0.0002), and IL-1β (P = 0.0005) than the various control groups when stimulated with Coxiella antigen. QFS patients had distinct differences in circulating inflammatory markers compared to the other groups, including higher concentrations of circulating IL-6 and IFNγ.
Conclusion
QFS patients showed signs of chronic inflammation compared to asymptomatic Q fever seropositive controls, CFS patients, and healthy controls, of which the monocyte-derived cytokines TNFα, IL-1β, and especially IL-6, are likely crucial components."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Data on the longer-term effectiveness of second line combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are lacking. We sought to assess the probability and determinants of 2nd line ART failure in SSA.
Methods
A retrospective, multi-center study of 2nd line ART initiated between 2005 and 2017 at four ART centers in Ethiopia, Ghana and Uganda. Main outcome measure was virologic failure (VF) defined as VL>1000 copies/ml after >6 months on 2nd line therapy. Predictors of VF and virologic re-suppression on 2nd line were evaluated using Cox Proportional Hazards and multivariable logistic regression models, respectively.
Results
2191 subjects started 2nd line therapy, 61.5% females. Switching from 1st line (56.4% NVP-based, 70.3% including thymidine-analogues) to 2nd line therapy occurred after mean of 4.1 years. 98.9% of patients started boosted PI with NRTI backbone (TDF+3TC/FTC 67.3%, AZT+3TC 18.5%, others 14.2%). There were 267 (12.0%) VF with a 5-year estimated probability of 15.0% (95% CI 13.2–16.9). Key determinants of VF were concomitant rifampicin use (aHR 2.50 [95% CI 1.54–4.05]) and clinical/immunological failure versus virologic failure as reason for switching therapy (aHR, 0.53 [0.33–0.86]). 138 of 267 (51.7%) subsequently achieved virologic re-suppression and predictors included HIV RNA levels at 2nd-line failure: +1 log higher aOR 0.59 [0.43–0.80], experiencing change within 2nd line ART before VF: aOR 0.17 [0.05–0.56], and more recent calendar year of 2nd line initiation: aOR 0.85 [0.75–0.94].
Conclusions
The effectiveness of current 2nd line ART regimens in SSA is good but challenged by interactions with TB therapy."

abstract = "Objectives
To identify risk factors for mortality in a cohort of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE) carriers, focusing on immunosuppression and other risk factors known at the time of CRE carriage detection.
Methods
We prospectively followed all new and known CRE carriers admitted between June 2016 and June 2017 to a single tertiary center in Israel. Patients were included in the study after confirmation of the carrier state. Demographic and clinical data were documented on admission or CRE acquisition and patients were followed prospectively post-discharge until January 2018 or death. Risk factors for mortality known at the time of the first encounter with a CRE carrier were sought. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for mortality at end of follow-up with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were assessed using Cox regression analysis.
Results
A total of 115 patients were included in the analysis. During the study period, 66 (57.4%) patients died. Immunosuppression was associated with mortality (HR 1.95, CI 95% 1.12–3.44), adjusted to the Charlson co-morbidity score, functional status, chronic renal disease and Klebsiella pneumonia CRE, the latter three also significantly associated with mortality. CRE bacteremia occurred among 24 (20.9%) carriers during follow up, more frequently among immunosuppressed patients and was significantly associated with mortality at end of follow-up (p = 0.015).
Conclusion
Immunosuppression is independently associated with mortality among CRE carriers, possibly related to CRE bacteremia that is frequent among these patients. Further research is needed on interventions to prevent deaths among CRE carriers."

abstract = "Objectives
Escherichia coli is the leading cause of bacteraemia. In an era of emerging multi-drug-resistant strains, development of effective preventative strategies will be informed by knowledge of strain diversity associated with specific infective syndromes/patient groups. We hypothesised that the number of virulence factor (VF) genes amongst bacteraemia isolates from neutropaenic patients would be lower than isolates from immunocompetent patients.
Methods
Immunocompetent and neutropaenic adults with E. coli bacteraemia were recruited prospectively and the source of bacteraemia determined. VF gene profiles were established in silico following whole genome sequencing.
Results
Isolates from individual patients were monoclonal. Strains from immunocompetent patients with urinary tract infective foci (UTIF) harboured more VF genes (median number of VF genes 16, range 8–24) than isolates from both immunocompetent patients with non-UTIF (10, 2–22, p = 0.0058) and neutropaenic patients with unknown focus of infection (NPUFI) (8, 3–13, p < 0.0001). Number of VF genes (OR 1.21, 95% CIs 1.01–1.46, p = 0.039) and urinary catheter/recurrent urinary tract infection (OR 12.82, 95% CIs 1.24–132.65, p = 0.032) were independent predictors of bacteraemia secondary to UTIF vs. non-UTIF in immunocompetent patients. papA, papC, papE/F, papG, agn43, tia, iut, fyuA, kpsM and sat were significantly more prevalent amongst UTIF- vs non-UTIF-originating isolates amongst immunocompetent patients, while papC, papE/F, papG, agn43, tia, fyuA, hlyA, usp and clb were significantly more prevalent amongst UTIF- vs NPUFI-associated isolates.
Conclusions
Bacteraemia-associated E. coli strains originating from UTIF have distinct VF gene profiles from strains associated with non-UTIF- and NPUFI. This diversity must be addressed in the design of future vaccines to ensure adequate coverage of strains responsible for site-specific disease."

To assess periodontitis prevalence and severity in HIV infected patients as compared to controls. Furthermore, to assess whether HIV infection characteristics are associated with periodontitis.
Design
cross-sectional controlled study.
Methods
We assessed prevalence and severity of periodontitis in 258 HIV-infected patients and 539 historical controls with the Dutch Periodontal Screening Index (DPSI). HIV characteristics were collected from medical charts. Age-related diseases and oral care were assessed with questionnaires.
Results
Severe periodontitis (DPSI 4) was more prevalent in HIV-infected patients than in controls (66% vs. 36%, p = 0.002). HIV-infection, increasing age and male sex were significant risk factors for severe periodontitis. In particular, older male HIV patients have a higher risk of severe periodontitis. Clinical, immunological and virologic characteristics, and antiretroviral therapy were not associated with periodontitis prevalence or severity. HIV-infected patients rate the importance of their oral health as high, although many do not disclose their HIV infection to their dentists.
Conclusions
Prevalence and severity of periodontitis are higher in HIV-infected patients compared to controls, particularly in older males. Awareness of the increased prevalence of periodontitis associated with HIV-infection among patients and health-care professionals could significantly improve oral health and quality of life of HIV-infected patients."

Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious re-emergent public health problem in the UK. In response to rising case incidence a National TB Strain-Typing Service based on molecular strain-typing was established. This facilitates early detection and investigation of clusters, targeted public health action, and prevention of further transmission. We review the added public health value of investigating molecular TB strain-typed (ST) clusters.
Methods
A structured questionnaire for each ST cluster investigated in England between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2013 was completed. Questions related to epidemiological links and public health action and the perceived benefits of ST cluster investigation.
Results
There were 278 ST cluster investigations (CIs) involving 1882 TB cases. Cluster size ranged from 2 to 92. CIs identified new epidemiological links in 36% of clusters; in 18% STs were discordant refuting transmission thought to have occurred. Additional public health action was taken following 23% of CI.
Conclusions
We found positive benefits of TB molecular ST and CI, in identifying new epidemiological links between cases and taking public health action and in refuting transmission and saving resources. This needs to be translated to a decrease in transmission to provide evidence of public health value in this low prevalence high resource setting."

Background
Clinical application of the CD8 response as measured by the newer interferon gamma release assay, QuantiFERON-TB Gold-Plus (QFT-Plus), remains to be investigated.
Method
We performed this prospective study and recruited active TB patients, contacts with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and contacts without LTBI in two centres in northern Taiwan in 2017. Subjects were tested with both QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) and QFT-Plus. LTBI was defined by positive result by QFT-GIT and exclusion of active TB.
Results
A total of 336 participants (118 uninfected contacts, 105 LTBI, 113 active TB) were included. The concordance rate of QFT-GIT and QFT-Plus was high (n = 300, 89.3%). The kappa value was 0.811 among contacts and 0.708 among active TB. While TB1 and TB2 quantitative responses were not different between active TB and LTBI (TB1: 1.74 ± 2.73 IU/ml vs. 2.03 ± 2.28 IU/ml, p = 0.403; TB2: 2.21 ± 3.09 IU/ml vs. 2.15 ± 2.40 IU/ml, p = 0.867), CD8 response was higher in active TB than LTBI (0.47 ± 1.53 IU/ml vs. −0.06 ± 1.47 IU/ml, p = 0.011). Culture-confirmed TB had a higher CD8 response compared with LTBI (0.63 ± 1.74 IU/ml vs. −0.05 ± 1.47 IU/ml, p = 0.004).
Conclusions
This study demonstrated specific CD8 responses among uninfected contacts, LTBI as well as active TB."

Objectives
Current national estimates of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated hospital admissions are insufficiently detailed to determine optimal vaccination strategies for RSV. We employ novel methodology to estimate the burden of RSV-associated hospital admissions in infants in England, with detailed stratification by patient and clinical characteristics.
Methods
We used linked, routinely collected laboratory and hospital data to identify laboratory-confirmed RSV-positive and RSV-negative respiratory hospital admissions in infants in England, then generate a predictive logistic regression model for RSV-associated admissions. We applied this model to all respiratory hospital admissions in infants in England, to estimate the national burden of RSV-associated admissions by calendar week, age in weeks and months, clinical risk group and birth month.
Results
We estimated an annual average of 20,359 (95% CI 19,236-22,028) RSV-associated admissions in infants in England from mid-2010 to mid-2012. These admissions accounted for 57,907 (95% CI 55,391-61,637) annual bed days. 55% of RSV-associated bed days and 45% of RSV-associated admissions were in infants <3 months old. RSV-associated admissions peaked in infants aged 6 weeks, and those born September to November.
Conclusions
We employed novel methodology using linked datasets to produce detailed estimates of RSV-associated admissions in infants. Our results provide essential baseline epidemiological data to inform future vaccine policy."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) diagnosis is mandatory in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) requiring biologics. QuantiFERON-TB-Plus (QFT-P), an LTBI diagnostic test, measures IFN-γ after M. tuberculosis-stimulation in TB1 and TB2 tubes in which a “CD4” or a “CD4 and CD8” response is respectively elicited. Aim of this study is to compare the response to QFT-P of IMID-LTBI patients candidates to a new biological therapy vs LTBI-subjects without IMID.
Methods
We prospectively enrolled 167 subjects: 61 IMID-LTBI and 106 NON-IMID-LTBI.
Results
All subjects were mitogen-responders. IFN-γ production was significantly lower in IMID-LTBI-patients compared to NON-IMID-LTBI-subjects. We observed discordant TB1 and TB2 results in 6.5% of IMID-LTBI-patients and in 8% of NON-IMID-LTBI-subjects. Applying a logistic regression analysis, we found that IMID-LTBI patients had a higher probability (TB1 stimulation OR 3.32; TB2 stimulation OR 4.33) to have IFNγ results ≤0.7 IU/mL compared to NON-IMID-LTBI-subjects. Interestingly, IMID-treatment did not interfere with the distribution of IFNγ-values.
Conclusions
These results indicate that IMID-LTBI-patients have a low IFN-γ response to QFT-P, a high proportion of results ranging in the grey zone and a distribution of IFNγ-values independent from the IMID-treatment. These results are important for the management of LTBI screening in IMID patients."

Objective
We aimed to identify plasma cytokine biomarkers that differentiate the infection stages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB).
Methods
This study included a total of 227 subjects consisting of active tuberculosis (ATB) patients, latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) individuals, and healthy controls (HC). We analyzed the expressions of 38 plasma cytokines in the discovery cohort to identify the biosignatures for differentiating MTB infection states, area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency. The AUC of unique plasma biomarker was confirmed in the validation cohort.
Results
In the discovery cohort, the AUC of the 8-marker biosignature (eotaxin, MIP-1α, MDC, IP-10, MCP-1, IL-1α, IL-10, and TNF-α) in diagnosing ATB was 1.0. The sensitivity and specificity of the 5-marker biosignature (IP-10, MCP-1, IL-1α, IL-10, and TNF-α) in diagnosing LTBI were 94% and 81.25%, respectively. The AUC of the 3-signature biosignature (eotaxin, MDC, MCP-1) in differentiating ATB from LTBI was 0.94, with the sensitivity and specificity of 87.76% and 91.84%, respectively. Moreover, among all the single cytokine biomarkers, MCP-1 exhibited the highest AUC in diagnosing ATB (0.98) and differentiating ATB from LTBI (0.91). In the subsequent validation cohort analysis, we identified that the AUC of MCP-1 in diagnosing ATB and differentiating ATB from LTBI were 0.97 and 0.89, respectively, which was generally consistent with the results of the discovery cohort.
Conclusion
Cytokine levels in plasma can be used as biosignatures to diagnose ATB. The cytokine concentrations vary during the different stages of MTB infection, which might serve as biomarkers in differentiating ATB from LTBI. Future studies with a larger population and data from multiple institutions are needed to validate our findings."

Lymphopenic (<724 lymphocytes/µL) community-acquired pneumonia (L-CAP) is an immunophenotype with an increased risk of mortality. We aimed to characterize the l-CAP immunophenotype though lymphocyte subsets and the inflammatory response and its relationship with severity at presentation and outcome.
Methods
Prospective study of 217 immunocompetent patients hospitalized for CAP. Lymphocyte subsets (CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and natural killer [NK] cells) and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed on days 1 and 4, and immunoglobulin subclasses were analyzed on day 1 in a nested group.
Results
39% of patients showed l-CAP, with decreased levels of all lymphocyte subsets with a partial recovery of CD4+ and CD8+ cells by day 4. l-CAP patients exhibited higher initial severity and systemic levels of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Initial IgG2 levels were lower in patients with <724 lymphocytes/µL and positively correlated with ALC, CD4+, and CD19+ cell counts. Low CD4+ counts (<129 cells/µL) also independently predicted 30-day mortality after adjusting for age, gender, and the CURB-65 score.
Conclusions
l-CAP is characterized by CD4+ depletion, a higher inflammatory response, and low IgG2 levels that correlated with greater severity at presentation and worse prognosis. l-CAP is an immunophenotype useful for rapidly recognizing severity."

Objectives
To identify transmission patterns of Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection during an outbreak at a large, tertiary care hospital and to detect whether the outbreak organisms spread to other facilities in the integrated healthcare network.
Methods
We analyzed 71 K. pneumoniae whole genome sequences collected from clinical specimens before, during and after the outbreak and reviewed corresponding patient medical records. Sequence and patient data were used to model probable transmissions and assess factors associated with the outbreak.
Results
We identified close genetic relationships among carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates sampled during the study period. Transmission tree analysis combined with patient records uncovered extended periods of silent colonization in many study patients and transmission routes that were likely the result of asymptomatic patients transitioning between facilities.
Conclusions
Detecting how and where Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infections spread is challenging in an environment of rising prevalence, asymptomatic carriage and mobility of patients. Whole genome sequencing improved the precision of investigating inter-facility transmissions. Our results emphasize that containment of Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infections requires coordinated efforts between healthcare networks and settings of care that acknowledge and mitigate transmission risk conferred by undetected carriage and by patient transfers between facilities."

Objectives
This study was aimed to determine pertussis specific serum PT-IgG antibodies in healthy individuals during 2010 and 2015/2016 in Beijing, China.
Methods
A total of 3884 healthy individuals were included: 3058 aged 3–69 years randomly selected from an epidemiological survey conducted in 2010, and 826 aged 20–39 years selected from those who attended an annual medical examination in 2015/2016. Serum PT-IgG antibodies were determined using the Serion/Virion ELISA kits.
Results
Of 3058 subjects in 2010, 167 (5.5%) and 39 (1.3%) subjects had PT-IgG antibodies ≥40 IU/ml and ≥100 IU/ml, respectively. No differences were observed among different age groups. Altogether, 26.2% had undetectable PT-IgG antibodies (<5 IU/ml), and the highest undetectable rate of 56.8% was found in children aged 3–5 years. When the age group of 20–39 years was compared between the two periods, no difference was found in seroprevalence of PT-IgG antibodies ≥ 40 IU/ml (5.1% vs. 4.0%). However, an undetectable rate of PT-IgG antibodies was significantly higher in 2015/2016 than that in 2010 (57.4% vs. 29.1%, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Our results showed that about 5% of individuals had PT-IgG antibodies indicative of a recent infection, and adults at childbearing age have an increased risk to pertussis in China."

Objectives
To evaluate the performance of QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection test among registered village doctors from China.
Methods
MTB infection of the registered village doctors in Zhongmu County were tested using QFT-Plus and two other interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) in parallel: QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) and T-SPOT.TB (T-SPOT). Retests were carried out for baseline positives at 3 and 6 months later, respectively.
Results
A total of 616 village doctors were included in the baseline examination. The positivity of QFT, QFT-Plus and T-SPOT was 27.91% (168/602), 31.22% (187/599) and 27.70% (169/610), respectively. The concordance between QFT and QFT-Plus was 94.81% (Kappa coefficient: 0.87) and between T-SPOT and QFT-Plus was 88.93% (Kappa coefficient: 0.73). Reversions were frequently observed for all three assays. With respect to QFT-Plus, the quantitative results of reversions in the serial testing were mostly distributed in an “uncertain range” zone (0.2-0.7 IU/mL). Similar patterns of distribution were observed for QFT and T-SPOT as well.
Conclusion
Village doctors should gain more attention as an at-risk group for TB infection control in rural China. Our results support, by means of serial testing, a good agreement between QFT-Plus and QFT in Chinese population."

Although distinct from other superantigens, speQ and speR were most closely related to speK and speJ, respectively. Recombinant SPEQ and SPER were mitogenic towards human peripheral blood mononuclear cells at ng/ml concentrations, and SPER was found to be more mitogenic than SPEQ."

abstract = "Summary
The IFN-γ release assays (IGRAs) based on region of difference 1 (RD1) antigens have improved diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. However, IGRAs with these antigens could not distinguish latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) from active tuberculosis (ATB). DosR regulon genes are thought to be important for Mtb dormancy, and their products have higher immunogenicity in LTBI than ATB individuals, suggesting protective immunity mediated by DosR regulon-encoded antigens and potential utility of them for differential diagnostics of Mtb-infected populations or development of therapeutic vaccines against tuberculosis (TB). Among them, Rv2028c is a dormancy-related antigen that has demonstrated potential use in TB control, but its immunological characteristics in the BCG-vaccinated Chinese population are unknown. In this study, a total of 148 individuals, including 98 patients with ATB, 20 cases with LTBI and 30 healthy controls, were tested for Rv2028c-specific T cell responses by using an IFN-γ ELISA assay. The results showed that the T-cell responses in LTBI individuals were almost always higher than those in ATB patients, regardless of the site of infection or the results of bacteriological examination in the patients. This allowed for good differentiation between these two groups of Mtb-infected individuals even in the BCG-vaccinated high TB-incidence setting that pertains in China. In addition, the diagnostic efficacy for ATB was enhanced by combining the results from Rv2028c and RD1 antigen-based IFN-γ ELISA assays. In conclusion, Rv2028c-specific T-cell responses might contribute to natural protection against dormant Mtb infection, and the determination of these responses can aid discrimination between healthy LTBI individuals and ATB patients in the Mtb-infected populations."

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes respiratory infection across the world, with infants and the elderly at particular risk of developing severe disease and death. The replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus (PanAd3-RSV) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA-RSV) vaccines were shown to be safe and immunogenic in young healthy adults. Here we report an extension to this first-in-man vaccine trial to include healthy older adults aged 60–75 years.
Methods
We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of MVA-RSV given by intra-muscular (IM) injection (n = 6), two doses of IM PanAd3-RSV given 4-weeks apart (n = 6), IM PanAd3-RSV prime and IM MVA-RSV boost 8-weeks later (n = 6), intra-nasal (IN) spray of PanAd3-RSV prime and IM MVA-RSV boost 8-weeks later (n = 6), or no vaccine (n = 6). Safety measures included all adverse events within one week of vaccination and blood monitoring. Immunogenicity measures included serum antibody responses (RSV- and PanAd3-neutralising antibody titres measured by plaque-reduction neutralisation and SEAP assays, respectively), peripheral B-cell immune responses (frequencies of F-specific IgG and IgA antibody secreting cells and memory B-cells by ex vivo and cultured dual-colour ELISpot assays respectively), and peripheral RSV-specific T-cell immune responses (frequencies of IFNγ-producing T-cells by ex vivo ELISpot and CD4+/CD8+/Tfh-like cell frequencies by ICS/FACS assay).
Results
The vaccines were safe and well tolerated. Compared with each individual baseline immunity the mean fold-changes in serum RSV-neutralising antibody, appearance and magnitude of F-specific IgG and IgA ASCs and expansion of CD4+/CD8+ IFNγ-producing T-cells in peripheral circulation were comparable to the results seen from younger healthy adults who received the same vaccine combination and dose. There were little/no IgA memory B-cell responses in younger and older adults. Expansion of IFNγ-producing T-cells was most marked in older adults following IM prime, with balanced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. The RSV-specific immune responses to vaccination did not appear to be attenuated in the presence of PanAd3 (vector) neutralising antibody.
Conclusions
PanAd3-RSV and MVA-RSV was safe and immunogenic in older adults and the parallel induction of RSV-specific humoral and cellular immunity merits further assessment in providing protection from severe disease."

This study sought to determine SV40 seroprevalence in residents of two Latin American countries, Colombia and Nicaragua, which were sites of prelicensure oral poliovaccine (OPV) trials.
Methods
Archival sera were tested for SV40 neutralizing antibody using a virus-specific plaque-reduction assay. Samples included 517 sera from Colombia and 149 sera from Nicaragua.
Results
Overall SV40 seroprevalence was 22.8% for Colombian subjects and 12.8% for Nicaraguans. Subgroups of Colombian subjects ranged in frequency of SV40 seropositivity from 10.0% to 38.6%. Birth cohorts both older and younger than the age cohort that contained potential OPV vaccinees from both countries had SV40 antibodies. Gender and ethnicity had no significant effects on SV40 seropositivity.
Conclusions
Inhabitants of both Colombia and Nicaragua had detectable SV40 neutralizing antibody, including those of ages presumably not recipients of potentially SV40-contaminated OPV. This observation provides support for the concept that transmission of SV40 human infections can occur. Frequency of SV40 antibody positivity was elevated over that reported for the US where there was limited use of contaminated OPV. This investigation indicates also that study results of SV40 infections in humans will reflect whether subject populations had probable exposures to contaminated poliovaccines and to environmental conditions favoring cycles of viral transmission."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Rotavirus is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children worldwide. In China, the universal immunization of children with the rotavirus vaccine has not been introduced, and the two globally distributed vaccines (RotaTeq and Rotarix) are not licensed in the country. We aim to determine the prevalence and strain diversity of rotavirus in children with diarrhea aged ≤ five years across China.
Materials and methods
Sentinel-based surveillance of acute diarrhea was conducted at 213 participating hospitals in China from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2015. Group A rotavirus (RVA) was tested by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and G- and P-genotype of RVA were tested by RT-PCR methods.
Results
Of 33,616 children with diarrhea, 10,089 (30%) were positive for RVA; RVA-associated diarrhea was identified in 2247 (39.5%, n = 2247/5685) inpatients and 7842 (28.1%, n = 7842/27931) outpatients. Children living in low-middle-income regions suffered from the highest burden of rotavirus, with 40.7% of diarrhea cases attributed to rotavirus infection, followed by 31.3% in upper-middle-income and 11.2% in high-income regions. The majority of children (88.9%, n = 8976/10089) who tested positive for RVA were children aged ≤ 2 years. The seasonal peak of RVA was in the winter. Among all 2533 RVA strains genotyped, five strain combinations, G9P[8], G3P[8], G1P[8], G2P[4] and G3P[4], contributed to 71.3% (1807/2533) of the RVA-associated diarrhea cases. The predominant strain of RVA has rapidly evolved from G3P[8] and G1P[8] to G9P[8] in the recent years, with the proportion of G9P[8] having increased remarkably from 3.4% in 2009 to 60.9% in 2015.
Conclusions
The burden of diarrhea attributed to rotavirus is high in China, highlighting the potential value of vaccination. The rapid shift of RVA strains highlights the importance of conducting rotavirus surveillance to ensure that currently marketed vaccines provide protective efficacy against the circulating strains."

Objectives
To critically appraise and evaluate the diagnostic value of symptoms and signs in identifying UTI in older adult outpatients, using evidence from observational studies.
Methods
We searched Medline and Medline in process, Embase and Web of Science, from inception up to September 2017. We included studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and/or signs in predicting UTI in outpatients aged 65 years and above. Study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool.
Results
We identified 15 eligible studies of variable quality, with a total of 12,039 participants (range 65–4259), and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of 66 different symptoms and signs in predicting UTI. A number of symptoms and signs typically associated with UTI, such as nocturia, urgency and abnormal vital signs, were of limited use in older adult outpatients. Inability to perform a number of acts of daily living were predictors of UTI: For example, disability in feeding oneself, + ve LR: 11.8 (95% CI 5.51–25.2) and disability in washing one's hands and face, + ve LR: 6.84 (95% CI 4.08–11.5).
Conclusions
The limited evidence of varying quality shows that a number of symptoms and signs traditionally associated with UTI may have limited diagnostic value in older adult outpatients."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Frequent reversion has been commonly observed in serial QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) tests, which limited its accuracy in defining the status of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection. Serum cytokine profiles might provide additional information to clarify the infection status.
Method
Based on a population-based cohort study aiming to track MTB infection acquisition and disease development, serum profiles of 12 cytokines were determined by bead-based multiplex assays in parallel with QFT and tuberculin skin tests (TST) to explore potential relation between serum cytokines and MTB infection status.
Results
Totally, 309 subjects got QFT conversion in one year (2013–2014) and 46.92% (145/309) of them got reversion in 2015. The study subjects were classified into three groups according to their QFT and TST results in 2015 (QFT persistence positive, QFT-/TST + and QFT-/TST-). The serum levels of MCP-1 and IL-8 were significantly different among the three groups. Furthermore, level of IL-8 was dramatically lower in QFT-/TST- group as compared to the other two groups, and no significant difference was observed for QFT-/TST + group as comparing with persistent positive group.
Conclusion
Our results suggested that the decreased serum level of IL-8 might be potential biomarker to identify QFT reversion caused by infection clearance."

Background
Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (SAB) is a common, life-threatening infection with a high mortality. Survival can be improved by implementing quality of care bundles in hospitals. We previously observed marked differences in mortality between hospitals and now assessed whether mortality could serve as a valid and easy to implement quality of care outcome measure.
Methods
We conducted a prospective observational study between January 2013 and April 2015 on consecutive, adult patients with SAB from 11 tertiary care centers in Germany, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. Factors associated with mortality at 90 days were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression and flexible parametric models.
Results
1851 patients with a median age of 66 years (64% male) were analyzed. Crude 90-day mortality differed significantly between hospitals (range 23–39%). Significant variation between centers was observed for methicillin-resistant S. aureus, community-acquisition, infective foci, as well as measures of comorbidities, and severity of disease. In multivariable analysis, factors independently associated with mortality at 90 days were age, nosocomial acquisition, unknown infective focus, pneumonia, Charlson comorbidity index, SOFA score, and study center. The risk of death varied over time differently for each infective focus. Crude mortality differed markedly from adjusted mortality.
Discussion
We observed significant differences in adjusted mortality between hospitals, suggesting differences in quality of care. However, mortality is strongly influenced by patient mix and thus, crude mortality is not a suitable quality indicator."

Objectives
Tuberculous meningitis carries a high rate of mortality and morbidity despite of an adequate treatment. Newer agents are being searched to improve outcome of these patients. Fluoroquinolones might be useful in the management of tuberculous meningitis in view of good cerebrospinal fluid penetration and good in-vitro activity against the mycobacterium. This review summarizes the effects of fluoroquinolone in first line regimens in tuberculous meningitis.
Methods
A systematic search of literature was performed using PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and LILACS for articles published till march 2017. We also searched meta-register of controlled trials and bibliography of relevant studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) where a fluoroquinolone was administered in addition or substitution of standard antituberculosis drugs formed the basis of selection criteria. Data was extracted on a pre-specified format. Risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data was calculated and fixed effect model was used to combined the data if no heterogeneity was found. Death was taken as the primary outcome measure.
Results
Five trials including 1115 patients of tuberclous meningitis were included. Addition of a fluoroquinolone to a standard regimen was not found to significantly reduce mortality [RR = 0.68 (0.30–1.52)] (low-quality evidence). Addition of a fluoroquinolone to an intensified regimen (containing high dose rifampicin) was not found to significantly reduce mortality [RR = 0.97 (0.78–1.20)] (low-quality evidence). Substitution of fluoroquinolone for ethambutol [RR = 1.17 (0.67–2.07)] (moderate-quality evidence, risk of harm cannot be ruled out) or for rifampicin [RR = 0.57 (0.32–1.01)] (low-quality evidence) in the standard regimen in terms of mortality did not show any benefit. There was no significant difference in the distribution of overall adverse events except for a higher incidence of vision loss and seizures in the fluoroquinolone arm.
Conclusion
Routine addition or substitution of a fluroquinolone in the standard regimen can not be recommended at present. As most of the evidence driven in this review was of moderate- to low-quality, further research in this area is expected to make a significant impact in formulating a directive."

Objectives
Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) are designed for diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) infection, and do not discriminate latent TB infection (LTBI) from active TB. Heparin-binding hemagglutinin antigen (HBHA) emerged as a promising antigen for TB diagnosis when used in IGRA format. Aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the performance of an HBHA-based IGRA to support TB diagnosis and TB therapy monitoring in children with TB infection or active TB disease.
Methods
Following clinical, microbiological and radiological assessment, children (0–14 years old) were tested by the QuantiFERON TB-Gold In tube (QFT) assay and an aliquot of whole-blood was stimulated with HBHA and IFNγ evaluated only in QFT-positive subjects.
Results
Among the 550 children tested, 486 (88.4%) scored negative and 64 (11.6%) positive. None of the QFT-negative had active TB. Among the QFT-positive, 45 were with LTBI and 19 active TB. HBHA-IGRA scored positive in 41/45 children (91.1%) with LTBI and in 6/19 active TB children (31.6%) at diagnosis (p = 0.001); remarkably, 5 of these 6 children with active TB scoring HBHA-positive were asymptomatic. Moreover, following TB-specific therapy, most of the non-HBHA-responding children, gained an HBHA-positive response.
Conclusions
HBHA-based IGRA is a useful support in TB diagnosis and TB-therapy monitoring in children."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Febrile urinary tract infections (fUTI) can often be treated safely with oral antimicrobials in an outpatient setting. However, a minority of patients develop complications that may progress into septic shock. An accurate assessment of disease severity upon emergency department (ED) presentation is therefore crucial in order to guide the most appropriate triage and treatment decisions.
Methods
Consecutive patients were enrolled with presumptive fUTI across 7 EDs in the Netherlands. The biomarkers mid-regional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and a clinical score (PRACTICE), were compared in their ability to predict a clinically severe course of fUTI, initial hospital admission and subsequent readmission using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves.
Results
Biomarker concentrations were measured in 313 patients, with 259 (83%) hospitalized upon ED presentation, and 54 (17%) treated as outpatients. Of these outpatients, 12 (22%) were later hospitalized. MR-proADM had the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting a complicated fUTI (AUROC [95% CI]: 0.86 [0.79–0.92]), followed by PCT (AUROC [95% CI]: 0.69 [0.58–0.80]). MR-proADM concentrations were unique in being significantly elevated in patients directly admitted and in outpatients requiring subsequent hospitalization, compared to those completing treatment at home. A virtual triage algorithm with an MR-proADM cut-off of 0.80  nmol/L resulted in a hospitalization rate of 66%, with only 2% secondary admissions.
Conclusion
MR-proADM could accurately predict a severe course in patients with fUTI, and identify greater patient numbers who could be safely managed as outpatients. An initial assessment on ED presentation may focus resources to patients with highest disease severities."

abstract = "Summary
Background
We aimed to estimate population-level exposure to Campylobacter and associated risk factors, using three approaches for serological data analysis.
Methods
Nationwide, population-based serosurvey in the Netherlands (Feb 2006–Jun 2007). Anti-Campylobacter IgG, IgM and IgA were measured using ELISA, and analysed via: a) seroincidence estimation, using reference values of antibody peak levels and decay rates over-time after Campylobacter exposure; b) two normal distributions of true positives/negatives fitted to the IgG distribution to derive seroprevalence and individual probability of being positive/negative; and c) IgG levels. Risk factors were analysed using multiple linear regressions.
Results
From 1559 respondents, seroincidence was estimated at 1.61 infections/person-year (95%CI:1.58–1.64) and seroprevalence at 68.1% (65.4–70.9). The three approaches identified similar risk factors, although seroincidence had higher power and results were interpretable as risk: seroincidence was higher in females [exp(b) = 1.07(1.04–1.11)], older ages [vs. 15–34 years; for < 5, 5–14, 35–54 and 55–70 years: 0.60(0.58–0.63), 0.74(0.71–0.78), 1.08(1.03–1.13) and 1.08(1.01–1.16), respectively], non-Dutch background [Moroccan/Turkish: 1.25(1.14–1.37); Caribbean: 1.14(1.03–1.25)], low socioeconomic status [1.05(1.01–1.10)], traveling outside Europe [1.05(1.01–1.09)], and eating undercooked meat [1.04(1.01–1.08)].
Conclusion
Campylobacter exposure is much higher than clinical infection rates, but risk factors are similar to those previously described.Seroincidence is a powerful measure to study Campylobacter epidemiology, and is preferred over other methods."

Since its emergence in March 2013, novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus has triggered five epidemics of human infections in China. This raises concerns about the pandemic threat of this quickly evolving H7N9 subtype for humans. In this study, we evaluated all available genomes for H7N9 and H9N2 influenza A viruses. Our assessment discovered that H7N9 of the 1st wave had the lowest nucleotide diversity, which then experienced substantial and rapid population expansion from a small founder population. From the 2nd wave, their nucleotide diversity increased quickly, indicating that H7N9 viruses had acquired larger populations and mutations after their initial emergence in 2013. After the phylogeographic divergence in the 2nd wave, although the HA and NA genes from different regions differed, compared to previous epidemics, the evolving H7N9 viruses in the 5th wave lost most of their previous clades. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N9 viruses in the 5th wave clustered together, and clustered close to the low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus isolated from the Pearl River Delta in the 3rd and 4th waves. This result supports the origin of HPAI H7N9 viruses was in the Pearl River Delta. In the 5th wave, although both HPAI and LPAI H7N9 viruses were isolated from the Pearl River Delta, their HA and NA genes were phylogenetically distinct."

Objectives
Group A streptococcus (GAS) is responsible for mild to very severe disease. The epidemiology of an upsurge in invasive GAS (iGAS) infections in Ireland, 2012–2015 was investigated.
Methods
Epidemiological typing of iGAS (n = 473) isolates was performed and compared to non-invasive (n = 517) isolates. Clinical data of notified iGAS was obtained from the national infectious disease information system.
Results
Annual incidences of iGAS cases (n = 561) were 2.33–3.66 per 100,000 population. Bacteraemia was the most common clinical presentation (75%) followed by focus without bacteraemia (19%) and necrotizing faciitis (7%). Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome occurred in 19% of presentations. The main invasive emm types in rank order were emm1, emm3, emm28, emm12 and emm89 whereas emm4, emm28, emm3, emm12, emm89 and emm1 predominated in non-invasive infections. Invasive emm1 and emm3 showed annual fluctuations (15–48% and 4–37%, respectively) and predominated in most clinical presentations of iGAS. Superantigens speA, speG, speJ was associated with iGAS disease and, speC, speI and ssa with non-invasive infections. There was 4.3% erythromycin and 5.6% tetracycline resistance. The main resistant types were emm11, emm28 and emm77.
Conclusions
Cyclic increases in emm1 and emm3 occurred during the iGAS upsurge. Continued surveillance of GAS is therefore essential given the epidemiological changes that occur in a short time period."

The entire human population is at risk of infectious diseases worldwide. Thus far, the diagnosis and treatment of human infectious diseases at the molecular and nanoscale levels have been extremely challenging tasks because of the lack of effective probes to identify and recognize biomarkers of pathogens. Oligonucleotide aptamers are a class of small nucleic acid ligands that are composed of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or RNA and act as affinity probes or molecular recognition elements for a variety of targets. These aptamers have an exciting potential for diagnose and/or treatment of specific diseases.

Objectives
Meningococcal conjugate vaccines (MenACWY) were licensed in the United States in 2005. We assessed the population structure of invasive Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) ten years after recommended use of MenACWY among adolescents.
Methods
Meningococcal isolates obtained through Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) from 2000–05, 2006–10, and 2011–15 underwent whole genome or Sanger sequencing. Genome phylogenies were completed using maximum likelihood methods; and distribution of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence type (ST) and clonal complex (CC), and PorA and FetA types were assessed.
Results
Prevalent serogroups (B, C, Y and W), CCs, and PorA and FetA types were detected in all three time periods, but dynamic changes were observed. The proportion of serogroup W CC11 isolates increased in 2011–15 and were most related to South American strains. Changes in CC distribution were also observed in serogroup C and serogroup Y. Phylogenetic analysis showed that U.S. serogroup W CC11s are closely related to a subset of U.S. serogroup C isolates; combined global analysis demonstrated that some CCs, including CC11, exhibit regional clustering.
Conclusions
Overall, the Nm population structure has remained stable after MenACWY introduction. Dynamic changes in genotypes, unlikely related to vaccination, also occurred, highlighting the need for continued whole genome-based surveillance."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
To evaluate burden and predictors of HSV pneumonia among immunocompromised patients not undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation according to a tailored diagnostic algorithm.
Methods
This prospective, observational study included immunocompromised adults with pneumonia non-responding to empirical antibiotic therapy. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens were cultured for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi. Real-time PCR for Herpesviruses and other microorganisms were performed on BAL and other specimens. Cytological examination of BAL samples was carried out for identification of intranuclear inclusion bodies and immunohistochemical staining for HSV.
Results
We enrolled 45 patients (mean age 64.6 years) from January 2015 to June 2016. Nineteen (42.2%) cases tested positive for HSV-1 PCR on BAL. According to our definitions, 11 (24.4%) patients had HSV-1 pneumonia with viral loads ranging between 103 copies/mL and 107 copies/mL. HSV-1 positive throat swab (OR 85.2, 95% CI 5.83–1245.1, P < 0.001) and solid organ transplant (SOT) (OR 53.3, 95% CI 1.37–2072.8, P < 0.03) as underlying condition were found to be independently associated with HSV pneumonia by multivariable analysis.
Conclusions
HSV pneumonia turned out to be relatively common and should be investigated especially in individuals with HSV positive throat swab and SOT. Interventional studies are needed to assess the real clinical impact of HSV pneumonia in immunocompromised patients."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) remains challenging, with available diagnostics being limited by inadequate sensitivities and specificities. Triacetylfusarinine C, a fungal siderophore that has been shown to accumulate in urine in animal models, is a potential new biomarker for diagnosis of IA.
Methods
We developed a method allowing absolute and matrix-independent mass spectrometric quantification of TAFC. Urine TAFC, normalized to creatinine, was determined in 44 samples from 24 patients with underlying hematologic malignancies and probable, possible or no IA according to current EORTC/MSG criteria and compared to other established biomarkers measured in urine and same-day blood samples.
Results
TAFC/creatinine sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio for probable versus no IA (cut-off ≥ 3) were 0.86, 0.88, 6.86, 0.16 per patient.
Conclusion
For the first time, we provide proof for the occurrence of TAFC in human urine. TAFC/creatinine index determination in urine showed promising results for diagnosis of IA offering the advantages of non-invasive sampling. Sensitivity and specificity were similar as reported for GM determination in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage, the gold standard mycological criterion for IA diagnosis."

Objective
microRNA expression profiles are of interest as a biomarker of tuberculosis (TB). How anti-TB therapy effects miRNA profiles is unknown and was examined.
Methods
We identified 87 plasma miRNAs that were significantly modified in an exploratory group of 19 Chinese pulmonary TB (PTB) patients compared to 14 healthy controls. We selected 10 of these miRNAs for analysis in a cohort of 100 PTB patients prior to, and at one, two and six months during treatment.
Results
Five miRNAs were differentially expressed in PTB patients compared to controls at diagnosis; miRs −29a and −99b were up-regulated, whilst miRs −21, −146a and −652 were down-regulated. A combination of 5 miRNA distinguished TB from healthy controls with a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 88%, and an AUC of 0.976. Within one month of treatment, significant changes in miRs −29a, −99b, −26a and 146a levels occurred in successfully treated patients, although not all miRNAs returned to baseline by treatment completion.
Conclusion
A 5-miRNA signature shows potential for development as a novel biomarker for TB disease with potential to predict response to treatment. The failure of all miRNA to return to baseline levels may reflect ongoing remodelling in the lung parenchyma that continues after completion of anti-TB therapy."

Objectives
Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious infectious disease with high mortality for solid-organ transplantation. Preventive therapy of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) has been considered to reduce TB risk and improve outcomes of transplantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs); QuantiFERON®-TB Gold in-Tube (QFT) and T-SPOT®.TB (TSPOT)), for kidney, liver and lung transplant recipients in low TB incidence countries.
Methods
Decision trees and Markov models were developed for four strategies; QFT, TSPOT, the tuberculin skin test (TST) and no screening. Targeted populations were hypothetical cohorts of kidney, liver and lung transplant recipients aged 40 years using a societal perspective on a lifetime horizon. Per-person costs, effectiveness and incremental cost effectiveness ratios were calculated and compared.
Results
QFT was the most cost-effective (Kidney; US$ 5679, 3.026 QALYs, Liver; US$ 5914, 2.365 QALYs, Lung; US$ 6092, 3.761 QALYs). No screening was the least effective. Cost-effectiveness was not sensitive to BCG vaccination rate, and the costs of screening tests and treatment.
Conclusions
TB screening using IGRA with individualized TB risk assessment and follow-up monitoring of drug toxicity during LTBI treatment is recommended for solid organ transplantation, on the basis of the benefits and cost-effectiveness."

Background
Candida periprosthetic joint infection (CPJI) is a rare, difficult-to-treat disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of CPJI treated with various surgical and antifungal strategies.
Methods
We conducted a multicenter retrospective study of all CPJI diagnosed between 2003 and 2015 in 16 Spanish hospitals.
Results
Forty-three patients included: median age, 75 years, and median Charlson Comorbidity Index score, 4. Thirty-four (79.1%) patients had ≥1 risk factor for Candida infection. Most common causative species were C. albicans and C. parapsilosis. Thirty-five patients were evaluable for outcome: overall, treatment succeeded in 17 (48.6%) and failed in 18 (51.4%). Success was 13/20 (67%) in patients with prosthesis removal and 4/15 (27%) with debridement and prosthesis retention (p = 0.041). All 3 patients who received an amphotericin B-impregnated cement spacer cured. In the prosthesis removal group, success was 5/6 (83%) with an antibiofilm regimen and 8/13 (62%) with azoles (p = 0.605). In the debridement and prosthesis retention group, success was 3/10 (30%) with azoles and 1/5 (20%) with antibiofilm agents. Therapeutic failure was due to relapse in 9 patients, need for suppressive treatment in 5, persistent infection in 2, and CPJI-related death in 2; overall attributable mortality was 6%.
Conclusions
CPJI is usually a chronic disease in patients with comorbidities and risk factors for Candida infection. Treatment success is low, and prosthesis removal improves outcome. Although there is insufficient evidence that use of antifungals with antibiofilm activity has additional benefits, our experience indicates it may be recommendable."

Objectives
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute hepatitis worldwide. However, our understanding of the source of contamination is incomplete and the frequency of neurological manifestations in still unknown.
Methods
200 eligible cases reported to the French National Reference Center from January 2015 to December 2015 were prospectively included in this case-control study (1 case: 1 control, matched for sex, age and area of living) to investigate the risk of infection. We documented the factors associated with their HEV infection and clinical manifestations.
Results
The 200 HEV-infected patients included 137 who were immunocompetent and 63 immunocompromised. The factors associated with an HEV infection were contact with farm animals, eating pork liver sausage and eating unpeeled fruit. The 33 patients (16.5%) who reported neurological symptoms included 14 with neuropathic pain suggesting small fiber neuropathy, 9 with painless sensory disorders, 6 with Parsonage–Turner syndrome, one Guillain–Barre syndrome, one meningitis, one encephalitis and one diplopia. Neurological manifestations were more frequent in immunocompetent patients (22.6% vs 3.2%, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
This study highlights the risk of HEV transmission by the environment in industrialized countries. The higher frequency of neurological disorders in immunocompetent patients suggests pathophysiological mechanisms involving the immune system."

We examined VRE colonization, bacteremia (VREB) incidence and outcomes within 100 days of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).
Methods
HCT recipients screened for VRE were assessed, and colonization and VREB incidence compared over time using linear regression. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to assess the relationship between mortality, pre-HCT colonization, and underlying disease.
Results
Of 1492 HCT recipients, 204 (14%) patients were colonized pre-HCT, while 90 (6%) acquired colonization post-HCT. Forty-two patients (2.8%) developed VREB within 100 days post-HCT; the majority, 32 (76%), were previously colonized. The cumulative incidence of VREB was 2.9 per 10,000 patient-days. Over the study period there were no significant changes in incidence of VRE colonization or VREB despite a number of interventions (p > 0.1). Patients with pre-HCT colonization had increased mortality compared to non-colonized patients (HR 2.1; 95% CI: 1.5, 3.3).
Conclusions
We found a low burden of VRE at our center with no significant changes observed over a 10-year study period. VRE, while responsible for substantial resource consumption from routine screening and isolation, was an infrequent cause of bacteremia."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
The Enterobacter cloacae complex (Ecc), routinely referred to as “E. cloacae” in clinical microbiology, encompasses several species with 12 genetic clusters and one sequence crowd that can be identified based on hsp60 sequencing. Little is known about the pathogenicity and distribution of resistance to antibiotics among the Ecc.
Methods and Results
In this prospective multicentre study, a total of 193 Ecc clinical isolates were collected from 10 academic hospitals distributed nationally across France and identified at the genetic cluster level on the basis of hsp60 sequencing. E. hormaechei isolates, which belong to clusters VI-VIII, were the largest group (53%), followed by cluster III that accounted for 28% of clinical isolates. All other Ecc clusters were present except cluster VII (E. hormaechei subsp. hormaechei). Cephalosporinase overproduction and ESBL were significantly more present in E. hormaechei (33% and 20%) than in other clusters (19% and 3%, respectively).
Conclusions
These results suggest that rapid identification of “E. cloacae” at the genetic cluster level could improve adequacy of empirical antibiotic treatment and reduce the unnecessary use of broad spectrum antibiotics."

: To evaluate the effect of the “Clean Hands, Happy Life” intervention on the incidence of hand, food and mouth disease (HFMD) and on school absences due to sickness in kindergarten students.
Methods
: The intervention consisted of four hand hygiene (HH) promotion components and was evaluated in a cluster-randomized controlled trial among 8275 children and 18 kindergartens from May to October, 2015 in Shenzhen, China. We compared two intervention arms – received the intervention in kindergartens only and in both kindergartens and families, respectively – to the control arm in multilevel analyses.
Results
: During the follow-up, the incidence of HFMD in both intervention arms was significantly lower than in the control arm (IRR1: 0.39, 95%CI: 0.26–0.59; IRR2: 0.30, 95%CI: 0.19–0.49); the duration of absence due to sickness (in days) in both intervention arms was significantly shorter than in the control arm (β1 = 0.58, 95%CI: 0.41–0.74; β2 = 0.34, 95%CI: 0.17–0.50), controlling for the area type of kindergarten and grade level of children. Furthermore, during the follow-up we found that there were fewer episodes of absence due to respiratory, skin and eye infections (P < 0.05).

Objectives
Debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR) is the recommended treatment for all acute prosthetic joint infections (PJI), but its efficacy in patients with late acute (LA) PJI is not well described.
Methods
Patients diagnosed with LA PJI between 2005 and 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. LA PJI was defined as the development of acute symptoms (≤ 3 weeks) occurring ≥ 3 months after arthroplasty. Failure was defined as: (i) the need for implant removal, (ii) infection related death, (iii) the need for suppressive antibiotic therapy and/or (iv) relapse or reinfection during follow-up.
Results
340 patients from 27 centers were included. The overall failure rate was 45.0% (153/340). Failure was dominated by Staphylococcus aureus PJI (54.7%, 76/139). Significant independent preoperative risk factors for failure according to the multivariate analysis were: fracture as indication for the prosthesis (odds ratio (OR) 5.4), rheumatoid arthritis (OR 5.1), age above 80 years (OR 2.6), male gender (OR 2.0) and C-reactive protein > 150 mg/L (OR 2.0). Exchanging the mobile components during DAIR was the strongest predictor for treatment success (OR 0.35).

Objectives
To dissect the transcriptional networks underpinning immune cells responses during primary Plasmodium vivax infection of healthy human adults.
Methods
We conducted network co-expression analysis of next-generation RNA sequencing data from whole blood from P. vivax and P. falciparum controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) of healthy naïve and malaria-exposed volunteers. Single cell transcription signatures were used to deconvolute the bulk RNA-Seq data into cell-specific signals.
Results
Initial exposure to P. vivax induced activation of innate immunity, including efficient antigen presentation and complement activation. However, this effect was accompanied by strong immunosuppression mediated by dendritic cells via the induction of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase 1(IDO1) and Lymphocyte Activation Gene 3 (LAG3). Additionally, P. vivax induced depletion of neutrophil populations associated with down regulation of 3G-protein coupled receptors, CRXCR1, CXCR2 and CSF3R. Accordingly, in malaria-exposed volunteers the inflammatory response was attenuated, with a decreased class II antigen presentation in dendritic cells. While the immunosuppressive signalling was maintained between plasmodium species, response to P. falciparum was significantly more immunogenic.
Conclusions
In silico analyses suggest that primary infection with P. vivax induces potent immunosuppression mediated by dendritic cells, conditioning subsequent anti-malarial immune responses. Targeting immune evasion mechanisms could be an effective alternative for improving vaccine efficacy."

This study aimed to examine changes to the microbiota composition and metabolic profiles of seven patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI), following treatment with faecal microbiota transplant (FMT).
Methods
16S rDNA sequencing and 1H NMR were performed on faecal samples from the patients (pre-, post-FMT, and follow-up) and the associated donor samples. Sparse partial-least-square analysis was used to identify correlations between the two datasets.
Results
The patients’ microbiota post-FMT tended to shift towards the donor microbiota, specifically through proportional increases of Bacteroides, Blautia, and Ruminococcus, and proportional decreases of Enterococcus, Escherichia, and Klebsiella. However, although cured of infection, one patient, who suffers from chronic alcohol abuse, retained the compositional characteristics of the pre-FMT microbiota. Following FMT, increased levels of short-chain fatty acids, particularly butyrate and acetate, were observed in all patients. Sparse partial-least-square analysis confirmed a positive correlation between butyrate and Bacteroides, Blautia, and Ruminococcus, with a negative correlation between butyrate and Klebsiella and Enterococcus.
Conclusions
Clear differences were observed in the microbiota composition and metabolic profiles between donors and rCDI patients, which were largely resolved in patients following FMT. Increased levels of butyrate appear to be a factor associated with resolution of rCDI."

We evaluated the diagnostic performance of the novel next-generation Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) in comparison to Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay for the detection of paediatric pulmonary tuberculosis in high burden settings.
Methods
From May 2011 to September 2012, children with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis were enrolled at two Tanzanian sites and sputum samples were examined using sputum smear, Xpert and culture. Xpert Ultra was tested between January and June 2017 using sputum pellets, which had been stored at −80°C. The diagnostic accuracy of Ultra versus Xpert was determined using well-defined case definitions as reference standard.
Results
In total, 215 children were included. The median age was 5.4 years, the HIV prevalence was 52% and 13% had culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. When only the first available sample of each patient was analysed, the sensitivity of Xpert Ultra was 64.3 % (95% CI: 44.1 to 81.4) while that of Xpert was 53.6% (95%CI: 33.9 to 72.5). The specificity of Xpert Ultra based on analysis of all available samples was 98.1% (95%CI: 93.4 to 99.7), that of Xpert was 100%.
Conclusions
Xpert Ultra was found to have a higher sensitivity, but slightly reduced specificity compared to Xpert in detecting pulmonary tuberculosis in children."

Methods
Observational cohort study of adults > 16 years of age with cerebrospinal fluid culture-positive E. coli meningitis in Denmark and the Netherlands. Exclusion criteria were primary brain abscess, previous neurosurgery and nosocomial infections. We analysed baseline characteristics, concomitant infections and neurological complications. Outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale score (GOS) at discharge with GOS 1–4 categorised as unfavourable outcome.
Results
We identified 36 patients with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range 61–83) of whom 15 (42%) were females. Immuno-compromise was present in 11 (31%) patients. Nineteen (53%) patients had concomitant infections consisting of urinary tract infections in 13 (36%), pneumonia in three (9%) and septic arthritis in two (6%). Bacteraemia with E. coli was found in 26 of 34 (76%) patients. Thirteen patients died (36%) and unfavourable outcome at discharge occurred in 23 (64%).

Since SBET is a controversial strategy for malaria self-treatment, this study aims to systematically review primary studies on its use amongst travellers.
Methods
Once studies were independently selected and data extracted, the pooled effect estimates (ES) were calculated through meta-analysis. Number of SBET users, of travellers carrying medications abroad, of subjects experiencing fever, of users complying with correct dosage, of those experiencing adverse effects, of those seeking medical care following SBET use, and those with positive malaria diagnostic test were collected and analysed. Subgroup and sensitive analyses were also performed.
Results
Of 935 titles and abstracts screened, 9 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis and 7 in the meta-analysis for the main outcome, with a pooled ES of the overall use of SBET in the studied population of 2%. There was significant heterogeneity for all studies. The pooled ES of travellers who carried SBET medications abroad and of SBET users seeking medical care after self-administration was 65% and 52%, respectively.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis indicated that the vast majority of travellers prescribed with SBET did not use it and the adherence to pre-travel recommendations on SBET use is suboptimal. Further studies to assess SBET cost-effectiveness and safety are needed."

Objectives
Gastrointestinal (GI) infections are common and most people do not see a physician. There is conflicting evidence of the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on risk of GI infections. We assessed the relationship between SES and GI calls to two National Health Service (NHS) telephone advice services in England.
Methods
Over 24 million calls to NHS Direct (2010–13) and NHS 111 (2013–15) were extracted from Public Health England (PHE) syndromic surveillance systems. The relationship between SES and GI calls was assessed using generalised linear models (GLM).
Results
Adjusting for rurality and age-sex interactions, in NHS Direct, children in disadvantaged areas were at lower risk of GI calls; in NHS 111 there was a higher risk of GI calls in disadvantaged areas for all ages (0–4 years RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.25–1.29; 5–9 years RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.36–1.51; 10–14 years RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.26–1.41; 15–19 years RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.52–1.67; 20–59 years RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.47–1.53, 60 years and over RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.09–1.14).
Conclusions
Disadvantaged areas had higher risk of GI calls in NHS 111. This may relate to differences in exposure or vulnerability to GI infections, or propensity to call about GI infections."

Objectives
Antibacterial chemoprophylaxis with fluoroquinolones (FQPx) has been commonly used in cancer patients with neutropenia, but its efficacy has been challenged by the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance.
Methods
The impact of FQPx on bloodstream infections (BSI) during neutropenia after high-dose chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies was evaluated through a multicenter hospital infection surveillance system for the period 2009–2014.
Results
Among 8755 patients (4223 allogeneic [allo-] HSCT, 3602 autologous [auto-] HSCT, 930 high-dose chemotherapy for acute leukemia [HDC]), 5302 (61%) had received FQPx. Administration of FQPx was associated with fewer Gram-negative BSI in the overall study cohort patients (4.6% vs. 7.7%, adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [aSHR] 0.59, 95%CI 0.50–0.70), in patients with HDC (3.7% vs. 9.2%, adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [aSHR] 0.40, 95%CI 0.22–0.70) and auto-HSCT patients (4% vs. 9%, aSHR 0.43, 95%CI 0.33–0.56). In HDC patients, FQPx was associated with a marked reduction in all-cause mortality during neutropenia (2.3% vs. 7.8%, aSHR 0.30, 95%CI 0.15–0.58). Patients receiving FQPx had significantly more BSIs due to ESBL-positive Enterobacteriacea (0.8 vs. 0.3%, RR 2.2, 95%CI 1.17–4.26). BSIs by MRSA (n = 5) and VRE (n = 11) were rare in our cohort.
Conclusions
As used in the participating centers, FQPx was associated with reduced Gram-negative BSI and improved survival among HDC patients. Among HSCT patients, the benefits were less clear. If adapted to local resistance patterns and patient characteristics, FQPx still may be useful in the management of patients with haematologic malignancies."

Methods
Cases of M. tuberculosis PJI documented in 7 referral French centers were retrospectively reviewed. Data were collected from medical files on a standardized questionnaire. We performed a literature review using the keywords ‘prosthetic joint’, and ‘tuberculosis’.
Results
During years 1997–2016, 13 patients (8 males, 5 females, median age 79 years [range, 60–86]) had documented M. tuberculosis PJI, involving hip (n = 6), knee (n = 6), or shoulder (n = 1). Median time from arthroplasty to diagnosis was 9 years [0.4–20]. The diagnosis was obtained on joint aspirates (n = 9), or synovial tissue (n = 4). PCR was positive in all cases tested (5/5). Median duration of antituberculosis treatment was 14 months [6–32]). Nine patients underwent surgery: debridement (n = 4), resection arthroplasty (n = 3), and revision arthroplasty (1-stage exchange, n = 2). PJI was controlled in 12 patients. Seventeen additional cases of documented M. tuberculosis PJI have been reported, with a favorable outcome in 79% (11/14) of patients with no surgery, 85% (11/13) with debridement, 86% (19/22) with revision arthroplasty, and 81% (17/21) with resection (NS).
Conclusions
M. tuberculosis PJI can be controlled with prolonged antituberculosis treatment in most cases, with or without surgical treatment."

Bloodstream infection results in significant short-term morbidity and mortality. No literature review has studied the long-term outcome following a bloodstream infection. This PROSPERO registered systematic review evaluated studies, which measured the association of a bloodstream infection with long-term morbidity and mortality.
Methods
Databases were systematically searched for studies of adult patients reporting morbidity and/or mortality one year or more following a bloodstream infection in comparison to a matched cohort without a bloodstream infection.
Results
Ten observational studies were included in the final analysis. Five studies assessed only mortality, two assessed morbidity and mortality and three studies assessed morbidity only. The one year mortality ranged from between 8 and 48% for patients with bloodstream infection. The pooled risk ratio of death at one year was significantly higher for patients with bloodstream infection when compared to the matched cohort (RR 4.04 [95% CI 1.84-8.87]).
Conclusions
Bloodstream infection was associated with poor long-term outcome measured at one year when compared to matched controls. More evidence is needed to determine if this association is causative."

Objectives
Hemoglobin E (HbE, β26 Glu-Lys) is the most prevalent hemoglobinopathy in Southeast Asia. This study aimed to determine whether HbE protects against clinical Plasmodium vivax malaria in Southeast Asia.
Methods
In a case-control study performed in villages along the China-Myanmar border, we determined the prevalence of HbE in 257 villagers who had acute P. vivax infections and in 157 control healthy villagers.
Results
HbE in P. vivax patients (17.4%) was significantly less prevalent than in the healthy villager population (36.3%). Moreover, there was a complete lack of HbEE homozygotes in the vivax patients as compared to 9.5% prevalence in the healthy villagers. Using the HbAA group as the reference, both the HbEA heterozygotes and HbEE homozygotes had significantly lower odds of presenting with acute P. vivax infections. Furthermore, HbEA heterozygotes also had significantly lower P. vivax asexual parasite densities. HbEA did not affect the proportion of P. vivax patients with gametocytemia nor the gametocyte densities.
Conclusions
HbE offers significant protection against the occurrence and parasite density of acute P. vivax infections and provides a renewed perspective on P. vivax malaria as a potentially strong driving force behind the high frequencies of HbE in the Kachin population."

Background: Vancomycin is often used as empiric therapy for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but can be associated with clinically important adverse events including renal failure. MRSA colonization swabs are primarily used for infection control; their use as a diagnostic test to inform the decision to add empiric vancomycin therapy has not been well elucidated. Methods: We performed a Medline and Embase systematic review for peer-reviewed studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of using MRSA colonization status to predict MRSA infections. Meta-analysis was performed using Cochrane guidelines. Grey literature was excluded. Findings: 29 studies were included involving 24225 patients. In cases where the pathogen is not known to be S. aureus, specificities were greater than 85% for bacteremia, lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), and all infections pooled together. Sensitivities ranged between 54.0% and 77.5%. In cases where the pathogen is known to be S. aureus, we found studies on bacteremia and SSTI and arrived at pooled estimates of sensitivities ranging between 56.6% and 56.9%, and of specificities greater than 91%. Most importantly, for most infections in settings where the prevalence of MRSA as a causative organism is below 15%, the negative predictive value of a negative MRSA colonization swab exceeds 90%. Interpretations: In settings of low-moderate MRSA prevalence, negative MRSA screening swabs may prevent unnecessary vancomycin use. More research is needed to assess if this strategy can mitigate the cost of screening in areas with a low MRSA colonization rate."

Objectives
The IFN-γ-release assay (IGRA) cannot differentiate active tuberculosis (TB) from latent TB infection (LTBI). We hypothesized that the TNF-α-release assay (TARA) combined with IGRA might discriminate active TB from not active TB without LTBI.
Methods
Adult patients with suspected TB, and with unrelated diseases such as herpes zoster as controls, were enrolled in an intermediate TB-burden country. Patients with confirmed or probable TB were regarded as active TB, and patients with not active TB were further classified as those having not active TB with and without LTBI based on IGRA results. The IGRA and TARA by using ELISPOT assays were performed on peripheral mononuclear cells.
Results
Thirty six patients with active TB and 53 patients including 18 not active TB with LTBI and 35 not active TB without LTBI were finally included. The sensitivity and specificity of the IGRA for those patients found to have active TB were 94% (CI, 80-99) and 66% (CI 52-78), respectively. Combining the IGRA and the TARA substantially increased the specificity for active TB (93%, CI, 82-98; P = 0.001) compared with the IGRA only, without compromising sensitivity (89%, CI, 73-96; P = 0.67).

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Latent infections are well-known for bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and for viruses such as Herpesviridae and parasites like Leishmania spp. or Toxoplasma gondii. However, invasive fungi may also be latent and come to reactivate. The aim of this review is to clarify the reactivation concept in major fungal invasive diseases.
Method
We have searched for PUBMED publications from 1980 to 2017 with the keywords “fungi”, “reactivation”, “latency”, “dormancy”, “granuloma”, “Aspergillus”, “Mucorales”, “Dimorphic fungi”, “Histoplasma”, “Cryptococcus”, “Pneumocystis”, “Yeast”, “Candida” and “Mold”.
Results
After primary infection and immune control of the fungus, reactivation can occur following a period of latency. Two conditions must be present: dormancy/survival of the fungi and immunosuppression of the host. Fungal reactivation is easily demonstrated for dimorphic fungi when patients travelling in endemic areas are no longer exposed to fungi at the time they when develop the disease. For cosmopolitan fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus or some emerging fungi, clinical data and animal models have brought some evidence of reactivation. Survival inside macrophages and granuloma formation appear to be predominant conditions to latency. Although granuloma may act as a reservoir for some fungi like Histoplasma or Cryptococcus, its role in mold reactivation has yet to be fully established.
Conclusions
The risk of fungal reactivation should be taken into account in patient management, especially in cases of solid organ transplantation or long-term immunosuppressive treatment."

The advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has revealed high rates of sustained virological response at 12 weeks (SVR 12) in Hepatitis C (HCV) treatment. Since the introduction of DAAs, in our centre, 42% of patients treated for HCV are HIV co-infected. Our study aimed to identify the SVR 12 rates between this group and HCV mono-infected patients.
Methods
Retrospective data analysis of HCV mono-infection and HIV-HCV co-infection patients between 1st July 2015 and 30th November 2018, who had a SVR at 12 weeks post treatment. Co-infected patients were only referred for HCV treatment if they had well controlled HIV. Patients treated with Pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin were excluded.
Results
During this period, 724 patients were treated for HCV and had data on SVR 12. Of those, 303 (41.8%) were co-infected with HIV. The SVR 12 was achieved in 386 (91.6%) of the HIV negative patients and 288 (95%) of the HIV positive patients (χ²= 3.10 p = 0.078). Cirrhotic patients had poorer SVR 12 in both groups (90% in co-infection and 88.4% in HCV mono-infection).
Conclusions
Our results demonstrate a higher SVR 12 in co-infected patients compared to patients with HCV mono-infection. We hypothesise that adherence to HIV treatment could increase compliance and success of HCV treatment."

Objective
To investigate the clinical manifestations, microbiological data, and outcomes of Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb) infections in patients with cancer.
Methods
Review of electronic medical records of 24 patients with Bb infection, from 2000 to 2013. An infection was considered to be associated with Bb if both clinical manifestations plus microbial growth from infected sites were present.
Results
Ten patients (42%) had a monomicrobial infection, whereas multiple pathogens in addition to Bb were isolated from the rest (14 patients, 58%). The most frequent sites of infection were the respiratory tract (18 patients, 75 %) and bloodstream (17%). The most frequently associated conditions were lymphopenia (71%), tobacco use (42%), and chemotherapeutic or immunosuppressive agents (33% each). Animal exposure was established in four patients. Overall, the response rate to treatment was 100% for monomicrobial and 79% for polymicrobial infections, respectively.
Conclusions
Bb is an uncommon pathogen even in immunosuppressed patients. Predominant sites of infection are the respiratory tract and bloodstream. Bb should be considered pathogenic in immunocompromised hosts, particularly with history of zoonotic exposure, even if accompanied by co-pathogens. Therefore, contact with potential animal sources should be minimized. The infection ranges from mild to severe and has no specific clinical or radiographic manifestations."

Objectives
Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) caused by C. difficile is one of the most common nosocomial infections, however, little is known about infections related to antimicrobial use for pathogens other than C. difficile. We therefore aimed to provide insight into other bacterial causes of AAD, and how infection with these pathogens causes damage in the dysbiotic gut.
Methods
Clinical isolates from C. difficile-negative AAD patients were whole genome sequenced for in silico analysis of potential virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants. A mouse model of infection was developed to assess the capacity of these isolates to cause gastrointestinal damage, which was analysed by studying specific markers in the gastrointestinal mucosa of infected mice.
Results
Several bacterial pathogens were isolated from patients with C. difficile-negative AAD. Each isolate showed the potential for virulence based on encoded virulence factors, as well as most showing antimicrobial resistance in vitro. Isolates of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were tested in the mouse model of infection, inducing damage primarily in the small intestine, affecting adherens junction integrity, cellular polarity, and cellular proliferation.
Conclusions
Several pathogens of clinical importance other than C. difficile are able to cause gastrointestinal infection following antimicrobial-mediated dysbiosis. The virulence potential and multidrug resistance identified in these isolates illuminates the importance of further diagnostic screening in cases of C. difficile-negative AAD."

Objectives
To compare the effectiveness and tolerability of micafungin versus posaconazole during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in acute leukemia (AL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Methods
Patients with AL or MDS undergoing chemotherapy were randomized to open-label micafungin 100 mg intravenously daily or posaconazole suspension 400 mg orally twice daily until neutrophil recovery, up to 28 days. Patients were followed for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was prophylaxis failure (premature discontinuation due to infection, intolerance, adverse event, or death). Time to failure and survival were calculated by Kaplan–Meier analysis.
Results
From March 2011 to May 2016, 113 patients who received at least 2 doses of prophylaxis were analyzed (58 patients randomized to micafungin and 55 to posaconazole). Prophylaxis failure occurred in 34.5% and 52.7% of patients on micafungin and posaconazole, respectively (P = 0.0118). The median number of days on prophylaxis was 16 [interquartile range (IQR) 12–20] for micafungin and 13 [IQR 6–16] for posaconazole (P = 0.01). Micafungin failures were largely due to antifungal treatment; posaconazole failures were mostly due to gastrointestinal intolerance or adverse effects. IFI incidence and survival were similar between study arms.
Conclusions
Our data support micafungin as alternative antifungal prophylaxis in patients with AL and MDS."

Objectives
There is conflicting evidence as to whether Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination offers protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ascertained by a positive tuberculin skin test (TST). We investigated the association between BCG vaccination status and TST results in a set of surveys at increasing TST cut-off values to take cross-reactions to BCG vaccination into account.
Methods
Secondary analysis of data from three consecutive tuberculin surveys done among schoolchildren in Tanzania between 1990 and 2002. BCG vaccination status was ascertained by the presence of a typical scar.
Results
We analyzed data of 277,588 children of whom 77.7% were BCG vaccinated and 8.5% had TST indurations ≥ 15 mm, 5.1% ≥ 17 mm and 2.8% ≥ 19 mm. In the combined analysis, odds ratios for a positive TST were > 1 for children with BCG up to TST cut-off values of 16 mm. For cut-off values > 17 mm crude and adjusted odds ratios were significantly < 1, and decreased with further increasing cut-off values.
Conclusions
Using a methodology that makes use of the differences in TST reaction sizes between specific and non-specific responses, we showed that BCG vaccination was associated with reduced prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection as measured by the tuberculin skin test, suggesting a protective effect."

Objectives
Burden of pneumococcal disease depends on the prevalence and invasive disease potential of serotypes. We aimed to estimate the invasive disease potential of serotypes in children under 5 years of age by combining data from different settings with routine immunisation with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV).
Methods
We conducted a systematic review, supplemented by unpublished data, to identify data on the frequency of pneumococcal serotypes in carriage and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). We estimated the invasive disease potential of serotypes as the ratio of IPD in relation to carriage (odds ratio and 95%CI) compared with 19A (reference serotype) by meta-analysis. We report results based on a random effects model for children aged 0–23, 24–29, and 0–59 months and by invasive clinical syndromes.
Results
In comparison with 19A, serotypes 1, 7F, and 12F had a significantly higher invasive disease potential in children aged 0–23 and 0–59 months for all IPD and clinical syndromes (OR > 5). Several non-vaccine types (NVTs) (6C, 15A, 15BC, 16F, 23B, in these two age groups) had a lower invasive disease potential than 19A (OR 0.1–0.3). NVTs 8, 12F, 24F, and 33F were at the upper end of the invasiveness spectrum.
Conclusions
There is substantial variation among pneumococcal serotypes in their potential to cause IPD and disease presentation, which is influenced by age and time after PCV introduction. Surveillance of IPD and carriage is critical to understand the expected effectiveness of current PCVs (in the longer term) and guide the development of future vaccines."

Objectives
The risk of developing active TB is greater in those receiving haemodialysis. This study aimed to describe the incidence of active tuberculosis among patients referred for management of kidney disease and dialysis in a high incidence UK city, with the purpose of informing latent TB testing and treatment practice.
Methods
Information from the tuberculosis register was cross-referenced with the Department of Renal Medicine patient information system. All patients seen between 1st January 2005 and 1st October 2016 were included in the analyses with the exception of those with prior TB.
Results
68 cases of active TB were identified, an incidence of 126/100,000 patient-years (95% CI 97-169). Incidence was lowest in those with CKD 1 or 2 and rose as high as 256/100,000 patient-years (95% CI 183-374) in those receiving renal replacement therapy. 48% of cases were pulmonary and 87% of TB patients gave their ethnicity as either black/black British or Asian/Asian British, significantly more than in the non-TB renal group. Cases occurred steadily over the time period in which patients were in the cohort.
Conclusion
TB incidence was very high among those receiving renal replacement therapy or CKD 4 or 5. Most cases occurred in those of an Asian/Asian British or black/black British background. Testing and treating such patients for latent TB is justified and should include those who have been receiving renal replacement therapy for some years."

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the severest form of tuberculosis, but current diagnostic tests are insensitive. Recent reports suggest simple modifications to conventional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) staining may greatly improve sensitivity. We sought to define the performance of modified and conventional ZN stain for TBM diagnosis.
Methods
In hospitals in Vietnam, South Africa and Indonesia we conducted a prospective study of modified ZN with or without cytospin, conventional ZN smear, GeneXpert, and culture on CSF in adults with suspected TBM.
Results
A total of 618 individuals were enrolled across 3 sites. Compared with the TBM clinical diagnostic gold standard for research (definite probable or possible TBM), sensitivity of conventional ZN and modified ZN with cytospin were 33.9% and 34.5% respectively (p = 1.0 for the difference between tests), compared with culture 31.8% and Xpert 25.1%. Using culture as a reference, sensitivities of conventional ZN, modified ZN with cytospin, and Xpert were 66.4%, 67.5%, and 72.3%, respectively. Higher CSF volume and lactate, and lower CSF:blood glucose ratio were independently associated with microbiologically confirmed TBM.
Conclusions
Modified ZN stain does not improve diagnosis of TBM. Currently available tests are insensitive, but testing large CSF volumes improves performance. New diagnostic tests for TBM are urgently required."

Objectives
Previous studies have demonstrated a diminution in the baseline and mycobacterial antigen – specific cytokines in low body mass index (LBMI) individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). We hypothesized that LBMI might be also associated with alteration in the baseline and antigen – stimulated levels of chemokines in LTBI.
Methods
To test this hypothesis, we examined baseline, TB-antigen and mitogen stimulated levels of chemokines in these individuals and compared them with those with LTBI and normal BMI (NBMI).
Results
LBMI with LTBI is characterized by diminished baseline levels of CCL1, CCL4, CCL11, CXCL1, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 in comparison to NBMI with LTBI. Similarly, LTBI with LBMI is also characterized by diminished TB-antigen stimulated levels of CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL11, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11. In contrast, there were no significant differences in the mitogen stimulated chemokine levels between the groups. Finally, there was a significant positive correlation between BMI and CCL1, CCL4, CCL11, CXCL11, CXCL2, CXCL9 and CXCL11 levels in LTBI individuals.
Conclusions
Therefore, our data reveal that LTBI subjects with low BMI are characterized by diminished levels of a variety of important chemokines, providing a novel biological mechanism for the increased risk of developing active TB."

Objectives
To investigate the involvement of NLRP3 in the effector functions of human dendritic cells (DCs) in response to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis yeast cells (Pb) and to evaluate its role in the modulation of the adaptive immune response.
Methods
DCs were differentiated from purified peripheral blood monocytes and analyzed in relation to the participation of TLR-2, dectin-1, and Syk in Pb recognition, as well as, the indirect mechanisms (Reactive Oxygen Species production, endosome acidification, or K+ efflux) involved in NLRP3 inflammasome activation after the stimulus with Pb. Additionally, we analyzed the role of NLRP3 in the activation of T cells.
Results
Our results demonstrated that the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cytokines production by DCs are dependent on ROS generation, endosome acidification, and K+ efflux and involve the Pb recognition by dectin-1 and Syk phosphorylation. Our data also demonstrate that the NLRP3 inflammasome is essential for the activation/expansion of Th1/Th17 cells and its inhibition leads to an increased frequency of Th2 and Treg cells.
Conclusion
Altogether our data indicated that activation of NLRP3 presents an important role in both the induction of the initial inflammatory response and in the development of the acquired immune response associated with resistance to infection."

Objective
To estimate the proportion of over-the-counter antibiotic requests or consultations that resulted in non-prescription supply of antibiotics in community pharmacies globally.
Methods
We systematically searched EMBASE, Medline and CINAHL databases for studies published from January 2000 to September 2017 reporting the frequency of non-prescription sale and supply of antibiotics in community pharmacies across the world. Additional articles were identified by checking reference lists and a Google Scholar search. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted to calculate pooled estimates of non-prescription supply of antibiotics.
Results
Of the 3302 articles identified, 38 studies from 24 countries met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. All the included countries with the exception of one, classified antibiotics as prescription-only medicines. The overall pooled proportion of non-prescription supply of antibiotics was 62% (95% CI 53–72). The pooled proportion of non-prescription supply of antibiotics following a patient request was 78% (95% CI 59–97) and based on community pharmacy staff recommendation was 58% (95% CI 48–68). The regional supply of non-prescription antibiotics was highest in South America, 78% (95% CI 72–84). Antibiotics were commonly supplied without a prescription to patients with symptoms of urinary tract infections (68%, 95% CI 42–93) and upper respiratory tract infections (67%, 95% CI 55–79). Fluoroquinolones and Penicillins respectively were the most commonly supplied antibiotic classes for these indications.
Conclusion
Antibiotics are frequently supplied without prescription in many countries. This overuse of antibiotics could facilitate the development and spread of antibiotic resistance."

Objectives
Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) is an important cause of healthcare-associated infections. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) provides a highly discriminative typing method. We aimed to determine the clinical impact of Ab sequence types (ST) in patients with bloodstream infection (BSI).
Methods
Patients with Ab-BSI were followed prospectively from 2009 to 2014. We randomly selected one-third of non-duplicate bacteremic isolates for MLST and correlated the Ab ST with the clinical course. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality.
Results
We enrolled 148 patients. Seventy-seven (52.0%) of the isolates were ST2. Patients with ST2-BSI were less likely to be treated with appropriate empirical antimicrobial agents (31.1% vs. 60.6%; P < 0.001). They had greater mortality (66.2% vs. 40.8%; P = 0.003) than patients with non-ST2-BSI. In the multivariable analysis, ST2 independently predicted greater severity of infection (Pitt bacteremia score) (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 3.38; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.75–6.54; P < 0.001). Mediated by a higher Pitt bacteremia score (Sobel test P < 0.001), ST2 is an independent prognostic factor that predict mortality (aOR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.07–5.11; P = 0.03).
Conclusions
ST2 was associated with high rates of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, severe infection and mortality. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and explore the potential of role of the virulence."

Objective
To investigate the risk of autoimmune diseases in dengue patients.
Methods
We conducted a population-based cohort study by the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, including a total of 12,506 newly diagnosed dengue patients and 112,554 control subjects between 2000 and 2010, matched by gender, age, income, urbanization, and comorbidities. Both cohorts were followed for a 3-year period to examine the incidence of autoimmune diseases.

Results
The dengue group showed an overall increased risk for 21 autoimmune diseases, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49–2.37, p < 0.001). Compared with the control group, the dengue group had higher risks of Reiter's syndrome (aHR 14.03, 95 % CI 1.63–120.58), multiple sclerosis (aHR 11.57, 95 % CI 1.8–74.4), myasthenia gravis (aHR 5.35, 95 % CI 1.43–20.02), autoimmune encephalomyelitis (aHR 3.8, 95% CI 1.85–7.8), systemic vasculitis (aHR 3.7, 95 % CI 1.11–12.28), systemic lupus erythematosus (aHR 3.5, 95% CI 1.85–6.63), and primary adrenocortical insufficiency (aHR 2.05, 95% CI 1.25–3.35).
Conclusion
Dengue patients were associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases."

Objectives
Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus, GBS) is an uncommon cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. We describe clinical characteristics, serotype distribution and outcome of adult GBS meningitis.
Patients and methods
Patients aged 16 years or older with GBS cultured in cerebrospinal fluid included in two prospective nationwide cohort studies performed in the Netherlands between 1998–2002 and 2006–2017 were evaluated.
Results
We identified 33 patients with GBS meningitis with a median age of 58 years of whom 22 were male (67%). The mean annual incidence was .16 per 1.000.000 adults. Ten patients (30%) had an immunocompromised state, which was due to alcoholism in 6 (18%) and diabetes mellitus in 4 (12%). Eleven patients (33%) had a distant focus of infection of whom 4 had endocarditis (13%). Seven patients (21%) died and 6 (18%) survivors had sequelae causing disability, including reduced vision and blindness due to endophthalmitis (n = 2). Twenty patients (61%) made a full recovery. Most common bacterial serotypes were serotype III (41%) and Ia (25%). Serotype V was associated with increased mortality (3 of 4 [75%] serotype V died vs. 4 of 28 [14%] other serotypes, P = .025).
Conclusion
GBS is a rare cause of meningitis in adults that more frequently occurs in patients with underlying comorbidities. Patients should be carefully evaluated for distant foci of infection. GBS serotype V is associated with poor outcome."

Objectives
Ventricular assist devices (VAD) are increasingly implanted in patients with terminal heart failure. Here we describe the clinical course, management and outcome of VAD patients with S. aureus bloodstream infection (SAB).
Methods
We conducted a post hoc analysis of data from 1073 patients who had been prospectively enrolled in two consecutive SAB bicenter cohort studies. Patients with VAD in situ at the onset of SAB were identified. Follow-up of patients was at least 90 days.
Results
Twelve VAD patients with SAB were identified. Compared to the overall cohort, patients with VAD presented more often with fever (92% vs. 65%) and septic shock (33% vs. 23%) and showed higher C-reactive protein levels (mean 244 vs. 132 g/ml). The median time to onset of SAB after device implantation was 161 days (range 24–790 days). 30-day mortality was comparable to the whole cohort (17% vs. 19%). Infection-related surgical interventions were performed in six patients. Hematogenous dissemination to distant foci was not found in any patient. One out of nine surviving patients required continuous suppressive antibiotic therapy.
Conclusions
Mortality rates for VAD patients with SAB were comparable to SAB without VAD. No hematogenous disssemination or persistent infections were recorded, which might be associated with the prompt and aggressive antibiotic and surgical management in VAD patients. SAB per se does not preclude successful transplantation."

Objective
To estimate outpatient visits and hospitalization rates due to cardiopulmonary illness attributable to influenza from 2008-09 to 2012-13 in a large cohort of pregnant women from Catalonia, Spain.
Methods
We estimated the event rates occurring during influenza epidemic, influenza non-epidemic and non-influenza seasons, and by pregnancy status (one year before pregnancy, first, second and third trimester). We fitted quasi-Poisson models in order to identify the variables associated to higher event rates.
Results
During influenza epidemic seasons, pregnant women in their second trimester had the highest rates of outpatient visits (153 per 10,000 women-months). An increased risk of outpatient visits was associated to first or second trimester (adjusted rate ratio (aRR) = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.10–1.23 and aRR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.28–1.43, respectively) and having any comorbidity (aRR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.21–1.36). Women during third trimester had the highest rates of hospitalizations (1.60 per 10,000 women-months), and an increased risk of hospitalization was significantly associated to third trimester (aRR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.01–3.39), having any comorbidity (aRR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.10–3.41) and the pandemic influenza season (aRR, 2.90 (1.81; 95% CI, 1.81–4.64).

Objectives
To determine whether missing the HepB birth dose vaccine is a risk factor for incomplete vaccination later in childhood.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study of infants born over one year at an academic medical center. The “not vaccinated at birth” group consisted of all infants who did not receive the HepB birth dose vaccine by seven days of life, while the “vaccinated at birth” group included infants who did receive the birth dose. The primary outcome was vaccination status at 18 months of age, determined from the state vaccination registry.
Results
Infants “not vaccinated at birth” had lower vaccination rates. At 18 months, 44% of the “vaccinated at birth” group received all recommended vaccines, compared with 23% of the “not vaccinated at birth” group (p < 0.001); at 24 months, rates were 65% and 45%, respectively (p < 0.001). Over 80% of the variability in vaccination completions were related to a single latent variable, which is most likely vaccine hesitancy/refusal.
Conclusions
Infants who miss the HepB birth dose vaccine are at risk for under-immunization by 18 and 24 months of age. This suggests that parents likely form opinions about vaccines long before the birth of their child; therefore, efforts to influence attitudes must begin earlier."

Introduction
The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of an intervention based on unsolicited consultations by an infectious diseases specialist (IDS) on the adequacy of antimicrobial treatment and mortality in patients with BSI.
Methods
A prospective cohort study was performed in a 410-bed hospital. An intervention based on unsolicited consultation by an IDS for patients with BSI was performed only on days when an IDS was available. Outcomes were the percentage of days on optimal antimicrobial treatment (PDOAT) and mortality. Analyses were performed by linear regression and multivariate logistic regression.
Results
Of 400 episodes of BSI included, 292 received the intervention. The median (interquartile range) PDOAT among those with and without the intervention was 93 (6–100) and 0 (0–53), respectively. The intervention was independently associated with a higher PDOAT (r = 0.5; p < 0.001) but not with mortality. The IDS recommendations were followed in full in 183 episodes, and not in 109. Mortality was 10.4% and 27.6%, respectively. Adherence to recommendations was associated with lower mortality (adjusted OR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1–0.5).
Conclusions
An intervention based on unsolicited IDS consultation for BSI episodes was associated with improved use of antibiotics and, when the recommendations were fully followed, with lower mortality."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis is progressively involved in device-related infections. Since these infections involve biofilm formation, antibiotics are not effective. Conversely, a vaccine can be advantageous to prevent these infections. In view of vaccine development, predicted surface proteins were evaluated on their potential as a vaccine target.
Methods
Immunoglobulins directed against S. epidermidis surface proteins SesB, M, O, Q and R were used to firstly affirm their surface location. Further, inhibitory effects of these IgGs on biofilm formation were determined in vitro on polystyrene and polyurethane surfaces and in vivo using a subcutaneous catheter mouse model. We also examined the opsonophagocytotic capacity of these IgGs.
Results
Surface localization of the five Ses proteins was demonstrated both for planktonic and sessile cells, though to a variable extent. Ses-specific IgGs added to planktonic cells had a variable inhibitory effect on cell adhesion to polystyrene, while only anti-SesO IgGs decreased cell attachment to polyurethane catheters. Although phagocytic killing was only obtained after opsonization with SesB-specific IgGs, a significant reduction of in vivo formed biofilms was observed after administration of SesB-, SesM- and SesO-specific IgGs.
Conclusions
Regardless of their characterization or function, S. epidermidis surface proteins can be adequate targets for vaccine development aiming the prevention of device-related infections caused by invasive S. epidermidis strains."

Background: An improved understanding of the gut microbiota could lead to better strategies for the diagnosis, therapy and prophylaxis of tuberculosis (TB). The impact of both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and anti-TB treatment on the gut microbiota has rarely been studied. Methods: We characterized the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota in pulmonary TB patients as well as the effects of anti-TB drugs on the gut microbiota. Results: Pulmonary Mtb infection led to a minor decrease in the α diversity of the gut microbiota when compared to healthy controls, which mainly resulted from changes in the relative abundance of the members of genus Bacteroides. Anti-TB therapy caused a rapid, significant alteration in the community structure. The relative abundance of members of genus Clostridiales of the phylum Firmicutes significantly decreased during anti-TB treatment, while many members of genus Bacteroides, including Bacteroides OTU230 and Bacteroides fragilis, were among the taxa that increased. OTU8 and OTU2972 assigned to family Erysipelotrichaceae of the phylum Firmicutes showed a dramatic increase 1 week after the start of therapy, while the other members of this family decreased. Conclusions: Pulmonary TB and anti-TB treatment caused a distinct dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Our study contributes valuable information implying potential links between the gut microbiota and TB."

Objectives
Echinocandins are fungicidal and more active than fluconazole against Candida biofilms. This is known to be an important mechanism for Candida persistence. However, there is limited evidence of effectiveness of echinocandins for treating persistent candidemia.
Methods
We prospectively observed adult patients with persistent candidemia from March 2011 to February 2016. This was defined as the isolation of the same Candida species for ≥ 5 days from blood cultures. We used a time-dependent analysis to evaluate the impact of definitive therapy on mycological eradication and overall survival at 30 days from the index date (the date of collecting the second positive blood culture).
Results
We screened 1162 episodes of candidemia. Of 196 non-duplicate patients enrolled, 64 received echinocandins and 132 received fluconazole as their first definitive therapy after the index date. The rates of mycological eradication and overall survival were 67.3% and 55.6%, respectively. The factors associated with mycological eradication included receipt of an echinocandin as the definitive therapy, adequate source control, and not receiving parenteral hyperalimentation. The factors related to overall survival were APACHE II, not receiving corticosteroids, and receiving cardiovascular or abdominal surgery.
Conclusions
Echinocandins were more effective than fluconazole in achieving mycological eradication in patients with persistent candidemia."

Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is an emerging pathogen causes life-threatening infections in cystic fibrosis patients. This narrative review aims to highlight an update on the epidemiology, the microbiological diagnostic methods, the antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, and the most current as well the promising therapeutic options for Bcc. Although Bcc plays a role in crop growth due to its fungicidal activity and pesticide metabolizer, it has been frequently implicated in outbreaks in the United States and Worldwide due to contaminated medicines or medical devices. Phenotypic methods of microbial identification often lack sensitivity. Consequently, the diagnosis is mainly based on molecular testing which is critical for species identification. Disc diffusion is a poorly reproducible method for antibiotic susceptibility testing of Bcc when compared to broth microdilution, agar dilution or Etest. Bcc is naturally resistant to many antimicrobialagents including carboxypenicillins, polymyxin, and often, aminoglycosides due to the efflux pump activity. Treatment is often based on antimicrobial susceptibility data. However, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, meropenem, doripenem, doxycycline, minocycline, and ceftazidime have been shown to be among the most active antimicrobial agents to date. Further studies are needed to compare the current antimicrobial agents and to study new inhibitors of the different efflux pumps implicated in the resistance of Bcc to antibiotics. Furthermore, harmonization of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines is highly important to fight against the rapidly emerging resistant bacteria e.g. Bcc."

Objectives
No study evaluated the contribution of adjunctive surgery in bedaquiline-treated patients. This study describes treatment outcomes and complications in a cohort of drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) cases treated with bedaquiline-containing regimens undergoing surgery.
Methods
This retrospective observational study recruited patients treated for TB in 12 centres in 9 countries between January 2007 and March 2015. Patients who had surgical indications in a bedaquiline-treated programme-based cohort were selected and surgery-related information was collected. Patient characteristics and surgical indications were described together with type of operation, surgical complications, bacteriological conversion rates, and treatment outcomes. Treatment outcomes were evaluated according to the time of surgery.
Results
57 bedaquiline-exposed cases resistant to a median of 7 drugs had indication for surgery (52 retreatments; 50 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) or pre XDR-TB). Sixty percent of cases initiated bedaquiline treatment following surgery, while 36.4% underwent the bedaquiline regimen before surgery and completed it after the operation. At treatment completion 90% culture-converted with 69.1% achieving treatment success; 21.8% had unfavourable outcomes (20.0% treatment failure, 1.8% lost to follow-up), and 9.1% were still undergoing treatment.
Conclusions
The study results suggest that bedaquiline and surgery can be safely and effectively combined in selected cases with a specific indication."

Objectives
To explore the clinical role of GeneXpert in managing pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in an intermediate burden city.
Methods
Sputum acid-fast-bacilli (AFB) smear negative patients underwent bronchoscopy for bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL). Fluids collected were examined for AFB smear, TB culture, TB polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Cobas Taqman) and for GeneXpert.
Results
From October 2015 to February 2017, 227 BAL samples were collected. Cough and haemoptysis were the presenting symptoms in 70.0% and 37.4%, respectively. Apical shadows on chest X-rays (CXR) and apical cavitations on computed tomography (CT) were commoner in GeneXpert positive cases (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). Sensitivity and specificity of GeneXpert for TB diagnosis was 80% and 98% respectively. Positive and negative predictive value of the test was 92.3 and 95.1%, respectively. There were 9 false negative GeneXpert samples (8 were Cobas Taqman TB PCR negative): 6 were diagnosed by BAL culture, 2 by biopsy and one by Cobas Taqman TB PCR. There were 3 false positive cases with negative culture; 2 were put on empirical treatment with favourable clinical responses, while one defaulted follow-p.
Conclusion
GeneXpert in BAL samples has high sensitivity and specificity. It enabled timely initiation of anti-TB treatment in clinical suspicious cases."

Objectives
Despite the clinical relevance of exacerbations in bronchiectasis (BE), little is known about the microbiology and outcomes of pneumonic (CAP) vs. non-pneumonic (NOCAP) exacerbations.
Methods
This study compares clinical and microbiological characteristics of CAP vs. NOCAP in adults with BE. We performed a multicenter prospective observational study of consecutive cases of NOCAP and CAP from four Spanish hospitals (2011-2015).
Results
We recruited 144 patients, 47 of them CAP (33%) cases. CAP patients were older, with a larger representation of males, more comorbidities, higher arterial hypertension and COPD but less chronic bronchial infection and previous history of exacerbations. Clinical presentation was similar, excepting creatinine, C-reactive protein (C-RP), glucose and leukocytes which were higher in CAP. C-RP of 8.38 mg/dL showed a significant predictive discrimination for CAP. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the first causes of CAP and NOCAP, respectively. The rate of microbiological concordance with previous chronic bronchial infection was variable. Main clinical outcomes (mortality, length of stay, etc.) were similar in the two groups. Chronic bronchial infection and history of frequent exacerbations (≥ 2/year) were associated with a reduced risk of CAP.
Conclusions
CAP and NOCAP in BE had similar clinical presentation with the exception of fever, leukocytosis, and C-RP. Microbiology also differed. A cut-off value of C-RP ≥ 8.38 mg/dL can predict CAP in bronchiectasis."

Objectives
We aimed to assess infection control rates after DAIR in patients with periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) following joint arthroplasty and evaluate factors associated with infection control using a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane databases and reference lists of relevant studies up to May 2017. Longitudinal studies conducted in patients with PJI treated exclusively by DAIR were eligible. Infection control rates were meta-analysed using random-effect models after arcsine transformation.
Results
We included 93 articles based on 99 unique observational studies with data on 4897 PJIs treated by DAIR. The infection control rate for DAIR ranged from 11.1% to 100% with an overall pooled estimate of 61.4% (95% CI, 57.3–65.4) and a 95% prediction interval of 25.5% to 91.8%. Infection control rates remained generally similar for several relevant characteristics, except for evidence of variation by age, geographical location, type of infection and joint affected, duration of parenteral antibiotic therapy after the DAIR procedure, and period (year) of DAIR procedure.
Conclusions
The DAIR approach remains an option for the treatment of PJI as it is associated with acceptable infection control rates, particularly in acute postoperative infections and infections of the hip and shoulder joints."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Dual β-lactam therapy and a penicillin-aminoglycoside combination are first line regimens in the treatment of penicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis (EFIE). Our aim was to compare ampicillin plus ceftriaxone (A+C) to ampicillin plus gentamicin (A+G) in the treatment of EFIE.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study of adults (≥18 years) patients diagnosed with EFIE at Mayo Clinic campuses in Rochester, Minnesota, and Phoenix, Arizona and treated with either A+C or A+G. Main outcome measurements were 1 year mortality, nephrotoxicity, and EFIE relapse rates.
Results
Eighty-five cases of EFIE were included in this investigation. The majority (n=67, 79%) of patients received A+G while 18 (21%) patients received A+C as initial treatment. On admission, patients who received A+C had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (median [IQR], 4 [3, 4 vs. 2 [1, 4]; P=.008) and a higher baseline serum creatinine (median [IQR], 1.2 [0.9, 1.6] vs. 0.9 [0.8, 1.2] mg/dL, P=.020). The 1 year mortality rates were similar for both treatment groups, 17% vs. 17%, P=.982. Each group had 1 case of relapsing EFIE. Patients who received A+G had worse kidney function outcome demonstrated by a greater increase in serum creatinine at end of therapy (median [IQR] difference, +0.4 [0.2, 0.8] vs. -0.2 [−0.3, 0.1] mg/dL, P≤.001).
Conclusion
A+C appears to be a safe and efficacious regimen in the treatment of EFIE. Patients treated with A+C had lower rates of nephrotoxicity and no differences in relapse rate and 1-year mortality as compared to that of the A+G group."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Numerous in-house and commercial nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) have been evaluated using variable reference standards for diagnosis of TBM but their diagnostic potential is still not very clear.
Methods
We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of different NAAT based assays for diagnosing TBM against 43 data sets of confirmed TBM (n = 1066) and 61 data sets of suspected TBM (n = 3721) as two reference standards. The summary estimate of the sensitivity and the specificity were obtained using the bivariate model. QUADAS-2 tool was used to perform the Quality assessment for bias and applicability. Publication bias was assessed with Deeks' funnel plot.
Results
Studies with confirmed TBM had better summary estimates as compared to studies with clinically suspected TBM irrespective of NAAT and index tests used. Among in-house assays, MPB as the gene target had best summary estimates in both confirmed [sensitivity:90%(83–95), specificity:97-%(87–99), DOR:247 (50–1221), AUC:99%(97–100), PLR:38.8-(6.6–133), NLR:0.11(0.05–0.18), I2 = 15%] and clinically suspected [sensitivity:69%(47–85), specificity:96%(90–98), DOR:62(16.8–232), AUC:94%(92–97), PLR:16.9(6.5–36.8), NLR:0.33(0.16–0.56), I2:15.3%] groups.

The implementation of rapid and reliable drug susceptibilities diagnosis is fundamental for effective treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis(MDR-TB). The present study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of the 2nd-version GenoType MTBDRsl kit as well as the impact of its implementation on the turnaround time in a multi-center Chinese study.
Methods
Totally 353 MDR-TB patient specimens were consecutively tested. The 2nd-version GenoType MTBDRsl assay, drug susceptibility testing with the MGIT 960 system, and sequencing were performed and compared.
Results
MTBDRsl testing identified the major genotypes associated with fluoroquinolones resistance, predominated by gyrA MUT3B (Asp94Asn and Asp94Tyr, 26.5%) and MUT3C (Asp94Gly, 19.5%). The genotypes associated with resistance to 2nd-line injectable drugs(SLIDs) were rrsMUT1(A1401G, 64.9%) and absence of WT1(C1402T, 10.5%). The sensitivities for detection of resistance to fluoroquinolones, SLIDs, and their combination (extensively drug resistance, XDR) were 80.5%, 80.7% and 73.5% and specificities were 100.0%, 99.3% and 99.1%, respectively. Implementation of this test significantly reduced the turnaround time between sample collection and result reporting from 45 to 3 days, a reduction by 93.3% (p, 0.001).
Conclusion
With a favorable diagnostic performance and short turnaround time, the 2nd-version GenoType MTBDRsl assay proves its value for early diagnosis of resistance to 2nd-line drugs as well as of XDR-TB in China."

abstract = "Summary
The importance of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) as a component of healthcare worker (HCW) protection was highlighted during the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa. The large number of HCW deaths in Africa was in part due to lack of resources or prior training in PPE usage. As part of the Ebola legacy, the High Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID) programme was initiated by NHS England and Public Health England (PHE) to improve preparedness for Ebola and other infections that not only endanger the life of the patient, but also pose particular dangers to HCWs. A systematic review identified national standardisation of PPE protocols as a priority, but recognised that a lack of safety data limited the ability to mandate any one protocol. A simulation-based exercise was developed to assess the safety of PPE ensembles in use in the UK during first assessment of a patient with a possible HCID. A mannequin was adapted to expose volunteer HCWs to synthetic bodily fluids (vomit, sweat, diarrhoea and cough), each with a different coloured fluorescent tracer, invisible other than under ultraviolet (UV) light. After exposure, HCWs were examined under UV lights to locate fluorescent contamination, and were screened again after removing PPE (doffing) to detect any personal contamination. The exercise was videoed, allowing retrospective analysis of contamination events and user errors. The simulation testing identified significant HCW contamination events after doffing, related to protocol failure or complications in PPE doffing, providing conclusive evidence that improvements could be made. At a workshop with an expert stakeholder group, the data were examined and a unified PPE ensemble agreed. This ensemble was then tested in the same simulation exercise and no evidence of any HCW contamination was seen after doffing. Following further review by the working group, a consensus agreement has been reached and a unified ‘HCID assessment PPE’ ensemble, with accompanying donning and doffing protocols, is presented here."

A growing body of evidence indicates that impaired neutrophil migration to the site of infection is associated with poor outcome in sepsis. Here we show that galectin-3 (Gal-3), an endogenous glycan-binding protein, plays a critical role in sepsis outcome. We found that serum Gal-3 concentration increased in patients with septic shock and mice undergoing sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Mice deficient in Gal-3 (Gal-3 KO) are more resistant to sepsis induced by CLP, showing lower levels of biochemical markers and neutrophil infiltration for organ injury/dysfunction than those observed in wild-type mice (WT). Furthermore, Gal-3 KO mice show an increased number of neutrophils in the primary focus of infection and reduced bacterial loads in the peritoneal cavity, blood, and lungs. Mechanistically, blood neutrophils from septic mice show higher levels of surface-bound Gal-3 than neutrophils from naive mice. The deficiency of Gal-3 was associated with increased rolling and adhesion of these cells in mesenteric venules. Our results indicate that Gal-3, secreted during sepsis, inhibits neutrophil migration into the infectious focus, which promotes the bacterial spread and worsens the outcome of sepsis."

Objectives
Reliable epidemiologic estimates of Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) infection and evidence on factors determining country-differences are sparse. We systematically assessed and extracted research data on three HEV infection markers and identified factors influencing HEV-positivity to generated adjusted EU/EEA country-specific estimates by a meta-analysis.
Methods
Reports on HEV published 2005–2015 for EU/EEA countries were obtained from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. Utilizing data on anti-HEV IgG, IgM and HEV-RNA we estimated HEV sero-prevalence, recent and acute HEV infections. Respective magnitude of factors influencing HEV-positivity was characterized using deviance. Country-specific estimates were generated by multivariable logistic regression.
Results
Of 4980 records, 165 covering 18 EU/EEA countries met inclusion criteria. The majority of collected data were published for Germany, France, United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Spain. Most influential factor for anti-HEV IgG was the assay used (42% of total deviance); IgM and HEV-RNA were predominately determined by studied population (34%, 74%). Adjusted country-specific estimates for anti-HEV IgG ranged from 1.82%–17.06%, IgM 0.14%–6.54%, and HEV-RNA 0.00%–0.10%. No general geographical pattern of HEV-positivity was visible.
Conclusions
Our analysis revealed a high heterogeneity regarding data availability and HEV-seropositivity across EU/EEA countries. Determinants of HEV-estimates including assay are to be considered when interpreting HEV-epidemiology and its burden."

abstract = "Summary
Aims
Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a catastrophic and potentially life threatening complication following arthroplasty. In addition to the resulting impact on patient morbidity and mortality, PJI is associated with significant financial cost, which is estimated at £21,937 per case. Methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) is a common isolate in PJI and colonisation is a proven risk factor for subsequent infection. The aims of this study were: (1) to determine if MSSA screening and decolonisation reduced MSSA PJI rate in primary joint replacement and (2) to determine cost effectiveness of such a screening program.
Methods
Pre-operative screening for MSSA was introduced in our institution in 2010. All MSSA positive patients attending for elective arthroplasty were prescribed Octenisan body wash and nasal Bactroban for use 5 days prior to procedure, and five days after. Infection data was collected prospectively and compared with a control group from before.
Results
Between 2007 and 2014, 12,910 primary arthroplasties (5917 hip, 6993 knee) were performed. There were 3593 in the pre-screening group and 9318 in the post-screening group. Pre-screening PJI MSSA rate was 0.75% which reduced to 0.25% post screening introduction (p < 0.0001). Overall PJI rate fell from 1.92% to 1.41% (p = 0.03). The screening program was most effective in MSSA prevention in total hip arthroplasty (3% to 1.5%, p = 0.002) and significant in the multivariate analysis. Following the introduction of the screening programme 47 PJIs were avoided, with a cost per infection prevented of £1893.
Conclusion
The MSSA screening and eradication protocol used in our institution was effective at reducing rates of MSSA PJI. Furthermore, it resulted in significant savings when compared to the cost of prevented infections."

This cohort study included 106 prospectively enrolled (2014–2017) adult cases with underlying hematological malignancies and suspected pulmonary infection undergoing bronchoscopy. Serum samples were collected within 24 hours of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) sampling. Both, serum and BALF samples were used to evaluate diagnostic performances of the Aspergillus-specific lateral-flow device test (LFD), Aspergillus PCR, β-D-glucan, and cytokines that have shown significant associations with IA before.
Results
Among 106 cases, 11 had probable IA, and 32 possible IA; 80% received mold-active antifungals at the time of sampling. Diagnostic tests and biomarkers showed better performance in BALF versus blood, with the exception of serum interleukin (IL)-8 which was the most reliable blood biomarker. Combinations of serum IL-8 with either BALF LFD (sensitivity 100%, specificity 94%) or BALF PCR (sensitivity 91%, specificity 97%) showed promise for differentiating probable IA from no IA.
Conclusions
High serum IL-8 levels were highly specific, and when combined with either the BALF Aspergillus-specific LFD, or BALF Aspergillus PCR also highly sensitive for diagnosis of IA."

Objectives
The rise in multidrug resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae poses a threat to healthcare, while the development of an effective vaccine has remained elusive due to antigenic and phase variability of surface-expressed proteins. In the current study, we identified a fully conserved surface expressed protein and characterized its suitability as a vaccine antigen.
Methods
An in silico approach was used to predict surface-expressed proteins and analyze sequence conservation and phase variability. The most conserved protein and its surface-exposed Loop 2, which was displayed as both a structural and linear epitope on the oligomerization domain of C4b binding protein, were used to immunize mice. Immunogenicity was subsequently analyzed by determination of antibody titers and serum bactericidal activity.
Results
MtrE was identified as one of the most conserved surface-expressed proteins. Furthermore, MtrE and both Loop 2-containing fusion proteins elicited high protein-specific antibody titers and particularly the two Loop 2 fusion proteins showed high anti-Loop 2 titers. In addition, antibodies raised against all three proteins were able to recognize MtrE expressed on the surface of N. gonorrhoeae and showed high MtrE-dependent bactericidal activity.
Conclusions
Our results show that MtrE and Loop 2 are promising novel conserved surface-expressed antigens for vaccine development against N. gonorrhoeae."

Background
Mental health disorders, social stress, and poor health-related quality of life are commonly reported among people with tuberculosis (TB). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify mental health disorders, social stressors, and health-related quality of life in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
Methods
We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, ProQuest, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for studies that reported data on mental health disorders, social stressors, and health-related quality of life among MDR-TB patients. Hand-searching the reference lists of included studies was also performed. Studies were selected according to pre-defined selection criteria and data were extracted by two authors. Pooled prevalence and weighted mean difference estimates were performed using random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was explored using meta-regression, and subgroup analyses were performed.
Results
We included a total of 40 studies that were conducted in 20 countries. Depression, anxiety, and psychosis were the most common mental health disorders reported in the studies. The overall pooled prevalence was 25% (95% confidence interval (CI): 14, 39) for depression, 24% (95% CI: 2, 57) for anxiety, and 10% (95% CI: 7, 14) for psychosis. There was substantial heterogeneity in the estimates. The stratified analysis showed that the prevalence of psychosis was 4% (95% CI: 0, 22) before MDR-TB treatment commencement, and 9% (95% CI: 5, 13) after MDR-TB treatment commencement. The most common social stressors reported were stigma, discrimination, isolation, and a lack of social support. Health-related quality of life was significantly lower among MDR-TB patients when compared to drug-susceptible TB patients (Q = 9.88, p = 0.01, I2 = 80%).
Conclusions
This review found that mental health and social functioning are compromised in a significant proportion of MDR-TB patients, a finding confirmed by the poor health-related quality of life reported. Thus, there is a substantial need for integrating mental health services, social protection and social support into the clinical and programmatic management of MDR-TB."

Objective
We validated the accuracy of host selected signature gene set using unstimulated whole blood (WB), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB).
Methods
The unstimulated WB and PBMC from 1417 individuals with active pulmonary TB patients, other lung diseases and healthy participants were analyzed using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Results
The WB cohort test demonstrates that the combination of GBP5 and KLF2 can differentiate active TB versus HC with sensitivity and specificity of 77.8% and 87.1%, respectively; but most importantly active TB versus OD with sensitivity and specificity of 96.1% and 85.2%, respectively. Again during treatment course, the TB score of GBP5 and KLF2, analytes secretion and clinical parameters were found to be associated in disease progression. In the PBMC cohort test, we found that the only and best discriminatory combination was GBP5, DUSP3 and KLF2 inthe active TB versus HC with a sensitivity and specificity of 76.4% and 85.9%, respectively.
Conclusions
Our study reveals that GBP5 and KLF2 may be useful as a diagnostic tool for active TB, also the two-gene set may serve as surrogate biomarkers for monitoring TB therapy."

abstract = "Introduction
The implementation of the Hib conjugate vaccine in the United Kingdom in 1992 resulted in a rapid decline in invasive Hib disease across all age groups. However, a resurgence in 2000–2002 prompted the introduction of additional control measures, including a routine 12-month booster in 2006. Here we describe results from a national serosurvey in children eligible for the 12-month booster and recent Haemophilus influenzae epidemiology in England and Wales.
Methods
A national serosurvey was performed to determine the prevalence of anti-polyribosyl-phosphate (anti-PRP) IgG antibodies in 1000 residual samples from children up to 8 years of age in 2013–2014. Data were compared to previous national serosurveys performed by the same laboratory. Current epidemiology of invasive H. influenzae disease in England and Wales is also reported.
Results
Median anti-PRP IgG concentrations were highest among 1 year olds at 4.4 µg/mL (IQR, 1.3–14.9; n = 99) and then declined rapidly but remained ≥1.0 µg/mL across the age-groups in the cohort eligible for the 12-month booster. Overall, 89% of children (719/817) had anti-PRP concentrations ≥0.15 µg/mL, the putative threshold for short-term protection against invasive Hib disease. During 2012–2016, annual Hib disease incidence remained below one case per million population, responsible for only 67 of 3523 laboratory-confirmed H. influenzae cases, including one case of Hib meningitis during the 5-year period. There were only two deaths within 30 days over the five-year period (case fatality rate, 3.0%).
Conclusions
Hib control in England and Wales is currently the best achieved since the vaccine was introduced more than two decades ago. However, Hib antibodies wane rapidly after the 12 months booster. Although most children remain protected against disease, antibody levels may not be high enough to prevent carriage among toddlers. Ongoing monitoring is essential to inform future vaccination policy."

Objectives
Mortality among HIV patients with tuberculosis (TB) remains high in Eastern Europe (EE), but details of TB and HIV management remain scarce.
Methods
In this prospective study, we describe the TB treatment regimens of patients with multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB and use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).
Results
A total of 105 HIV-positive patients had MDR-TB (including 33 with extensive drug resistance) and 130 pan-susceptible TB. Adequate initial TB treatment was provided for 8% of patients with MDR-TB compared with 80% of those with pan-susceptible TB. By twelve months, an estimated 57.3% (95%CI 41.5–74.1) of MDR-TB patients had started adequate treatment. While 67% received ART, HIV-RNA suppression was demonstrated in only 23%.
Conclusions
Our results show that internationally recommended MDR-TB treatment regimens were infrequently used and that ART use and viral suppression was well below the target of 90%, reflecting the challenging patient population and the environment in which health care is provided. Urgent improvement of management of patients with TB/HIV in EE, in particular for those with MDR-TB, is needed and includes widespread access to rapid TB diagnostics, better access to and use of second-line TB drugs, timely ART initiation with viral load monitoring, and integration of TB/HIV care."

Objectives
Summary evidence of influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against hospitalized influenza is lacking. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting IVE against laboratory-confirmed hospitalized influenza among adults.
Methods
We searched Pubmed (January 2009 to November 2016) for studies that used test-negative design (TND) to enrol patients hospitalized with influenza-associated conditions. Two independent authors selected relevant articles. We calculated pooled IVE against any and (sub)type specific influenza among all adults, and stratified by age group (18–64 and 65 years and above) using random-effects models.
Results
We identified 3411 publications and 30 met our inclusion criteria. Between 2010–11 and 2014–15, the pooled seasonal IVE was 41% (95%CI:34;48) for any influenza (51% (95%CI:44;58) among people aged 18–64y and 37% (95%CI:30;44) among ≥65 years). IVE was 48% (95%CI:37;59),37% (95%CI:24;50) and 38% (95%CI:23;53) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B, respectively. Among persons aged ≥65 year, IVE against A(H3N2) was 43% (95%CI:33;53) in seasons when circulating and vaccine strains were antigenically similar and 14% (95%CI:-3;30) when A(H3N2) variant viruses predominated.
Conclusions
Influenza vaccines provided moderate protection against influenza-associated hospitalizations among adults. They seemed to provide low protection among elderly in seasons where vaccine and circulating A(H3N2) strains were antigenically variant."

The main aim of this exploratory study was to evaluate functional activity of antibodies elicited by a maternal Group B Streptococcus (GBS) investigational vaccine composed of capsular polysaccharides Ia, Ib, and III conjugated to genetically detoxified Diphtheria toxin CRM197. The second objective was to investigate the relationship between serotype-specific IgG concentrations and functional activity in maternal and cord sera.
Methods
Maternal and cord sera collected at baseline and at delivery from vaccine and placebo recipients during a double-blind placebo-controlled Phase II study (www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01446289) were tested in an opsono-phagocytic bacterial killing assay. Cord sera from vaccine recipients were also passively transferred to newborn mice to investigate conferred protection against bacterial challenge.
Results
Antibody-mediated GBS phagocytic killing was significantly increased in maternal serum at delivery and in cord sera from the investigational vaccine group as compared to the placebo group. Anti-capsular IgG concentrations above 1 µg/mL mediated in vitro killing against GBS strains belonging to all three serotypes and IgG levels correlated with functional titers. Passively administered cord sera elicited a dose-dependent protective response against all GBS serotypes in the in vivo model.
Conclusions
The maternal vaccine elicited functional antibodies that were placentally transferred. Anti-capsular IgG concentrations in maternal and cord sera were predictive of functional activity and in vivo protection in the mouse model."

Early Warning Scores are used to evaluate patients in many hospital settings. It is not clear if these are accurate in predicting mortality in sepsis. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of multiple studies in sepsis. Our aim was to estimate the accuracy of EWS for mortality in this setting.
Methods
PubMED, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched to October 2016. Studies of adults with sepsis who had EWS calculated using any appropriate tool (e.g. NEWS, MEWS) were eligible for inclusion. Study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2. Summary estimates were derived using HSROC analysis.
Results
Six studies (4298 participants) were included. Results suggest that EWS cannot be used to predict which patients with sepsis will (positive likelihood ratio 1.79, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.11) or will not die (negative likelihood ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.78). Two studies were rated as low risk of bias and one as unclear risk of bias on all domains. The other three studies were judged at high risk of bias in one domain.
Conclusion
Early Warning Scores are not sufficiently accurate to rule in or rule out mortality in patients with sepsis, based on the evidence available, which is generally poor quality."

Current estimates suggest that even in the most resourced settings, the aetiology of encephalitis is identified in less than half of clinical cases. It is acknowledged that filling this gap needs a combination of rigorous sampling and improved diagnostic technologies. Next generation sequencing (NGS) methods are powerful tools with the potential for comprehensive and unbiased detection of pathogens in clinical samples. We reviewed the use of this new technology for the diagnosis of suspected infectious encephalitis, and discuss the feasibility for introduction of NGS methods as a frontline diagnostic test.
Methods
A systematic literature review was performed, using MESH and text word searches for variants of “sequencing” and “encephalitis” in Medline and EMbase, and searching bibliographies and citations using the Web of Science database. Two authors independently reviewed, extracted and summarised data.
Findings
The review identified 25 articles reporting 44 case reports of patients with suspected encephalitis for whom NGS was used as a diagnostic tool. We present the data and highlight themes arising from these cases. There are no randomly controlled trials to assess the utility of NGS as a diagnostic tool.
Interpretation
There is increasing evidence of a role for NGS in the work-up of undiagnosed encephalitis. Lower costs and increasing accessibility of these technologies will facilitate larger studies of these patients. We recommend NGS should be considered as a front-line diagnostic test in chronic and recurring presentations and, given current sample-to-result turn-around times, as second-line in acute cases of encephalitis."

Objectives
To estimate the incidence and burden of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and to investigate risk factors for PHN in the Valencia Region of Spain.
Methods
Data were extracted from population and healthcare databases from the Valencia Region (2009–2014). Herpes zoster (HZ) and PHN were defined using ICD-9 codes and drug prescriptions in people aged ≥50 years. The risk of HZ patients for developing PHN and potential risk factors (diabetes mellitus, COPD and heart failure) were investigated. A survival analysis was developed to estimate the cumulative hazard of developing HZ and PHN between ages 50–90 years.
Results
From a total of 2,289,485 subjects, 87,086 cases of HZ were registered, 13,658 (15.7%) of whom developed PHN. PHN risk was higher in women and increased sharply with age and comorbidities as diabetes mellitus, COPD and heart failure. The cumulative risk of developing HZ between ages 50–90 years was 31.7% (95% CI: 31.3-32.1) and 6.9 (95% CI: 6.7–7.1) for PHN.
Conclusions
PHN risk was higher in women and increased with age and comorbidities. At least 32% and 7% of people will develop HZ and PHN, respectively, between ages 50–90 years. These results should be considered for vaccine policy implementation."

To evaluate whether intravenous plus inhaled combination (IV/INHCC) compared to intravenous monotherapy (IVCM) was associated with patient outcomes and identify factors influencing study outcomes.
Methods
PubMed and Scopus were searched till November 2016. Studies were included if they evaluated adult patients with lower respiratory tract infections due to MDR/XDR Gram-negative bacteria and reported comparative mortality data (adjusted and unadjusted) for patients receiving IV/INHCC versus IVCM. Random effects meta-analyses were performed.
Results
Thirteen studies (11 retrospective, 2 prospective) were included. The overall quality of data was low to very low and characterized by the lack of adjusted data. The majority of the studies were designed to evaluate the outcome of the meta-analysis. Both IV and inhaled colistin were administered at variable doses. There was no difference in mortality between IV/INHCC and IVCM when all studies were combined (13 studies, 1115 patients, risk ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.81–1.08). Only the analysis that included studies with low-dose IV colistin showed significant difference in favor of IV/INHCC versus IVCM (0.65, 0.45–0.94).
Conclusions
Overall, low quality data suggest that IV/INHCC did not lower mortality in patients with MDR Gram negative infections unless low IV colistin dose was administered."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Colombia experienced a Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in 2015–2016. To assist with planning for medical and supportive services for infants affected by prenatal ZIKV infection, we used a model to estimate the number of pregnant women infected with ZIKV and the number of infants with congenital microcephaly from August 2015 to August 2017.
Methods
We used nationally reported cases of symptomatic ZIKV disease among pregnant women and information from the literature on the percent of asymptomatic infections to estimate the number of pregnant women with ZIKV infection occurring August 2015–December 2016. We then estimated the number of infants with congenital microcephaly expected to occur August 2015–August 2017. To compare to the observed counts of infants with congenital microcephaly due to all causes reported through the national birth defects surveillance system, the model was time limited to produce estimates for February–November 2016.
Findings
We estimated 1140–2160 (interquartile range [IQR]) infants with congenital microcephaly in Colombia, during August 2015–August 2017, whereas 340–540 infants with congenital microcephaly would be expected in the absence of ZIKV. Based on the time limited version of the model, for February–November 2016, we estimated 650–1410 infants with congenital microcephaly in Colombia. The 95% uncertainty interval for the latter estimate encompasses the 476 infants with congenital microcephaly reported during that approximate time frame based on national birth defects surveillance.
Interpretation
Based on modeled estimates, ZIKV infection during pregnancy in Colombia could lead to 3–4 times as many infants with congenital microcephaly in 2015–2017 as would have been expected in the absence of the ZIKV outbreak.

This study aimed to evaluate new tools to diagnose invasive aspergillosis (IA) directly from broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) samples.
Methods
All consecutive patients with suspected IA who underwent bronchoscopy with BAL were prospectively included. Mycological culture and ELISA detection of galactomannan (GM) were performed on BAL. Two in-house and two marketed PCR assays were used on BAL DNA extracts to detect Aspergillus species. Susceptibility testing was performed after culture; marketed PCR assays detected mutations in the CYP51A gene associated to resistance.
Results
Within 3 years, 1555 BAL samples were processed, including 413 samples from 387 immunosuppressed patients. IA diagnosis was no-IA, possible, probable or proven IA in 326, 23, 37 and 1 patients, respectively. PCR assays sensitivity for Aspergillus detection ranged from 61% to 74%, below GM (87%), but contrasting with 47% for cultures. Combining PCR to EORTC/MSG criteria increased the sensitivity to 100%. Interestingly, tests performance in non-hematological patients ranged from 60% to 75%, and were higher than in hematological patients, and those with prior exposure to antifungals. All 16 isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus were susceptible; PCR did not detect any resistance marker in the 37 A. fumigatus PCR-positive samples.
Conclusion
The molecular detection of Aspergillus directly in BAL samples greatly improved the diagnosis of IA, particularly in non-hematological patients."

Objectives
To evaluate the impact of three decades of hepatitis B vaccination in infancy on antenatal prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriage in 93,134 Hong-Kong born gravidae managed in 1997–2015.
Methods
Annual prevalence of HBsAg carriage on routine antenatal screening was examined with respect to maternal year of birth in three periods i.e. pre-1983 (before availability of vaccination), 1983–1988 (vaccination of infants born to HBsAg-carriers), and after 1988 (universal vaccination).
Results
Overall HBsAg carriage was 8.3% (7737/93,134), decreasing from 10.5% in 1997 to 6.5% in 2015 (p < 0.001), and from 8.8%, 7.0% to 3.1%, respectively, for the three period-of-birth cohorts (p < 0.001). Annual prevalence decreased from 9.9% in 1997 to 7.5% in 2015 (p < 0.001) in the pre-1983 cohort, but showed neither difference nor trend in the other two cohorts. However, the annual prevalence showed significantly falling trends from the pre-1983 to the post-1988 cohorts for the years 2007–2008 and 2010–2015.
Conclusions
A progressive decline in overall annual prevalence of antenatal HBsAg carriage was found, with a consistently significant decline among the three cohorts for the years 2007–2008 and 2010–2015, providing evidence that universal hepatitis B vaccination in infancy has reduced significantly antenatal prevalence of HBsAg carriage in Hong Kong."

There is increasing recognition of the involvement of platelets in orchestrating inflammatory responses, driving the activation of neutrophils, monocytes and vascular endothelium, which, if poorly controlled, may lead to microvascular dysfunction. Importantly, hyperreactivity of platelets has been implicated in the pathogenesis of myocardial injury and the associated particularly high prevalence of acute cardiovascular events in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), of which Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the most commonly encountered aetiologic agent. In this context, it is noteworthy that a number of studies have documented various mechanisms by which the pneumococcus may directly promote platelet aggregation and activation. The major contributors to platelet activation include several different types of pneumococcal adhesin, the pore-forming toxin, pneumolysin, and possibly pathogen-derived hydrogen peroxide, which collectively represent a major focus of the current review. This is followed by an overview of the limited experimental studies together with a larger series of clinical studies mainly focused on all-cause CAP, which have provided evidence in support of associations between alterations in circulating platelet counts, most commonly thrombocytopenia, and a poor clinical outcome. The final section of the review covers, albeit briefly, systemic biomarkers of platelet activation which may have prognostic potential."

abstract = "Summary
Summary
Acute native joint septic arthritis is generally considered a surgical emergency, requiring drainage within hours, including during night, weekend or holiday shifts. However, there are few data supporting the need for the disruption caused by this degree of urgency.
Methods
We performed a retrospective review of all adult patients seen in our medical center from 1997−2015 with culture-proven septic arthritis and noted the epidemiology of sequelae, and their possible association with a delay in surgical drainage.
Results
Of 204 septic arthritis episodes, 46 (23%) involved interdigital hand and foot joints. Large joints involved included the knee (n = 67), shoulder (48), hip (22), ankle (8), acromio-clavicular (5), elbow (4), wrist (3), and sterno-clavicular (1) regions. All patients underwent surgical drainage of the joint and received targeted systemic antibiotic therapy. Sequelae of varying severity occurred in 83 patients (41%): recurrences (n = 15); secondary arthrosis (30); persistent pain (9); Girdlestone procedure (9); arthrodesis (9); amputation (8); stiffness (8); and Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome (2). By multivariate Cox regression analysis factors did not predict sequelae included: age; treatment with systemic corticosteroids; pre-existing clinical or radiological arthropathy; total duration of antibiotic therapy; type of joint; and, number of surgical interventions. Similarly, there was no association of sequelae with the number of days of pre-hospitalization joint symptoms (hazard ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval 0.99−1.01) or hours spent in the emergency department (HR 1.0, 0.9−1.2). Notably, patients who had joint lavage within 6 h of presentation had similar functional outcomes as those with lavage done at 6−12 h, 12–24 h, or > 24 h after presentation.
Conclusions
Our data suggest that for native septic arthritis, in the absence of clinical sepsis immediate joint drainage does not appear to reduce the risk of sequelae compared with delayed drainage."

Background
Non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) is a recommended public health intervention after a sexual or percutaneous exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Methods
We conducted a prospective observational study recording consultations for nPEP at a reference HIV center in Brussels, Belgium from January 2011 to December 2015. We recorded attendance to follow-up, reported completion of nPEP and pharmacy records to measure adherence. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify independent risk factors for adherence to nPEP and attendance to first follow-up visit at the STI clinic.
Findings
Among 1881 patients receiving nPEP, 66.4% had a documented completion of a 28-day course of nPEP and 87.3% attended their first follow-up clinic visit. MSM (OR, 1.40; 95%CI, 1.04–1.90), being a native Belgian (OR, 1.50; 95%CI, 1.18–1.90), older age (OR, 1.02; 95%CI, 1.01–1.04), being a sexual assault survivor (OR, 0.59; 95%CI, 0.38–0.91), having had a previous nPEP treatment (OR, 1.44; 95%CI, 1.02–2.02), consultation during daytime (OR, 1.35; 95%CI, 1.07–1.70) and benefitting from a health insurance (OR, 2.11; 95%CI, 1.58–2.89) were significant independent predictors for adherence to nPEP. Patients whose initial treatment was AZT/3TC/IDV/r had similar adherence than patients on d4T/3TC/LPV/r (OR, 0.898; 95%CI, 0.68–1.20).
Interpretation
Multiple independent risk factors for nPEP retention into care and adherence are present at treatment initiation and might be targeted by tailored interventions. Sexual assault victims are overexposed to deleterious consequences of the lack of health insurance on compliance."

Materials and methods
Children aged 35 months to 12 years (N = 851) were enrolled. Follow-on participants (N = 646) were randomised 2:1 to vaccination and non-vaccination subsets; vaccination subsets received an additional 4CMenB dose. Newly enrolled vaccine-naïve participants (N = 205) received 2 catch-up doses, 1 month apart (accelerated schedule). Antibody levels were determined using human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) against MenB indicator strains for fHbp, NadA, PorA and NHBA. Safety was also evaluated.
Results
Antibody levels declined across follow-on groups at 24–36 months versus 1 month post-vaccination. Antibody persistence and booster responses were similar between infants receiving the reduced or licensed 4CMenB-schedule. An additional dose in follow-on participants induced higher hSBA titres than a first dose in vaccine-naïve children. Two catch-up doses in vaccine-naïve participants induced robust antibody responses. No safety concerns were identified.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the clinical outcome and the risk factors associated with poor outcome of MDR-TB patients receiving standardized second-line treatment regimen in China.
Methods
Between January 2008 and December 2010, a total of 12,100 clinical diagnosed TB cases at high risk of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) were enrolled in this study. Routine follow-up tests were conducted every month during the 6-month intensive phase, and every two months during the 18-month continuation phase.
Results
On the basis of phenotypical drug susceptibility test (DST) results, 2322 MDR-TB patients were confirmed, of which 1542 further received standardized second-line anti-TB regimen. The treatment success rate was 47.6% (734/1542): 688 patients (44.6%) were cured and 46 (3.0%) completed treatment. The percentage of cases with favorable outcome in previously untreated patients (57.6%) was significantly higher than that in treatment-experienced patients (46.1%, OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.17–2.14). In addition, a significant lower percentage of male MDR-TB cases with favorable outcome (45.8%) was observed using female MDR-TB cases as a reference (52.0%, OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.03–1.60). The proportion of MDR-TB cases with favorable outcome was significantly decreased in older age groups.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that less than half of these patients receiving standardized second-line treatment regimen meet the definition of successful treatment during a 3-year period in China. More attention should be paid to the MDR-TB population at high-risk of poor clinical outcome, including male, elderly age, and those who have received prior treatment."

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a toxin-mediated disease. Oncology patients are at increased risk for developing CDI. Diagnosis of CDI by PCR has led to misclassification of some C. difficile carriers as CDI cases. We determined if an optimized C. difficile PCR cycle threshold value (CT) could reliably predict presence of free toxin, and in turn improve the utility of PCR in detecting clinically relevant CDI in oncology patients.
Methods
183 consecutive patients positive for C. difficile by the Xpert C. difficile were additionally tested using the cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assay (CYT) and enzyme immunoassays (EIA). CT values at diagnosis and relevant clinical information were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess predictive validity and to find optimal CT for CYT positive cases. Severity of CDI was assessed by blinded charts review.
Results
Using CYT as the reference, ROC-derived Youden cut-off CT of 28.0 predicted 77% cytotoxin positive cases, and 91% and 100% of severe and complicated CDI episodes respectively. The median CT values for non-severe, severe, and complicated CDI episodes were 28.0, 24.5 and 22.5 respectively (p = 0.005).
Conclusions
Lower CT value of the Xpert C. difficile PCR was associated with the presence of toxin and increased CDI severity. CT values may be beneficial in interpreting positive C. difficile PCR results."

Its most common complication, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), may cause chronic debilitating pain. This study aimed to estimate the HZ incidence in individuals aged ≥50 years in Germany, the proportion of PHN and the economic burden.
Methods
From 2010 to 2014, HZ patients were recruited when consulting physicians in physician networks covering about 157,000 persons aged ≥50 years. PHN was defined as “worst pain” rated ≥3 on the zoster brief pain inventory persisting or appearing over 90 days after rash onset. Costs were calculated based on medical resource utilization and lost working time.
Results
HZ incidence was estimated as 6.7/1000 person-years, increasing with age to 9.4/1000 in ≥80 year-olds. Among 513 HZ patients enrolled, the proportion of PHN was 11.9%, rising with age to 14.3% in HZ patients ≥80 years. Estimated total cost per HZ patient was €156 from the healthcare system perspective and €311 from the societal perspective.
Conclusions
The study confirmed previous findings that HZ causes a substantial clinical and economic burden in older German adults. It also confirmed the age-related increasing risk of HZ and PHN."

Objectives
To assess real-world treatment patterns and clinical outcomes associated with initial antibiotic therapy (IAT, antibiotics received ≤ 48 h post-initiation of antibiotic therapy), including level of IAT failure, and potential risk factors for IAT failure in healthcare-associated infections.
Methods
Data were obtained from medical records of adult patients hospitalized with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and nosocomial pneumonia (NP), including ventilator-associated pneumonia, from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 in Brazil, France, Italy, Russia and Spain during the retrospective, observational study, RECOMMEND (NCT02364284; D4280R00005). Potential risk factors for IAT failure were explored using logistic regression analyses.
Results
Mean (standard deviation) age and Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Score were 66.0 (16.2) years and 2.4 (2.4), respectively (N = 451). Most patients (62.5%) received monotherapy. Mean (standard deviation) duration of IAT was 8.8 (7.2) days. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens were identified in 52.4% of patients with ≥ 1 pathogen isolated (154/294). IAT failure was recorded in 72.5% of patients and was significantly associated with isolation of a MDR pathogen and country using multivariate analyses.
Conclusions
Real-world data demonstrate the burden of HCAP/NP, with high rates of IAT failure. The association of IAT failure with MDR pathogens highlights the urgent need to understand and account for local prevalence of MDR pathogens when selecting IAT for the management of HCAP/NP."

Limited data exist describing supportive care management, laboratory abnormalities and outcomes in patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa. We report data which constitute the first description of the provision of enhanced EVD case management protocols in a West African setting.
Methods
Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected by retrospective review of clinical and laboratory records of patients with confirmed EVD admitted between 5 November 2014 and 30 June 2015.
Results
A total of 44 EVD patients were admitted (median age 37 years (range 17–63), 32/44 healthcare workers), and excluding those evacuated, the case fatality rate was 49% (95% CI 33%–65%). No pregnant women were admitted. At admission 9/44 had stage 1 disease (fever and constitutional symptoms only), 12/44 had stage 2 disease (presence of diarrhoea and/or vomiting) and 23/44 had stage 3 disease (presence of diarrhoea and/or vomiting with organ failure), with case fatality rates of 11% (95% CI 1%–58%), 27% (95% CI 6%–61%), and 70% (95% CI 47%–87%) respectively (p = 0.009). Haemorrhage occurred in 17/41 (41%) patients. The majority (21/40) of patients had hypokalaemia with hyperkalaemia occurring in 12/40 patients. Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred in 20/40 patients, with 14/20 (70%, 95% CI 46%–88%) dying, compared to 5/20 (25%, 95% CI 9%–49%) dying who did not have AKI (p = 0.01). Ebola virus (EBOV) PCR cycle threshold value at baseline was mean 20.3 (SD 4.3) in fatal cases and 24.8 (SD 5.5) in survivors (p = 0.007). Mean national early warning score (NEWS) at admission was 5.5 (SD 4.4) in fatal cases and 3.0 (SD 1.9) in survivors (p = 0.02). Central venous catheters were placed in 37/41 patients and intravenous fluid administered to 40/41 patients (median duration of 5 days). Faecal management systems were inserted in 21/41 patients, urinary catheters placed in 27/41 and blood component therapy administered to 20/41 patients.
Conclusions
EVD is commonly associated life-threatening electrolyte imbalance and organ dysfunction. We believe that the enhanced levels of protocolized care, scale and range of medical interventions we report, offer a blueprint for the future management of EVD in resource-limited settings."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Dengue fever (DF) is still a major challenge for public health, especially during massive outbreaks. We developed a novel prediction score to help decision making, which has not been performed till date.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective case-control study to recruit all the DF patients who visited a medical center during the 2015 DF outbreak. Demographic data, vital signs, symptoms/signs, chronic comorbidities, laboratory data, and 30-day mortality rates were included in the study. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to identify the independent mortality predictors, which further formed the components of a DF mortality (DFM) score. Bootstrapping method was used to validate the DFM score.
Results
In total, a sample of 2358 DF patients was included in this study, which also consisted of 34 deaths (1.44%). Five independent mortality predictors were identified: elderly age (≥65 years), hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg), hemoptysis, diabetes mellitus, and chronic bedridden. After assigning each predictor a score of “1”, we developed a DFM score (range: 0–5), which showed that the mortality risk ratios for scores 0, 1, 2, and ≥3 were 0.2%, 2.3%, 6.0%, and 45.5%, respectively. The area under the curve was 0.849 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.785–0.914), and Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit was 0.642. Compared with score 0, the odds ratios for mortality were 12.73 (95% CI: 3.58–45.30) for score 1, 34.21 (95% CI: 9.75–119.99) for score 2, and 443.89 (95% CI: 86.06–2289.60) for score ≥3, with significant differences (all p values <0.001). The score ≥1 had a sensitivity of 91.2% for mortality and score ≥3 had a specificity of 99.7% for mortality.
Conclusions
DFM score was a simple and easy method to help decision making, especially in the massive outbreak. Further studies in other hospitals or nations are warranted to validate this score."

This study was undertaken to analyze prosthetic joint infection (PJI)-causing microorganisms and compare their distribution patterns according to PJI classification.
Methods
Cohort study from a single referral center for bone-and-joint infections from January 2004 to December 2015.
Results
Nine hundred and twenty-six patients, who developed 997 PJIs, involving the hip (62%), knee (35%) and/or shoulder (1%), were included. PJIs were classified as early postoperative (19%), late chronic (30%), hematogenous (35%) and undetermined (16%). Pathogens most frequently isolated from early-postoperative PJIs were staphylococci (57%), with 25% each Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis; 21% were polymicrobial and 10% Gram-negative rods. For late-chronic PJIs, the most frequent microbes were staphylococci (61%), predominantly S. epidermidis (35%); anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 15%; 11% were polymicrobial. Hematogenous PJIs were 99% monomicrobial. Although S. aureus was the most frequently isolated species (28%), streptococci were isolated slightly more often than staphylococci (39% vs. 36%). Among streptococci, group B streptococci were the most frequent (15%). The portal of entry was identified for 52% of hematogenous PJIs: 15% cutaneous, 11% dental, 9% gastrointestinal, 6% urinary, and 11% miscellaneous.
Conclusion
Although a wide variety of microorganisms was isolated from PJIs, specific microbiological patterns were observed according to infection classification."

Objectives
Fluoroquinolone (FQ) prophylaxis was recommended in 2005 by European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) for patients with prolonged neutropenia. In consideration of a worldwide increase in antibiotic resistance, the issue of FQ prophylaxis during neutropenia was re-evaluated.
Methods
Literature review of randomised controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies published in years 2006–2014 was performed. Their results were analysed in meta-analysis. Meta-regression model was applied to evaluate whether the rates of FQ resistance in community and hospital settings influenced the efficacy of FQ prophylaxis. The impact of FQ prophylaxis on colonisation and infection with resistant bacteria was reviewed.
Results
Two RCTs and 12 observational studies were identified. FQ prophylaxis did not have effect on mortality (pooled OR 1.01, 95%CI 0.73–1.41), but was associated with lower rate of bloodstream infections (BSI) (pooled OR 0.57, 95%CI 0.43–0.74) and episodes of fever during neutropenia (pooled OR 0.32, 95%CI 0.20–0.50). No effect of the background rate of FQ resistance on the efficacy of FQ prophylaxis was observed. In few studies, FQ prophylaxis resulted in an increased colonisation or infection with FQ- or multi-drug resistant strains.
Conclusions
The possible benefits of FQ prophylaxis on BSI rate, but not on overall mortality, should be weighed against its impact in terms of toxicity and changes in local ecology in single centres."

We evaluate early impact of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) on pneumococcal meningitis in Burkina Faso.
Methods
Nationwide surveillance gathered demographic/clinical information and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results for meningitis cases. Pneumococcal cases were confirmed by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or latex agglutination, and strains serotyped using PCR. We compared incidence (cases per 100,000) in the early post-PCV13 period (2014 and 2015) to average pre-PCV13 incidence (2011–2013).
Results
In 2015, age-specific pneumococcal meningitis incidences were 8.7 (<1 year), 2.4 (1–4 years), 6.5 (5–14 years), and 2.6 (≥15 years). Compared to 2011–2013, PCV13-serotype incidence among all ages decreased by 32% (95%CI: 23%–39%), with significant decreases among children aged <1 year (76%; 95%CI: 64%–84%) and 1–4 years (58%, 95%CI: 40%–71%). Among all ages, incidence of PCV13 serotypes besides serotype 1 decreased (68%; 95%CI: 59%–75%), but serotype 1 incidence did not. Incidence of non-PCV13 serotypes also decreased (47%; 95%CI: 29%–60%). Among children aged <1 year, serotypes 12F/12A/12B/44/46 (17%), 1 (12%), and 5 (10%) predominated.
Conclusions
Following PCV13 introduction, PCV13-serotype meningitis incidence in young children significantly decreased. PCV13 impact on serotype 1 and disease in older children and adults requires continued monitoring."

Objectives
We assessed the value of the clinical symptoms included in the case definition of pertussis in household contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases.
Methods
A prospective epidemiological study was made in two Spanish regions. Household contacts were identified for each confirmed case reported during 2012 and 2013. Two clinical samples were taken to determine the presence or absence of Bordetella pertussis by culture or real-time PCR. Clinical variables, age and vaccination status were recorded. Positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR, NLR) were estimated for each symptom.
Results
2852 household contacts of 688 confirmed cases were reported. 178 household contacts with clinical symptoms were analyzed: 150 were laboratory confirmed and 28 were not. The clinical symptom with the highest PLR in comparison with the NLR was paroxysmal cough(PLR 4.76; 95% CI 1.91–11.87 and NLR 0.37; 95% CI 0.28–0.49). The contrast between the PLR and NLR was especially important for persons aged <18 years (PLR 7.08; 95% CI 1.10–45.74 and NLR 0.32; 95% CI 0.21–0.49).
Conclusions
The clinical symptoms of pertussis are poor predictors of pertussis disease, independently of the vaccination status. Differences were observed between persons aged <18 years and adults. To adopt the appropriate treatment and control measures, rapid laboratory confirmation by PCR of all household contacts of confirmed cases who present any clinical symptoms compatible with pertussis should be recommended."

Limited clinical trial data has shown high efficacy of co-formulated ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT)-4 infected cirrhotic patients. We assessed real-world safety and efficacy of LDV/SOF with or without ribavirin (RBV) in GT4-infected patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis.
Patients & Methods
This observational cohort (n = 213) included GT4 treatment-naïve (59.6%) and -experienced (40.4%) patients with advanced fibrosis (F3, Metavir; n = 30), compensated (F4, n = 135) and decompensated cirrhosis (n = 48) treated for 12 (n = 202) or 24 weeks (n = 11) with LDV/SOF. RBV was dosed by physician discretion between 600–1200 mg daily. Patients with prior DAA failure were excluded from the analysis. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12) on an intention-to-treat analysis, and occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs).
Results
The mean age of the overall cohort was 59.6 ± 12.1 years and 125 (58.7) were female. Overall, 197 (92.5%) of the patients achieved SVR12, including 93.3% of F3 fibrosis, 93.3% of compensated cirrhotics and 89.6% of the decompensated cirrhotics (P = 0.686). Addition of RBV (68.5%) did not enhance efficacy (91.8% vs. 94.0% without RBV, P = 0.563), including in F3 fibrosis, compensated and decompensated cirrhosis (P > 0.05, for all). There was no difference in SVR12 rates with 24 and 12 weeks therapy (90.9% and 92.6%, respectively; P = 0.586). Treatment failure (n = 16) was mostly related to relapse (n = 11), while on-treatment death (n = 3) and breakthrough (n = 2) comprised a minority. SAEs occurred in 9 (4.2%) patients requiring early treatment discontinuation in 4 (3 on-treatment deaths and 1 pregnancy).
Conclusion
LDV/SOF therapy yielded high SVR12 rates in both compensated and decompensated cirrhotic GT4 patients. The addition of RBV to this regimen did not improve efficacy. The safety profile of this regimen was comparable with that reported for other HCV genotypes."

Taking into account the significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs related to Candidemia, our objective is to define if improving appropriateness in candidemia management was associated with better clinical outcomes.
Methods
A prospective observational monocentric cohort study was conducted. Adherence to five main elements was examined: appropriate selection of initial therapy; follow-up blood culture; echocardiography; ophthalmological examination; and removal of a central venous catheter. The correlation between the number of appropriate elements achieved and 30 day survival was examined.
Results
Patients with candidemia (n = 213) were enrolled. Adherence to all five elements was achieved in 36 cases (16.9%), while the majority adhered to three or four elements (28.2% and 37.1%, respectively). Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the number of elements achieved was associated with survival [HR: 0.39 (0.30–0.52); p < 0.001]. Also, the number of elements achieved correlated positively with duration of therapy (p = 0.01), but not length of hospital stay (p = 0.56).
Conclusions
Five elements, including therapeutic and non-therapeutic-related aspects, of care were good indicators of appropriate management of patients with candidemia. Implementation of evidence-based practice regarding optimal clinical management is crucial for any antimicrobial stewardship program."

Objectives
Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic cause of severe meningitis and sepsis in humans. We aimed to assess the long-term outcomes in patients who survived S. suis infection, in particular the progress and impact of vestibulocochlear sequelae.
Methods
This case-control study evaluated outcomes of S. suis infection at discharge and 3 and 9 months post-discharge for 47 prospectively enrolled cases and at 11–34 months for 31 retrospectively enrolled cases. Outcomes in patients were compared to 270 controls matched for age, sex and residency.
Results
The prevalence ratio (PR) of moderate-to-complete hearing loss was 5.0(95%CI 3.6–7.1) in cases at discharge, 3.7(2.5–5.4) at 3 months, 3.2(2.2–4.7) at 9 months, and 3.1(2.1–4.4) in retrospective cases compared to controls. Hearing improvement occurred mostly within the first 3 months with a change in hearing level of 11.1%(95%CI 7.0–15.1%) compared to discharge. The PR of vestibular dysfunction was 2.4(95%CI 1.7–3.3) at discharge, 2.2(1.4–3.1) at 3 months, 1.8(1.1–2.5) at 9 months, and 1.8(1.1–2.6) for retrospective cases compared to controls. Cases also indicated more problems with mobility, self-care and usual activities.
Conclusions
Both hearing and vestibular impairment were common and persist in cases. Appropriate patient management strategies are needed to reduce the incidence and impact of these sequelae."

Introduction
Infectious disease remains a significant burden in the UK and the focus of significant amounts of research investment each year. The Research Investments in Global Health study has systematically assessed levels of funding for infection research, and here considers investment alongside UK burden of individual infectious diseases.
Methods
The study included awards to UK institutions between 1997 and 2013 that were related to infectious disease. Awards related to global health projects were excluded here. UK burden data (mortality, years lived with disability, and disability adjusted life years) was sourced from the Global Burden of Disease study (IHME, USA). Awards were categorised by pathogen, disease, disease area and by type of science along the research pipeline (pre-clinical, phase I-III trials, product development, public health, cross-disciplinary research). New metrics present relative levels of funding by comparing sum investment with measures of disease burden.
Results
There were 5685 relevant awards comprising investment of £2.4 billion. By disease, HIV received most funding (£369.7m; 15.6% of the total investment). Pre-clinical science was the predominant type of science (£1.6 billion, 68.7%), with the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) the largest funder (£714.8 million, 30.1%). There is a broad temporal trend to increased fundingper annum. Antimicrobial resistance received (£102.8 million, 4.2%), whilst sepsis received £23.6 million (1.0%). Compared alongside disease burden, acute hepatitis C and measles typically were relatively well-funded, whilst pneumonia, syphilis and gonorrhoea were poorly-funded.
Conclusions
The UK has a broad research portfolio across a wide range of infectious diseases and disciplines. There are notable strengths including HIV, some respiratory infections and in pre-clinical science, though there was less funding for UK-relevant trials and public health research. Compared to the UK burden of disease, syphilis, gonorrhoea and pneumonia appear relatively neglected. Investment analyses can assist support policymakers to increase the equity of the UK R&D landscape."

In order to analyze the molecular epidemiology of human astroviruses (HAstV) in Germany, a retrospective long-term study was performed to characterize circulating human astrovirus in patients with acute gastroenteritis in Germany.
Methods
A total of 2877 stool samples, collected between January 2010 and December 2015 from sporadic cases and outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis were retrospectively analyzed for astrovirus. A two-step PCR algorithm was developed and used to identify and characterize human astrovirus infections.
Results
Overall, 143 samples were astrovirus-positive (5.0%). Astrovirus infection was most frequently detectable in samples from children of 3–4 years (15%) followed by children of 1–2 years (8.6%), detection rates in adults were lower (1%–3.6%). A high number (71.3%) of co-infections, mainly with noro- or rotaviruses, were identified. Genotyping revealed that at least ten genotypes from all four human MAstV species were circulating in the study population. HAstV-1 was predominant in different age groups. Novel HAstV (MLB and VA genotypes) were also circulating in Germany.
Conclusion
Our findings give new insights into the circulation and genetic diversity of human astroviruses in patients with acute gastroenteritis. The novel HAstV-MLB and -VA genotypes could be characterized firstly in Germany while the analysis showed that these viruses have been dispersed in Germany since 2011 as a causative agent of acute gastroenteritis."

Midregional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM) is a prognostic biomarker in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. In this paper, we examined the ability of MR-proADM to predict organ damage and long-term mortality in sepsis patients, compared to that of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and lactate.
Methods
This was a prospective observational cohort, enrolling severe sepsis or septic shock patients admitted to internal service department. The association between biomarkers and 90-day mortality was assessed by Cox regression analysis and Kaplan–Meier curves. The accuracy of biomarkers for mortality was determined by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis.
Results
A total of 148 patients with severe sepsis, according to the criteria of the campaign to survive sepsis, were enrolled. Eighty-five (57.4%) had sepsis according to the new criteria of Sepsis-3. MR-proADM showed the best AUROC to predict sepsis as defined by the Sepsis-3 criteria (AUROC of 0.771, 95% CI 0.692–0.850, p <0.001) and was the only marker independently associated with Sepsis-3 criteria (OR = 4.78, 95% CI 2.25–10.14; p < 0.001) in multivariate analysis. MR-proADM was the biomarker with the best AUROC to predict mortality in 90 days (AUROC of 0.731, CI 95% 0.612–0.850, p <0.001) and was the only marker that kept its independence [hazard ratio (HR) of 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.64, p <0.001] in multivariate analysis. The cut-off point of MR-proADM of 1.8 nmol/L (HR of 4.65, 95% CI 6.79–10.1, p < 0.001) was the one that had greater discriminative capacity to predict 90 days mortality. All patients with MR-proADM concentrations ≤0.60 nmol/L survived up to 90 days. In patients with SOFA ≤ 6, the addition of MR-proADM to SOFA score increased the ability of SOFA to identify non-survivors, AUROC of 0.65 (CI 95% 0.537–0.764) and AUROC of 0.700 (CI 95% 0.594–0.800), respectively (p < 0.05 for both).
Conclusions
MR-proADM is a good biomarker in the early identification of high risk septic patients and may contribute to improve the predictive capacity of SOFA scale, especially when scores are low."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Fournier's gangrene is an uncommon but often devastating infection. There are few contemporary data on the risk factors and evolving microbiologic trends including drug-resistant organisms implicated in these life-threatening infections.
Methods
A retrospective study of Fournier's gangrene from 2006 to 2015 at a large academic hospital was conducted. Cases were identified using ICD codes (ICD-9: 608.83, V13.89; ICD-10: N49.3, Z87.438), and a review of medical, radiographic, and pathology records was performed to confirm each case. Data collected included socio-demographics, medical conditions, bacterial pathogens and their resistance patterns, treatments, and outcome. Descriptive and univariate statistics were performed.
Results
A total of 59 cases were evaluated with an overall incidence of 31.8 cases per 100,000 admissions which remained stable over the study period. Mean age was 56 years (range 18–91), 71% were male, and 44% white. Risk factors included overweight/obesity (61%), diabetes (44%, with a mean A1c of 9.6%), immunocompromised state (34%), and illicit use (20%). A causative organism was identified in all except 2 cases; 12 patients (21%) had a multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) with MRSA being the most common pathogen (n = 8, 14% of all cases), followed by ESBL E. coli (n = 3) and MDRO Acinetobacter (n = 1). MRSA was the sole pathogen isolated in five (63%) of the eight cases involving this organism. Among those with an aerobic Gram-negative rod (GNR) isolated, 32% were fluoroquinolone-resistant. Overall, 30% of cases had a poor outcome (15% died and an additional 15% had loss of an organ/body part). Those with an MDRO were more likely to experience a poor outcome (42% vs. 28%), although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.48); of note, most (83%) MDRO cases were initially treated with an antibiotic that the organism was susceptible.
Conclusions
This report highlights the emergence of MDROs as an important cause of Fournier's gangrene including MRSA and drug-resistant GNRs. Antibiotics should be chosen with broad-spectrum, anti-MDRO activity given the high morbidity and mortality associated with these infections."

Objectives
The REDUC clinical study Part B investigated Vacc-4x/rhuGM-CSF therapeutic vaccination prior to HIV latency reversal using romidepsin. The main finding was a statistically significant reduction from baseline in viral reservoir measurements. Here we evaluated HIV-specific functional T-cell responses following Vacc-4x/rhuGM-CSF immunotherapy in relation to virological outcomes on the HIV reservoir.
Methods
This study, conducted in Aarhus, Denmark, enrolled participants (n = 20) with CD4>500 cells/mm3 on cART. Six Vacc-4x (1.2 mg) intradermal immunizations using rhuGM-CSF (60 μg) as adjuvant were followed by 3 weekly intravenous infusions of romidepsin (5 mg/m2). Immune responses were determined by IFN-γ ELISpot, T-cell proliferation to p24 15-mer peptides covering the Vacc-4x region, intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) to the entire HIVGag and viral inhibition.
Results
The frequency of participants with CD8+ T-cell proliferation assay positivity was 8/16 (50%) at baseline, 11/15 (73%) post-vaccination, 6/14 (43%) during romidepsin, and 9/15 (60%)post-romidepsin. Participants with CD8+ T-cell proliferation assay positivity post-vaccination showed reductions in total HIV DNA post-vaccination (p = 0.006; q = 0.183), post-latency reversal (p = 0.005; q = 0.183), and CA-RNA reductions post-vaccination (p = 0.015; q = 0.254). Participants (40%) were defined as proliferation ‘Responders’ having ≥2-fold increase in assay positivity post-baseline. Robust ELISpot baseline responses were found in 87.5% participants. No significant changes were observed in the proportion of polyfunctional CD8+ T-cells to HIVGag by ICS. There was a trend towards increased viral inhibition from baseline to post-vaccination (p = 0.08).
Conclusions
In this ‘shock and kill’ approach supported by therapeutic vaccination, CD8+ T-cell proliferation represents a valuable means to monitor functional immune responses as part of the path towards functional HIV cure."

Objectives
Pentraxin-3 (PTX-3) is a multi-functional pattern recognition molecule produced by various cell types of peripheral tissues in different infections. It is raised in sepsis, but its values in predicting disease severity or mortality outcomes have been controversial. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of these associations.
Methods
PubMed and Embase were searched until July 18, 2017 for studies that evaluated the relationship between PTX-3 levels and disease severity or mortality in sepsis.
Results
A total of 23 and 10 entries were retrieved from both databases, respectively, of which 16 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. A total of 3001 patients (56% male, mean age 63 ± 15 years; mean follow-up duration of 207 days) were analysed. PTX-3 was significantly higher in patients with more severe sepsis compared to those with less severe sepsis (standard mean difference = 18.5 ng/mL, standard error: 4.5 ng/mL, P < 0.0001) and higher in non-survivors compared to survivors (standard mean difference = 40.3 ng/mL, standard error: 6.8 ng/mL, P < 0.0001). Elevated PTX-3 levels significantly increased the risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.53 to 2.46, P < 0.0001).
Conclusions
PTX-3 significantly predicts disease severity and mortality in sepsis."

Background
Despite the fact that antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppresses HIV-viremia, an adequate CD4 T-cell recovery is not always achieved (immunodiscordant response to cART). IL17a-producing CD4 T-cells (Th17) constitutes an important subset involved in the preservation of mucosal surfaces integrity, which depletion has been associated with disease progression in HIV-infection. However, whether Th17 frequency at cART initiation is associated with a poor CD4 T-cell recovery has not been yet explored. Our aim was to explore whether the Th17 cells and other IL17a-producing T-cell subsets at cART initiation were associated with a subsequent immunodiscordant response to cART.
Methods
We selected pre-cART samples of antiretroviral-naïve subjects with and without a low CD4 recovery after cART (LR-subjects and HR-subjects, respectively). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with PMA/ionomycine, and the production of several cytokines including IL17a was analyzed by flow cytometry.
Results
A trend to higher Th17 (p = 0.05) and increased frequencies of IL17a-producing Treg (p = 0.011) was found in LR-subjects before cART onset. Despite increased frequencies of both Treg and Th17 in LR-subject at cART initiation, no alteration of Treg/Th17 ratio was observed. While polifunctional profile of CD4 T-cells was not different, frequencies of CD4 T-cells producing cytokine-combinations including IL17a were increased in LR-subjects.
Conclusion
Increased frequencies of Th17, IL17a-producing Treg and CD4 T-cells producing specific IL17a-containing combinations of cytokines, precede the immunodiscordant response to cART, suggesting a potential contribution of these subsets in such anomalous response to cART."

Little is known about the dynamics of the transmission contacts between poultry and human populations, although such understanding is essential for developing effective strategies to control this zoonosis. In this study, we evaluated the effects of contact reductions from live poultry markets (LPMs) closures on the transmission of H7N9 virus during epidemics in Guangdong Province, China. A mathematical model of the poultry-to-person transmission dynamics of H7N9 virus was constructed. The parameters in the model were estimated from publicly available data on confirmed cases of human infection and information on LPMs closure during 2013–2017. By fitting the model, we measured the time-dependent contact quantity of the susceptible population to LPMs. The results showed that periodic intervention strategies can greatly reduce the magnitude of outbreaks, and the earlier interventions for policy are implemented, the smaller is the outbreak. The control efforts for LPMs to decrease the contact quantity are critical in preventing epidemics in the long term. This model should provide important insights for the development of a national intervention strategy for the long-term control of avian influenza virus epidemics."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Neisseria meningitidis group W (NmW) belonging to the clonal complex ST-11 (NmW/cc11) spread in Europe and in France in 2000 and declined thereafter. In France, invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) due to NmW increased again in 2012 and thereafter since 2015. Several sub-lineages of NmW/cc11 are circulating worldwide with successive epidemic waves. We aimed to describe recent epidemiological trends of NmW in France and to explore the microbiological and epidemiological characteristics associated with different NmW/cc11 sub-lineages.
Methods
The epidemiology of NmW was described based on data collected through mandatory notification of IMD and strain typing data for culture-confirmed and PCR-confirmed cases for the period 2000–2016. All culture-confirmed cases due to NmW from the period 2010–2016 were characterised by whole genome sequencing (WGS). A detailed epidemiological analysis was performed for culture-confirmed cases on the basis of WGS data.
Findings
During the period 2010–2016, genotyping was obtained for 148 cases including all the 132 culture-confirmed cases, among which 127 were matched with epidemiological data, and 16 PCR-confirmed cases (out of a total of 47 PCR-confirmed cases). An increase in IMD was observed in 2012 and was linked to isolates belonging to the “Anglo-French-Hajj” sub-lineage. These isolates have decreased significantly since 2013 and have been replaced by NmW/cc11 isolates related to the “South American – UK” sub-lineage which caused a marked increase in the number of cases of NmW in 2016. In this sub-lineage, the “original UK strain” was first detected in 2012 and increased thereafter, followed by the recently described “UK 2013-strain”. Isolates related to the “South American-UK” sub-lineage represented 45% of all NmW cultured isolates from the whole period 2010–2016 but were the most frequent isolates in 2016, representing 76% of the total NmW typed isolates and 94% of the typed NmW/cc11 isolates. A changing pattern in the epidemiology of NmW has been observed in 2015–2016 in relation to the spread of the “UK 2013-strain” with a sharp increase in the number of cases among persons aged 15 years and over and a high case fatality rate (CFR). Among cases due to the “UK 2013-strain”, 94% of cases were aged 15 years and over and the CFR was 28%.
Interpretation
Our data suggest a recent clonal replacement among NmW/cc11 isolates with the expansion of the “South American-UK” sub-lineage in France and particularly the “UK 2013-strain” which was predominant in 2015 and 2016. A shift in the age-distribution of IMD due to NmW to older ages and the high CFR are consistent with the expansion of a new virulent clone in a naive population. These data may have an impact on tailoring vaccination strategies against NmW."

The association of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with dengue disease progression is currently unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify lncRNAs in different categories of dengue patients and evaluate their association with dengue disease progression. Herein, we examined the expression profiles of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes between other febrile illness (OFI) and different grade of dengue patients through high-throughput RNA sequencing. We identified Nuclear Enriched Abundant Transcript 1 (NEAT1) as one of the differentially expressed lncRNAs (adjusted P ≤ 0.05 and log-fold change ≥ 2) and subsequently validated the expression by qRT-PCR. The co-expression analysis further revealed that NEAT1 and the coding gene IFI27 were highly co-expressed and negatively correlated with dengue severity. Using regression analysis, we observed that NEAT1 expression was significantly dependent on disease progression (Coefficient = −0.27750, SE Coefficient = 0.07145, and t = −3.88).Further, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that NEAT1 expression could discriminate DI from DS (sensitivity and specificity of 100% (95%CI: 85.69 – 97.22) and area under the curve (AUC) = 0.97). Overall, the results of this study offer the first experimental evidence demonstrating the correlation between lncRNAs and severe dengue phenotype. Monitoring NEAT1and IFI27 expression in PBMC may be useful in understanding dengue virus-induced disease progression."

We assessed the immunological response of hospitalized adult patients with rhinovirus infection, including critically-ill patients.
Methods
The differential white blood cell (WBC) count and the levels of 29 plasma cytokines/chemokines were compared between 50 adult hospitalized patients with rhinovirus infection and 100 age-matched controls with influenza virus infection.
Results
The demographics and comorbidities were similar between rhinovirus and influenza patients, but severe disease was more common for the rhinovirus cohort. Rhinovirus patients had significantly higher WBC counts than influenza patients, especially for eosinophil (P = 3.1 × 10−8). The level of the TH2 cytokine IL-5 was significantly higher among rhinovirus patients, while the levels of 9 other cytokines/chemokines were significantly lower among rhinovirus patients. The levels of CXCL-10 (IP-10), CCL-2 (MCP-1), IFN-α2, IFN-γ, IL-10, and IL-15 remained significantly lower among rhinovirus patients after correction for multiple comparisons. Notably, CXCL-10 had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in differentiating rhinovirus from influenza patients (AUC, 0.918). In the patient subgroup without asthma, the difference in the WBC count and cytokine/chemokine levels between rhinovirus and influenza patients remained statistically significant.
Conclusions
Rhinovirus infection was characterized by a prominent TH2 response, even in patients without asthma. CXCL-10 (IP-10) is a potential biomarker in differentiating rhinovirus from influenza infection."

Methods
We isolated and characterized two hetero-reactive human monoclonal antibodies from an H3N2 virus-infected human.
Results
These antibodies, which are predominantly bound to the HA stem of group 2 HAs, used IGHV3-66 and IGHV4-38-2 germline genes, respectively. They possessed in vitro neutralizing ability, and in vivo protective efficacy against lethal infection with H3N2 or H7N9 virus. Escape mutations revealed that one of the protective antibodies recognized the α-helix A of HA2, and the other recognized the C-terminal portion of the fusion peptide and the β-sheet that precedes the α-helix A of HA2.
Conclusions
Of many human protective monoclonal antibodies against the HA stem, two human protective monoclonal antibodies were isolated in this study that predominantly recognize epitopes on the HA stem of group 2 and use unique IGHV3-66 and IGHV4-38-2 germline genes."

Breakthrough candidemia (BTC) on fluconazole was associated with non-susceptible Candida spp. and increased mortality. This nationwide FUNGINOS study analyzed clinical and mycological BTC characteristics.
Methods
A 3-year prospective study was conducted in 567 consecutive candidemias. Species identification and antifungal susceptibility testing (CLSI) were performed in the FUNGINOS reference laboratory. Data were analyzed according to STROBE criteria.
Results
43/576 (8%) BTC occurred: 37/43 (86%) on fluconazole (28 prophylaxis, median 200 mg/day). 21% BTC vs. 23% non-BTC presented severe sepsis/septic shock. Overall mortality was 34% vs. 32%. BTC was associated with gastrointestinal mucositis (multivariate OR 5.25, 95%CI 2.23–12.40, p < 0.001) and graft-versus-host-disease (6.25, 1.00–38.87, p = 0.05), immunosuppression (2.42, 1.03–5.68, p = 0.043), and parenteral nutrition (2.87, 1.44–5.71, p = 0.003). Non-albicans Candida were isolated in 58% BTC vs. 35% non-BTC (p = 0.005). 63% of 16 BTC occurring after 10-day fluconazole were non-susceptible (Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Candida norvegensis) vs. 19% of 21 BTC (C. glabrata) following shorter exposure (7.10, 1.60–31.30, p = 0.007). Median fluconazole MIC was 4 mg/l vs. 0.25 mg/l (p < 0.001). Ten-day fluconazole exposure predicted non-susceptible BTC with 73% accuracy.
Conclusions
Outcomes of BTC and non-BTC were similar. Fluconazole non-susceptible BTC occurred in three out of four cases after prolonged low-dose prophylaxis. This implies reassessment of prophylaxis duration and rapid de-escalation of empirical therapy in BTC after short fluconazole exposure."

Objective
New tests for diagnosing active tuberculosis (aTB) are urgently needed, and TB antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity can be expected to develop new testing methods of aTB.
Materials and methods
Rv0183 protein, the only monoglyceride lipase identified in mycobacteria, was used to stimulate freshly heparin-treated whole blood. The Rv0183-specific cytokines/chemokines response associated with aTB was screened firstly with 4 aTB patients and 4 LTBIs, and further evaluated in 192 suspected aTB patients and 372 healthy individuals.
Results
Out of 71 cytokines/chemokines, the response of IL-6 against Rv0183 protein was found to be associated with aTB. The Rv0183-specific IL-6 response was significantly higher in aTB patients (n = 128) than in those with non-TB lung disease (n = 64) and in healthy individuals (n = 327) (p < 0.0001), and not affected by latent TB infection. In IGRA+ suspected active TB patients, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of IL-6 response (with cutoff of 235.2 pg/ml) were 85.7%, 100%, 100% and 51.5% for diagnosing aTB, respectively. While in IGRA− ones, they were 87.5%, 80.5%, 60.9% and 95.0% with 174.2 pg/ml IL-6 response as cutoff, respectively.
Conclusions
These results clearly show that the Rv0183 antigen-specific IL-6 response has the potential to be used as an immune-diagnosis test for active TB in clinical practice."

Objectives
RECOMMEND (NCT02364284; D4280R00005) assessed treatment patterns and outcomes associated with initial antibiotic therapy (IAT; antibiotics received <48 h post-initiation of antibiotic therapy) in healthcare-associated infections across five countries.
Methods
Data from medical records of hospitalized patients aged ≥18 years with healthcare-associated complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) are presented. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified potential risk factors associated with IAT failure.
Results
Mean (SD) age was 68.7 (17.4) years (n = 408). In patients with microbiological documentation (357/408), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were most common (47.1%, 21.6% and 11.8%, respectively); 46.1% of patients had a multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogen isolated. Most patients received monotherapy IAT (72.5%). Mean IAT duration was 7.8 days. IAT failure, in-hospital mortality, and mortality 30-day post-discharge were 54.4%, 35.0% and 37.3%, respectively. IAT failure was associated with age, Deyo–Charlson comorbidity score, country, MDR status and ICU admission in the univariate analysis; and country and age in the multivariate analysis.
Conclusions
This study provides real-world insights into the high rates of IAT failure and morbidity observed in patients with cUTI. Further study is imperative to understand the epidemiology of cUTI, support appropriate IAT selection and management, and reduce the burden of this disease."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Historically considered to have very poor outcome, there is paucity of recent data regarding invasive mold infections (IMIs) of the central nervous system (CNS) in patients with hematologic cancer (HC) or stem cell transplantation (SCT).
Methods
We reviewed the records of HC patients and/or SCT recipients who were diagnosed with CNS IMIs (EORTC/MSG criteria) at MD Anderson Cancer Center (1/1/2000-6/31/2016). Risk factors for survival at day (d) 42 post diagnosis were assessed.
Results
We identified 40 such patients (16 with proven infection). The incidence density was 3.8 cases/100000 patient days and mortality remained stable throughout the study period. Most patients had active HC and neutropenia at diagnosis (95% and 53% respectively). Of the 25 patients with a microbiological diagnosis, Aspergillus spp and Mucorales accounted for 85% of cases. CNS IMIs were deemed to be secondary to hematogenous spread in 31 (77%), mostly (90%) fungal pneumonia. CNS lesions typically presented as solitary ring-enhancing abscesses in MRI (26; 65%). Most patients (34; 85%) received lipid AMB and were treated with combination therapy (33; 83%); Mortality 42d was 48%. In univariate analysis, lack of surgical drainage (p = 0.01), absence of giant cells (p = 0.01) and granulomas (p = 0.03) were associated with increased 42d mortality. In multivariate analysis, co-infection was associated with increased (p = 0.005), while steroid tapering was associated with decreased mortality (p = 0.01).
Conclusions
Although less lethal, improved outcome in these uncommon infections was related only to immune response in histopathology, steroid tapering and possibly surgical drainage. In a contemporary 16-year cohort of 40 patients with hematologic cancer and mold infections of Central Nervous System, 42-day mortality was 48%. Improved survival was related to immune response in histopathology, absence of co-infections, corticosteroid tapering and possibly surgical drainage."

To develop and validate a simple prognostic scoring system to predict the mortality risk during treatment in tuberculosis patients.
Methods
Using data from the CDC's Tuberculosis Genotyping Information Management System of TB patients in Texas reported from 01/2010 to 12/2016, age ≥ 15 years and having an outcome as “completed” or “died”, we developed and validated a prognostic mortality scoring system-based logistic regression beta-coefficients.
Results
The developmental and validation cohorts consisted of 3378 and 3377 patients, respectively. The score used 9 demographic and clinical characteristics, which are usually available at the patient's initial visits to a healthcare facility. Prognostic scores were categorized into three groups that predicted mortality: low-risk (<15 points), medium-risk (15–18 points), and high-risk (>18 points). The model had excellent discrimination and calibration with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 and 0.80, and a non-significant Hosmer–Lemeshow test P = 0.514 and P = 0.613 in the developmental and validation cohorts, respectively.
Conclusion
Our validated TB prognostic scoring system, which used demographic and clinical characteristics available at the patient's initial visits, can be a practical tool for health care providers to identify TB patients with high mortality risk so that appropriate treatment, medical supports and follow-up resources could be appropriately allocated."

Objectives
Rifampin was initially approved for the treatment of tuberculosis. Because of its low toxicity, broad-spectrum activity, and good bioavailability, rifampin is now commonly administered as combination antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of various infections caused by organisms other than mycobacteria. This review summarizes the most recent clinical studies on the use of rifampin combinations for treating four common non-mycobacterial infections: acute bacterial meningitis, infective endocarditis and bacteraemia, pneumonia, and biofilm-related infections.
Methods
We performed a literature search of clinical studies published in English from January 2005 to June 2016 using the PubMed database with the search terms “rifampin” with “meningitis” or “infective endocarditis and bacteraemia” or “pneumonia” or “prosthetic joint infections.
Results
Current evidence to support a rifampin combination therapy as a treatment for non-mycobacterial infections was largely based on in vitro/in vivo studies and non-comparable retrospective case series. Additionally, controlled clinical trials that directly compared outcomes resulting from rifampin treatment versus treatment without rifampin were limited.
Conclusions
Rifampin combination therapy appears promising for the treatment of non-mycobacterial infections. However, further definitive clinical trials are necessary to validate its use because the risk of adverse drug–drug interactions and of the emergence of rifampin resistance during treatment may outweigh the potential benefits."

Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic disease caused by Echinococcus granulosus (Eg) infection. Th9 cells are reported to be involved in the immune responses in CE patients. This study aims to investigate the role of TGF-β/Smad pathway in the regulation of Th9 cells in CE patients.
Methods
Using Western blot analysis, flow cytometry, qPCR, immunohistochemistry, ELISA and MTT assay, we measured the expression levels of TGF-β/Smad, PU.1, IRF-4, and IL-9 in CE patients.
Results
The levels of TGF-β, p-Samd3, PU.1 and IL-9 were elevated in the liver of CE patients. IL-9 and IL-9R expressions were also elevated in the infected liver tissue, and IL-9 level was positively correlated with the liver inflammation. The levels of IL-9, IL-4, TGF-β and IL-10 in the supernatant were also significantly increased after stimulating hepatic lymphocytes of CE patients with Eg antigen B. After blocking the TGF-β pathway signaling in vitro, PU.1 and IL-9 were obviously reduced.
Conclusions
IL-9 may aggravate the inflammatory response in the liver of CE patients. The TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway is activated, and the signaling pathway may promote the differentiation of Th9 cells and IL-9 expression in active CE patients."

Aerococcus urinae and Aerococcus sanguinicola cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) and antibiotic treatment recommendations are solely based on in vitro findings and limited clinical experience. Our objective was to investigate the effectiveness of different treatment strategies in aerococcal UTI through a prospective observational study.
Methods
Urine samples with aerococci were identified and patients were enrolled. The aerococci were subjected to Etests. Information on clinical symptoms, and the treatment given, was collected. Patients were interviewed after the conclusion of treatment to assess clinical cure and a control urine culture assessed the microbiological cure.
Results
Of 31,629 urine samples, 144 grew aerococci and fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 91 patients gave consent and the 72 patients with UTI were assessed for treatment outcome. 53 patients had A. urinae UTI, while 19 had A. sanguinicola UTI. Nitrofurantoin was most commonly prescribed, achieving clinical and microbiological success in 71/76% of cases of A. urinae UTI, and 42/50% of cases of A. sanguinicola UTI. Pivmecillinam achieved success in patients with A. urinae cystitis and ciprofloxacin in patients with pyelonephritis.
Conclusions
Our results support that nitrofurantoin is a valid option for the treatment of cystitis caused by A. urinae."

Objective
To assess impact of a topical decontamination regimen on rates of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) in intensively-treated haematology patients.
Methods
A historically-controlled cohort study was used to evaluate the effect of applying chlorhexidine or Octenisan® body washes and nasal Prontoderm® ointment for 5 days around the time of Hickman line insertion on the incidence of CRBSI and infection-free catheter time. Lines inserted during a 24 month period prior to implementation of the decolonisation regimen were compared with those inserted during a 12 month period after the intervention was applied.
Results
During the post-intervention period, 163 lines were inserted in 147 patients, compared to 303 lines in 242 patients in the pre-intervention period. CRBSI rates in treated and untreated patients respectively were 6.8 and 35.0 cases per 10,000 line-days by 21 days (p = 0.009), and 14.4 and 26.0 cases respectively per 10,000 line-days by 180 days (p = 0.025). The incidence rate of Staphylococcus aureus CRBSI in treated and untreated patients were 0.0 and 4.6 cases per 10,000 line-days respectively (p = 0.012). Multivariable Cox regression estimated an 81% probability (95% confidence interval 74%–85%) that a treated line develops a CRBSI later than an untreated line by 21 days post-insertion.
Conclusion
Implementation of this safe and effective topical decontamination regimen enhances routine CRBSI-prevention measures for haematology patients requiring central venous line insertion."

We studied prevalence, risk factors and concordance of vaginal and anal HPV infection and L1 seropositivity among female sex workers (FSW) in Amsterdam.
Methods
In 2016, FSW aged ≥18 years having a sexually transmitted infections (STI) consultation were invited to participate. Participation entailed taking vaginal and anal self-swabs. Demographics and sexual behaviour data were collected. HPV DNA was analysed using the SPF10-PCR-DEIA-LiPA25-system-v1. Serum was tested for HPV L1 antibodies using multiplex serology assays. Determinants of vaginal and anal high risk HPV (hrHPV) infection and L1 seropositivity were assessed with logistic regression analyses.
Results
We included 304 FSW; median age was 29 years (IQR 25–37). Vaginal and anal hrHPV prevalence were 46% and 55%, respectively. HrHPV L1 seropositivity was 37%. Vaginal-anal hrHPV concordance was strong, but no significant association between vaginal or anal hrHPV infection and seropositivity was found. Having had anal sexual contact was not associated with anal hrHPV infection (P = 0.119).
Discussion
Vaginal and anal hrHPV prevalence is high among FSW in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Promotion of HPV vaccination, preferably at the beginning of the sex (work) career, may be a useful prevention method against hrHPV infection and disease."

Streptococcal serology provides evidence of prior Group A Streptococcus (GAS) exposure, crucial to the diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. However, current tests, which measure anti-streptolysin-O and anti-DNaseB antibodies, are limited by false positives in GAS endemic settings, and incompatible methodology requiring the two tests to be run in parallel. The objective was to improve streptococcal serology by combining the novel GAS antigen, SpnA, with streptolysin-O and DNaseB in a contemporary, bead-based immunoassay.
Methods
Recombinant streptolysin-O, DNAseB and SpnA were conjugated to polystyrene beads with unique fluorescence positions so antibody binding to all three antigens could be detected simultaneously by cytometric bead array. Multiplex assays were run on sera collected in three groups: ARF; ethnically matched healthy children; and healthy adults.
Results
The ability of the antigens to detect a previous GAS exposure in ARF was assessed using the 80th centile of the healthy children group as cut-off (upper limit of normal). SpnA had the highest sensitivity at 88%, compared with 75% for streptolysin-O and 56% for DNaseB.
Conclusions
SpnA has favorable immunokinetics for streptococcal serology, and can be combined with anti-streptolysin-O and anti-DNaseB in a multiplex format to improve efficiency and accuracy."

The analysis of the potential impact of the meningococcal vaccines in asymptomatic carriers has become one of the key aspects in the evaluation of new vaccines and of their impact on disease control. An important step in this direction is provided by the analysis of the sequence variability and surface-exposure of the 4CMenB (Bexsero®) vaccine antigens, as well as the cross-reactivity of vaccine induced antibodies, in isolates from healthy carriers. The Spanish Reference Laboratory, in collaboration with the University Hospital Marqués de Valdecilla in Santander (Spain), carried out a meningococcal carrier survey between May 2010 and April 2012 (population aged 4 to 19 years). The present study was done on 60 meningococcal carrier strains representative of the overall strain panel obtained and compared to invasive strains isolated in Spain in the same time. We found quantifiable levels of fHbp and NHBA expression and immunologic cross-reactivity in 10% and 75% of analyzed carrier strains, respectively, so the potential impact of the 4CMenB vaccine on Spanish asymptomatic carrier strains is expected to be mediated by the NHBA antigen."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
(1–3)-ß-D-Glucan (BDG) is a marker for invasive fungal diseases (IFD). Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin preparations (IVIG) has been reported to lead to false positive BDG serum levels >80 pg/ml. The aim of the study was to determine the time interval between IVIG infusion and normalisation of BDG serum levels.
Methods
In 22 paediatric haemato-/oncologic patients, we analysed 92 BDG serum levels obtained within 4 weeks after IVIG administration (0.5 to 1 g/kg body weight), correlated them to 54 IVIG episodes and compared them to 76 BDG levels obtained in 29 patients without IVIG administration in the 4 weeks prior to BDG analyses (control group).
Results
BDG peak levels within 3 days after IVIG ranged from 21.47 to 660.38 (median 201.4) pg/ml. BDG serum levels at 7, 14 and 21 days (+/−1 day each) after IVIG infusion were significantly higher than BDG serum levels in the control group (p < 0.001 each). By days 7, 14, and 21 (+/−1 day each) after IVIG infusion, BDG serum levels have normalized (<80 pg/ml) in 64.0%, 76.5% and 100%, respectively.
Conclusions
IVIG administration leads to false positive BDG levels in the vast majority of patients. Elevated BDG levels may be detectable for more than two weeks after IVIG administration, while BDG levels normalized within 3 weeks in all patients. Therefore, BDG should not be used to diagnose IFD within three weeks after IVIG administration."

Objectives
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is a significant global public health concern due to rising diagnoses rates and antimicrobial resistance. Molecular combined with epidemiological data have been used to understand the distribution and spread of NG, as well as relationships between cases in sexual networks, but the public health value gained from these studies is unclear. We conducted a systematic review to examine how molecular epidemiological studies have informed understanding of sexual networks and NG transmission, and subsequent public health interventions.
Methods
Five research databases were systematically searched up to 31st March 2017 for studies that used sequence-based DNA typing methods, including whole genome sequencing, and linked molecular data to patient-level epidemiological data. Data were extracted and summarised to identify common themes.
Results
Of the 49 studies included, 82% used NG Multi-antigen Sequence Typing. Gender and sexual orientation were commonly used to characterise sexual networks that were inferred using molecular clusters; clusters predominantly of one patient group often contained a small number of isolates from other patient groups. Suggested public health applications included using these data to target interventions at specific populations, confirm outbreaks, and inform partner management, but these were mainly untested.
Conclusions
Combining molecular and epidemiological data has provided insight into sexual mixing patterns, and dissemination of NG, but few studies have applied these findings to design or evaluate public health interventions. Future studies should focus on the application of molecular epidemiology in public health practice to provide evidence for how to prevent and control NG."

Human papillomavirus (HPV) associated cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers and ranked as the eighth most common killer for Chinese women. A dozen of HPV vaccines are being developed in China without a solid China-specific distribution of carcinogenic HPV types, thus, we performed this systematic review to explore the China-specific spectrum of high-risk types causing cancer.
Methods
Studies on HPV infection among Chinese women were searched. All retrieved articles were screened and reviewed by a standardized algorithm. Distribution of carcinogenic HPV types and age-specific prevalence were analyzed using random-effects model.
Results
A total of 303 articles were included in the final analysis. The top 10 common HPV types detected in ICC patients, in descending order of frequency, were HPV 16 (62.5%), 18 (12.4%), 58 (8.6%), 52 (5.7%), 33 (4.6%), 31 (3.5%), 55 (2.4%), 68 (2.4%), 53 (2.2%) and 45 (2.0%) respectively. Similar spectrum was found in women with precancer. The prevalence of HPV infection peaked between 20 and 24 years with a rate of 24.3%, thereafter declined substantially and stabilized at middle-ages. Compared to women living in the developed provinces, the second peak was observed among women aged 45–55 years in less developed regions.
Conclusion
In general, the spectrum of HPV types in women with precancer/cancer and the pattern of age-specific prevalence were consistent with that of elsewhere worldwide. However, some distinguished characteristics could also be concluded, and these imprinting should be considered and integrated when developing vaccines and strategy for disease control in China."

abstract = "Summary
Introduction
Successful treatment of haematological malignancies is frequently complicated by Invasive Aspergillosis (IA), a life-threatening fungal infection that occurs in at least 10% of haemato-oncological patients. Case fatality rates (CFR) may fluctuate over time, depending on host pathogen interactions as well as on treatment and quality of patient care. We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of current – i.e. 2008-revised EORTC-MSG criteria era – incidence and case fatality rates (CFR) of IA in patients with haematological malignancy.
Methods
A systematic search according to PRISMA guidelines was performed to identify all literature reporting populations with a haematological malignancy and the incidence of IA, defined according to the EORTC/MSG 2008 criteria. Pooled cumulative incidences and CFR within 100 days were estimated using a random effects model for predefined patient populations and stratified by use of prophylaxis.
Results
The systematic literature search yielded 1285 publications of which n = 49 met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 16.815 patients were involved of which 1056 (6.3%) developed IA. IA risk ranged from 4% (during remission-induction, with prophylaxis) to 11% (during remission-induction, without prophylaxis). Antifungal prophylaxis was associated with a lower rate of IA, especially in the pre-HSCT population. The pooled CFR within 100 days was 29% (95% CI: 20–38%).
Discussion
This study confirms that IA is a relevant threat in the treatment of haematological cancer despite the universal use of antifungal prophylaxis. These outcomes inform scientists and other stakeholders about the current burden of IA and may be used to direct, implement and improve antifungal stewardship programs."

In our study, we conducted animal experiments and tested their pathogenicity in ducks, chickens and mice. Ducks can carry and shed the H5N6 HPAIVs, but show no ill effects. On the other hand, these H5N6 HPAIVs can efficiently infect, transmit and cause death in chickens. Due to the overlap of habitats, domestic ducks play an important role in circulating AIVs between poultry and wild birds. Our results raise the possibility that wild birds disseminate these H5N6 HPAIVs to poultry along their flyways and thus pose a great threat to the poultry industry. These viruses are also highly pathogenic to mice, suggesting they pose a potential threat to mammals and, thus, public health. One virus isolated in 2015 replicates much more efficiently and is more lethal in these animals than the two other viruses isolated in 2014. It seems that the H5N6 viruses tend to be more lethal as time passes. Therefore, it is necessary to vigilantly monitor H5N6 HPAIVs in wild birds and poultry."

Objectives
This study aimed to examine the previously unknown long-term spatio-temporal patterns in diarrheal morbidity and mortality across age groups and geography in Brazil under the light of evolving socioeconomic factors and interventions.
Methods
Nationwide mortality (1979–2014) and hospitalization (1998–2014) data were obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Analyses of long-term secular trends and seasonality of diarrheal morbidity and mortality were performed in EPIPOI (www.epipoi.info).
Results
For most states, the primary peak in mortality risk among children under 5 years occurred from December–April (summer/early autumn) from 1979–1988. From 2000–2005 (before the 2006 implementation of rotavirus vaccination), the pattern switched to June–October (winter/early spring). By 2007–2014, the peak in mortality shifted back towards summer/early autumn. A similar pattern was observed for hospitalizations. These patterns were particularly apparent in non-equatorial regions of the country. In contrast, the risk of diarrhea-related death among older children (5–19 years) did not demonstrate well-defined seasonality or spatial patterns.
Conclusions
Rotavirus vaccination policies were associated with a shift in the timing of seasonal peaks in children under 5, reminiscent of the summer diarrhea period common decades prior. Additionally, young children were shown to have distinct disease patterns compared to other age groups, suggesting different etiologies."

Definitive diagnosis of invasive candidiasis (IC) may be difficult to achieve in patients with haematological malignancy (PHM). We aimed to evaluate the performance of BDG for the diagnosis and the follow-up of IC in PHM.
Patients and methods
We retrospectively reviewed the serological data of BDG assay in adult and paediatric PHM, who developed candidemia or chronic disseminated candidiasis (CDC) through a 4-year period. Sensitivity and kinetics of BDG were determined for both clinical forms.
Results
In a panel of 3027 PHM, incidence rates of candidemia and CDC ranged between 0.74 and 0.77 and 0.30 and 0.44 according to the group of patients. At the time of diagnosis, 43.5% and 73% of cases of candidemia and CDC had a positive BDG assay, respectively. We found a significant correlation between the level of BDG at diagnosis and the outcome of candidemia (p = 0.022). In all cases of CDC, BDG negative results were obtained 2 to 6 months before recovery of the CT-scan lesions.
Conclusions
BDG exhibits a low sensitivity to detect IC in PHM, but its kinetics correlates the clinical outcome. Additional studies are warranted in patients with CDC to evaluate the interest of monitoring BDG levels to anticipate the discontinuation of antifungal maintenance therapy."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
The study assessed markers of renal health in HIV/HBV co-infected patients receiving TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy in Ghana.
Methods
Urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR) and albumin-to-protein ratio (uAPR) were measured cross-sectionally after a median of four years of TDF. At this time, alongside extensive laboratory testing, patients underwent evaluation of liver stiffness and blood pressure. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was measured longitudinally before and during TDF therapy.
Results
Among 101 participants (66% women, median age 44 years, median CD4 count 572 cells/mm3) 21% and 17% had detectable HIV-1 RNA and HBV DNA, respectively. Overall 35% showed hypertension, 6% diabetes, 7% liver stiffness indicative of cirrhosis, and 18% urinary excretion of Schistosoma antigen. Tubular proteinuria occurred in 16% of patients and was independently predicted by female gender and hypertension. The eGFR declined by median 1.8 ml/min/year during TDF exposure (IQR −4.4, −0.0); more pronounced declines (≥ 5 ml/min/year) occurred in 22% of patients and were associated with receiving ritonavir-boosted lopinavir rather than efavirenz. HBV DNA, HBeAg, transaminases, and liver stiffness were not predictive of renal function abnormalities.
Conclusions
The findings mandate improved diagnosis and management of hypertension and suggest targeted laboratory monitoring of patients receiving TDF alongside a booster in sub-Saharan Africa."

Objectives
The objectives were to determine the prevalence of colistin resistance in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, and to gain knowledge on the epidemiological and clinical features of the patients.
Methods
All colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae consecutively isolated from clinical samples in our institution from 2012 to 2015, were included in this cross-sectional study. Intrinsic-resistant species were excluded. Minimum inhibitory concentration was performed by gradient diffusion. Detection of plasmid-encoded colistin resistance genes mcr-1 and mcr-2 was performed by amplification. Epidemiological and clinical features were reviewed.
Results
Of 13579 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 91 were colistin-resistant. The overall prevalence of colistin resistance was 0.67%. The rates were higher in Enterobacter cloacae (4.2%) than Escherichia coli (0.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%). One third of the isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR). While mcr-2 was not detected, mcr-1 was detected only in E. coli. Regarding these infections, 23% were community-acquired. 89% of the patients had not received colistin previously. There were no significant differences between infections caused by mcr-1 and non-mcr-1-carrying isolates.
Conclusions
Colistin resistance was not restricted to MDR isolates and to clinical settings. Most patients had no record of previous administration of colistin."

KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-KP) has become a major public health challenge. Accordingly, this study sought to use a systematic review of the scientific literature to ascertain the mortality of KPC-KP infection, and analyze such mortality by country, year of publication, hospital ward, and type of interpretation used to define carbapenem resistance.
Methodology
A search without language restrictions was made of the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EBSCO, LILACS and EMBASE databases from 1996 through June 2017, to locate all studies which had determined the existence of KPC-KP infection. We then performed a meta-analysis of all studies that reported KPC-KP infection-related mortality, and analyzed mortality by subgroup in accordance with standard methodology.
Results
A total of 51 papers were included in the systematic review. From 2005 through 2017, data on KPC-KP infection were reported in 5124 patients, with an average of 465 patients per year. The most widely studied type of infection was bacteremia (28∙0%). The meta-analysis showed that overall mortality for the 37 studies was 41.0% (95%CI 37.0–44.0), with the highest mortality rates being observed in oncology patients, 56.0% (95%CI 38.1–73.0), and Brazil, 51.3% (95%CI 43.0–60.0).
Conclusion
KPC-KP infection-related mortality is high, is manifested differently in some countries, and is highest among oncology patients."

Objectives
To discuss what is presently known about recent mumps outbreaks and what solutions can be suggested to ensure more complete protection against mumps.
Methods
PubMed was used to search for all of the studies published over the last 15 years using the key words “mumps” or “mumps virus” or “mumps vaccine”. More than 1500 articles were found, but only those published in English or providing evidence-based data were included in the evaluation.
Results
Prevention of mumps remains an unsolved problem. Available vaccines are effective but the protection they evoke declines over time. The use of booster doses can control outbreaks but it is not precisely defined whether they can prevent them. The rapid decline of antibody levels could limit the impact of the introduction of a third dose in the recommended immunization schedule. Furthermore, in most of the areas, mumps viral strains that are genetically different from those included in the vaccines are emerging and this might favour vaccine escape. However, also for this problem, its real relevance in favouring outbreak development is not precisely defined.
Conclusions
The true reasons for the development of mumps outbreaks in people with very high vaccination coverage are not clearly understood. The use of a booster dose or the preparation of vaccines containing the emerging serotypes are possible solutions, but both have some limitations. Further studies mainly devoted to improve our knowledge of the immune response to mumps vaccines are needed before long-term effective mumps vaccines can be prepared and outbreaks can be avoided."

To determine the existence of autoantibodies against apolipoprotein A-1 (anti-apoA-1 IgG) in HIV patients and explore their association with biological features of HIV infection and different inflammatory biomarkers. We also evaluated their impact on CD4+ lymphocytes survival.
Methods
Anti-apoA-1 IgG plasma levels were assessed by ELISA in 237 HIV positive patients from a national prospective cohort with no current lipid-lowering therapy.
Results
58% of patients were found positive for anti-apoA-1 IgG and were associated with lower CD4+ counts, but higher viremia and systemic inflammation. Logistic regression analyses indicated that high anti-apoA-1 IgG levels were associated with a 16-fold increased risk of displaying low CD4+ levels, independent of HIV RNA levels and treatment (adjusted Odds ratio [OR]:16.1, 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]:1.80–143.6; p = 0.01), and a 6-fold increased risk of having a detectable viremia, independent of antiretroviral treatment (OR:5.47; 95% CI:1.63–18.36; p = 0.006). In vitro, anti-apoA-1 IgG induced dose and time-dependent CD4+ apoptosis that was increased by exposure to HIV RNA.
Conclusions
In HIV patients, anti-apoA-1 IgG levels are associated with low CD4+ counts, high viremia and a pro-inflammatory systemic profile. Anti-apoA-1 IgG can promote CD4+ lymphocyte apoptosis via undefined pathways."

Objectives
Typhoid fever caused by Salmonella Typhi remains a major burden worldwide. Gastrointestinal bleeding can be seen in up to 10 percent of patients and may be fatal. The coagulopathy, which may be the driver of this severe complication in patients with typhoid fever, however is ill defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activation of coagulation, anticoagulation, and fibrinolysis in patients with acute typhoid fever.
Methods
Parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis were measured in 28 hospitalized patients with culture-confirmed or PCR-confirmed typhoid fever and compared to 38 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers.
Results
Patients demonstrated activation of the coagulation system, as reflected by elevated in vitro thrombin generation and high plasma levels of fibrinogen, D-dimer and prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 in concert with consumption of coagulation factors resulting in a prolonged prothrombin-time and activated-partial-thromboplastin-time. Concurrently, the anticoagulant proteins, protein C and antithrombin, were significantly lower in comparison to healthy controls. Patients also demonstrated evidence of activation and inhibition of fibrinolysis and a marked activation of endothelial cells. The extent of coagulation activation was associated with the course of the disease, repeated testing during convalescence showed a return toward normal values.
Conclusions
Activation of coagulation is an important clinical feature of typhoid fever and is associated with severity of disease."

Combining a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone to beta-lactam regimens in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia is recommended by the international guidelines. However, the information in patients with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia is limited.
Methods
A propensity score technique was used to analyze prospectively collected data from all patients with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia admitted from 2000 to 2015 in our institution, who had received empirical treatment with third-generation cephalosporin in monotherapy or plus macrolide or fluoroquinolone.
Results
We included 69 patients in the monotherapy group and 314 in the combination group. After adjustment by PS for receiving monotherapy, 30-day mortality (OR 2.89; 95% CI 1.07–7.84) was significantly higher in monotherapy group. A higher 30-day mortality was observed in monotherapy group in both 1:1 and 1:2 matched samples although it was statistically significant only in 1:2 sample (OR: 3.50 (95% CI 1.03–11.96), P = 0.046).
Conclusions
Our study suggests that in bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia, empirical therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone is associated with a lower mortality rate than beta-lactams in monotherapy. These results support the recommendation of combination therapy in patients requiring admission with moderate to severe disease."

Objectives
Carriers of Neisseria meningitidis are a key source of transmission. In the African meningitis belt, where risk of meningococcal disease is highest, a greater understanding of meningococcal carriage dynamics is needed.
Methods
We randomly selected an age-stratified sample of 400 residents from 116 households in Bamako, Mali, and collected pharyngeal swabs in May 2010. A month later, we enrolled all 202 residents of 20 of these households (6 with known carriers) and collected swabs monthly for 6 months prior to MenAfriVac vaccine introduction and returned 10 months later to collect swabs monthly for 3 months. We used standard bacteriological methods to identify N. meningitidis carriers and fit hidden Markov models to assess acquisition and clearance overall and by sex and age.
Results
During the cross-sectional study 5.0% of individuals (20/400) were carriers. During the longitudinal study, 73 carriage events were identified from 1422 swabs analyzed, and 16.3% of individuals (33/202) were identified as carriers at least once. The majority of isolates were non-groupable; no serogroup A carriers were identified.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that the duration of carriage with any N. meningitidis averages 2.9 months and that males and children acquire and lose carriage more frequently in an urban setting in Mali. Our study informed the design of a larger study implemented in seven countries of the African meningitis belt."

We explored if HIV infection is associated with impaired T-Helper 17 responses against Streptococcus pneumoniae in the lung.
Methods
We recruited 30 HIV-uninfected healthy controls, 23 asymptomatic HIV-infected adults not on ART, and 40 asymptomatic HIV-infected adults on ART (Median time 3.5yrs), in whom we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. We measured alveolar CD4+ T cell immune responses following stimulation with pneumococcal cell culture supernatant using flow cytometry-based intracellular cytokine staining.
Results
We found that the proportion of alveolar CD4+ T cells producing IL-17A following stimulation with pneumococcal cell culture supernatant (CCS) was similar between HIV-uninfected controls and ART-naïve HIV-infected adults (0.10% vs. 0.14%; p = 0.9273). In contrast, the proportion and relative absolute counts of CD4+ T cells producing IL-17A in response to pneumococcal CCS were higher in ART-treated HIV-infected adults compared HIV-uninfected controls (0.22% vs. 0.10%, p = 0.0166; 5420 vs. 1902 cells/100 ml BAL fluid; p = 0.0519). The increase in relative absolute numbers of IL-17A-producing alveolar CD4+ T cells in ART-treated individuals was not correlated with the peripheral blood CD4+ T cell count (r=–0.1876, p = 0.1785).
Conclusion
Alveolar Th17 responses against S. pneumoniae are preserved in HIV-infected adults. This suggests that there are other alternative mechanisms that are altered in HIV-infected individuals that render them more susceptible to pneumococcal pneumonia."

The primary objective of this work was to examine the acquisition and spread of multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) in Ireland.
Methods
All available Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates (n = 42), from MDR-TB cases diagnosed in Ireland between 2001 and 2014, were analysed using phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing, Mycobacterial-Interspersed-Repetitive-Units Variable-Number Tandem-Repeat (MIRU-VNTR) genotyping, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
Results
The lineage distribution of the MDR-TB isolates comprised 54.7% Euro-American, 33.3% East Asian, 7.2% East African Indian, and 4.8% Indo-Oceanic. A significant association was identified between the East Asian Beijing sub-lineage and the relative risk of an isolate being MDR. Over 75% of MDR-TB cases were confirmed in non-Irish born individuals and 7 MIRU-VNTR genotypes were identical to clusters in other European countries indicating cross-border spread of MDR-TB to Ireland. WGS data provided the first evidence in Ireland of in vivo microevolution of MTBC isolates from drug-susceptible to MDR, and from MDR to extensively-drug resistant (XDR). In addition, they found that the katG S315T isoniazid and rpoB S450L rifampicin resistance mutations were dominant across the different MTBC lineages.

Our molecular epidemiological analyses identified the spread of MDR-TB to Ireland from other jurisdictions and its potential to evolve to XDR-TB."

Reversion of tuberculosis (TB) infection testing has been suggested to be associated with prophylactic treatment efficacy. However, evidences based on randomized controlled study were sparse.
Methods
Studies on serial QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) test, among individuals with and without prophylactic treatment were identified in the databases of PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 28 February 2018. The reversion rates were quantitatively summarized by means of meta-analysis using the random-effect model.
Results
A total of 52 eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis on QFT test reversion rate among participants with (20 studies) and without (32 studies) prophylactic treatment. Summarized reversion rate was found to be 24.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.4–32.9%) and 25.3% (95% CI: 19.6–32.0%) for those completed or without treatment, respectively. When the analysis was restricted to the participants completed treatment, higher summarized rate of QFT reversion was found among those with longer course therapy (9INH vs. the other regimens), studies from Asia (vs. Europe and America), and individuals with immunosuppression disorders (vs. general populations).
Conclusions
Our results suggested that QFT reversion was frequently observed regardless of with or without prophylactic treatment. Serial QFT testing might be inappropriate for evaluating preventive treatment efficacy."

The goal of the GMI is to prevent meningococcal disease worldwide through education, research, and co-operation. The Chinese GMI roundtable meeting was held in June 2017. The GMI met with local experts to gain insight into the meningococcal disease burden in China and current prevention and vaccination strategies in place. China experienced five epidemics of serogroup A meningococcal disease (MenA) between 1938 and 1977, with peak incidence of 403/100,000 recorded in 1967. MenA incidence rates have significantly declined following the universal introduction of the MenA polysaccharide vaccine in China in the 1980s. Further, surveillance data indicates changing meningococcal epidemiology in China with the emergence of new clones of serogroup B from serogroup C clonal complex (cc) 4821 due to capsular switching, and the international spread of serogroup W cc11. The importance of carriage and herd protection for controlling meningococcal disease was highlighted with the view to introduce conjugate vaccines and serogroup B vaccines into the national immunization schedule. Improved disease surveillance and standardized laboratory techniques across and within provinces will ensure optimal epidemiological monitoring."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) and clindamycin are frequently prescribed to treat cellulitis. The primary objective was to determine if weight-based dosing of these antibiotics is associated with better outcomes in cellulitis. The secondary objective was to assess variables associated with clinical failure among hospitalized patients with cellulitis with or without cutaneous abscess.
Methods
This multi-center retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2010 to September 4, 2014. Adult patients admitted for cellulitis who received a minimum of seven days of therapy and discharged on oral clindamycin or TMP/SMX were included. Binary univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for clinical failure, including the impact of dose adequacy of clindamycin and TMP/SMX on clinical outcomes.
Results
A total of 208 cases met inclusion criteria. Of these cases, 120 (57.7%) received inadequate dosing of clindamycin (<10 mg/kg/day) or TMP/SMX (<5 mg TMP/kg per day) while 88 (42.3%) received adequate dosing. Clinical failure occurred in 36/120 (30%) and 15/88 (17%) of patients receiving inadequate and adequate doses, respectively (p = 0.032). Upon univariate analysis length of stay ≥ 7 days (OR = 2.96, p = 0.046) and inadequate dosing (OR = 2.09, p = 0.034) were associated with clinical failure. Upon multivariate analysis, inadequate dosing was independently associated with clinical failure (OR = 2.01, p = 0.032).
Conclusion
Inadequate dosing of clindamycin and TMP/SMX is independently associated with clinical failure in patients hospitalized with cellulitis. Further prospective studies evaluating weight-based dosing of clindamycin and TMP/SMX in the setting of cellulitis are warranted."

Shigella species are the third most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States. During a Shigella sonnei outbreak in Oregon from July 2015 through June 2016, Shigella cases spread among homeless persons with onset of the wettest rainy season on record.
Methods
We conducted time series analyses using Poisson regression to determine if a temporal association between precipitation and shigellosis incidence existed. Models were stratified by housing status.
Results
Among 105 infections identified, 45 (43%) occurred in homeless persons. With increasing precipitation, cases increased among homeless persons (relative risk [RR] = 1.36 per inch of precipitation during the exposure period; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17–1.59), but not among housed persons (RR = 1.04; 95% CI 0.86–1.25).
Conclusions
Heavy precipitation likely contributed to shigellosis transmission among homeless persons during this outbreak. When heavy precipitation is forecast, organizations working with homeless persons could consider taking proactive measures to mitigate spread of enteric infections."

To discuss the role of gut dysbiosis in the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the impact of probiotics as a potential therapeutic measure.
Methods
PubMed was used to search for all of the studies published over the last 15 years using the key words: “irritable bowel syndrome” and “gut dysbiosis” or “probiotic”. More than 800 articles were found, but only those published in English or providing evidence-based data were included in the evaluation.
Results
IBS is a common disease for which no resolutive therapy is presently available. In recent years, strong evidence of a possible relationship between modifications of the gut microbiota composition and development of IBS has been collected. Moreover, the evidence showed that attempts to treat acute infectious and post-antibiotic gastroenteritis with some probiotics were significantly effective in a great number of patients, leading many experts to suggest the use of probiotics to address all of the clinical problems associated with IBS.
Conclusion
The available data are promising, but presently, a precise definition of which probiotic or which mixture of probiotics is effective cannot be made. Moreover, the dose and duration of treatment has not been established. Finally, we do not know whether probiotic treatment should be different according to the type of IBS. Further studies are needed before probiotics can be considered a reliable treatment for IBS."

Objectives
The bacterial pathogen Neisseria meningitidis is able to escape the currently available capsule-based vaccines by undergoing capsule switching. In this study, we investigated whether capsule switching has occurred in a recently emerged sequence type (ST) 7 serogroup X isolate in China, for which currently no vaccine is available.
Methods
To identify capsule switching breakpoints, the capsule locus and flanking regions of the ST-7 serogroup X isolate and three endemic ST-7 serogroup A isolates were sequenced and compared. To obtain further insight into capsule switching frequency and length of DNA fragments involved, capsule switching assays were performed using genomic DNA containing combinations of antibiotic selection markers at various locations in the capsule locus and flanking regions.
Results
Sequence analyses showed that capsule switching has occurred and involved a 8450 bp serogroup X DNA fragment spanning the region from galE to ctrC. Capsule switching assays indicate that capsule switching occurs at a frequency of 6.3 × 10−6 per bacterium per μg of DNA and predominantly involved DNA fragments of about 8.1–9.6 kb in length.
Conclusions
Our results show that capsule switching in N. meningitidis occurs at high frequency and involves recombination in the flanking regions of the capsule biosynthesis genes."

Objective
To study whether genetic variation in coagulation and fibrinolysis genes contributes to cerebrovascular complications in bacterial meningitis.
Methods
We performed a nationwide prospective genetic association study in adult community-acquired bacterial meningitis patients. The exons and flanking regions of 16 candidate genes involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways were sequenced. We analyzed whether genetic variation in these genes resulted in a higher risk of cerebrovascular complications, unfavorable outcome and differences in thrombocyte count on admission.
Results
From 2006 to 2011, a total of 1101 bacterial meningitis patients were identified of whom 622 supplied DNA for genotyping and passed genetic quality control steps. In 139 patients (22%) the episode of bacterial meningitis was complicated by cerebral infarction, and 188 (30%) had an unfavorable outcome. We identified the functional variant rs494860 in the protein Z (PROZ) gene as our strongest association with occurrence of cerebral infarction (odds ratio (OR) 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.33–0.73), p = 5.2 × 10−4). After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing no genetic variant was significantly associated (p-value threshold 2.7 × 10−4).
Conclusion
Our study suggests a functional genetic variation in the PROZ gene, rs494860, may be of importance in bacterial meningitis pathogenesis and cerebral infarction risk. Replication of this finding in other cohort studies populations is needed."

Rotavirus (RV) is highly endemic inside and outside hospital-settings. Immunocompromised children and adults are at risk of complicated rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE), but general rotavirus disease severity in this group remains poorly described and rotavirus testing is not routinely performed beyond infancy. We assessed rotavirus disease among immunocompromised hospitalized patients.
Methods
Rotavirus infections at a Dutch tertiary-care centre were identified from 5-year laboratory records. Rotavirus disease course was evaluated by chart review for each immunocompromised patient. In a matched case-control analysis, we assessed whether being immunocompromised predisposed to RVGE. Rotavirus testing practice for suspected infectious gastroenteritis in our hospital was determined over a 3-years period.
Results
Out of 4584 RV tests performed, 294 were positive among hospitalized patients. Immunocompromised patients represented 57% (N = 20) of adult, and 12% (N = 32) of paediatric RVGE. A complicated disease course occurred in 81% of them and 33% required adaptations in underlying disease management. Immunocompromised adults were 7.4 times more likely todevelop RVGE compared to non-immunocompromised matched hospital-controls. Rotavirus testing in adult patients with suspected infectious gastroenteritis was uncommon (12% tested).
Conclusions
In our hospital, most adults with RVGE are immunocompromised compared to a much smaller proportion in children. RVGE in immunocompromised patients is associated with significant morbidity. Routine rotavirus testing beyond infancy should be recommended for immunocompromised patients with suspected infectious gastroenteritis."

Objectives
The aim of this study was to present a 15-year experience and provide a comprehensive analysis of a large cohort of patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa osteomyelitis.
Methods
We reviewed the medical records of patients admitted to a large French university hospital for P. aeruginosa osteomyelitis over a 15-year period. Patient outcome was assessed at follow-up after at least six months.
Results
Sixty-seven patients were included, comprising 57% with chronic osteomyelitis. Polymicrobial infection was predominant (63%), and an infected device was involved in 39% patients. The overall treatment success rate was 79.1%. All but one patient were treated with a combination of surgery and antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic treatment had a mean duration of 45 days (range, 21–90 days). Single-antibiotic therapy was preferred in nearly all cases. Treatment failure was reported for 14 (21%) patients and was due to the persistence of P. aeruginosa in four cases. No significant risk factor for treatment failure was identified, especially when treatment strategies were compared.
Conclusions
We advocate optimal surgical debridement combined with initial parenteral antibiotics for a maximum of 15 days, followed by an oral fluoroquinolone. Total treatment duration should not exceed six weeks, and antibiotic treatment with two-drug combinations does not seem necessary."

Objectives
Direct-Acting Antivirals (DAAs) opened a new era in HCV treatment. We report the impact of HCV treatment in French HIV-HCV coinfected patients.
Methods
All HIV-HCV patients from the Dat'AIDS cohort followed between 2012 and 2015 were included. HCV status was defined yearly as naive, spontaneous cure, sustained virological response (SVR12), failure or reinfection.
Results
Among 32,945 HIV-infected patients, 15.2% were positive for anti-HCV antibodies. From 2012 to 2015, HCV incidence rate increased from 0.35%PY to 0.69%PY in MSM, while median incidence was 0.08%PY in other patients. Median reinfection rate was 2.56%PY in MSM and 0.22%PY in other patients. HCV treatment initiation rate rose from 8.2% in 2012 to 29.6% (48.0% in pre-treated patients vs 22.6% in naïve patients). SVR12 rate increased from 68.7% to 95.2%. By the end of 2015, 62.7% of the patients were cured either spontaneously or following SVR.
Conclusions
HCV treatment dramatically increased in HIV-HCV patients in France from 2012 to 2015 resulting in HCV cure in nearly two-thirds of the patients in this cohort. Combined with a declining HCV prevalence, the prevalence of active HCV infection among HIV patients will drastically decrease in the forthcoming years."

Background
HIV-associated incidence and prognosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis (CTX) is not well established during later years.
Methods
From the Danish HIV Cohort Study, we identified 6325 HIV-infected individuals. We assessed incidence, mortality, predictive and prognostic factors of CTX during the pre-combination antiretroviral therapy (pre-cART; 1995–1996) and cART-era (1997–2014). Adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR), mortality rate ratios (aMRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were assessed using Poisson regression analysis.
Results
CTX IR was 1.17/1000 PYR (95% CI 0.93–1.47). We observed no change in CTX-risk in the first year after HIV-diagnosis, but a substantial reduction in mortality in the first 3 months after CTX diagnosis when comparing the cART-era to the pre-cART-era; {(aIRR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.37–1.72) (aMRR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.06–0.38)}. For individuals surviving the first year after HIV-diagnosis or the first 3 months after CTX-diagnosis, IRR and MRR had declined to minimal levels {(aIRR: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.03–0.10); (aMRR: 0.02; 95% CI: 0.01–0.05)}. Three years after CTX-diagnosis 30% of the patients still had neurological deficits.
Conclusion
Although, CTX remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the cART-era, with high prevalence of neurological sequelae, incidence and mortality has largely declined, especially among those surviving the first year after diagnosis."

The Global Meningococcal Initiative (GMI) has recently considered current issues in Middle Eastern and African countries, and produced two recommendations: (i) that vaccination of attendees should be considered for some types of mass-gathering events, as some countries mandate for the Hajj, and (ii) vaccination of people with human immunodeficiency virus should be used routinely, because of increased meningococcal disease (MD) risk. Differences exist between Middle Eastern and African countries regarding case and syndrome definitions, surveillance, and epidemiologic data gaps. Sentinel surveillance provides an overview of trends and prevalence of different capsular groups supporting vaccine selection and planning, whereas cost-effectiveness decisions require comprehensive disease burden data, ideally counting every case. Surveillance data showed importance of serogroup B MD in North Africa and serogroup W expansion in Turkey and South Africa. Success of MenAfriVac® in the African “meningitis belt” was reviewed; the GMI believes similar benefits may follow development of a low-cost meningococcal pentavalent vaccine, currently in phase 1 clinical trial, by 2022. The importance of carriage and herd protection for controlling invasive MD and the importance of advocacy and awareness campaigns were also highlighted."

Objective
Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due to association of diseases with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Diagnosis continues to be a clinical challenge as microbiological confirmation is rare and time consuming resulting in delayed treatment. Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a rapid and simple test, which has been endorsed by World Health Organization as an initial diagnostic test for the diagnosis of TBM. However, evidence still lacks for its performance on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the diagnosis of TBM especially from India.
Methods
A total of 267 CSF samples from patients with high clinico-radiological suspicion of TBM were included in this study. Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) staining, BACTEC Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT-960) culture system, and Xpert MTB/RIF assay (using cartridge version G4) were tested on all samples.
Results
Of total 267 samples, all were negative for smear AFB and 52 (19.5%) were culture positive by MGIT-960 culture system. However, out of 52 (19.5%) cultures detected positive by MGIT-960, 5 (9.6%) were detected as resistant to rifampicin. Xpert MTB/RIF assay was positive in 38 (14.2%) samples and negative in 223 (83.5%) samples. Cartridge error was detected in 6 (2.2%) samples, which could not be repeated due to insufficient sample volume. The sensitivity and specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF assay in comparison to MGIT-960 was 55.1% (95%, CI: 40.2–69.3) and 94.8% (95%, CI: 90.9–97.4) respectively. Overall, Xpert MTB/RIF assay detected 38 (14.2%) as positive for MTB of which 4 (10.5%), 31 (81.6%) and 3 (7.9%) were found to be rifampicin resistant, sensitive and indeterminate respectively.
Conclusion
Xpert MTB/RIF assay showed lower sensitivity as compared to MGIT 960 culture for the diagnosis of TBM from CSF samples."

abstract = "Summary
Cholera is an acute secretory diarrhoeal infection caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It is likely to have originated in the Indian sub-continent; however, it spread to cause six worldwide pandemics between 1817–1923. The ongoing seventh worldwide pandemic of cholera began in 1961. The intensity, duration and severity of cholera epidemics have been increasing, signaling the need for more effective control and prevention measures. The response to the cholera pandemics of the 19th century led to the development of safe and effective sanitation and water systems which have effectively removed the risk of cholera in many settings. However, such systems are not in place to protect billions of people worldwide. Although some progress has been made in expanding access to water in recent years, achieving optimal infrastructure will, in the most optimistic scenario, take decades. Climate change, extreme weather events and rapid urbanisation suggests that alternatives to the current paradigm of providing large centralised water and sanitation systems should be considered, including smaller decentralised systems. The aim of this review paper is to provide an overview of current knowledge regarding management of cholera with a focus on prevention measures including vaccination and water and sanitation interventions."

Objectives
The diagnosis of typhoid fever is a challenge. Aiming to develop a typhoid diagnostic we measured antibody responses against Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) protein antigens and the Vi polysaccharide in a cohort of Bangladeshi febrile patients.
Methods
IgM against 12 purified antigens and the Vi polysaccharide was measured by ELISA in plasma from patients with confirmed typhoid fever (n = 32), other confirmed infections (n = 17), and healthy controls (n = 40). ELISAs with the most specific antigens were performed on plasma from 243 patients with undiagnosed febrile disease.
Results
IgM against the S. Typhi protein antigens correlated with each other (rho > 0.8), but not against Vi (rho < 0.6). Typhoid patients exhibited higher IgM against 11/12 protein antigens and Vi than healthy controls and those with other infections. Vi, PilL, and CdtB exhibited the greatest sensitivity and specificity. Specificity and sensitivity was improved when Vi was combined with a protein antigen, generating sensitivities and specificities of 0.80 and >0.85, respectively. Applying a dynamic cut-off to patients with undiagnosed febrile disease suggested that 34–58% had an IgM response indicative of typhoid.
Conclusions
We evaluated the diagnostic potential of several S. Typhi antigens; our assays give good sensitivity and specificity, but require further assessment in differing patient populations."

Background
To understand the epidemiology and disease burden of norovirus (NoVs) gastroenteritis in China, a systematic review was conducted.
Methods
Studies on acute gastroenteritis (AGE) caused by NoVs from mainland China, published before 2017 were searched. All retrieved articles were screened and reviewed by a standardized algorithm. NoVs detection rates as well as strain variations by ages, seasonal variations and geographic locations were analyzed using random-effects model.
Results
A total of 225 articles were included in the final analysis. Similar detection rates at 21.0% and 19.8% were obtained from the North and the South, respectively. NoVs infection occurred year round, with a peak between October and January in the North and between August and November in the South. High detection rates (∼29%) of NoVs were found in adults and the elderly and in children aged 6–35 months (∼22%). The predominant strains were GII.4 (70.4%), followed by GII.3 (13.5%).
Conclusion
NoVs cause significant disease burden in China which warrants development of vaccines against NoVs, particularly for children and the elderly who are vulnerable to gastroenteritis diseases. To achieve a broad protection, continual monitoring NoV epidemics and strain variations for selection of proper vaccine strains is critical."

Objectives
Biologic agents are used against rheumatic diseases, however, they increase the risk of developing severe infections and diseases such as tuberculosis. We aimed to determine the benefits of IP-10 detection to diagnose latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases on different immunosuppressive drug regimens, and compare these results with IFN-γ detection.
Materials and methods
We included 64 patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. We used QuantiFERON Gold In-Tube (QFN-G-IT) and T-SPOT.TB to detect IFN-γ production, and an in-house ELISA for IP-10 detection from the previous QFN-G-IT stimulated samples. We assessed the combined use of IFN-γ release assays (IGRAs) and IP-10 test, and analyzed the influence of immunotherapy on the tests performance.
Results
We obtained 34.9% positive results by T-SPOT.TB, 25.0% by QFN-G-IT and 31.3% by IP-10 test. The combined use of IGRAs and IP-10 detection increased significantly the amount of positive results (p < 0.0001). Treatment intake had no significant effect on in vitro tests (p > 0.05).
Conclusions
IP-10 and IFN-γ detection is comparable and their combined use could increase the number of positive results in the diagnosis of LTBI in rheumatic patients. The tested assays were not influenced by rheumatoid immunosuppressive therapy. Thus, IP-10 could be of use in the development of new and improved LTBI diagnostic tools."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
Candidaemia is a life-threatening infectious disease, associated with septic shock, multiple organ failure, and a high mortality rate. In France, reported data on the incidence of ICU-acquired candidaemia and the causative Candida species are scarce. The objective of this study was to determine temporal trends in epidemiology and risk factors of intensive care unit-acquired candidaemia (ICU-Cand) and ICU mortality among a very large population of ICU patients.
Method
Demographics, patient risk factors, invasive device exposure and nosocomial infection in ICU patient were collected from 2004 to 2013 in a national network of 213 ICUs: REA-RAISIN. Incidence and risk factors for candidaemia and ICU mortality were assessed.
Results
Out of 246,459 ICU patients, 851 developed an ICU-cand, representing 0.3 per 1000 patients-days. The incidence rose sharply over time. Candida albicans was the main species. The overall and ICU mortality was 52.4% in ICU-cand patients. The main risk factors of ICU-cand were length of stay, severity of illness and antimicrobial therapy at ICU admission, immune status and use of invasive procedure. ICU-cand was an independent risk factor of mortality (OR: 1.53; 95%CI [1.40–1.70]); in a sub-group analysis, independent effects on mortality were observed with C. albicans (OR: 1.45 [1.23–1.71]), Candida tropicalis (OR: 2.11 [1.31–3.39]) and “other” Candida species (OR: 1.64 [1.09–2.45]).
Conclusion
ICU candidaemia ranked sixth among bloodstream infections, and its average annual incidence was 0.3 per 1000 patients days. Despite of new therapy and international recommendation, the incidence rose sharply during the study period, and ICU mortality remained high."

Fungal infections largely caused by Candida species are responsible for a significant disease burden in neonates and invasive candidiasis in hospitalised neonates has high associated morbidity and mortality. Early initiation of antifungal treatment improves outcome but the recognition and diagnosis of systemic fungal infection in this population is difficult due to the non-specific clinical presentation and the high false negative rate of cultures. There is a need for a practical, sensitive and rapid diagnostic test to enhance identification and early treatment. Serum detection of (1,3)-β-d-glucan and Candida PCR are promising candidates but at present limited data exists for their use in the neonatal intensive care setting. Until such investigations are validated, early initiation of antifungal treatment on the basis of risk factor profile and clinical features remains the safest practical approach."

We investigated the clinical characteristics and risk factors for mortality in adults with persistent candidemia.
Methods
All patients ≥18 years old with candidemia in two Korean tertiary hospitals from 2007 to 2014 were investigated. Persistent candidemia was defined as isolation of the same Candida species ≥5 days after initiation of antifungal therapy. Non-persistent candidemia was defined as candidemia persisting for ≤3 days after initiation of antifungal therapy.
Results
Candida tropicalis (29.2%) was the most common pathogen in persistent candidemia, and Candida albicans (35.9%) was the most common in non-persistent candidemia. Central venous catheter (CVC) (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.05–3.78; P = 0.034), longer hospital stay (OR 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01–1.02; P = 0.025), and severe sepsis (OR 2.25; 95% CI, 1.11–4.56; P = 0.024) were independent risk factors for persistent candidemia.

abstract = "Summary
Introduction
Determining the cause of eosinophilia in patients returning from the tropics continues to present a diagnostic challenge. The history, symptoms and degree of eosinophilia are often poor predictors of eventual diagnosis, but helminths are an important cause. The current British Infection Association recommendations use travel history to guide investigation of eosinophilia. However the global burden of helminth disease and travel patterns have changed over the last 3 decades and guidelines based on previous epidemiology need to be reviewed in the light of current data.
Methods
Consecutive patients presenting with, or referred for, investigation of eosinophilia were identified prospectively. Case notes, laboratory results and electronic records were reviewed for demographic and clinical data. Patients with an eosinophil count ≥0.50 × 109/L were included, and grouped based on lifetime history of travel to: West Africa, elsewhere in Africa, and the rest of the world. Results were compared to published data from 1997 to 2002 collected at the same centre.
Results
Of 410 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 407 had a documented travel history. Average yearly referrals for eosinophilia fell from 58 per year between 1997 and 2002, to 33 per year (2002–2015). The proportion of eosinophilia cases diagnosed with a parasitic cause fell from 64% to 50%, and yields for all parasitological investigations fell, the largest reduction in stool microscopy (20% yield to 9%) and day bloods for microfilariae (14% yield to 3%). Strongyloides stercoralis was the commonest diagnosis overall in our cohort, accounting for 50% of the total parasites diagnosed, and was present in 38% of patients from West Africa, 19% from rest of Africa, and 34% from rest of world; a relative increase compared to previous data. Schistosomiasis is slightly less common in those who had travelled to West Africa than the rest of Africa, and overall point prevalence has fallen from 33% (1997–2002) to 17% (2002–2015). Travellers were significantly less likely than patients who had immigrated to the UK to be diagnosed with any parasite (OR 0.54 95% CI 0.378–0.778 p = 0.0009).
Discussion
A parasitic cause will still be found in half of people returning from the tropics with an eosinophilia, but we observed a fall in the overall prevalence of parasitic diagnoses when compared with the earlier data. This may, in part, be explained by the impact of control programmes on the prevalence of parasites globally, especially filarial disease. S. stercoralis now represents the majority of parasites diagnosed in our cohort from all continents. We identified significantly higher rates of strongyloidiasis in immigrants than returning travellers. Despite the falling yields of stool microscopy and filarial serology the current guidelines based on travel history remain relevant with adequate yield."

Children suffer a huge and often underappreciated burden of disease in tuberculosis (TB) endemic countries. Major hurdles include limited awareness among health care workers, poor integration of TB into maternal and child health approaches, diagnostic difficulties and a lack of child-friendly treatment options. Accurate disease diagnosis is particularly difficult in young and vulnerable children who tend to develop paucibacillary disease and are unable to produce an expectorated sputum sample. In addition, access to chest radiography is problematic in resource-limited settings. Differentiating between TB exposure and M. tuberculosis infection, and especially between M. tuberculosis infection and TB disease is crucial to guide clinical management. TB represents a dynamic continuum from well-contained “latent” infection to incipient and ultimately severe disease. The clinical spectrum of disease in children is broad and can be confused with a myriad of common infections. We provide a pragmatic 4-step approach to diagnose intra-thoracic TB in children and demonstrate how classifying clinical, radiological and laboratory findings into recognised clinical syndromes may provide a more refined diagnostic approach, even in resource-limited settings."

To investigate the viral genetic evolution, spatial origins and patterns of transmission of HIV-1 subtype B in Shanghai, China.
Methods
A total of 242 Shanghai subtype B and 1519 reference pol sequences were subjected to phylogenetic inference and genetic transmission network analyses.
Results
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that subtype B strains circulating in Shanghai were genetically diverse and closely associated with viral sequence lineages in Beijing (76 of 242 [31.4%]), Central China (Henan/Hebei/Hunan/Hubei) (43 of 242 [17.8%]), Chinese Taiwan (20 of 242 [8.3%]), Japan (6 of 242 [2.5%]), and Korea (7 of 242 [2.9%]), suggesting multiple introductions into Shanghai from mainland China and Taiwan, Japan, and Korea. Interestingly, a monophyletic Shanghai lineage (SH-L) (36 of 242 [14.9%]) of HIV-1 subtype B most likely originated from an Argentine strain, transferred through Liaoning infected individuals. In-depth analyses of 195 Shanghai subtype B sequences revealed that a total of 37.9% (n = 74) sequences contributed to 35 transmission networks, whereof 33.8% (n = 25) of the sequences associated with infected individuals from other provinces.
Conclusions
Our new findings reflect the evolution complexity and transmission dynamics of HIV-1 subtype B in Shanghai, which would provide critical information for the design of effective prevention measures against HIV transmission."

Objectives
A biomarker indicating successful tuberculosis (TB) therapy would assist in determining appropriate length of treatment. This study aimed to determine changes in mycobacteria-specific antigen-induced cytokine biomarkers in patients receiving therapy for latent or active TB, to identify biomarkers potentially correlating with treatment success.
Methods
A total of 33 adults with active TB and 36 with latent TB were followed longitudinally over therapy. Whole blood stimulation assays using mycobacteria-specific antigens (CFP-10, ESAT-6, PPD) were done on samples obtained at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 9 months. Cytokine responses (IFN-γ, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-10, IL-13, IP-10, MIP-1β, and TNF-α) in supernatants were measured by Luminex xMAP immunoassay.
Results
In active TB cases, median IL-1ra (with CFP-10 and with PPD stimulation), IP-10 (CFP-10, ESAT-6), MIP-1β (ESAT-6, PPD), and TNF-α (ESAT-6) responses declined significantly over the course of therapy. In latent TB cases, median IL-1ra (CFP-10, ESAT-6, PPD), IL-2 (CFP-10, ESAT-6), and IP-10 (CFP-10, ESAT-6) responses declined significantly.
Conclusions
Mycobacteria-specific cytokine responses change significantly over the course of therapy, and their kinetics in active TB differ from those observed in latent TB. In particular, mycobacteria-specific IL-1ra responses are potential correlates of successful therapy in both active and latent TB."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
Infected macrophages play a role in the dissemination of Salmonella and may serve as a reservoir of infection in asymptomatic carriers. However, relatively little is known about the early molecular interactions of the bacteria with these cells. We have recently shown that members of the tetraspanin family of membrane proteins are involved in the initial adhesion of a range of bacteria to host cells. This study investigated the role of tetraspanins in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM).
Methods
The role of tetraspanins was studied by the use of tetraspanins recombinant proteins as well as monoclonal antibodies targeted against different tetraspanins. Knockdown of the tetraspanin CD63 was carried out by siRNA to further study the role of CD63 in Salmonella uptake.
Results
Recombinant proteins representing the large extracellular domains of tetraspanins inhibited binding of S. Typhimurium to human MDM by ∼50%, whereas tetraspanin-specific antibodies showed varying effects, with some enhancing (anti-CD37) and some inhibiting (anti-CD81, anti-CD63) binding. Inhibition of the S. Typhimurium-MDM interaction by anti-CD63 mAb appeared to be mediated by antibody induced internalization, suggesting that surface expression of CD63 is required for S. Typhimurium binding. Knockdown of CD63 in human MDM using siRNA greatly reduced S. Typhimurium binding, confirming the importance of CD63. However, ectopic expression of CD63 in the non-phagocytic cell line HEK293 was insufficient to mediate bacterial binding.
Conclusion
Bacterial adhesion is the first step in infection by pathogens that invade and replicate within host cells. Taken together, the results here describe a role for tetraspanins in binding of S. Typhimurium to human macrophages and highlight the particular importance of CD63 in this process."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
The capability to detect ZIKV RNA is of crucial importance for cases confirmation. However, due to the short-lived viremia, the detection of ZIKV RNA in plasma/serum is challenging for samples collected more than one week after onset of clinical illness. We compared the window time and detection rate of ZIKV RNA in different specimen types (plasma, whole blood and urine) collected simultaneously at several times post-symptom onset.
Methods
We examined the presence of ZIKV RNA in matched specimens of whole blood, plasma and urine collected in the same date (3–28 days after symptom onset) from 10 ZIKV infected patients.
Results
ZIKV RNA was found in plasma as late as 10 days after symptoms onset and tested positive in all 5 (100%) and in 2 of 6 (33,3%) plasma samples collected 1–5 and 6–10 days after symptoms onset, respectively. ZIKV RNA was positive in urine through the 21st day after symptom onset; the detection rate of ZIKV RNA in urine samples was 100% (11/11) for samples collected 1–10 days from symptoms onset, decreasing at later times of sampling. The detection rate of ZIKV RNA in whole blood was comparable to that in urine samples but extended the window of detection of ZIKV RNA up to 26 days after symptom onset.
Conclusions
Our results highlight the usefulness of simultaneously testing multiple specimen types in order to extend the rate and the time frame of ZIKV RNA detection, increasing the possibility of cases confirmation through direct diagnosis in convalescence-phase of infection, supplementing serological data which are often difficult to interpret."

Historically, bone was thought to be immunologically inactive with the sole function of supporting locomotion and ensuring stromaness functions as a major lymphoid organ. However, a myriad of pathogens (bacteria such as staphylococcus as well as viruses including alphaviruses, HIV or HCV) can invade the bone. These pathogens can cause apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis of osteoblasts and lead to lymphopenia and immune paralysis. There are now several detailed studies on how osteoblasts contribute to innate immune and inflammatory responses; indeed, osteoblasts in concert with resident macrophages can engage an armory of defense mechanisms capable of detecting and controlling pathogen evasion mechanisms. Osteoblasts can express the so-called pattern recognition receptors such as TOLL-like receptors involved in the detection for example of lipids and unique sugars (polysaccharides and polyriboses) expressed by bacteria or viruses (e.g. LPS and RNA respectively). Activated osteoblasts can produce interferon type I, cytokines, chemokines and interferon-stimulated proteins through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms to control for viral replication and to promote phagocytosis or lysis of bacteria for example by defensins. Uncontrolled and sustained innate immune activation of infected osteoblasts will also lead to an imbalance in the production of osteoclastogenic factors such as RANKL and osteoprotegerin involved in bone repair."

Whooping cough is a highly contagious, acute respiratory disease, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis (Bp). Despite the introduction and widespread use of vaccines starting in the 1950s pertussis cases continue to be reported, with a significant global impact. The role of specific virulence factors in disease and the immune mechanisms associated with protection following natural infection or vaccination are still not completely understood. The recently-developed baboon model of clinical pertussis provides a valuable tool for the study of pertussis. Baboons infected with B. pertussis exhibit all of the manifestations of human pertussis including paroxysmal coughing, mucus production, leukocytosis and transmission. The establishment of this model provides the opportunity to address unanswered questions about the natural progression of this disease and host responses to infection and vaccination in a very relevant model. In this review, we present an overview of our knowledge of pertussis along with recent advances resulting from use of the baboon model. Remaining questions and future research directions are discussed. We hope that the knowledge gained through use of the baboon model of pertussis and clinical studies will allow the development of more efficacious vaccines, conferring long lasting protection against disease and transmission."

Background
There are limited data on the epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) illness in HIV-infected adults or the elderly in Africa. We studied the epidemiology of RSV-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) hospitalizations in adults in South Africa from 2009 through 2013.
Methods
Individuals admitted to sentinel surveillance hospitals were investigated by respiratory tract swabs for RSV, using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. The incidence of RSV-associated SARI was calculated for the one site with population denominators.
Results
Of 7796 participants investigated, 329 (4%) tested positive for RSV. On multivariable analysis, HIV-infected individuals with RSV-associated SARI had greater odds of being in the age groups 18–44 and 45–64 years (odd ratios (OR) 26.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.2–112.1 and OR 11.4; 95% CI 2.6–50.0) compared with those ≥65 years and being female (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.4–5.4). The relative risk of hospitalization with RSV-associated SARI was 12–18 times higher in HIV infected individual compared to that of HIV-uninfected.
Conclusion
The incidence of RSV-associated SARI was higher in HIV-infected individuals and those aged 65 years and older. Further studies are warranted to describe the disease association of RSV detected in adults with SARI."

Introduction
The measurement of adenosine deaminase (ADA) level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has generated as a suitable test for tuberculous meningitis (TBM) diagnosis. The main objective in the present meta-analysis focused on analyzing the ADA test accuracy in order to diagnose TBM.
Methods
We searched several databases including Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases to identify studies addressing the diagnosis of TBM. The quality of included reports were assessed by RevMan5 software (via QUADS2 checklist). Accuracy measures of ADA test (sensitivity, specificity and others) pooled with random effects models. In addition, the data was elicited by using midas and metan packages in stata (version 12). Result: Twenty studies were eligible for inclusion within the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for TBM diagnosis hallmarks were 89% (95% CI: 0.84–0.92) and 91% (95% CI: 0.87–0.93), respectively. The positive likelihood ratio was 9.4 (95% CI: 7–12.8), negative likelihood ratio was 0.12 (95% CI: 0.09–0.17), and diagnostic odds ratio was 77 (95% CI: 45–132). Indeed, the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) was 0.96.
Conclusion
It was magnificently attained that ADA test had a relatively high accuracy for TBM diagnosis."

Despite advances over the past ten years lower respiratory tract infections still comprise around a fifth of all deaths worldwide in children under five years of age with the majority in low- and middle-income countries. Known risk factors for severe respiratory infections and poor chronic respiratory health do not fully explain why some children become sick and others do not. The respiratory tract hosts bacteria that can cause respiratory infections but also normal commensal bacteria. Together, this microbial population is called the microbiome. The composition of the respiratory microbiome in the first few months of life is likely influenced by external factors such as environment, mode of delivery and infant feeding practices, which are also associated with susceptibility to respiratory infections and wheezing illness/asthma. Recently, multiple studies have shown that respiratory microbiota profiles early in life are associated with an increased risk and frequency of subsequent respiratory infections, disease severity and occurrence of wheeze in later childhood. Early interactions between infectious agents such as viruses and the respiratory microbiome have shown to modulate host immune responses potentially affecting the course of the disease and future respiratory health. Deeper understanding of these interactions will help the development of new therapeutic agents or preventive measures that may modify respiratory health outcomes and help us to stratify at risk populations to better target our current interventional approaches."

Objectives
To investigate the value of in-care viral load (ICVL) and other viral load (VL) metrics for HIV surveillance by comparing time trends and associations with numbers of new HIV diagnoses.
Methods
Data from 20,740 HIV patients registered in the Dutch ATHENA-cohort between 2002 and 2013 were used. We compared: six ICVL metrics (i.e. mean of the mean/first/last/highest log VL, median of the median log VL, first log VL for newly diagnosed combined with mean log VL for all others), log VL at diagnosis, proportion of patients with transmission risk (>400 copies/ml) or suppressed VL (≤200 copies/ml). Subgroup differences were assessed using Kruskal–Wallis and chi-square tests. Negative binomial regression was used for studying associations between VL metrics and numbers of new diagnoses 1–4 years later.
Results
Most ICVL metrics showed similar decreasing trends over time. Differences in covariables were found for all VL metrics. Mean ICVL showed the strongest association with new diagnoses: a decrease of one log unit in mean ICVL was associated with a 21% decrease in new diagnoses two years later.
Conclusions
VL metrics may be of value for enhancing HIV surveillance by identifying subgroup differences in impact of treatment on viral suppression, and by predicting numbers of new diagnoses in subsequent years."

Objectives
To characterize whether the CMV-specific cellular immune response can be used as a predictor of the control of CMV infection and disease and determine thresholds in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients seropositive for CMV (R+).
Methods
The CMV-specific T-cell response was characterized using intracellular cytokine staining and the evolution of clinical and virological parameters were recorded during the first year after transplantation.
Results
Besides having positive CMV serology, only 28.4% patients had positive immunity (CD8+CD69+IFN-γ+ ≥0.25%) at 2 weeks after transplantation. These patients had less indication of preemptive treatment (p = 0.025) and developed less high grade (≥2000 IU/ml) CMV replication episodes (p = 0.006) than patients with no immunity. Of the 49 patients with a pretransplant sample, only 22.4% had positive immunity, and had a detectable immune response early after transplantation (median of 3.7 weeks). However, only 50% of patients with negative pretransplant immunity acquired a positive immune response and it was significantly later, at a median of 11 weeks (p < 0.001). Patients that developed CMV disease had no CMV-specific immunity.
Conclusions
Having CMV-specific CD8+IFN-γ+ cells ≥0.25% before transplant; 0.15% at two weeks or 0.25% at four weeks after transplantation, identifies patients that may spontaneously control CMV infection and may require less monitoring."

Objectives
The treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been revolutionized by the use of immunomodulatory agents. Although these potent drugs are effective in controlling disease activity, they also cause an increased risk of new infections or reactivation of latent infections. On these premises, we aimed to provide guidance on the definitions of immunocompromised patients, opportunistic infections and the risk factors associated with their occurrence in an IBD context, and to suggest the proper screening tests for infectious diseases and the vaccination schedules to perform before and/or during therapy with immunomodulators.
Methods
All the most recent evidences – filtered by the combined work of gastroenterologists and infectious disease experts – were summarized with the aim to provide a practical standpoint for the physician.
Results
A systematic screening of all infections which may arise during therapy with immunomodulator drugs is necessary in all patients with IBD.
Conclusions
The ideal timing to perform screening tests and vaccinations is at the diagnosis of the disease, regardless of its severity at onset, because the course of IBD and its treatment may vary over time, and an immunocompromised status may hamper efficacy and/or possibility to perform all necessary vaccines."

This study included 23 septic and 14 non-septic patients during 2015–16 study period at the Christchurch Hospital Intensive Care Unit, Christchurch, New Zealand. Blood samples were collected from the time of admission to 96 h, with collection at different time points (0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h) and subjected to measurement of hydrogen sulfide, substance P, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and lactate levels.
Results
Patients with sepsis showed higher circulating hydrogen sulfide and substance P levels compared to patients without sepsis. Hydrogen sulfide levels were significantly higher at 12 h (1.45 vs 0.75 μM; p < 0.05) and 24 h (1.11 vs 0.72 μM; p < 0.01), whereas substance P levels were higher at 48 h (0.55 vs 0.31 ng/mL; p < 0.05). Increased hydrogen sulfide and substance P levels in septic patients were associated with increased levels of inflammatory mediators – procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6.

Objectives
To identify within-host quasispecies characteristics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in mothers and children infected via mother-to-child transmission (MTCT).
Methods
Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we analyzed sequences within the non-overlapping pre-core/core (pre-C/C) gene in 37 mother–child pairs.
Results
Phylogenetic and Highlighter analyses suggested that both a single strain and multiple distinct strains may be transmitted in MTCT of HBV. However, analysis of reassembled viral sequences revealed a relatively narrow distribution of variants in children, which was confirmed by a lower viral diversity in children than that in mothers. New closely related variants with combinations of two to five high-frequency mutations were observed in seven children with elevated ALT levels; the new variants out-competed the transmitted maternal variants to become the dominant strains in five of them. Furthermore, 30 mutations with a frequency >1% of all viruses within-host were present in those children; the mutations caused 19 amino-acid substitutions. Interestingly, almost all were located within the well-known T-cell or B-cell epitopes.
Conclusions
There are restrictive changes that occur in the early stages of chronic HBV infection through MTCT with different clinical consequences. These data might have important implications for future investigations of interrelated immunopathogenesis and therapeutic strategies."

Globally, anal cancer incidence is rare, but is increasing in some world regions. Our objective was to assess differences in anal HPV natural history in three countries.
Methods
Men aged 18–70 years were recruited from the US (n = 634), Mexico (n = 665), and Brazil (n = 731). Anal specimens were collected every six-months. HPV genotyping was assessed by Linear Array. Anal HPV prevalence was compared using the Fisher's exact test. HPV infection incidence rates (IR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
Results
Any anal HPV prevalence was highest among men from Brazil (24%) compared to Mexico (15%) and the US (15%). When stratified by sexual history, the prevalence of any HPV among MSM/MSMW was 43%, 37%, and 45% and 9%, 12%, and 10% for MSW from Brazil, Mexico, and US, respectively. Any HPV incidence was significantly higher among men from Brazil compared to US men (IRR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.7–3.4) and comparable between men from Mexico and the US (IRR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.8–1.8).

Men in Brazil and Mexico often have similar, if not higher incidence of anal HPV compared to men from the U.S., and may benefit from gender neutral HPV vaccine policies."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Cancer may increase risk of active tuberculosis but evidence is sparse. We therefore examined tuberculosis risk in patients with incident cancer using Danish nationwide medical databases.
Methods
We conducted a matched follow-up study comparing risk of active tuberculosis in cancer-exposed individuals to that in a general population comparison cohort, matched on gender, age, and country of origin, in different follow-up intervals using Cox regression.
Findings
We identified 290,944 patients with incident cancer and 871,147 matched comparison cohort members during 1 January, 2004–30 November, 2013. After adjusting for comorbidities, the overall adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for tuberculosis among cancer patients was 2.48 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.99–3.10). The highest tuberculosis risks were observed following cancers of the aerodigestive tract (aHR = 8.12; 95% CI: 4.33–15.22), tobacco-related cancers (aHR = 5.01; 95% CI: 3.37–7.44), and hematological cancers (aHR = 4.88; 95% CI: 2.27–10.48). Tuberculosis risk was highly elevated within the first year after cancer diagnosis (aHR = 4.14; 95% CI: 2.88–5.96), with a 6.78-fold increased aHR for cancer patients receiving cytostatics or radiotherapy. Beyond five years of observation, the overall aHR for tuberculosis remained at 2.66 (95% CI: 1.22–5.81).
Interpretation
Cancer is a clinical predictor for increased risk of active tuberculosis, probably related to decreased infection barriers, immunosuppression, and shared risk factors."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Platelets orchestrate the inflammatory activities of neutrophils, possibly contributing to pulmonary and myocardial damage during severe pneumococcal infection. This study tested the hypothesis that the pneumococcal toxin, pneumolysin (Ply), activates production of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) by neutrophils, these bioactive lipids being potential mediators of neutrophil:platelet (NP) networking.
Methods
The effects of recombinant Ply (10–80 ng mL−1) on the production of PAF and TxA2 by isolated neutrophils were measured using ELISA procedures, and NP aggregation by flow cytometry.
Results
Exposure of neutrophils to Ply induced production of PAF and, to a lesser extent, TxA2, achieving statistical significance at ≥20 ng mL−1 of the toxin. In the case of NP interactions, Ply promoted heterotypic aggregation which was dependent on upregulation of P-selectin (CD62P) and activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), attaining statistical significance at ≥10 ng mL−1 of the toxin, but did not involve either PAF or TxA2.
Conclusion
Ply induces synthesis of PAF and TxA2, by human neutrophils, neither of which appears to contribute to the formation of NP heterotypic aggregates in vitro, a process which is seemingly dependent on CD62P and PAR1. These pro-inflammatory activities of Ply may contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary and myocardial injury during severe pneumococcal infection."

abstract = "Summary
Some orthopaedic patients might be at risk for enterococcal infections and might benefit from adapted perioperative prophylaxis.
Methods
We performed a single-center cohort of adult patients with orthopaedic infections.
Results
Among 2740 infection episodes, 665 surgeries (24%) involved osteosynthesis material, including total joint arthroplasties. The recommended perioperative prophylaxis was cefuroxime (or vancomycin in case of documented MRSA body carriage). Patients had received antibiotic therapy before surgery in 1167 episodes (43%); among them with potential anti-enterococcal activity (penicillins, glycopeptides, imipenem, linezolid, daptomycin, aminoglycosids, tetracyclins) in 725 (62%) cases. Overall, enterococci were identified in intraoperative samples of 100 different infections (3.6%) (Enterococcus faecalis, 95; Enterococcus faecium, 2; and other enterococci, 3). However, only 15/100 (15%) enterococcal infections were monomicrobial and 19 were nosocomial (19/2740; 0.7%), of which 15 had previous cephalosporin perioperative prophylaxis without other antibiotic exposure. This association to prior cephalosporin use was significant (Pearson-χ2-test; 148/2640 vs. 15/100, p < 0.01). By multivariate analysis, the presence of diabetic foot infection (odds ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.2–2.9), and polymicrobial infection (OR 6.0, 95%CI 3.9–9.4) were the main predictors of enterococcal infection, while sex, age, and type of material were not.
Conclusions
Community-acquired or nosocomial enterococcal infections in orthopaedic surgery are mostly polymicrobial, rare and very seldom attributed to a nosocomial origin. Thus, even if they are formally associated with prior cephalosporin use, we do not see a rational for changing our antibiotic prophylaxis."

Background
Invasive meningococcal disease is a severe infection. The appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy is not well established.
Methods
Two hundred and sixty-three consecutive patients with invasive meningococcal disease treated with 4 days' antibiotic therapy were compared with 264 consecutive patients treated previously at the same center with 7 days' antibiotic therapy. A Desirability of Outcome Ranking (DOOR) and Response Adjusted for Duration of Antibiotic Risk (RADAR) study was also performed.
Results
No relapses were recorded in any patient. Patients on the 4-day course were 63% female, with a median age of 23 years old (IQR 16–54) and patients on the 7-day course were 61% female, with a median age of 17 years old (IQR 12–43). Case fatality rate was 7% in the 4-d patients and 6% in the 7-d patients (p = 0.582). Neurological sequelae were recorded in 6% of the 4-d group and in 7% of the 7-d group ((p = 0.509) and cutaneous sequelae in 3% in both groups. There were no statistical significant differences between the groups in terms of clinical characteristics, laboratory findings or complications. The probability that a patient had a randomly chosen DOOR better with the 4-day regimen than with the 7-day regimen was 80.4% [95% CI 80.1–80.7%].

The measles virus is among the most transmissible viruses known to infect humans. Prior to measles vaccination programs, measles infected over 95% of all children and was responsible for over 4 million deaths each year. Measles vaccination programs have been among the greatest public health achievements reducing, eliminating endemic measles in the whole of the Americas and across much of the globe. Where measles vaccines are introduced, unexpectedly large reductions in all-cause childhood mortality have been observed. These gains appear to derive in part from direct heterologous benefits of measles vaccines that enhance innate and adaptive immune responses. Additionally, by preventing measles infections, vaccination prevents measles-associated short- and long-term immunomodulating effects. Before vaccination, these invisible hallmarks of measles infections increased vulnerability to non-measles infections in nearly all children for weeks, months, or years following acute infections. By depleting measles incidence, vaccination has had important indirect benefits to reduce non-measles mortality. Delineating the relative importance of these two modes of survival benefits following measles vaccine introduction is of critical public health importance. While both support continued unwavering global commitments to measles vaccination programs until measles eradication is complete, direct heterologous benefits of measles vaccination further support continued commitment to measles vaccination programs indefinitely. We discuss what is known about direct and indirect nonspecific measles vaccine benefits, and their implications for continued measles vaccination programs."

Objectives
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are considered to be at increased risk of severe infections. We here describe the clinical characteristics, course and outcome of RA patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB).
Methods
We conducted a post hoc analysis of data from a German bi-center prospective SAB cohort study (period 2006–2014). Patients were followed-up for one year. Primary and secondary outcomes were survival time and osteoarticular infection (OAI).
Results
A total of 1069 patients with SAB were analyzed, with 31 patients suffering from RA. RA patients showed significantly more often OAI (15/31 patients, 48% vs. 152/1038, 15%), disseminated infection (12/31, 39% vs. 164/1038, 16%) and severe sepsis/septic shock (12/31, 39% vs. 235/1038, 23%). Day-30 mortality in RA patients was 36% (vs. 19% in non-RA patients, p = 0.034), and day 90 mortality was 58% (vs. 32%, p = 0.003). Multivariate analyses confirmed RA to be an independent risk factor for death (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4–3.7) and OAI (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.8–9.8).
Conclusions
Patients with RA exhibit a complicated SAB course and a high mortality, their management is challenging. Adequate antibiotic treatment, prompt invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures like joint lavage or surgery are of pivotal importance. Joint damage due to RA may confer a higher risk of acquiring OAI than immunosuppression."

Objectives
Malaria in pregnancy (MiP) contributes to fetal undernutrition and adverse birth outcomes, and may constitute a developmental origin of metabolic diseases in the offspring. In a Ghanaian birth cohort, we examined the relationships between MiP-exposure and metabolic traits in adolescence.
Methods
MiP at delivery was assessed in 155 mother-child pairs. Among the now teenaged children (mean age, 14.8 years; 53% male), we measured fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body mass index (BMI), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP). Associations of MiP with the adolescents' FPG, BMI, and BP were examined by linear regression.
Results
At delivery, 45% were MiP-exposed, which increased FPG in adolescence, adjusted for mother's age at delivery, parity and familial socio-economic status (infected vs. uninfected: mean ΔFPG = 0.20 mmol/L; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01, 0.39; p = 0.049). As a trend,this was discernible for BP, particularly for microscopic infections (mean Δsystolic BP = 5.43 mmHg; 95% CI: 0.00, 10.88; p = 0.050; mean Δdiastolic BP = 3.67 mmHg; 95% CI: −0.81, 8.14; p = 0.107). These associations were largely independent of birth weight, gestational age and teenage BMI. Adolescent BMI was not related to MiP.
Conclusions
In rural Ghana, exposure to malaria during fetal development contributes to metabolic conditions in young adulthood."

Objectives
Fast expansion and linkage to microcephaly and Guillain Barre syndrome have made Zika virus (ZIKV) track attention of global health authority concerns. The epidemiology, virological characteristics and genetic evolution of introduced ZIKV to Guangdong, China, were investigated.
Methods
Analyses of the epidemiological characteristics and genetic diversity of ZIKV isolates were performed.
Results
A total of twenty-eight confirmed ZIKV infection cases were imported into China in 2016, of which 19 were imported into Guangdong, China from Venezuela (16), the Samoa Islands (1), Suriname (1) and Guatemala (1). Serial sampling studies of the cases indicated longer shedding times of ZIKV particles from urine and saliva samples than from serum and conjunctiva swab samples. Seven ZIKV strains were successfully isolated from serum, urine and conjunctiva swab samples using cell culture and neonatal mouse injection methods. Genomic analysis indicated that all viruses belonged to the Asian lineage but had different evolutionary transmission routes with different geographic origins. The molecular clock phylogenetic analysis of the ZIKV genomes indicated independent local transmission that appeared to have been previously established in Venezuela and Samoa. Additionally, we found 7 unique non-synonymous mutations in the genomes of ZIKV that were imported to China. The mutations may indicate that ZIKV has undergone independent evolutionary history not caused by sudden adaptation to Chinese hosts.
Conclusion
The increasing number of ex-patriot Chinese returning from ZIKV hyper-endemic areas to Guangdong combined with the presence of a variety of Aedes species indicate the potential for autochthonous transmission of ZIKV in Guangdong."

Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were activated with stimuli relevant during bacterial infections and sensitivity to recombinant leukocidins was measured in cell-viability assays. Leukocidin receptor expression was quantified by flow cytometry.
Results
We observed greatly variable sensitivities of different PMN preparations towards LukGH. Activation of PMNs by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or S. aureus culture supernatant (CS) lacking all leukocidins resulted in higher surface expression of CD11b, the LukGH receptor, and greatly enhanced the sensitivity towards LukGH, eliminating the variability observed with unstimulated cells. In contrast, CS induced a decrease in sensitivity of PMNs to the other four leukocidins and reduced surface staining for their cognate receptors (CXCR1, CXCR2, C5aR, C5L2). Delta-toxin and peptidoglycan mimicked the effect of CS. Moreover, IL-8, an important cytokine in neutrophil activation, also selectively increased LukGH sensitivity. Deletion of lukGH, but not other leukocidin genes, prevented PMN killing upon infection with USA300 CA-MRSA.
Conclusion
Inflammatory signals enhance the susceptibility of human PMNs to lysis by LukGH rendering this toxin dominant among the S. aureus leukocidins in vitro."

The DOTS strategy assisted global tuberculosis (TB) control, but was unable to prevent the emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains. Genomic evidence confirms the transmission of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in many different settings, indicative of epidemic spread. These findings emphasise the need for enhanced infection control measures in health care and congregate settings. Young children in TB endemic areas are particularly vulnerable. Although advances in TB drug and vaccine development are urgently needed, improved access to currently available preventive therapy and treatment for drug resistant TB could reduce the disease burden and adverse outcomes experienced by children. We review new insights into the transmission dynamics of drug resistant TB, the estimated disease burden in children and optimal management strategies to consider."

Objectives
This work aimed to describe the epidemiology of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in France, 2006–2015, including group- and genotype-specific disease burden, incidence trends before and after introduction of meningococcal C conjugate vaccines (MCCV) in 2010, and factors influencing the case fatality rate.
Methods
Mandatory notification data on incidence and IMD case characteristics were used. Genotyping of invasive strains and whole genome sequencing were performed by the French National Reference Center. Vaccination coverage was estimated from the National Health Insurance Information System's reimbursement data.
Results
The decrease in annual IMD incidence rates (per 100,000 inhabitants) from 1.23 in 2006 to 0.78 in 2016 was mainly related to the decrease in group B IMD. Group C incidence decreased from 0.29 in 2006 to 0.13 in 2010 but increased thereafter in age groups not targeted by MCCV. From 2010 onwards, MCCV coverage gradually increased but remained below 25% in 15–19 year-olds in 2015. Age, clinical presentation and, to a lesser extent, clonal complex 11 were the most significant factors determining mortality.
Conclusions
The limited impact of vaccination on group C IMD incidence may be explained by the emergence of a new epidemic cycle in 2011 and the low vaccination coverage rates among adolescents and young adults."

M. pneumoniae infection gives rise to a wide variety of manifestations. The pathogenesis of secondary manifestations is not always known. Some depend on the direct invasion of M. pneumoniae and others on the indirect effect of M. pneumoniae through pathological immune responses, for instance autoreactive antibodies in Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Diagnosis remains challenging with currently available diagnostic tests, because they do not demonstrate a causal relation due to M. pneumoniae asymptomatic carriage or previous infection. The mainstay of treatment is macrolide antibiotics, but the role of additional immunomodulation therapy is unclear.

Objective
To determine the clinical course and perinatal transmission of chronic hepatitis B during pregnancy in a real life setting.
Methods
A total of 221 singleton pregnant women with detectable HBV-DNA levels (≥103 copies/mL) were enrolled during January 2011 to June 2015. Forty-three high viraemic patients (≥106 copies/mL) received telbivudine in the 2nd or 3rd trimester according to their intention, while 89 high viraemic and 79 low viraemic (≥103 and <106 copies/mL) patients were the control cohorts. Primary endpoint was the pregnancy outcomes and secondary endpoint the perinatal transmission including intrauterine infection, immunoprophylaxis failure and occult infection.
Results
In all, 209 patients completed pregnancy with 209 infants, while 2 in telbivudine-treated cohort had unexplained late stillbirths. Twenty-nine (70.7%) of telbivudine-treated patients and 3 (3.4%) of untreated high viraemic controls achieved undetectable HBV-DNA levels prior delivery. At 7 months postpartum, immunoprophylaxis failure was significantly lower (2.4%) in telbivudine-treated cohort, compared with 16.9% and 10.1% in untreated high and low viraemic cohorts, respectively.
Conclusions
Low viraemic patients may also need antiviral therapy since they bear moderate risk for perinatal transmission of HBV. However, more multicenter, large-scale studies are required before antepartum antiviral therapy is routinely recommended in patients with detectable viral loads."

Objectives
We examined the incidence of herpes zoster in immunocompromised adults (≥18 years) with different severities of immunosuppression and assessed the prevalence of complications and of various kinds of healthcare resource utilisation.
Methods
German claims data from more than ten million adults were used to calculate annual incidence rates of herpes zoster for the years 2006–2012 and to analyse the prevalence of complications, physician visits, hospitalisations, and antiviral and analgesic treatments using a cohort design. The analyses were stratified by age, sex, and severity of immunosuppression, defined by immunocompromising conditions and drug therapies.
Results
The incidence rate per 1000 person-years of herpes zoster was almost twice as high in immunocompromised patients (11.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.4–11.6)) compared to immunocompetent subjects (5.9 (95% CI: 5.8–5.9)). The incidence rate was higher in highly immunocompromised patients (13.4 (95% CI: 13.2–13.6)) than in patients with a low severity of immunosuppression (10.0 (95% CI: 9.8–10.1)). These differences were observed for both sexes and in all age groups. Complications, outpatient physician visits, hospitalisations, and analgesic treatments occurred more frequently in immunocompromised patients as well.
Conclusions
Our results show that immunocompromised individuals are affected by the disease in particular and that the burden of herpes zoster is highest in severely immunocompromised patients."

Listeria monocytogenes can cause sepsis and meningitis. We report national surveillance data on L. monocytogenes meningitis in the Netherlands, describing incidence changes, genetic epidemiology and fatality rate.
Methods
We analyzed data from the Netherlands Reference Laboratory of Bacterial Meningitis for cases of L. monocytogenes meningitis. Strains were assessed by serotyping and bacterial population structure by multi-locus sequence typing.
Results
A total of 375 cases of Listeria meningitis were identified between 1985 and 2014. Peak incidence rates were observed in neonates (0.61 per 100,000 live births) and older adults (peak at 87 year; 0.53 cases per 100,000 population of the same age). Neonatal listerial meningitis decreased 17-fold from 1.95 per 100,000 live births between 1985 and 1989, to 0.11 per 100,000 live births between 2010 and 2014. Overall case fatality rate was 31%, in a multivariate analysis older age and concomitant bacteremia were associated with mortality (both p < 0.01). Clonal complexes (CC) CC1, CC2 and CC3 decreased over time from respectively 32% to 12%, 33% to 9% and 10% to 2% (all p < 0.001), while CC6 increased from 2% to 26% (p < 0.001).
Conclusions
The incidence of neonatal listerial meningitis has declined over the past 25 years. The genotype CC6 has become the predominant genotype in listerial meningitis in the Netherlands. Mortality of listeria meningitis has remained high."

Objectives
For tuberculosis (TB) transmission to occur, an uninfected individual must inhale the previously infected breath. Our objective was to identify potential TB transmission hotspots in metropolitan city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and to model the annual risk of TB transmission in different locations of public importance.
Methods
We collected indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) data from markets, prisons, night clubs, public transportation, religious and social halls, and from schools. Study volunteers recorded social contacts at each of the locations. We then estimated the annual risks of TB transmission using a modified Wells-Riley equation for different locations.
Results
The annual risks of TB transmission were highest among prison inmates (41.6%) and drivers (20.3%) in public transport. Lower transmission risks were found in central markets (4.8% for traders, but 0.5% for their customers), passengers on public transport (2.4%), public schools (4.0%), nightclubs (1.7%), religious (0.13%), and social halls (0.12%).
Conclusion
For the first time in a country representative of sub-Saharan Africa, we modelled the risk of TB transmission in important public locations by using a novel approach of studying airborne transmission. This approach can guide identification of TB transmission hotspots and targeted interventions to reach WHO's ambitious End TB targets."

The incidence of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa is falling and in many countries on the continent the pattern of malaria infection within the country is becoming more heterogeneous. National malaria control programmes need to take this into account and the ‘one size fits all’ approach to malaria control may no longer be appropriate, with individual approaches being needed in different parts of a country. This applies particularly to decisions on the introduction of new control tools. Recent experience with Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention and with the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine provides examples of interventions which need to be deployed on a restricted rather than a national basis, taking account of differences in climate and the intensity of malaria infection between regions within a country. Designing, implementing and monitoring more complex national malaria control programmes will require staff skilled in many disciplines, and substantial funding will be needed to sustain these more complex control programmes, even though the burden of the disease is falling."

Importance
Human serum bactericidal antibody levels (hSBA) are commonly used as an immune correlate of protection after vaccination against meningococcal disease. We performed a systematic review of how well this marker correlates with protection induced by outer membrane vesicle (OMV) vaccines against meningococcal B (MenB) disease.
Objective
To compare vaccine effectiveness (VE) of OMV vaccines against MenB predicted by hSBA (predicted protection) to VE from clinical studies (observed protection).
Data sources
Studies identified by searching Medline, Embase, Global Health, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects.
Study selection
Studies reporting hSBA after vaccination with OMV vaccines and subsequent efficacy/effectiveness in a MenB outbreak were included.
Data extraction and synthesis
Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were performed by two independent investigators.
Main outcomes and measures
Predicted VE and observed VE measured during MenB outbreaks.
Results
We included 19 studies (eleven randomized controlled trials, six cohort studies, two case-control studies). Four different OMV vaccines were applied during nine different outbreaks (six countries, 1987–2009). A comparison between predicted and observed VE was possible using results from studies performed during five outbreaks. Predicted VE differed from observed VE by 2–59%, with greater differences observed in younger age groups. In general, predicted VE tended to be lower than observed VE.
Conclusion and relevance
hSBA induced by OMV vaccines correlates moderately well with protection against MenB in older children and adults. The correlation was poor at very young ages, for which low VE was observed."

Aims
A prospective observational study was conducted in Royal Marines (RM) recruits to investigate throat carriage of group A Streptococcus (GAS) and incidence of soft tissue infections.
Methods
1012 RM recruits were followed through a 32-week training programme, with throat swabs being obtained in weeks 1, 6, 15, and 32. Alongside a separate cohort of 46 RM Young Officers (YO) undergoing training were sampled in parallel.
Results
Carriage of group A Streptococcus was detected in only 5/1012 (0.49%) recruits at the beginning of training and remained low throughout training. There was no association between GAS carriage and development of soft tissue infection. There was no carriage of GAS in the smaller YO cohort at the start of training, (0/46). At week 6, a surge in GAS carriage was detected in 8/46 (17%) YO, that could be ascribed to a cluster of GAS genotype emm83.
Conclusions
Asymptomatic GAS carriage is very infrequent among young adults in England and this should be borne in mind when considering the relevance of a positive throat swab result in symptomatic patients or outbreaks. Despite low prevalence, there is however potential for GAS to rapidly and transiently disseminate among adults during outbreaks."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infection (Sa-SSTI) places a significant burden on healthcare systems. New Zealand has a high incidence of Sa-SSTI, and here most morbidity is caused by a polyclonal methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) bacterial population. However, MSSA also colonise asymptomatically the cornified epithelia of approximately 20% of the population, and their divide between commensalism and pathogenicity is poorly understood. We aimed to see whether MSSA are genetically differentiated across colonisation and SSTI; and given the close interactions between people and pets, whether strains isolated from pets differ from human strains.
Methods
We compared the genomes of contemporaneous colonisation and clinical MSSA isolates obtained in New Zealand from humans and pets.
Results
Core and accessory genome comparisons revealed a homogeneous bacterial population across colonisation, disease, humans, and pets. The rate of MSSA colonisation in dogs was comparatively low (5.4%).
Conclusions
In New Zealand, most Sa-SSTI morbidity is caused by a random sample of the colonising MSSA population, consistent with the opportunistic infection model rather than the paradigm distinguishing strains according to their pathogenicity. Thus, studies of the factors determining colonisation and immune-escape may be more beneficial than comparative virulence studies. Contact with house-hold pets may pose low zoonotic risk."

Objectives
Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid) is a rapid molecular assay shown to be sensitive and specific for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis in highly endemic countries. We evaluated its diagnostic performance in a low TB prevalence setting, examined rifampicin resistance detection and quantitative capabilities predicting graded auramine microscopy and time to positivity (TTP) of culture.
Methods
Xpert MTB/RIF was used to test respiratory samples over a 3 year period. Samples underwent graded auramine microscopy, solid/liquid culture, in-house IS6110 real-time PCR, and GenoType MTBDRplus (HAIN Lifescience) to determine rifampicin and/or isoniazid resistance.
Results
A total of 2103 Xpert MTB/RIF tests were performed. Compared to culture sensitivity was 95.8%, specificity 99.5%, positive predictive value (PPV) 82.1%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 99.9%. A positive correlation was found between auramine microscopy grade and Xpert MTB/RIF assay load. We found a clear reduction in the median TTP as Xpert MTB/RIF assay load increased. Rifampicin resistance was detected.
Conclusions
Xpert MTB/RIF was rapid and accurate in diagnosing pulmonary TB in a low prevalence area. Rapid results will influence infection prevention and control and treatment measures. The excellent NPV obtained suggests further work should be carried out to assess its role in replacing microscopy."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
We sought to understand how polymicrobial colonization varies during health, viral upper respiratory infection (URI) and acute upper respiratory bacterial infection to understand differences in infection-prone vs. non-prone patients.
Methods
Nasopharyngeal (NP) samples were collected from 74 acute otitis media (AOM) infection-prone and 754 non-prone children during 2094 healthy visits, 673 viral URI visits and 631 AOM visits. Three otopathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), and Moraxella catarrhalis (Mcat) were identified by culture.
Results
NP colonization rates of multiple otopathogens during health were significantly lower than during viral URI, and during URI they were lower than at onset of upper respiratory bacterial infection in both AOM infection-prone and non-prone children. AOM infection-prone children had higher polymicrobial colonization rates than non-prone children during health, viral URI and AOM. Polymicrobial colonization rates of AOM infection-prone children during health were equivalent to that of non-prone children during viral URI, and during viral URI were equivalent to that of non-prone during AOM infection. Spn colonization was positively associated with NTHi and Mcat colonization during health, but negatively during AOM infection.
Conclusion
The infection-prone patients more frequently have multiple potential bacterial pathogens in the NP than the non-prone patients. Polymicrobial interaction in the NP differs during health and at onset of infection."

Throughout human history, pathogens transmitted through feces from person to person have caused substantial mortality. Over a century ago civil engineers in high income countries developed approaches to collect and remove feces from the environment that in communities with high incomes and strong governments markedly reduced the burden of enteric disease. These approaches, however, have not been successfully extended to impoverished communities in low income countries. Water/sanitation/hygiene professionals have attempted, with only limited success, to reduce fecal exposure and human disease in the absence of definitive civil engineering approaches. Medical professionals have worked to develop vaccines against some of the most important fecal oral pathogens. Each of these approaches needs further development and adaptation to optimally address the burden of fecally transmitted diseases in impoverished communities."

abstract = "Summary
Interactions between pathogens and commensal microbes are major contributors to health and disease. Infectious diseases however are most often considered independent, viewed within a one-host one-pathogen paradigm and, by extension, the interventions used to treat and prevent them are measured and evaluated within this same paradigm. Vaccines, especially live vaccines, by stimulating immune responses or directly interacting with other microbes can alter the environment in which they act, with effects that span across pathogen species. Live attenuated infl uenza vaccines for example, while safe, increase upper respiratory tract bacterial carriage density of important human commensal pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Further, by altering the ecological niche and dynamics of phylogenetically distinct microbes within the host, vaccines may unintentionally affect transmission of non-vaccine targeted pathogens. Thus, vaccine effects may span across species and across scales, from the individual to the population level. In keeping with traditional vaccine herd-effects that indirectly protect even unvaccinated individuals by reducing population prevalence of vaccine-targeted pathogens, we call these cross-species cross-scale effects “generalized herd-effects”. As opposed to traditional herd-effects, “generalized” relaxes the assumption that the effect occurs at the level of the vaccine-target pathogen and “herd effect” implies, as usual, that the effects indirectly impact the population at large, including unvaccinated bystanders. Unlike traditional herd-effects that decrease population prevalence of the vaccine-target, generalized herd-effects may decrease or increase prevalence and disease by the off-target pathogen. LAIV, for example, by increasing pneumococcal density in the upper respiratory tract of vaccine recipients, especially children, may increase pneumococcal transmission and prevalence, leading to excess pneumococcal invasive disease in the population, especially among the elderly and others most susceptible to pneumococcal disease. However, these effects may also be beneficial, for example the large reductions in all-cause mortality noted following measles vaccines. Here we discuss evidence for these novel vaccine effects and suggest that vaccine monitoring and evaluation programs should consider generalized herd effects to appreciate the full impacts of vaccines, beneficial or detrimental, across species and scales that are inevitably hiding in plain sight, affecting human health and disease."

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death due to an infectious disease worldwide. Especially in low-income countries, new diagnostic techniques that are accessible, inexpensive and easy-to-use, are needed to shorten transmission time and initiate treatment earlier.
Objective
We conducted a study with a handheld, point-of-care electronic nose (eNose) device to diagnose TB through exhaled breath.
Setting
This study includes a total of 110 patients and visitors of an expert centre of respiratory diseases in Asunción, Paraguay. TB diagnosis was established by culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and compared with the eNose results in two phases.
Results
The calibration phase, including only culture confirmed TB cases versus healthy people, demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 93% respectively. The confirmation phase, including all participants, showed a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 92%. The eNose showed high acceptance rate among participants, and was easy to operate.
Conclusion
The eNose resulted in a powerful technique to differentiate between healthy people and TB patients. Its comfort, speed and usability promise great potential in vulnerable groups, in remote areas and hospital settings to triage patients with suspicion of TB."

Lemierre’s syndrome is a rare and feared complication of pharyngitis, occurring most commonly in adolescents and young adults. It is typically defined by the constellation of septic internal jugular vein thrombophlebitis, pulmonary and other septic emboli, and sterilesite infection by Fusobacterium necrophorum. The rarity and severity of Lemierre’s syndrome has made it an attractive subject for case reports but there is a paucity of evidence to inform areas of persistent uncertainty. In recent years, heightened attention and controversy has focused upon speculation that a purported rise in the incidence of Lemierre’s syndrome is due to reduced antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections, that F. necrophorum is an under-appreciated cause of acute tonsillopharyngitis and that testing and targeted treatment would prevent cases of Lemierre’s syndrome."

The meningococcal ST-11 complex (cc11) causes large invasive disease outbreaks with high case fatality rates, such as serogroup C (MenC) epidemics in industrialised nations in the 1990s and the serogroup W epidemic currently expanding globally. Glycoconjugate vaccines are available for serogroups A, C, W and Y. Broad coverage protein-based vaccines have recently been licensed against serogroup B meningococci (MenB), however, these do not afford universal MenB protection. Capsular switching from MenC to MenB among cc11 organisms is concerning because a large MenB cc11 (B:cc11) outbreak has the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to assess the potential for licensed and developmental non-capsular meningococcal vaccines to protect against B:cc11. The population structure and vaccine antigen distribution was determined for a panel of >800 geo-temporally diverse, predominantly MenC cc11 and B:cc11 genomes. The two licensed vaccines potentially protect against many but not all B:cc11 meningococci. Furthermore, strain coverage by these vaccines is often due to a single vaccine antigen and both vaccines are highly susceptible to vaccine escape owing to the apparent dispensability of key proteins used as vaccine antigens. cc11 strains with MenB and MenC capsules warrant special consideration when formulating future non-capsular meningococcal vaccines."

Acute pulmonary and cardiac injury remain significant causes of morbidity and mortality in those afflicted with severe pneumococcal disease, with the risk for early mortality often persisting several years beyond clinical recovery. Although remaining to be firmly established in the clinical setting, a considerable body of evidence, mostly derived from murine models of experimental infection, has implicated the pneumococcal, cholesterol-binding, pore-forming toxin, pneumolysin (Ply), in the pathogenesis of lung and myocardial dysfunction. Topics covered in this review include the burden of pneumococcal disease, risk factors, virulence determinants of the pneumococcus, complications of severe disease, antibiotic and adjuvant therapies, as well as the structure of Ply and the role of the toxin in disease pathogenesis. Given the increasing recognition of the clinical potential of Ply-neutralisation strategies, the remaining sections of the review are focused on updates of the types, benefits and limitations of currently available therapies which may attenuate, directly and/or indirectly, the injurious actions of Ply. These include recently described experimental therapies such as various phytochemicals and lipids, and a second group of more conventional agents the members of which remain the subject of ongoing clinical evaluation. This latter group, which is covered more extensively, encompasses macrolides, statins, corticosteroids, and platelet-targeted therapies, particularly aspirin."

2017 will mark the 60th anniversary since the first isolation of RSV in children. In spite of concerted efforts over all these years, the goal of developing an effective vaccine against paediatric RSV disease has remained elusive. One of the main hurdles standing in the way of an effective vaccine is the fact that the age incidence of severe disease peaks within the first 3 months of life, providing limited opportunity for intervention. In addition to this complexity, the spectre of failed historical vaccines, which increased the risk of illness and death upon subsequent natural infection, has substantially increased the safety criteria against which modern vaccines will be assessed. This review traces the history of RSV vaccine development for young infants and analyses the potential reasons for the failure of historic vaccines. It also discusses recent breakthroughs in vaccine antigen design and the progressive evolution of platforms for the delivery of these antigens to seronegative infants."

Objectives
To determine the trend of incidence and outcome of sepsis based on a nationwide administrative database.
Methods
We analyzed the incidence and mortality of both emergency department treated and hospital treated sepsis from 2002 through 2012 using the entire health insurance claims data of Taiwan. The national health insurance covers 99% of residents in Taiwan. Sepsis patients were identified using a set of validated ICD-9CM codes conforming to the sepsis-3 definition. The 30-day all-cause mortality was verified by linked death certificate database.
Results
During the 11-year study period, a total of 1,259,578 episodes of sepsis was identified. The mean incidence rate was 639 per 100,000 person-years, increasing from 637.8/100,000 persons in 2002 to 772.1/100,000 persons in 2012 (annual increase: 1.9%). The mortality rate, however, has decreased from 27.8% in 2002 to 22.8% in 2012 (annual decrease: 0.45%). The trend of incidence and mortality did not change after standardization by age and gender using 2002 as the reference standard.
Conclusion
We showed that the incidence of sepsis has increased while the mortality has decreased in Taiwan. Despite the decreasing trend in sepsis mortality, the total number of sepsis mortality remains increasing due to the rapid increase in sepsis incidence."

Varicella and zoster continue to cause significant morbidity and even mortality in children and adults. Complications include bacterial superinfection, central nervous system manifestations such as meningitis, encephalitis, and cerebellar ataxia, and pain syndromes especially post herpetic neuralgia. Many developed countries but not all, are now administering live attenuated varicella vaccine routinely, with a decrease in the incidence of disease, providing personal and herd immunity. There is some controversy, however, in some countries concerning whether a decrease in the circulation of wild type virus will result in loss of immunity to VZV in persons who have already had varicella. This manuscript reviews the complications of varicella and zoster in detail, the reasons for development of vaccines against these diseases, complications of vaccinations, and mechanisms by which immunity to this virus develops and is maintained. There are strong indications that the best way to control disease and spread of this virus is by vaccination against both."

Group A streptococcal bloodstream infection is the most common presentation of invasive group A streptococcal disease. We sought to determine the impact of immunosuppression on severity of disease and clinical outcomes.
Methods
This retrospective review of 148 patients with at least one positive blood culture for Streptococcus pyogenes from 1/2003 to 3/2013 compared immunocompromised patients with those with no immunocompromise in regards to development of severe complications and mortality.
Results
Twenty-five patients (17%) were immunocompromised; 123 were not. Skin and soft tissue infection occurred in 60% of immunocompromised vs. 38% of non-immunocompromised patients, p = .04. Necrotizing fasciitis and septic shock were significantly more common in immunocompromised patients, p < .0001 and .028, respectively. Mortality at 30 days was 32% in immunocompromised patients vs. 16% in non-immunocompromised patients, p = .05.

Objective
To determine current outcomes and predictors of treatment failure among patients with surgical site infection (SSI) after colorectal surgery.
Methods
A multicentre observational prospective cohort study of adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery in 10 Spanish hospitals (2011–2014). Treatment failure was defined as persistence of signs/symptoms of SSI or death at 30 days post-surgery.
Results
Of 3701 patients, 669 (18.1%) developed SSI; 336 (9.1%) were organ-space infections. Among patients with organ-space SSI, 81.2% required source control: 60.4% reoperation and 20.8% percutaneous/transrectal drainage. Overall treatment failure rate was 21.7%: 9% in incisional SSIs and 34.2% in organ-space SSIs (p < 0.001). Median length of stay was 15 days (IQR 9–22) for incisional SSIs and 24 days (IQR 17–35) for organ-space SSIs (p < 0.001). One hundred and twenty-seven patients (19%) required readmission and 35 patients died (5.2%). Risk factors for treatment failure among patients with organ-space SSI were age ≥65 years (OR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.07–1.83), laparoscopy (OR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.06–2.77), and reoperation (OR 2.8, 95% CI: 1.7–4.6).
Conclusions
Rates of SSI and treatment failure in organ-space SSI after elective colorectal surgery are notably high. Careful attention should be paid to older patients with previous laparoscopy requiring reoperation for organ-space SSI, so that treatment failure can be identified early."

We conducted a cross-sectional study within a prospective cohort of HIV-infected women on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Cervical specimens were collected for cytology and HPV genotyping (Papillocheck®). Any women with High-Risk-HPV (HR-HPV), and/or potentially HR-HPV (pHR-HPV) and/or ASC-US or higher (ASC-US+) lesions were referred for colposcopy. Factors associated with HR-HPV infection and with HSIL+/CIN2+ lesions were investigated using mixed-effects logistic regression models.
Results
829 women were enrolled: median age 40.4 years, on cART for a median of 6.9 years, median CD4 cell-count 536 cells/mm3, and 788 (96%) with HIV-viral load<50copies/mL. Of 214 (26%) infected with HPV: 159 (19%) had ≥1 HR-HPV, of whom 38 (5%) HPV52, 22 (3%) HPV16, 9 (1%) HPV18; 21 (3%) had pHR-HPV, 34 (4%) low risk-HPV infection, and 56 (26%) had multiple genotypes. Younger age, low CD4 cell-counts and low education were independently associated with HR-HPV infection. 72 women (9%) had ASC-US+ and 28 (3%) HSIL+/CIN2+ lesions. HR-HPV infection was independently associated with HSIL+/CIN2+ lesions.
Conclusion
The prevalence of HPV infection and of cervical lesions was low. The HPV genotype distribution supports the use of 9-valent vaccine in Thailand."

Tinea capitis is the most important superficial fungal condition in children. It is often unrecognised but the presence of alopecia, scale and lymphadenopathy, especially in inner-city children should prompt investigation. An understanding of changing epidemiology and prevalence of causative organisms is important in deciding appropriate therapy. The use of diagnostic aids including dermoscopy is increasing and is reported to be helpful in identifying subtle signs. Trichophyton tonsurans accounts for the majority of cases in the UK and terbinafine is increasingly advocated as a safe and effective therapy. Exclusion from school is unnecessary provided the child is receiving appropriate systemic and topical therapy, but family members should be screened and carriers should receive treatment. Steroids and surgical treatments should be avoided. Treatment failure is common and may be multifactorial. Mycological cure after completing treatment should be sought and therefore follow up is necessary for Tinea capitis cases. Development of molecular diagnostic methods may improve our ability to diagnose Tinea capitis accurately and quickly in the future. Emerging new dermatophytoses affecting other anatomical sites are discussed which, although not common in the UK, may be seen due to increasing travel worldwide."

Objectives
Influenza is responsible for a large number of deaths which can only be estimated using modelling methods. Such methods have rarely been applied to describe the major socio-demographic characteristics of this disease burden.
Methods
We used quasi Poisson regression models with weekly counts of deaths and isolates of influenza A, B and respiratory syncytial virus for the period 1994 to 2008.
Results
The estimated average mortality rate was 13.5 per 100,000 people which was 1.8% of all deaths in New Zealand. Influenza mortality differed markedly by age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic position. Relatively vulnerable groups were males aged 65–79 years (Rate ratio (RR) = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.9, 1.9 compared with females), Māori (RR = 3.6, 95% CI: 3.6, 3.7 compared with European/Others aged 65–79 years), Pacific (RR = 2.4, 95% CI: 2.4, 2.4 compared with European/Others aged 65–79 years) and those living in the most deprived areas (RR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3, 2.4) for New Zealand Deprivation (NZDep) 9&10 (the most deprived) compared with NZDep 1&2 (the least deprived).
Conclusions
These results support targeting influenza vaccination and other interventions to the most vulnerable groups, in particular Māori and Pacific people and men aged 65–79 years and those living in the most deprived areas."

Objectives
To establish risk factors for Clostridium difficile colonization among hospitalized patients in England.
Methods
Patients admitted to elderly medicine wards at three acute hospitals in England were recruited to a prospective observational study. Participants were asked to provide a stool sample as soon as possible after enrolment and then weekly during their hospital stay. Samples were cultured for C. difficile before ribotyping and toxin detection by PCR. A multivariable logistic regression model of risk factors for C. difficile colonization was fitted from univariable risk factors significant at the p < 0.05 level.
Results
410/727 participants submitted ≥1 stool sample and 40 (9.8%) carried toxigenic C. difficile in the first sample taken. Ribotype 106 was identified three times and seven other ribotypes twice. No ribotype 027 strains were identified. Independent predictors of colonization were previous C. difficile infection (OR 4.53 (95% C.I. 1.33–15.48) and malnutrition (MUST score ≥2) (OR 3.29 (95% C.I. 1.47–7.35)). Although C. difficile colonised patients experienced higher 90-day mortality, colonization was not an independent risk for death.
Conclusions
In a non-epidemic setting patients who have previously had CDI and have a MUST score of ≥2 are at increased risk of C. difficile colonization and could be targeted for active surveillance to prevent C. difficile transmission."

Objectives
The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence and primary clinical outcomes of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis plus addition resistance to all drug tested (XDR-TB-Plus) between 2011 and 2015 in Beijing Chest Hospital.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed the drug susceptibility testing (DST) results of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains from TB patients seeking health care in the National Clinical Center for Tuberculosis, between 2011 and 2015. The medical records of patients classified as XDR-TB-Plus were reviewed, including demographic characteristics, treatment regimen, and treatment outcome.
Results
Of 9544 MTB isolates, there were 3376 (35.4%), 842 (8.8%) and 61 (0.64%) isolates identified as multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) and XDR-TB-Plus, respectively. The proportion of XDR-TB showed significant increase from 6.3% in 2011 to 9.1% in 2015 (Chi-square trend 5.94, P = 0.015). Similarly, the proportion of XDR-TB-Plus seemed to increase from 0.46% in 2011 to 0.74% in 2015, while the increasing trend was not significant (Chi-square trend 1.50, P = 0.221). The most frequently prescribed anti-TB drug was moxifloxacin (18/29, 62.1%), followed by protionamide (16/29, 55.2%), clofazimine (15/29, 51.7%), and pyrazinamide (15/29, 51.7%). Patients receiving regimens containing linezolid (LZD) were almost 27 times more likely to have favorable treatment outcome compared with those receiving regimens without LZD [odds ratios = 27.00; 95% CI = 2.50–291.19; P = 0.003].
Conclusions
In conclusion, our data have demonstrated that the proportion of XDR-TB has significantly increased over the past five years in Beijing Chest Hospital. In addition, the XDR-TB-Plus patients were more likely to reach favorable clinical outcome under the treatment of regimen containing LZD."

Objective
We investigated the diversity and drug susceptibility of pathogenic yeasts on fruit surfaces.
Method
Fruits were purchased from supermarkets and washed with buffer. The pellets were re-suspended in medium after centrifugation. The cell suspensions were plated onto CHROMagar Candida medium. Yeasts were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing and their drug susceptibilities were determined by broth microdilution assay.
Results
Of 184 isolates, comprised of 55 species, from 22 different types of fruits, 29 species, including Candida famata, Candida fermentati, Candida guilliermondii, Candida intermedia, Candida krusei, Candida orthopsilosis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida pelliculosa, Candida tropicalis, and others have been reported to cause diseases in humans. In addition to C. krusei, intrinsically resistant to fluconazole, all Rhodotorula and Rhodosporidium species were resistant to fluconazole. One each of C. tropicalis isolate was belonged to diploid sequence type (DST)149 and DST225, genotypes also detected in isolates from humans. Furthermore, the DST225 isolate was less susceptible to azole drugs. The susceptibilities to azole drugs for clinical and agricultural usage were associated to each other.
Conclusion
It is important to be aware of the existence of pathogenic yeasts, especially drug-resistant ones, on the fruit surfaces, a potential route for pathogenic yeasts to be transmitted to humans."

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is one of the most common causes of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Intra-partum antibiotic prophylaxis does not play a significant role in reducing the risk of GBS late-onset disease. One of the proposed mechanisms for GBS late-onset disease is infection through contaminated breast milk. Infants in whom breast milk is thought to be the source for GBS late-onset disease are more heavily colonised and reports suggest they have a higher recurrence rate compared to infants with other potential sources. There is no consensus whether the breast milk of mothers of infants with GBS late-onset disease, especially those with recurrent episodes, should be tested for GBS. In addition, recommendations differ on whether breast-feeding should be interrupted or breast milk pasteurised, or whether the mother and infant should be treated for colonisation. In this review we discuss these different approaches."

Sepsis in children is a complex syndrome that develops from various infections and results in 15–30% mortality in high-income countries and up to 50% or higher in low-income countries. Worldwide, this represents an annual burden of 30 million cases resulting in 8 million deaths. Not surprisingly, there is a significantly higher burden in low-income countries with children there being 18 times more likely to die before the age of 5 years compared to high-income countries. Factors such as commercial air travel, climate change, and unchecked population growth have contributed to the growing burden of infectious diseases and ensuing sepsis. In this article, we review the important role of global advocacy to improve public awareness of sepsis; increase access to essential medicines and vaccines; improve use of evidence-based treatment guidelines; raise awareness of antimicrobial resistance and encourage antibiotic stewardship; and, develop resilient health systems that can cope with health crises. Advocacy in these areas can assist nations in reaching the United Nations sustainable development goals (UN SDGs) of low rates of neonatal and under-5 mortality."

Characterization of a hospital outbreak of Candida auris candidemia that involved 18 critically ill patients in Venezuela.
Method
Bloodstream isolates of C. auris obtained from 18 patients admitted at a medical center in Maracaibo, between March, 2012 and July, 2013 were included. Species identification was confirmed by ITS rDNA sequencing. Isolates were subsequently typed by amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting (AFLP). Susceptibility testing was performed according to CLSI. Clinical data were collected from all cases by using a standard clinical form.
Results
A total of 13 critically ill pediatric and 5 adult patients, with a median age of 26 days, were included. All were previously exposed to antibiotics and multiple invasive medical procedures. Clinical management included prompt catheter removal and antifungal therapy. Thirteen patients (72%) survived up to 30 days after onset of candidemia. AFLP fingerprinting of all C. auris isolates suggested a clonal outbreak. The isolates were considered resistant to azoles, but susceptible to anidulafungin and 50% of isolates exhibited amphotericin B MIC values of >1 μg/ml.
Conclusions
The study demonstrated that C. auris is a multiresistant yeast pathogen that can be a source of health-care associated infections in tertiary care hospitals with a high potential for nosocomial horizontal transmission."

Objectives
Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal infection afflicting immunocompromised patients, causing a significant degree of morbidity and mortality. The purpose of the study was to provide a comprehensive analysis describing the epidemiology and outcome of mucormycosis in the scenario of HIV infection.
Methods
We systematically searched PubMed for reports about mucormycosis associated with HIV. Eligible studies describe the predisposing factor, clinical form, treatment, and survival outcome.
Results
We included 61 articles from 212 reviewed abstracts, corresponding to 67 cases. Patients were mostly men (68.2%) with a median CD4+ count of 47 [IQR 17–100] cells/mm3. Intravenous drug use (50%), neutropenia (29.7%) and corticosteroid use (25%) were the predominant associated factors. The main clinical forms were disseminated (20.9%), renal (19.4%), and rhino-cerebral (17.9%). Rhizopus (45.5%) and Lichtheimia spp (30.3%) were the main fungal isolates. Treatment consisted of antifungal therapy and surgery in 38.8%. Overall mortality rate was 52.2%, and varied with the site of infection: 92.9% for disseminated disease, 62.5% for cerebral disease, 60% for pulmonary infection, and 36.4% for cutaneous infection. Survival was worse for those who did not initiate antifungals (p = .04), who were antiretroviral naïve (p = .01), who were admitted to ICU (p = .003) or had disseminated disease (p = .007).

We investigated the susceptibility to Gram-negative sepsis after multiple traumas (MT).
Methods
From a prospective cohort of 5076 Greek patients with sepsis, 16 with Gram-negative bacteremia after MT were compared with 204 patients well-matched for severity, comorbidities and appropriateness of antimicrobials; circulating mononuclear cells were isolated and stimulated for the release of interleukin (IL)-10. Male C57Bl6J mice were subject to MT (right pneumothorax and right femur fracture) followed after 72 h by the intravenous challenge with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Survival was recorded and splenocytes were isolated for cytokine stimulation.
Results
28-day mortality after MT was 18.8% compared to 48.0% of comparators (48.0%) (odds ratio 0.25, p: 0.035). This was confirmed after logistic regression analysis taking into consideration comorbidities and age. Stimulation of IL-10 was enhanced from MT patients. Survival of mice challenged by P. aeruginosa 72 h after MT was prolonged compared to mice challenged by P. aeruginosa without prior MT. Cytokine production was decreased 24 h after MT and restored 96 h thereafter. Production of IL-10 was particularly pronounced from splenocytes of mice challenged by P. aeruginosa after MT.
Conclusions
Survival after MT is accompanied by favorable immune responses allowing survival benefit from Gram-negative sepsis. This is associated with increased IL-10 release."

Objectives
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is widely used in the treatment or prevention of HIV and hepatitis B infection. TDF may cause renal tubulopathy in a small proportion of recipients. We aimed to study the risk factors for developing severe renal tubulopathy.
Methods
We conducted an observational cohort study with retrospective identification of cases of treatment-limiting tubulopathy during TDF exposure. We used multivariate Poisson regression analysis to identify risk factors for tubulopathy, and mixed effects models to analyse adjusted estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slopes.
Results
Between October 2002 and June 2013, 60 (0.4%) of 15,983 patients who had received TDF developed tubulopathy after a median exposure of 44.1 (IQR 20.4, 64.4) months. Tubulopathy cases were predominantly male (92%), of white ethnicity (93%), and exposed to antiretroviral regimens that contained boosted protease inhibitors (PI, 90%). In multivariate analysis, age, ethnicity, CD4 cell count and use of didanosine or PI were significantly associated with tubulopathy. Tubulopathy cases experienced significantly greater eGFR decline while receiving TDF than the comparator group (−6.60 [−7.70, −5.50] vs. −0.34 [−0.43, −0.26] mL/min/1.73 m2/year, p < 0.0001).
Conclusions
Older age, white ethnicity, immunodeficiency and co-administration of ddI and PI were risk factors for tubulopathy in patients who received TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy. The presence of rapid eGFR decline identified TDF recipients at increased risk of tubulopathy."

The sensitivity of PCR/ESI-MS by specimen (excluding polymicrobial infections, n = 25) in comparison with blood culture was 64.3% overall, 69.0% in oncological patients, and 59.3% in haematological patients. When comparing with a clinical infection criterion, overall sensitivity rose to 74.7%, being higher in oncological patients (80.0%) than in haematological patients (67.7%). Thirty-one microorganisms isolated by culture were not detected by IRIDICA, whereas 42 clinically relevant pathogens not isolated by culture were detected moleculary.
Conclusions
PCR/ESI-MS offers a reliable identification of pathogens directly from whole blood. While additional studies are needed to confirm our findings, the system showed a lower sensitivity in onco-haematological patients in comparison with previously reported results in patients from the Intensive Care Unit."

Objective
To define the clinical features and outcomes of neonatal listeriosis, and identify the maternal risk factors to seek scope for improvement.
Methods
Neonatal listeriosis was identified prospectively from a United Kingdom neonatal infection surveillance network (neonIN) between 2004 and 2014. The participating neonatal units completed a study-specific proforma.
Results
The incidence of neonatal listeriosis was 3.4 per 100,000 live births. Of the 21 cases identified, 19 were confirmed with a median gestational age of 33 weeks and a median birth weight of 1960 g. The majority had clinical features (95%, 18/19), presented within the first 24 h (95%, 18/19), and received penicillin empirically (94%, 18/19). The neonatal case-fatality rate was 21% (24% if probable cases were included). A proportion of mothers were investigated (60%, 12/18) and diagnosed with listeriosis (58%, 7/12); 32% (6/19) were treated with antibiotics but only 33% (6/12) included penicillin.
Discussion
Despite its rarity and the prompt and appropriate use of antibiotics neonatal listeriosis has a high case-fatality rate. There is room for improvement in the adherence to the empiric antibiotic choice for puerperal sepsis, according to the national guidelines as this, would target listeriosis. Strategies should be in place to prevent pregnancy-associated listeriosis in higher risk population."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) cause significant morbidity and mortality among recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Although fluconazole is used widely as an antifungal prophylactic agent in these patients, it is not reliably effective against mold infection including invasive aspergillosis. Micafungin provides antifungal activity against Candida and Aspergillus species, and previous studies have demonstrated its efficacy when used as a prophylactic agent for fungal infection in neutropenic patients. Here, we evaluated and compared the incidence of proven or probable IFIs after antifungal prophylaxis using micafungin or fluconazole.
Methods
This was a prospective, single-center, phase II study involving adult patients who received allogeneic or autologous HSCT. Patients were randomly assigned to micafungin or fluconazole arms in a ratio of 2:1, and the treatment was initiated within 24 h of HSCT and maintained for up to 21 days. The primary end point was the incidence of proven or probable IFIs during the 100 days after HSCT. The secondary end points were the incidence rates of possible, proven, or probable IFIs, need to change the antifungal agent before engraftment, IFI-related mortality, and survival within 100 days after transplantation.
Results
Between March 2010 and May 2015, a total of 257 patients were enrolled. After exclusion of seven patients who did not receive at least one dose of a study treatment, 250 patients (micafungin, n = 165; fluconazole, n = 85) were included in the analysis of clinical efficacy. The median age was 47 years (range, 20–64). Allogeneic and autologous transplantations were performed in 56.0% (n = 140) and 44.0% (n = 110) of the patients, respectively. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two groups. Overall, the incidence of proven and probable IFIs within 100 days of HSCT was 7.6% (n = 19). The percentages of patients who experienced proven or probable IFIs did not differ significantly between the micafungin and fluconazole groups: 7.3% and 8.2%, respectively (p = 0.786). Thirteen patients in the micafungin arm (7.9%) and eight patients in the fluconazole arm (9.4%) needed a change in antifungal agent before engraftment (p = 0.824). Mortality within 100 days after HSCT did not differ significantly between groups: 9.1% vs 12.9% in the micafungin and fluconazole arms, respectively (p = 0.345).
Conclusion
Micafungin is comparable to fluconazole for the prevention of IFIs in HSCT recipients."

Objectives
Detailed information regarding treatment practices and outcomes of MDR-TB treatment in the UK is required as a baseline for care improvements.
Methods
100 consecutive cases between 2008 and 2014 were reviewed retrospectively at 4 MDR-TB treatment centres in England to obtain information on drug treatment choices, hospital admission duration and outcomes for MDR-TB.
Results
Initial hospital admission was long, median 62.5 (IQR 20–106, n = 92) days, and 13% (12/92) of patients lost their home during this period. Prolonged admission was associated with pulmonary cases, cavities on chest radiograph, a public health policy of waiting for sputum culture conversion (CC) and loss of the patient's home. Sputum CC occurred at a median of 33.5 (IQR 16–55, n = 46) days. Treatment success was high (74%, 74/100) and mortality low (1%, 1/100). A significant proportion of the cohort had “neutral” results due to deportation and transfer overseas (12%, (12/100)). 14% (14/100) had negative outcomes for which poor adherence was the main reason (62%, 9/14).
Conclusions
Successful outcome is common in recognised centres and limited by adherence rather than microbiological failure. Duration of hospital admission is influenced by lack of suitable housing and some variation in public health practice. Wider access to long-term assisted living facilities could improve completion rates."

Introduction
QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) is the new generation of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test to identify latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). QFT-Plus includes TB1 and TB2 tubes which contain selected Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) peptides designed to stimulate both CD4 and CD8 T-cells. Aim of this study is the flow cytometric characterization of the specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses to Mtb antigens contained within QFT-Plus.
Methods
We enrolled 27 active tuberculosis (TB) patients and 30 LTBI individuals. Following stimulation with TB1 and TB2, antigen-specific T-cells were characterized by flow cytometry. Data were also correlated with the grade of TB severity.
Results
TB1 mainly elicited a CD4 T-cell response while TB2 induced both CD4 and CD8 responses. Moreover, the TB2-specific CD4 response was detected for both active TB and LTBI patients, whereas the TB2-specific CD8 response was primarily associated with active TB (p = 0.01).
Conclusions
To our knowledge, we report the first characterization of the CD4 and CD8 T-cell response to QFT-Plus. CD8 T-cell response is mainly due to TB2 stimulation which is largely associated to active TB. These results provide a better knowledge on the use of this assay."

Background
After the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Korea, prediction of pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure was emphasized in control of MERS outbreak.
Methods
MERS-CoV infected patients who were managed in a tertiary care center during the 2015 Korean MERS outbreak were reviewed. To analyze predictive factors for pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure, we evaluated clinical variables measured within three days from symptom onset.
Results
A total of 45 patients were included in the study: 13 patients (28.9%) did not develop pneumonia, 19 developed pneumonia without respiratory failure (42.2%), and 13 progressed to respiratory failures (28.9%). The identified predictive factors for pneumonia development included age ≥45 years, fever ≥37.5 °C, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, CRP ≥ 2 mg/dL, and a threshold cycle value of PCR less than 28.5. For respiratory failure, the indicators included male, hypertension, low albumin concentration, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and CRP ≥ 4 mg/dL (all P < 0.05). With ≥ two predictive factors for pneumonia development, 100% of patients developed pneumonia. Patients lacking the predictive factors did not progress to respiratory failure.
Conclusion
For successful control of MERS outbreak, MERS-CoV infected patients with ≥ two predictive factors should be intensively managed from the initial presentation."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
We aimed to determine whether combinations of multiplex cytokine responses could differentiate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection states.
Methods
Mtb-specific antigen-induced and unstimulated cytokines were measured by Luminex assay in supernatants of QuantiFERON® Gold In-Tube assay (QFT) in 48 active pulmonary TB patients (TB), 15 latent TB infection subjects (LTBI), and 13 healthy controls (HCs).
Results
Among the 29 cytokines, eight Mtb antigen-specific biomarkers (GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-3, IL-13, IP-10, and MIP-1β) in the Mtb-infected group were significantly different from those of the HCs. Five Mtb-specific biomarkers (EGF, GM-CSF, IL-5, IL-10, and VEGF), two unstimulated biomarkers (TNF-α[Nil] and VEGF[Nil]), and one Mtb-specific biomarker ratio (IL-2/IFN-γ) showed significant differences between active TB and LTBI. Three unstimulated biomarkers (IL-8[Nil], IL-13[Nil], and VEGF[Nil]) and 5 Mtb-specific biomarkers (IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-3, IP-10, and VEGF) were significantly different between active TB and non-active TB groups. Combinations of three cytokine biomarkers resulted in the accurate prediction of 92.1–93.7% of Mtb-infected cases and 92.3–100% of HCs, respectively. Moreover, combinations of five biomarkers accurately predicted 90.9–100% of active TB cases and 80–100% of LTBI subjects, respectively. In discriminating between active TB and non-active TB regardless of QFT results, combinations of six biomarkers predicted 79.2–95.8% of active TB cases and 67.9–89.3% of non-active TB subjects.
Conclusions
Taken together, our data suggest that combinations of whole blood Mtb antigen-dependent cytokines could serve as biomarkers to determine TB disease states. Especially, VEGF is highlighted as a key biomarker for reflecting active TB, irrespective of stimulation."

Objectives
Besides group A streptococcus (GAS), microbial causes of pharyngitis in children are not well known. We aimed to document the viral and bacterial aetiology of pharyngitis and to assess the pathogenic role of viruses by determining the myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) in the blood as a marker of interferon response.
Methods
In this prospective observational study, throat swabs and blood samples were collected from children (age 1–16 years) presenting to the emergency department with febrile pharyngitis. Microbial cause was sought by bacterial culture, polymerase chain reaction, and serology. Blood MxA level was determined.
Results
A potential pathogen was detected in 88% of 83 patients: GAS alone in 10%, GAS and viruses in 13%, group C or G streptococci alone in 2% and together with viruses in 3%, and viruses alone in 59% of cases. Enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses. Blood MxA levels were higher in children with viral (880 [245–1250] μg/L; median [IQR]) or concomitant GAS-viral (340 [150–710] μg/L) than in those with sole GAS (105 [80–160] μg/L) infections.
Conclusions
Detection of respiratory viruses simultaneously with elevated blood MxA levels supports the causative role of viruses in the majority of children with pharyngitis."

In our study, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus intermedius or combinations of them were found in 3/4 of polymicrobial brain abscesses. Internal organ abscesses are illustrative of the shortcomings of bacterial culture. NGS has the ability to identify both common and rare pathogens without any prior suspicious needed, and is able to offer a new platform for quantification of all detected microorganisms.

To assess the clinical response and renal toxicity observed in chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) patients receiving ≥1 short-courses of liposomal amphotericin (LAmB) (AmBisome®) therapy.
Methods
A retrospective audit of clinical response and renal function was undertaken in 71 CPA patients (41 male) treated with LAmB at the National Aspergillosis Centre, including 20 patients receiving repeated treatment courses or long-term therapy (n = 5).
Results
Median age was 64 years (range 29–86 years). Treatment indications included respiratory symptoms (n = 33; 46.5%), constitutional symptoms (n = 2; 2.8%) or both (n = 36; 50.7%). 48 patients (73.8%) responded to their first LAmB course. Quality of life (QOL) improvements occurred in 37 (92.5%) of 40 patients with sufficient data available. Response rates for repeated short-courses of LAmB were 76.6%; QOL improvements were observed in 91.7% of treatment courses. All patients on long-term therapy demonstrated a response. 34 (50%) and 17 (25%) patients respectively developed an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) or actual AKI with their first treatment; a significant reduction in geometric mean eGFR was observed and a similar pattern occurred following their second treatment course.
Conclusions
Whilst CPA is responsive to LAmB, caution should be exercised with repeated courses, if other treatments are available."

In healthy individuals and in patients with invasive aspergillosis, Aspergillus-specific T-cells in peripheral blood display mainly a Thelper1 phenotype. Although in other fungal infections Thelper17 immunity is important, it was suggested that in aspergillus infection Thelper17 cells do not play a role or may even be detrimental.
Objectives
To compare the cytokine profiles of Aspergillus-specific CD4+ T-cells in peripheral blood and in the lung. To investigate the Thelper phenotype at the primary location of A. fumigatus exposure.
Methods
Lung-derived T-cells and peripheral blood T-cells from COPD-patients were stimulated with overlapping peptides of 6 A. fumigatus proteins. Aspergillus-specific T-cells were identified on the basis of the activation marker CD154 and production of TNFα. In addition, production of the cytokines IFNγ, IL-17, IL-4 and IL-5 by the Aspergillus-specific T-cells was measured.
Results
The majority of lung-derived Aspergillus-specific T-cells displayed a Thelper17 phenotype, and only low percentages of cells produced IFNγ. In contrast, in the peripheral blood of COPD patients Aspergillus-specific T-cells displayed a Thelper1 phenotype, similar as peripheral blood-derived Aspergillus-specific T-cells from healthy individuals.
Conclusions
These data demonstrate that in A. fumigatus infection, similar as in other fungal infections, Thelper17 cells may play a more important role in the immune response than was appreciated until now."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus with similar virulence characteristics as Staphylococcus aureus. Whether S. lugdunensis causes infective endocarditis (IE) in a similar proportion of cases as S. aureus (reported to be 12.6% in a definitive multicenter prospective study) is unclear.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with at least one blood culture positive for S. lugdunensis at our institution from January 2006 to December 2014. We examined microbiology data, ascertained disease severity and determined the proportion of patients with definite or possible IE based on the 2000 Modified Duke Criteria. Because coagulase-negative staphylococci were routinely identified to the species level at our institution from 2012 onwards, we determined the proportion of patients with definite or possible IE before and after implementation of routine speciation. We also compared our results with reported proportions of IE among patients with S. lugdunensis bacteremia (SLB) in other institutions by conducting a systematic review of the scientific literature. Nonparametric bootstrapping methods were performed to determine 95% confidence intervals (CI) for proportions of IE in patients with SLB.
Results
Seventy-four patients with SLB were identified, of whom 64% (47/74) had sepsis by SIRS criteria, and 18% (13/74) had severe illness by Pittsburgh bacteremia score (PBS). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that one-year survival among patients with severe illness was worse than patients with non-severe illness (p = 0.02). Fifteen percent (11/74) of patients had definite or possible IE (95% CI 6.8–23.0%). The proportion of SLB patients with definite or possible IE was 15.8% (6/38, 95% CI 5.3–28.9%) prior to routine speciation and 13.9% (5/36, 95% CI 2.8–27.8%) after routine speciation (p = 0.71). Among patients with at least two positive blood cultures for S. lugdunensis, 25% (10/40, 95% CI 12.5–40.0%) had IE. Systematic review of the literature yielded eight relevant retrospective studies. Of studies that included patients with one or more positive blood cultures for S. lugdunensis, the proportion of IE ranged from 6.3% to 27.0%.
Conclusion
The proportion of definite or possible IE among patients with SLB is similar to the proportion of IE among patients with S. aureus bacteremia. The proportions of IE among patients with SLB at other institutions fall within the 95% CI yielded by bootstrapping. Our findings suggest that growth of S. lugdunensis in two separate blood cultures should prompt consideration of workup for IE."

The emergence and spread of multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria has led to a resurgence in the clinical use of polymyxin antibiotics. However, the prevalence of polymyxin resistance is on the rise at an alarming rate, motivating the idea of combination therapy to sustain the revival of these “old” antibiotics. Although ample evidence in favor of combination therapy has emerged, it seems impracticable and confusing to find a promising combination from the diverse reports or gain adequate information on the efficacy and safety profile. With a stagnating discovery pipeline of novel antimicrobials, there is a clear need to fill the knowledge gaps in translating these basic research data to beneficial clinical practice. In this review, we examined the factors and ambiguities that stand as major hurdles in bringing polymyxin combination therapy to bedside care, highlighting the importance and urgency of incorporating translational research insights into areas of difficulty. We also discussed future research priorities that are essential to gather the necessary evidence and insights for promoting the best possible use of polymyxins in combination therapy."

Objectives
Gram-negative bacteremia may be a harbinger of occult cancer. We examined the risk of cancer following hospitalization with bacteremia.
Methods
Using medical databases, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study of all Danes with a discharge diagnosis of Gram-negative bacteremia during 1994–2013. We calculated absolute risks and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of cancer, comparing the observed risk to that expected in the general population.
Results
We observed 1379 cancers vs. 988 expected among 11,753 patients with Gram-negative bacteremia, corresponding to an overall SIR of 1.40 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.32–1.47). During the first 6 months following the bacteremia diagnosis, the SIR for cancer was 3.33-fold (95% CI: 2.99–3.69) increased, corresponding to an absolute risk of 3.05%. The increased risk stemmed mainly from higher than expected occurrence of gastrointestinal cancer (3- to 13-fold higher), genitourinary cancer (4- to 10-fold higher), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (5-fold higher), non-specified metastatic cancer (5-fold higher), and breast and lung cancer (2-fold higher). The 6–12 months SIR for any cancer was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.22–1.72), and beyond 1 year of follow-up, the SIR declined to 1.13 (95% CI: 1.05–1.20).
Conclusions
Gram-negative bacteremia is a clinical marker of occult cancer."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Better population data on respiratory viruses in children in tropical and southern hemisphere countries is needed.
Methods
The epidemiology of respiratory viruses among healthy children (6 months to <10 years) with influenza-like illness (ILI) was determined in a population sample derived from an influenza vaccine trial (NCT01051661) in 17 centers in eight countries (Australia, South East Asia and Latin America). Active surveillance for ILI was conducted for approximately 1 year (between February 2010 and August 2011), with PCR analysis of nasal and throat swabs.
Results
6266 children were included, of whom 2421 experienced 3717 ILI episodes. Rhinovirus/enterovirus had the highest prevalence (41.5%), followed by influenza (15.8%), adenovirus (9.8%), parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (both 9.7%), coronavirus (5.6%), human metapneumovirus (5.5%) and human bocavirus (HBov) (2.0%). Corresponding incidence per 100 person-years was 29.78, 11.34, 7.03, 6.96, 6.94, 4.00, 3.98 and 1.41. Except for influenza, respiratory virus prevalence declined with age. The incidence of medically-attended ILI associated with viral infection ranged from 1.03 (HBov) to 23.69 (rhinovirus/enterovirus). The percentage of children missing school or daycare ranged from 21.4% (HBov) to 52.1% (influenza).
Conclusions
Active surveillance of healthy children provided evidence of respiratory illness burden associated with several viruses, with a substantial burden in older children."

Objectives
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens our ability to treat the sexually transmitted bacterial infection gonorrhoea. The increasing availability of whole genome sequence (WGS) data from Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates, however, provides us with an opportunity in which WGS can be mined for AMR determinants.
Methods
Chromosomal and plasmid genes implicated in AMR were catalogued on the PubMLST Neisseria database (http://pubmlst.org/neisseria). AMR genotypes were identified in WGS from 289 gonococci for which MICs against several antimicrobial compounds had been determined. Whole genome comparisons were undertaken using whole genome MLST (wgMLST).
Results
Clusters of isolates with distinct AMR genotypes were apparent following wgMLST analysis consistent with the occurrence of genome wide genetic variation. This included the presence of the gonococcal genetic island (GGI), a type 4 secretion system shown to increase recombination and for which possession was significantly associated with AMR to multiple antimicrobials.
Conclusions
Evolution of the gonococcal genome occurs in response to antimicrobial selective pressure resulting in the formation of distinct N. gonorrhoeae populations evidenced by the wgMLST clusters seen here. Genomic islands offer selective advantages to host bacteria and possession of the GGI may, not only facilitate the spread of AMR in gonococcal populations, but may also confer fitness advantages."

Objectives
Recently, genotype 4 HEV (HEV-4) associated hepatitis E has overtaken HEV-1 infections in China, but few studies reported the clinical and virological features of HEV-4 infection.
Methods
Sixty-two patients with acute hepatitis E (AHE) were enrolled from three hospitals in China. Clinical profiles and epidemiological records were analyzed. Patients' serum samples were tested for anti-HEV IgM/IgG and fecal samples were screened for HEV RNA. Representative HEV isolates were partially sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically.
Results
A high median age (57.5 years) and an overwhelming proportion of males (51/62, 82%) were found. Most patients presented with symptoms of jaundice (56/62, 90%), malaise (44/62, 71%), anorexia (44/62, 71%) and nausea (41/62, 66%). Elevated mean values of total bilirubin (186 μmol/L), direct bilirubin (109 μmol/L), ALT (997 IU/L), AST (583 IU/L), ALP (159 IU/L) and GGT (170 IU/L) and reduced albumin level (32 g/L) were observed. The positive rate for anti-HEV IgM/IgG was 100% (62/62)/76% (47/62), for HEV RNA was 58% (25/43). Twelve HEV-4 isolates were obtained.
Conclusion
All HEV isolates belonged to HEV-4 and showed high sequence similarity to swine HEV-4. Most of the sporadic cases had typical clinical symptoms, signs of AHE, and elevated levels of serum bilirubin and liver enzymes."

Objective
guidelines recommend first-line systemic antifungal therapy (SAT) with echinocandins in invasive candidiasis (IC), especially in critically ill patients. This study aimed at assessing the impact of echinocandins compared to azoles as initial SAT on the 28-day prognosis in adult ICU patients.
Methods
From the prospective multicenter AmarCAND2 cohort (835 patients), we selected those with documented IC and treated with echinocandins (ECH) or azoles (AZO). The average causal effect of echinocandins on 28-day mortality was assessed using an inverse probability of treatment weight (IPTW) estimator.
Results
397 patients were selected, treated with echinocandins (242 patients, 61%) or azoles (155 patients, 39%); septic shock: 179 patients (45%). The median SAPSII was higher in the ECH group (48 [35; 62] vs. 43 [31; 58], p = 0.01). Crude mortality was 34% (ECH group) vs. 25% (AZO group). After adjustment on baseline confounders, no significant association emerged between initial SAT with echinocandins and 28-day mortality (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: [0.60; 1.49]; p = 0.82). However, echinocandin tended to benefit patients with septic shock (HR: 0.46 [0.19; 1.07]; p = 0.07).
Conclusion
Patients who received echinocandins were more severely ill. Echinocandin use was associated with a non-significant 7% decrease of 28-day mortality and a trend to a beneficial effect for patient with septic shock."

Objectives
Despite the high frequency of tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/TB co-infected patients, no diagnostic test is available. Here, we investigated whether monocyte/macrophage activation markers can predict TB-IRIS occurrence and if they are modulated by anti-TB treatment.
Methods
Frozen plasma was obtained from 127 HIV/TB co-infected adults naïve for antiretroviral therapy, enrolled in the CAMELIA trial, 36 of whom developed TB-IRIS. Concentrations of IL-1Ra, sCD14, and sCD163 were measured at anti-TB treatment onset (baseline), after 8 weeks of anti-TB treatment and at TB-IRIS time.
Results
At baseline, IL-1Ra and sCD14 concentrations were similar in TB-IRIS and non-IRIS patients. sCD163 concentrations, although significantly higher in TB-IRIS patients, did not remain associated with TB-IRIS occurrence in multivariate analysis. At the time of TB-IRIS, patients displayed higher concentrations of IL-1Ra (p = 0.002) and sCD14 (p < 0.001). The most striking result was the significant decrease in IL-1Ra after 8 weeks of anti-TB treatment (median reduction: −63% (p < 0.0001)).
Conclusions
None of the biomarkers tested was associated with TB-IRIS occurrence. However, repeated measurement of IL-1Ra could help for the diagnosis of TB-IRIS. The substantial reduction of IL-1Ra under treatment suggests that IL-1Ra could be a surrogate biomarker of anti-TB treatment response in HIV-infected patients."

Objectives
We evaluated the ability of the Xpert® MTB/RIF assay to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis in whole blood of children with tuberculosis in tuberculosis endemic settings with high rates of HIV infection.
Methods
From June 2011 to September 2012 we prospectively enrolled children with symptoms or signs suggestive of tuberculosis at three research centres in Tanzania and Uganda. After clinical assessment, respiratory specimens were collected for microscopy and culture, as well as whole blood for Xpert® MTB/RIF. Children were classified according to standardised case definitions.
Results
A total of 232 children were evaluated; 14 (6.0%) had culture-confirmed tuberculosis. The Xpert® MTB/RIF assay detected M. tuberculosis in 5/232 (2.2%) blood samples with 1 (0.4%) error reading and presumably 1 (0.4%) false-positive result. The sensitivity of the assay in children with culture-confirmed (1/14) versus no tuberculosis (1/117) was 7.1% (95% CI, 1.3–31.5). Three of the five Xpert® MTB/RIF positive patients had negative cultures, but were classified as probable tuberculosis cases. Assay sensitivity against a composite reference standard (culture-confirmed, highly probable or probable tuberculosis) was 5.4% (95% CI, 2.1–13.1).

Whole blood Xpert® MTB/RIF demonstrated very poor sensitivity, although it may enhance the diagnostic yield in select cases, with culture-negative tuberculosis."

Objectives
To assess benefits and harms of empirical mono- vs. combination antibiotic therapy in adult patients with severe sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU).
Methods
We performed a systematic review according to the Cochrane Collaboration methodology, including meta-analysis, risk of bias assessment and trial sequential analysis (TSA). We included randomised clinical trials (RCT) assessing empirical mono-antibiotic therapy versus a combination of two or more antibiotics in adult ICU patients with severe sepsis. We exclusively assessed patient-important outcomes, including mortality. Two reviewers independently evaluated studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated and the risk of random errors was assessed by TSA.
Results
Thirteen RCTs (n = 2633) were included; all were judged as having high risk of bias. Carbapenems were the most frequently used mono-antibiotic (8 of 13 trials). There was no difference in mortality (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95–1.29; p = 0.19) or in any other patient-important outcomes between mono- vs. combination therapy. In TSA of mortality, the Z-curve reached the futility area, indicating that a 20% relative risk difference in mortality may be excluded between the two groups. For the other outcomes, TSA indicated lack of data and high risk of random errors.
Conclusions
This systematic review of RCTs with meta-analysis and TSA demonstrated no differences in mortality or other patient-important outcomes between empirical mono- vs. combination antibiotic therapy in adult ICU patients with severe sepsis. The quantity and quality of data was low without firm evidence for benefit or harm of combination therapy."

Objectives
To asses the clinical features, aetiology, antimicrobial resistance and outcomes of bacteraemic cholangitis in patients with solid tumours (ST).
Methods
All consecutive episodes of bacteraemia in hospitalized patients were prospectively analysed (2006–2015).
Results
Of 1852 episodes of bacteraemia, 750 involved patients with ST. Among them, 173 episodes (23%) were due to cholangitis. The most frequent neoplasms were hepato-biliary-pancreatic tumours (68.2%) and gastrointestinal cancer (18.5%); 57.2% of patients had a biliary stent in place. The most frequent causative agents were Escherichia coli (39.3%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.1%) and Enterococcus faecium (7.8%). Forty-one episodes (18.7%) were caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms. Patients with a second episode of cholangitis were more likely to have an MDR isolate and to had received inadequate empirical antibiotic therapy. 7-day and 30-day case-fatality rates were 7.6% and 26%, respectively. The only risk factors independently associated with 30-day case-fatality rate were corticosteroids and malignancy-related complications.
Conclusions
Bacteraemic cholangitis is frequent in patients with ST, and is mainly caused by Enterobacteriaceae and E. faecium. The emergence of MDR is of special concern, particularly in patients with a second episode of bacteraemia. Case-fatality rates are high, especially among patients receiving corticosteroids and presenting malignancy-related complications."

Background
During the 2014–2015 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in N'Zérékoré, Forested Guinea, modes of transmission remained unexamined for a number of new cases. We used network visualization to investigate EVD transmission chains (TC) in seven sub-prefectures of N'Zérékoré in order to adapt outbreak response.
Methods
Between August 2014 and February 2015, the EVD outbreak response team including the World Health Organization (WHO) and local health authorities routinely collected information among new cases regarding hospital visits, cases within a household, participation in burials, as well as dates of symptom onset, serial intervals (SI) and exposure to EVD. SI's were defined as the interval between symptom onset in an index case and symptom onset in a secondary case infected by that index case. Cases who reported hospital visits, contact with a case in the household or participating in burials were attributed to these exposures.
Results
We identified seven TC (two urban and five rural) gathering characteristics of 109 probable/confirmed cases. Overall, 61% (66 cases, SI range: 7–20 days) were household related, 32% (35 cases, SI range 8–30 days) were household or burial related and 7% (8 cases, SI range: 4–20 days) were hospital-related. In the urban chains (18 cases, SI range: 7–20 days), 12 cases were household related and 6 cases were hospital related, none where household or burial related. In the rural chains (84 cases, SI range: 7–30 days), 60% (50 cases) were household related, 1% (1 case) was hospital related and 39% (34 cases) were household or burial related. No cases reported multiple exposures.
Conclusions
Network visualization during field response is crucial in enhancing local control strategies, refining outbreak response and aiding rapid response teams in insuring psychosocial and socio-economic recovery. Urban settings need to focus on reducing hospital EVD transmission whereas rural settings should focus on raising awareness of transmission within a household and safeguarding EVD burials."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a disease of immunocompromised hosts. Cytokines are important mediators of innate and adaptive immune system. The aim of this study was to identify cytokine profiles that correlate with increased risk of IFD.
Methods
We prospectively enrolled 172 adult haematology patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy, and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Pro-inflammatory cytokine profiling using 30-plex Luminex assay was performed at baseline and during treatment. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4.1, TLR4.2, TLR6, CLEC7A, CARD9, and INFG) were investigated among transplant recipients and donors.
Findings
The incidence of IFD in this cohort was 16.9% (29/172). Median baseline serum concentrations of IL-15, IL-2R, CCL2, and MIP-1α were significantly higher whilst IL-4 was lower in patients with proven/probable IFD compared to those with no evidence of IFD. Baseline high IL-2R and CCL2 were associated with increased risk of IFD in the multivariate analysis (adjusted hazard ratio 2.3 [95% CI 1.1–5.1; P = 0.037], and hazard ratio 2.7 [95% CI 1.2–6.1; P = 0.016], respectively). However, these differences were not significant in follow up measurements. Similarly, no significant independent prognostic value was associated with baseline cytokine profile.
Interpretation
High baseline IL-2R and CCL2 concentrations were independent indicators of the risk of developing IFD and could be used to identify patients for enhanced prophylaxis and early antifungal therapy."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
We aimed to investigate the incidence and mortality of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) in a nationwide cohort.
Methods
From the Danish National Patient Registry, we identified all adults hospitalised with a first-time diagnosis of HSE in Denmark during 2004–2014. The HSE diagnoses were verified using medical records and microbiological data. Patients were followed for mortality through the Danish Civil Registry System. We estimated age-standardised incidence rates of HSE and 30-day, 60-day, and 1-year cumulative mortality. Furthermore, we assessed whether calendar year, age, gender, level of comorbidity, virus type, and department type was associated with HSE mortality.
Results
We identified a total of 230 cases of HSE. Median age was 60.7 years (interquartile range: 49.3–71.6). The overall incidence rate was 4.64 cases per million population per year (95% confidence interval: 4.06–5.28). The cumulative mortality within 30 days, 60 days, and 1 year of the HSE admission was 8.3%, 11.3%, and 18.6%, respectively. Advanced age and presence of comorbidity were associated with increased 60-day and 1-year mortality.
Conclusions
This nationwide study of verified HSE found a higher incidence than reported in previous nationwide studies. Presence of comorbidity was identified as a novel adverse prognostic factor. Mortality rates following HSE remain high."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
To compare mortality between de-escalation and continued empirical treatment in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
Methods
Using a nationwide administrative database, we identified adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Escherichia coli (n = 10,231) or of unknown etiology (n = 8247), discharged between July 2010 and March 2013. De-escalation was determined by the spectrum and number of antimicrobials at day 4. We used propensity score matching to obtain 489 pairs of de-escalation and continuation groups among pathogen-identified patients and 278 pairs among culture-negative patients to compare mortalities.
Results
In the pathogen-identified patients, de-escalation was noninferior to continuation in 15-day mortality [5.3% in de-escalation versus 4.3% in continuation, a difference of 1.0% (95% confidence interval, −1.7% to 3.7%)] and in-hospital mortality [8.0% in de-escalation versus 8.8% in continuation, a difference of −0.8% (95% confidence interval, −4.3% to 2.7%)]. In the culture-negative cases, de-escalation was noninferior to continuation in terms of 15-day mortality but not in terms of in-hospital mortality.
Conclusions
Among patients with community-acquired pneumonia of specific etiology, de-escalation was noninferior to continuation of empirical treatment, suggesting that de-escalation is a safe strategy and supporting current recommendations. Safety of de-escalation in culture-negative cases is questionable."

Objectives
Patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) are highly susceptible to various microorganisms. However, no population-based studies have been performed among common viral pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rotavirus (RV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and influenza virus (IV). The objective of this study was to reveal the clinical burden of these four infections among PID patients in Japan.
Methods
We conducted a nationwide survey by sending questionnaires to 898 hospitals with pediatric departments throughout Japan.
Results
Nine hundred ten PID patients from 621 hospitals were registered (response rate: 69.2%). Fifty-four of the patients were hospitalized due to these viral infections. The durations of hospitalization due to RSV and RV infections differed significantly in the PID patients with and without cellular immunodeficiency (12.0 vs 6.5 days, p = 0.041; and 14.0 vs 6.0 days, p = 0.031, respectively). There was no significant difference in the duration of hospitalization in PID patients with and without cellular immunodeficiency who were hospitalized with IV infections (7.3 vs 6.1 days, p = 0.53).
Conclusions
Special attention should be paid to PID patients with compromised cellular immunity who present with RSV and RV infection due to their high risk for severe disease."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
ICU-acquired bloodstream infection (ICUBSI) in Intensive Care unit (ICU) is still associated with a high mortality rate. The increase of antimicrobial drug resistance makes its treatment increasingly challenging.
Methods
We analyzed 571 ICU–BSI occurring amongst 10,734 patients who were prospectively included in the Outcomerea Database and who stayed at least 4 days in ICU. The hazard ratio of death associated with ICU–BSI was estimated using a multivariate Cox model adjusted on case mix, patient severity and daily SOFA.
Results
ICU–BSI was associated with increased mortality (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.16–1.69; p = 0.0004). The relative increase in the risk of death was 130% (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.8–3.0) when initial antimicrobial agents within a day of ICU–BSI onset were not adequate, versus only 20% (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9–1.5) when an adequate therapy was started within a day. The adjusted hazard ratio of death was significant overall, and even higher when the ICU–BSI source was pneumonia or unknown origin. When treated with appropriate antimicrobial agents, the death risk increase was similar for ICU–BSI due to multidrug resistant pathogens or susceptible ones. Interestingly, combination therapy with a fluoroquinolone was associated with more favorable outcome than monotherapy, whereas combination with aminoglycoside was associated with similar mortality than monotherapy.
Conclusions
ICU–BSI was associated with a 40% increase in the risk of 30-day mortality, particularly if the early antimicrobial therapy was not adequate. Adequacy of antimicrobial therapy, but not pathogen resistance pattern, impacted attributable mortality."

Oncovirus-associated malignancies are potentially preventable diseases with major public health significance. Human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) may be associated with oncogenesis or symptomatic illnesses in immunocompromised patients, but the site of viral shedding of most recently discovered HPyVs remains obscure. Using real-time PCR assay using specific primers targeting the HPyV6 large tumor antigen gene, we detected a phylogenetically distinct HPyV6 which was highly prevalent in the bile samples of patients with malignant biliary obstruction (18.8%) and acute gallstone cholangitis (5.5%). The prevalence rate and mean viral load of this HPyV6 were highest in the cholangiocarcinoma subgroup (27.6% and 2.41 × 104copies/ml). These findings were confirmed with another real-time PCR assay using specific primers targeting the HPyV6 viral capsid protein 2 gene. These bile HPyV6 strains may represent a novel clade of HPyV6 as they formed a distinct cluster from the other HPyV6s and exhibited >2% differences in amino acid sequences in their major proteins. While HPyV6 was unlikely the cause of the patients' acute symptoms and liver dysfunction, the virus may be related to immunosuppression in patients with malignancy and/or important in the oncogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma in patients without coinfection with other oncogenic microbes. Further studies to ascertain a causative role of HPyV6 in cholangiocarcinoma should be conducted."

Objectives
To determine the prevalence, risk factors, treatments, and outcomes of bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in adult neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies.
Methods
We reviewed all BSIs between 2008 and 2012 in this population at two New York City oncology centers. A case-control study was conducted to identify CRE BSI risk factors, using three controls of non-CRE BSIs per case.
Results
CRE caused 43 (2.2%) of 1992 BSIs overall and 4.7% of Gram-negative bacteremias. Independent risk factors for CRE BSI were prior β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.2; P = 0.03) or carbapenem (aOR 3.0; P = 0.05) use, current trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (aOR 24; P = 0.001) or glucocorticoid (aOR 5.4, P = 0.004) use, and having a prior CRE culture (aOR 12; P = 0.03). Patients with CRE bacteremia had a median of 52 h from culture collection until receipt of active therapy. They had a 51% BSI-related mortality rate, with a median of 4 days from bacteremia onset until death. CRE-active empirical therapy was associated with a lower 30-day mortality rate (17% vs. 59%; P = 0.08).
Conclusions
CRE are lethal emerging causes of bacteremia in neutropenic patients. New strategies are needed to shorten the delay in administration of CRE-active agents and improve outcomes in this vulnerable population."

Objective
To evaluate the association between HIV and Staphylococcus aureus colonization after confounding by incarceration is removed.
Method
A cross sectional stratified study of all HIV infected and a random sample of HIV-uninfected inmates from two maximum-security prisons in New York State. Structured interviews were conducted. Anterior nares and oropharyngeal samples were cultured and S. aureus isolates were characterized. Log-binomial regression was used to assess the association between HIV and S. aureus colonization of the anterior nares and/or oropharynx and exclusive oropharynx colonization. Differences in S. aureus strain diversity between HIV-infected and uninfected individuals were assessed using Simpson's Index of Diversity.
Results
Among 117 HIV infected and 351 HIV uninfected individuals assessed, 47% were colonized with S. aureus and 6% were colonized with methicillin resistant S. aureus. The prevalence of S. aureus colonization did not differ by HIV status (PR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.76–1.24). HIV infected inmates were less likely to be exclusively colonized in the oropharynx (PR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.30–0.99). Spa types t571 and t064 were both more prevalent among HIV infected individuals, however, strain diversity was similar in HIV infected and uninfected inmates.
Conclusions
HIV infection was not associated with S. aureus colonization in these maximum-security prison populations, but was associated with decreased likelihood of oropharyngeal colonization. Factors that influence colonization site require further evaluation."

Results
Fifty one pulmonary TB cases and 20 healthy HIV-uninfected controls were enrolled in the study. 31 (61%) of the 51 pulmonary TB cases were coinfected with HIV. At day 0 (before TB treatment initiation) the sensitivity of our device was estimated at 94.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83.8–98.8%) and specificity was 90.0% (95% CI, 68.3–98.8%) for distinguishing TB cases from controls. Time-dependent changes in the breath signals were identified as time on TB treatment progressed. Time-dependent signal changes were more pronounced among HIV-uninfected patients.

In Northern China, slow growing mycobacteria (SGM) consistituted 63.7% of all the NTM isolates, while this rate in Southern China was 53.0%. More rapid growing mycobacteria (RGM) were present in southern China than the northern (χ2 = 57.996, P < 0.001). According to the coastal provinces' data (from north to south), the NTM prevalence rate and the number of isolated NTM species increased apparently in accordance with geographic latitude. The information obtained in this assay will facilitate the NTM disease diagnosis and screening policy making in China."

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a serious infection that may occasionally rapidly evolve provoking organ dysfunctions. We aimed to characterize CAP presenting with organ dysfunctions at the emergency room, with regard to host factors and causative microorganisms, and its impact on 30-day mortality. 460 of 4070 (11.3%) CAP patients had ≥2 dysfunctions at diagnosis, with a 30-day mortality of 12.4% vs. 3.4% in those with one or no dysfunctions. Among them, the most frequent causative microorganisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae, gram-negatives and polymicrobial etiology. Independent host risk factors for presenting with ≥2 dysfunctions were: liver (OR 2.97) and renal diseases (OR 3.91), neurological disorders (OR 1.86), and COPD (OR 1.30). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (OR 6.41) and bacteraemic episodes (OR 1.68) had the higher independent risk among microorganisms. The number of organ dysfunctions vs. none increased at 30-day mortality: three organs (OR 11.73), two organs (OR 4.29), and one organ (OR 2.42) whereas Enterobacteria (OR 3.73) were also independently related to mortality. The number of organ dysfunctions was the strongest 30-day mortality risk factor while Enterobacteriaceae was also associated with poorer outcome. The assessment of organ dysfunctions in CAP should be implemented for management, allocation and treatment decisions on initial evaluation."

abstract = "Summary
The demonstrated variable efficacy of the only licensed TB vaccine Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette–Guérin (M. bovis BCG) encourages the need for new vaccine candidates against TB. Antigen specific cellular immune response is often considered imperative during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection and antigens that are strongly associated with the latent phase of infection are drawing increasing attention for anti-TB vaccine development. Here, we investigated the phenotypic and functional profiles of two novel mycobacterial antigens Rv2251 and Rv2721c during T cell recall response via multi-color flow cytometry. Healthy household contacts of TB (latent/HHC) and active pulmonary TB (PTB) patients were recruited to investigate the difference in antigen specific T cell recall response. These two antigens induced expansion of CD45RA− CCR7+ central memory subtypes and CD45RA− CCR7− effector memory cells in latent population which suggests their possible association with HHC. Rv2251 and Rv2721c antigen specific IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 response was also significantly high in HHC when compared to the PTB (p < 0.005, p < 0.05 and p < 0.05 respectively). The frequency of multifunctional T cells also was high in HHC compared to the PTB with statistical significance only for the antigen Rv2251. Often, the dominant Th1 immune response in HHC is correlated with the protection against the active TB disease. Collectively, we report the first insights into Rv2251 and Rv2721c antigen specific immune response in human donors of TB and provide the immunologic rationale for selecting them for vaccine development against TB."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Elevated vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) have been reported to adversely affect clinical outcome in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection (BSI). We therefore examined the association between vancomycin MIC and outcome considering various potential confounders.
Methods
Clinical data and bacterial isolates were prospectively collected from patients with MRSA BSI from 2006 to 2012 as part of the Invasive Staphylococcus aureus Infection Cohort (INSTINCT) study. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by Etest, broth microdilution (BMD) and VITEK 2. Bacterial genotypes were determined by spa typing. Using univariate and Cox regression analyses, we investigated the impact of low (≤1.0 mg/L) and high (≥1.5 mg/L) vancomycin Etest MIC on clinical outcomes.
Results
Ninety-one MRSA BSI episodes were included, of which 79 (86.8%) were caused by spa types t003, t032 and t045. High vancomycin MICs were seen only if using Etest but not confirmed using standard reference BMD. When episodes were stratified into low and high vancomycin Etest MIC groups, 30-day overall mortality was 34.5% and 27.3%, respectively (P = 0.64, OR 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27–1.79). Variables significantly associated with all-cause mortality in the Cox model were age (P = 0.003), acute physiology score (P = 0.0006), and Charlson comorbidity index (P = 0.018).
Conclusions
Vancomycin MICs may vary dependent on testing methodologies and local MRSA epidemiology. The patients' underlying disease and individual comorbidities rather than elevated vancomycin MICs determine adverse clinical outcomes in MRSA BSI. Routine Etest MIC testing of MRSA isolates is of limited value for treatment decisions."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is rare but remains one of the most feared infectious diseases worldwide. We linked multiple national datasets to describe disease characteristics and outcomes of IMD in England over a five-year period.
Methods
IMD cases confirmed by Public Health England (2007–11) were linked with national hospitalisation records and death registrations. Cases were analysed by age, gender, capsular group, clinical presentation, diagnostic test and outcome. Risk factors for death were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.
Results
Overall, 4619 of 5115 (90.30%) laboratory-confirmed IMD cases were successfully linked to a hospitalisation record. Group B meningococci were responsible for 87.33% (n = 4034) of hospitalised IMD cases, ranging from 93.56% (2294/2452) in <15 year-old to 53.52% (152/284) among ≥65 year-old. Most cases presented with meningitis only (n = 2057, 44.53%), septicaemia only (n = 1725, 37.35%) or both meningitis and septicaemia (n = 389, 8.42%). Over half the cases (2526/4619, 54.69%) were confirmed by PCR only, 22.91% (1058/4619) by culture only and 22.41% (1035/4619) by both. The case fatality rate was 4.46% (206/4619; 95% CI, 3.88–5.10%) and varied by age, clinical presentation and capsular group. Children under 15 years who died within 30 days of diagnosis were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed by culture than by PCR alone (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.02–2.39; P = 0.040).
Conclusions
We identified complex interactions between age, meningococcal capsular group, clinical presentation, diagnostic method and death. The recent introduction of two new meningococcal immunisation programmes in the UK should significantly reduce IMD cases and deaths in the coming years."

Background
The aim of this combined in-vitro and in-vivo study was to investigate whether state of the art dialysis modalities produce false positive serum 1,3-ß-d-Glucan (BDG) levels.
Methods
Dialysis fluid for simulated dialysis treatments was spiked with BDG from different sources. Samples were taken from the dialysate and dialyzer blood compartments at various time points. In addition, serum samples were obtained in three groups of patients without invasive fungal disease: a.) twelve patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD)/hemodiafiltration (HDF); b.) ten patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD); and c.) ten patients with stable chronic kidney disease (CKD) but without dialysis.
Results
Median BDG levels in BDG spiked dialysate were 3250.9, 2050.4, and 390.1 pg/ml respectively. All corresponding samples from the blood compartments were BDG negative. In HD/HDF patients no increase of serum BDG levels could be observed over the duration of treatment. 71/72 BDG tests in this group remained negative. BDG tests were also negative in 9/10 CAPD patients, both in in- and outflow dialysates as well as in all ten patients with CKD.
Conclusion
We conclude that state of the art renal replacement therapies using up-to-date treatments are not a cause of falsely elevated serum BDG levels."

abstract = "Summary
Major human pathogens are frequently isolated from meat-producing animals, particularly poultry. Among them is Enterococcus faecalis, which is known to be one of the main cause of human urinary-tract infections worldwide. Early in 2015, we detected several, consecutive abnormal increases in the weekly number of human E. faecalis infections in various medical settings in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region of France, especially including community-acquired urinary-tract infections. Speculating that this region-wide epidemiological event may have originated from animal-based food, we initiated this work to provide an overview of the epidemiology of E. faecalis, with a particular focus on the possible link between E. faecalis clones isolated from food-producing animals and those responsible for human urinary-tract infections. At that time, only one study had clearly identified strong epidemiological links between E. faecalis clones isolated from food-producing animals and human E. faecalis urinary-tract infections. This observation, coupled with our region-wide epidemiological experience, leads us to strongly believe that E. faecalis is a real zoonotic pathogen with potentially highly significant impact on human health. This is of particular concern because of its ability to acquire antibiotic-resistance genes and to infect animals and humans. Various strategies must be urgently implemented to address this public health threat, in particular through the development and implementation of large integrated automated surveillance systems based on animal and human health data to enable us to detect E. faecalis epidemiological events."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The burden of fungal disease in the UK is unknown. Only limited data are systematically collected. We have estimated the annual burden of invasive and serious fungal disease.
Methods
We used several estimation approaches. We searched and assessed published estimates of incidence, prevalence or burden of specific conditions in various high risk groups. Studies with adequate internal and external validity allowed extrapolation to estimate current UK burden. For conditions without adequate published estimates, we sought expert advice.
Results
The UK population in 2011 was 63,182,000 with 18% aged under 15 and 16% over 65. The following annual burden estimates were calculated: invasive candidiasis 5142; Candida peritonitis complicating chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis 88; Pneumocystis pneumonia 207–587 cases, invasive aspergillosis (IA), excluding critical care patients 2901–2912, and IA in critical care patients 387–1345 patients, <100 cryptococcal meningitis cases. We estimated 178,000 (50,000–250,000) allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis cases in people with asthma, and 873 adults and 278 children with cystic fibrosis. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis is estimated to affect 3600 patients, based on burden estimates post tuberculosis and in sarcoidosis.
Conclusions
Uncertainty is intrinsic to most burden estimates due to diagnostic limitations, lack of national surveillance systems, few published studies and methodological limitations. The largest uncertainty surrounds IA in critical care patients. Further research is needed to produce a more robust estimate of total burden."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Improved diagnostics for typhoid are needed; a typhoid controlled human infection model may accelerate their development and translation. Here, we evaluated a blood culture-PCR assay for detecting infection after controlled human infection with S. Typhi and compared test performance with optimally performed blood cultures.
Methodology/Principal findings
Culture-PCR amplification of blood samples was performed alongside daily blood culture in 41 participants undergoing typhoid challenge. Study endpoints for typhoid diagnosis (TD) were fever and/or bacteraemia. Overall, 24/41 (59%) participants reached TD, of whom 21/24 (86%) had ≥1 positive blood culture (53/674, 7.9% of all cultures) or 18/24 (75%) had ≥1 positive culture-PCR assay result (57/684, 8.3%). A further five non-bacteraemic participants produced culture-PCR amplicons indicating infection; overall sensitivity/specificity of the assay compared to the study endpoints were 70%/65%. We found no significant difference between blood culture and culture-PCR methods in ability to identify cases (12 mismatching pairs, p = 0.77, binomial test). Clinical and stool culture metadata demonstrated that additional culture-PCR amplification positive individuals likely represented true cases missed by blood culture, suggesting the overall attack rate may be 30/41 (73%) rather than 24/41 (59%). Several participants had positive culture-PCR results soon after ingesting challenge providing new evidence for occurrence of an early primary bacteraemia.
Conclusions/Significance
Overall the culture-PCR assay performed well, identifying extra typhoid cases compared with routine blood culture alone. Despite limitations to widespread field-use, the benefits of increased diagnostic yield, reduced blood volume and faster turn-around-time, suggest that this assay could enhance laboratory typhoid diagnostics in research applications and high-incidence settings."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
Pseudomonas aeruginosa often presents multi-drug resistance (MDR) in intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired pneumonia (ICUAP), possibly resulting in inappropriate empiric treatment and worse outcomes. We aimed to identify patients with ICUAP at risk for these pathogens in order to improve treatment selection and outcomes.
Methods
We prospectively assessed 222 consecutive immunocompetent ICUAP patients confirmed microbiologically. We determined the characteristics, risk factors, systemic inflammatory response and outcomes of P. aeruginosa pneumonia (Pa-ICUAP), compared to other aetiologies. We also compared patients with MDR vs. non-MDR Pa-ICUAP.
Results
Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent aetiology (64, 29%); 22 (34%) cases had MDR. Independent predictors for Pa-ICUAP were prior airway colonization by P. aeruginosa, previous antibiotic treatment, solid cancer and shock; alcohol abuse and pleural effusion were independently associated to lower risk for Pa-ICUAP. Chronic liver disease independently predicted MDR among Pa-ICUAP. The inflammatory biomarkers were similar between all groups. Patients with Pa-ICUAP had lower unadjusted 90-day survival (p = 0.049). However, the 90-day survival adjusted for confounding factors using a propensity score did not differ between all groups.
Conclusion
Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains the most frequent aetiology of ICUAP, with high prevalence of MDR. These risk factors should be taken into account to avoid inappropriate empiric antibiotics for Pa-ICUAP. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, regardless multidrug resistance, was not associated with different propensity-adjusted survival."

abstract = "Summary
Numerous different pathogens are responsible for infective peripheral neuropathies and this is generally the result of the indirect effects of pathogen infection, namely anti pathogen antibodies cross reacting with epitopes on peripheral nerve, auto reactive T cells attacking myelin, circulating immune complexes and complement fixation. Primary infection of Schwann cells (SC) associated with peripheral nerve inflammation is rare requiring pathogens to cross the Blood Peripheral Nerve Barrier (BPNB) evade anti-pathogen innate immune pathways and invade the SC. Spirochetes Borrelia bourgdorferi and Trepomema pallidum are highly invasive, express surface lipo proteins, but despite this SC are rarely infected. However, Trypanosoma cruzi (Chaga's disease) and Mycobacterium leprae. Leprosy are two important causes of peripheral nerve infection and both demonstrate primary infection of SC. This is due to two novel strategies; T. cruzi express a trans-silalidase that mimics host neurotrophic factors and infects SC via tyrosine kinase receptors. M. leprae demonstrates multi receptor SC tropism and subsequent infection promotes nuclear reprogramming and dedifferentiation of host SC into progenitor stem like cells (pSLC) that are vulnerable to M. leprae infection. These two novel pathogen evasion strategies, involving stem cells and receptor mimicry, provide potential therapeutic targets relevant to the prevention of peripheral nerve inflammation by inhibiting primary SC infection."

Objectives
We sought to determine the association between previous daptomycin exposure and daptomycin non-susceptible Enterococcus faecium (DNSEf) bloodstream infections (BSI) in adult leukemia patients.
Methods
We retrospectively identified adult (≥18 years old) leukemia patients with Enterococcus spp. bacteremia at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) from 6/1/2013 to 7/22/2015. Antimicrobial susceptibility and previous antibiotic exposure within the 90 days prior to bacteremia were collected. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to identify the most significant breakpoint between daptomycin exposure and DNSEf.
Results
Any amount of daptomycin received within the 90 days preceding BSI was significantly associated with isolation of DNSEf compared to daptomycin susceptible E. faecium (DSEf) (88% vs. 44%, respectively, p < 0.01). CART analysis identified receiving ≥13 days of daptomycin in the preceding 90 days as most significantly correlated with DNSEf (60% vs. 11%, relative risk [RR] 5.31, 95% Confidence interval [CI] 2.36–11.96, p < 0.01).
Conclusions
Prior daptomycin exposure for ≥13 days within 90 days preceding BSI was significantly associated with isolation of DNSEf BSI in adult leukemia patients at our institution. Antimicrobial stewardship initiatives aimed at minimizing daptomycin exposure in high-risk patients may be of significant benefit in limiting the emergence of DNSEf."

Background
Tuberculosis-diabetes co-morbidity (TB-DM) is characterized by increased inflammation with elevated circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines and other factors. Circulating angiogenic factors are intricately involved in the angiogenesis-inflammation nexus.
Methods
To study the association of angiogenic factors with TB-DM, we examined the systemic levels of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, VEGF-R3 in individuals with either TB-DM (n = 44) or TB alone (n = 44).
Results
Circulating levels of VEGF-A, C, D, R1, R2 and R3 were significantly higher in TB-DM compared to TB individuals. Moreover, the levels of VEGF-A, C, R2 and/or R3 were significantly higher in TB-DM with bilateral or cavitary disease or with hemoptysis, suggesting an association with both disease severity and adverse clinical presentation. The levels of these factors also exhibited a significant positive relationship with bacterial burdens and HbA1c levels. In addition, VEGF-A, C and R2 levels were significantly higher (at 2 months of treatment) in culture positive compared to culture negative TB-DM individuals. Finally, the circulating levels of VEGF-A, C, D, R1, R2 and R3 were significantly reduced following successful chemotherapy at 6 months.
Conclusion
Our data demonstrate that TB-DM is associated with heightened levels of circulating angiogenic factors, possibly reflecting both dysregulated angiogenesis and exaggerated inflammation."

Objectives
To determine cost-effectiveness of three community-based acute HIV infection (AHI) testing algorithms compared to HIV antibody testing alone by focusing on the potential of averting new infections occurring within a one-year time horizon among men who have sex with men (MSM).
Methods
Data sources for model parameters included actual cost and prevalence data derived from a community-based AHI screening program in San Diego, and published studies. Main outcome measure was costs per infection averted (IA). The lower end of the cost range of discounted lifetime costs of an HIV infection (i.e. $236,948) was used for defining cost-effectiveness.
Results
The most sensitive algorithm for AHI detection, which was based on HIV nucleic acid amplification testing, was estimated to prevent between 5 and 45 transmissions, with simulated costs per infection averted between $965 and $141,256 when compared to HIV antibody testing alone.
Conclusion
AHI testing was cost-effective in preventing new HIV infections among at risk MSM in San Diego, and also among other MSM populations with similar HIV prevalence but lower proportions of AHI diagnoses. These results indicate that community-based AHI testing among MSM in the United States can pay for itself over the long run."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The aim of this study is to investigate the “weekend effect” and early mortality of patients with severe sepsis.
Methods
Using the Taiwanese National Healthcare Insurance Research Database, all patients who were hospitalized for the first time with an episode of severe sepsis between January 2000 and December 2011 were identified and the short-term mortality of patients admitted on weekdays was compared to those admitted on weekends. The primary endpoint was 7-day mortality. The secondary endpoints were 14 and 28-day mortality.
Results
A total of 398,043 patients were identified to have had the diagnosis of severe sepsis. Compared with patients admitted on weekends, patients admitted on weekdays had a lower 7-day mortality rate (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% confidential interval [CI] 0.87–0.91), 14-day mortality rate (adjusted OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.90–0.93), and 28-day mortality rate (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95–0.98). This “weekend effect” was maintained every year throughout the 11-year study period.
Conclusions
Patients with severe sepsis are more likely to die in the hospital if they were admitted on weekends than if they were admitted on weekdays."

Recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) has been recognized as a significant threat to global public health. The disease was present in large parts of the Americas, the Caribbean, and also the western Pacific area with southern Asia during 2015 and 2016. However, little is known about the factors affecting the transmission of ZIKV. We used Gradient Boosted Regression Tree models to investigate the effects of various potential explanatory variables on the spread of ZIKV, and used current with historical information from a range of sources to assess the risks of future ZIKV outbreaks. Our results indicated that the probability of ZIKV outbreaks increases with vapor pressure, the occurrence of Dengue virus, and population density but decreases as health expenditure, GDP, and numbers of travelers. The predictive results revealed the potential risk countries of ZIKV infection in the Asia-Pacific regions between October 2016 and January 2017. We believe that the high-risk conditions would continue in South Asia and Australia over this period. By integrating information on eco-environmental, social-economical, and ZIKV-related niche factors, this study estimated the probability for locally acquired mosquito-borne ZIKV infections in the Asia-Pacific region and improves the ability to forecast, and possibly even prevent, future outbreaks of ZIKV."

Objectives
Data from a vaccine trial and from post-vaccine surveillance in the United Kingdom have suggested that the bivalent HPV-16/18 vaccine offers cross-protection against HPV-6/11 and protection against anogenital warts (AGW). We studied the effect of the bivalent vaccine on genital HPV-6/11 positivity and AGW in the Netherlands.
Methods
We included all vaccine-eligible women from the PASSYON study, a biennial cross-sectional study among 16- to 24-year-old sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic attendants. Vaginal self-swabs were analyzed for type specific HPV and AGW were diagnosed at the STI-clinic. Prevalence of HPV-6 and/or HPV-11 and AGW were compared between self-reported vaccinated and unvaccinated women by log-binomial regression analysis, adjusted for demographics and risk behavior.
Results
Of the 1198 women included, 56% reported to be vaccinated at least once. Relative to unvaccinated women, the adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) for HPV-6/11 was 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74–1.43) for women vaccinated at least once. The crude PR for AGW was 0.67 (95% CI 0.22–2.07) for women vaccinated at least once. Adjustment did not change these results.
Conclusions
We observed no cross-protective effect of the bivalent vaccine on genital HPV-6/11 positivity and a non-significant partially protective effect on AGW."

Context
The Greater Stockholm HIV Cohort Study is an initiative to provide longitudinal information regarding the health of people living with HIV.
Objective
Our aim was to explore the prevalence of HIV and its association with psychiatric co-morbidities.
Design, setting and participants
All patients with a recorded diagnosis of HIV (any position of the ICD–10 codes B20–B24) were identified during the period 2007–2014 and related to the total population in Stockholm by January 1, 2015, N = 2.21 million. The age at diagnosis, gender, and first occurrence of an HIV diagnosis was recorded. Analyses were done by age and gender. Prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidities amongst HIV patients were recorded.
Main outcome measures
Age-adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated with logistic regression for prevalent psychiatric co-morbidities in HIV infected individuals compared to the prevalence in the general population.
Results
The total prevalence of HIV was 0.16%; females 0.10% (n = 1134) and males 0.21% (n = 2448). HIV-infected people were more frequently diagnosed with psychiatric illnesses and drug abuse. In females and males with HIV-diagnosis respectively, drug dependence disorder was 7.5 (7.76% vs 1.04%) and 5.1 (10.17% vs 1.98%) times higher, psychotic disorders were 6.3 (2.65% vs 0.42%) and 2.9 (1.43% vs 0.49%) times higher, bipolar disorder was 2.5 (1.41% vs 0.57%) and 3 (1.02% vs 0.34%) times higher, depression diagnosis was 1.5 (8.47% vs 5.82%) and 3.4 (10.17% vs 2.97%) higher, trauma-related disorder was 1.5 (6.00% vs 4.10%) respectively 2.9 (4.45% vs 1.56%) times higher, anxiety disorder was 1.2 (6.88% vs 5.72%) and 2.2 (6.54% vs 2.93%) times higher than in their non-infected peers.
Conclusion
Despite effective ART, many individuals with HIV have an impaired mental health and a history of drug abuse that may threaten the vision of a contained epidemic."

Objectives
Data describing long-term mortality in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is scarce. This study investigated risk factors, causes of death and temporal trends in long-term mortality associated with SAB.
Methods
Nationwide population-based matched cohort study. Mortality rates and ratios for 25,855 cases and 258,547 controls were analyzed by Poisson regression. Hazard ratio of death was computed by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.
Results
The majority of deaths occurred within the first year of SAB (44.6%) and a further 15% occurred within the following 2–5 years. The mortality rate was 14-fold higher in the first year after SAB and 4.5-fold higher overall for cases compared to controls. Increasing age, comorbidity and hospital contact within 90 days of SAB was associated with an increased risk of death. The overall relative risk of death decreased gradually by 38% from 1992–1995 to 2012–2014. Compared to controls, SAB patients were more likely to die from congenital malformation, musculoskeletal/skin disease, digestive system disease, genitourinary disease, infectious disease, endocrine disease, injury and cancer and less likely to die from respiratory disease, nervous system disease, unknown causes, psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease and senility. Over time, rates of death decreased or were stable for all disease categories except for musculoskeletal and skin disease where a trend towards an increase was seen.
Conclusion
Long-term mortality after SAB was high but decreased over time. SAB cases were more likely to die of eight specific causes of death and less likely to die of five other causes of death compared to controls. Causes of death decreased for most disease categories. Risk factors associated with long-term mortality were similar to those found for short-term mortality. To improve long-term survival after SAB, patients should be screened for comorbidity associated with SAB."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Convalescent blood therapy has been a promising form of treatment for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), but less attention has been focused on it for treatment.
Method
We assessed the effectiveness of convalescent whole blood (CWB) in the treatment of consented EVD patients. We recruited 69 subjects in December 2014 up to April 2015, at the 34 Military Hospital in Wilberforce and the PTS 1 Ebola Treatment Unit in Hastings, Freetown. Forty-four were given CWB, and 25 who consented but preferred to be exempted from the CWB treatment were used to compare clinical outcomes. All were given routine treatment used at the Ebola Treatment Unit.
Results
One of 44 subjects treated with CWB dropped out of the study and 31 recovered while 12 succumbed to the disease with a case fatality rate of 27.9%. For the group that was given routine treatment without CWB, 11 died with a case fatality rate of 44%. There was a significant difference between admission viral load and viral load after the first 24 h of treatment with convalescent whole blood (P < 0.01). The odds ratio for survival with CWB was 2.3 (95% CI, 0.8–6.5).
Conclusion
CWB is promising for treating EVD in resource-poor settings, especially in the early phases of outbreaks when resource-mobilization is done. Even though our sample size was small and the evaluation was not randomised, our results contribute to existing evidence that convalescent whole blood could be considered as a useful candidate for treating EVD. Further studies that are randomised will be required to further assess the efficacy of CWB as treatment option during any EVD outbreak."

Objectives
Gut dysbiosis has been associated with several clinically relevant conditions, including alterations of central nervous system (CNS) structure and function development. This review discussed aspects of the relationship between gut microbiota and the CNS during development.
Methods
PubMed was used to search for all of the studies published over the last 15 years using the key word “microbiota” and “gut” or “intestinal” and “nervous system”. More than 350 articles were found, and only those published in English and providing data on aspects related to neurologic diseases were included in the evaluation.
Results
The data indicate that the gut microbiota influences CNS development and function and that gut dysbiosis is associated with significant neurological problems. However, most of these data have been collected in experimental animals and cannot be transferred to humans. Moreover, it is not definitively established whether neurologic diseases depend on a generic modification of the gut microbiota or whether a single bacterial phylum or species plays a specific role for any single condition. Furthermore, limited information exists regarding protective bacteria.
Conclusions
Both probiotics and prebiotics can have different impacts on CNS according to the microbial species or oligosaccharides that are administered. In humans, particularly in children, several factors may be important in conditioning gut microbiota modifications; unfortunately, most of these factors act simultaneously. More efforts are required to fully define both the array of complex behaviors that are influenced by the gut microbiota at the CNS level and the mechanisms involved."

Objectives
Researchers have advocated for an increased awareness of occult cancer among herpes zoster patients, but there are no systematic reviews to support these claims. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of evidence on zoster and risk of occult cancer.
Methods
Through February 18, 2016, we searched PubMed, EMBASE and references of relevant papers for studies on zoster and risk of any cancer. One author screened retrieved papers by title and abstract; included papers were reviewed by two authors for eligibility, data extraction, and potential biases. Despite statistical heterogeneity, associations were consistently in the same direction and we therefore computed pooled relative risks using random-effects models.
Results
We identified 46 eligible studies, 10 of which considered all cancer types combined. The pooled relative risk for any cancer was 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.18, 1.71) overall and 1.83 (95% confidence interval: 1.17, 2.87) at one year after zoster. Considering cancer subtypes, the highest estimates were generally reported for occult hematological cancer. The absolute risk of any cancer at one year after presentation with zoster was 0.7–1.8%.
Conclusion
This study supports an association between zoster and occult cancer, but the low absolute risk of cancer limits the clinical implications."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
To perform an external validation study of risk scores, identified through a systematic review, predicting outcome in community-acquired bacterial meningitis.
Methods
MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for articles published between January 1960 and August 2014. Performance was evaluated in 2108 episodes of adult community-acquired bacterial meningitis from two nationwide prospective cohort studies by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the calibration curve, calibration slope or Hosmer–Lemeshow test, and the distribution of calculated risks.
Findings
Nine risk scores were identified predicting death, neurological deficit or death, or unfavorable outcome at discharge in bacterial meningitis, pneumococcal meningitis and invasive meningococcal disease. Most studies had shortcomings in design, analyses, and reporting. Evaluation showed AUCs of 0.59 (0.57–0.61) and 0.74 (0.71–0.76) in bacterial meningitis, 0.67 (0.64–0.70) in pneumococcal meningitis, and 0.81 (0.73–0.90), 0.82 (0.74–0.91), 0.84 (0.75–0.93), 0.84 (0.76–0.93), 0.85 (0.75–0.95), and 0.90 (0.83–0.98) in meningococcal meningitis. Calibration curves showed adequate agreement between predicted and observed outcomes for four scores, but statistical tests indicated poor calibration of all risk scores.
Interpretation

Objectives
We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of paediatric urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE), identify predisposing factors and examine their effect on the length of hospital stay (LOS).
Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases for studies that provide data on the rate of ESBL-PE among paediatric UTIs.
Results
Out of 1828 non-duplicate citations, 16 studies reporting a total of 7374 cases of UTI were included. The prevalence of ESBL-PE was 14% [(95%CI 8, 21)]. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) [OR = 2.79, (95%CI 1.39, 5.58)], history of UTI [OR = 2.89 (95%CI 1.78, 4.68)] and recent antibiotic use [OR = 3.92, (95%CI 1.76, 8.7)] were identified as risk factors. The LOS was significantly longer among children infected with ESBL-PE, compared to those infected with other uropathogens. [SMD = 0.88, (95%CI 0.40, 1.35)].
Conclusions
In the paediatric population, 1 out of 7 UTIs are caused by ESBL-PE. Patients with VUR, previous UTI or recent antibiotic use constitute a high risk group and these pathogens are associated with increased LOS. The significant incidence of ESBL-PE in this population should be taken into consideration in the development of empiric treatment protocols and antibiotic stewardship programmes, especially in high-prevalence areas."

Objectives
To study clinical features and outcome of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in alcoholic patients.
Methods
Patients with a history of alcoholism were selected from our nationwide, prospective cohort on community-acquired bacterial meningitis performed from March 2006 to October 2014. Data on patient history, symptoms and signs on admission, treatment, and outcome were prospectively collected.
Results
Of 1359 included episodes, 88 episodes (6%) occurred in 88 alcoholic patients. Seizures as presenting symptom were present in 18% alcoholic patients, and 23% presented with co-existing pneumonia. Causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae in 76%, Listeria monocytogenes in 8%, and Neisseria meningitidis in 6% of patients. A high rate of systemic complications occurred with respiratory failure in 40% and endocarditis in 9% of patients. Outcome was unfavorable in 58% of alcoholic patients, and 25% died. Alcoholism was associated with unfavorable outcome in a multivariate analysis (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.12–3.46; P = 0.019), but not with death (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.35–1.68; P = 0.762).
Conclusion
Alcoholic bacterial meningitis patients often have an unfavorable outcome, which appears to result from a high rate of systemic complications, mainly respiratory failure. Seizures are common in alcoholic patients and warrant caution of development of an alcohol withdrawal syndrome."

Objectives
Persistence with an antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen for HIV can be defined as the length of time a patient remains on therapy before stopping or switching. We aimed to describe ART persistence in treatment naïve patients starting therapy in the United Kingdom, and to describe differential persistence by treatment regimen.
Methods
We performed a retrospective cohort study at eight UK centres of ART-naïve adults commencing ART between 2012 and 2015. Aggregate data were extracted from local treatment databases. Time to discontinuation was compared for different third agents and NRTI backbones using incidence rates.
Results
1949 patients contributed data to the analysis. Rate of third agent change was 28 per 100 person-years of follow up [95% CI 26–31] and NRTI backbone change of 15 per 100 person-years of follow up [95% CI 14–17]). Rilpivirine, as co-formulated rilpivirine/tenofovir/emtricitabine had a significantly lower discontinuation rate than all other third agents and, excluding single tablet regimens, co-formulated tenofovir/emtricitabine had a significantly lower discontinuation rate than co-formulated abacavir/lamivudine. The reasons for discontinuation were not well recorded.
Conclusions
Treatment discontinuation is not an uncommon event. Rilpivirine had a significantly lower discontinuation rate than other third agents and tenofovir/emtricitabine a lower rate than co-formulated abacavir/lamivudine."

A paucity of data describing citizen perceptions of novel technologies, including those containing unsupervised computer-controlled systems is currently available. We explored citizen perceptions of using a microneedle biosensor and automated dose control system at a university public festival. Groups of citizens (from 2–6 people per group) attended a short demonstration of a microneedle biosensor and automated dosing system versus a traditional phlebotomy approach over a two-day public festival. Individual groups discussed and reached consensus on a number of short questions regarding their perceptions on the acceptability of such technology. Over the two days, 100 groups participated (56/100 day 1 and 44/100 day 2). The majority of individuals reported high acceptability of microneedle technology (median Likert score 9/10), but the majority believed that doctors should decide what dose of antibiotic is delivered (75/100; 75%). Groups concurred with the acceptability of microneedles to reduce blood tests and pain associated with them. However, concerns were reported over unsupervised computer-controlled programmes making decision about antibiotic dosing. This was driven by concerns over computer error and the inability of systems to contextualise decision making to the human and social context. Future work must consider the greater role of citizen engagement in the development of such technologies, to ensure their acceptability upon implementation in clinical practice."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
Vitamins are known to be associated with immunity and nutrition. Moreover, vitamin deficiency can affect host immunity to various infectious diseases, including tuberculosis. Although patients with tuberculosis often have vitamin D deficiency, little is known about the levels of other vitamins. Here, we aimed to investigate the status of vitamins A, B12, D, and E in patients with tuberculosis. We also aimed to investigate the clinical and laboratory variables related to vitamin status in patients with tuberculosis.
Methods
We performed a case-control study to investigate the serum vitamin concentrations in 152 patients with tuberculosis and 137 control subjects. The concentrations of vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, homocysteine, and methylmalonic acid were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Patient demographic data and other biochemical parameters were also analyzed.
Results
The serum concentrations of vitamins A, D, and E were significantly lower in patients with tuberculosis than in control subjects (1.4 vs. 2.0 μmol/L, P < 0.001; 10.6 vs. 19.3 ng/mL, P < 0.001; and 22.8 vs. 30.6 μmol/L, P < 0.001, respectively). In contrast, the methylmalonic acid levels were higher in patients with tuberculosis (134.9 vs. 110.8 nmol/L, P < 0.001). The prevalences of vitamin deficiencies were significantly higher in patients with tuberculosis. Moreover, multiple vitamin deficiencies were only observed in patients with tuberculosis (22.4% of all patients with tuberculosis vs. 0% of all control subjects). Positive correlations among vitamin A, D, and E concentrations were observed (vitamins A and D, r = 0.395; vitamins D and E, r = 0.342; and vitamins A and E, r = 0.427, P < 0.001). Body mass index, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, iron, and total iron-binding capacity all showed positive correlations with vitamin A, D, and E concentrations.
Conclusions
Vitamin deficiencies are common in patients with tuberculosis. Further research investigating the clinical importance of vitamin and nutritional status in patients with tuberculosis is needed."

Objectives
The ß-D-glucan assay (BDG) has been added to the EORTC/MSG criteria for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections (IFI), but data from pediatric populations is scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate performance of BDG in a cohort of hemato-oncological children with hematological malignancy at risk for IFI.
Methods
113 patients were included through an 18-month period. In addition to routine IFI screening, BDG was assayed once a week. IFIs were classified using EORTC/MSG criteria without including the BDG results. Performances were assessed after a ROC analysis for optimization and multivariate analysis to detect the causes of false positivity.
Results
8 proven and 4 probable IFIs, and 7 possible IFIs were diagnosed in 9 and 7 patients, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity increased from 75% and 56% to 100% and 91.1%, respectively when considering the whole population and patients not having received any antifungals prior to the test. Multivariate analysis revealed that being younger than 7, severe colitis/mucositis, recent administration of polyvalent immunoglobulins and digestive colonization with Enterococcus sp were independent risk factors for false positivity.
Conclusions
BDG is a valuable test to detect IFI in pediatric patients not previously treated with antifungals and to detect the occurrence of chronic infection."

Objectives
Although n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFAs) are used widely in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, their effect in infectious disease requires a particular attention.
Methods
The present article discusses their anti-inflammatory and immune properties involved in the host defence and presents a systematic review of the effects of their oral administration on the prevention and outcome of experimental and clinical infections.
Results
At a dose corresponding to an human dose of 500 mg/day, n-3 LC-PUFAs intake is beneficial against experimental infections caused by extracellular pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus by reducing inflammation, and reduces the incidence of pneumococcal infections in the elderly, but at 2–4-fold higher doses as occurs in some human intervention and/or during long-term it becomes detrimental in intestinal infections with Citrobacter rodentium or Helicobacter hepaticus by exacerbating anti-inflammatory response. They are also harmful against infections caused by intracellular pathogens as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella, Influenza virus and Herpes simplex virus by affecting the immune cell response.
Conclusion
The effects of n-3-LC-PUFAs on infections depend on the pathogen and the n-3 LC-PUFA dose and timing. Caution should be recommended for high-dose and long-term supplementation in humans."

Background
Respiratory viruses are detectable in a large proportion of adults hospitalised with acute respiratory illness. For influenza and other viruses there is evidence that viral load and persistence are associated with certain clinical outcomes but it is not known if there is an association between viral load and hospital length of stay.
Methods
306 adults hospitalised with viral acute respiratory illness were studied. Associations between viral load and length of stay were examined. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to control for age, comorbidity, influenza vaccine status, duration of illness prior to hospitalisation, bacterial co-infection, clinical group and virus subtype.
Results
High viral load was associated with a longer duration of hospitalisation for all patients (p < 0.0001). This remained significant across all virus types and clinical groups and when adjusted for age, comorbidity, duration of illness prior to hospitalisation, bacterial co-infection and other factors.
Conclusions
High viral loads are associated with prolonged hospital length of stay in adults with viral acute respiratory illness. This further supports existing evidence demonstrating that viral acute respiratory illness is a viral load driven process and suggests that viral load could be used in clinical practise to predict prolonged hospitalisation and prioritise antivirals.

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
We have shown that the routine use of a multiple decontamination regimen with oropharyngeal and digestive polymyxin/tobramycin/amphotericin B plus mupirocin/chlorhexidine in intubated patients reduced all-cause acquired infections (AIs) in the intensive care unit (ICU). We now assessed the long-term impact of this strategy on AIs involving multidrug-resistant aerobic Gram negative bacilli (AGNB) and acquired episodes of extended-spectrum betalactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae rectal carriage.
Methods
This was an observational single center study of all patients admitted to an ICU over 5 years (study population). Decontamination was given for the period of intubation and standard care otherwise. AIs and colonization rates were prospectively recorded. AIs rates were compared between the study period and a 1-year pre-intervention period. During study, trends were analyzed by semester using a Poisson regression model.
Results
The incidence rate of multidrug-resistant AGNB AIs was lower during the study (1.59 per 1000 patient-days, versus pre-intervention: 5.43‰, p < 0.001) and declined with time (adjusted OR = 0.85, 95 percent confidence interval 0.77–0.93, p < 0.001). ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae acquired colonization episodes (OR = 0.94 [0.88–1.00] P = 0.04) and the use of five major antibiotics (p < 0.001) also declined.
Conclusion
A multiple decontamination regimen did not favor the emergence of multidrug-resistant AGNB. In contrast, infection and colonization rates declined with time."

Objectives
This article systematically reviews research on the costs of sepsis and, as a secondary aim, evaluates the quality of economic evaluations reported in peer-reviewed journals.
Methods
We systematically searched the MEDLINE, National Health Service (Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Economic Evaluation and Health Technology Assessment), Cost-effectiveness Analysis Registry and Web of Knowledge databases for studies published between January 2005 and June 2015. We selected original articles that provided cost and cost-effectiveness analyses, defined sepsis and described their cost calculation method. Only studies that considered index admissions and re-admissions in the first 30 days were published in peer-reviewed journals and used standard treatments were considered. All costs were adjusted to 2014 US dollars. Medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for various costs of sepsis were calculated. The quality of economic studies was assessed using the Drummond 10-item checklist.
Results
Overall, 37 studies met our eligibility criteria. The median of the mean hospital-wide cost of sepsis per patient was $32,421 (IQR $20,745–$40,835), and the median of the mean ICU cost of sepsis per patient was $27,461 (IQR $16,007–$31,251). Overall, the quality of economic studies was low.
Conclusions
Estimates of the hospital-related costs of sepsis varied considerably across the included studies depending on the method used for cost calculation, the type of sepsis and the population that was examined. A standard model for conducting cost improve the quality of studies on the costs of sepsis."

Objectives
The reported prevalence of anti-hepatitis E virus antibodies in HIV-positive patients from industrialized countries varies greatly. It is also difficult to compare these data with the anti-IgG prevalence in the general population because age and sex are not matched in most studies. Moreover, MSM are at increased risk of viral hepatitis.
Methods
HEV is endemic in southwestern France. We investigated therefore 300 HIV-infected patients consecutively attending the out-patient clinic of Toulouse University Hospital. Each HIV-infected patient was matched for sex and age with 2 healthy blood donors from the same area. They were tested for anti-HEV IgM and IgG.
Results
Anti-HEV IgG was found in 116 HIV-infected patients (38.7%) and in 284 matched controls (47.3%, p = 0.027). However, anti-HEV IgG concentration tended to be lower in HIV-patients than in controls. Anti-HEV IgM prevalence was similar HIV-infected patients (3.6%) and in matched controls (3.8%, p = 0.85).
Conclusion
The prevalence and concentrations of anti-HEV IgG in HIV-infected patients from Southern-France were lower than in controls, suggesting a weaker humoral response. But their prevalences of anti-HEV IgM were similar, indicating a high incidence of HEV infection. These data do not indicate that HEV is transmitted sexually."

After adjustment by different covariate factors and propensity score, antibiotic therapy was still independently associated with a lower incidence of septic shock at admission (OR 0.54 [95% CI 0.31–0.95], p = 0.03) and less need for invasive ventilation (OR 0.38 [95% CI 0.16–0.91], p = 0.03). In this cohort, recent use of antibiotics before hospital admission in CAP seems to be associated with a lower incidence of septic shock on admission and a lower need for invasive ventilation."

Objectives
To study the diagnostic accuracy of clinical and laboratory features in the diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) infection and bacterial meningitis.
Methods
We included consecutive adult episodes with suspected CNS infection who underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination. The reference standard was the diagnosis classified into five categories: 1) CNS infection; 2) CNS inflammation without infection; 3) other neurological disorder; 4) non-neurological infection; and 5) other systemic disorder.
Results
Between 2012 and 2015, 363 episodes of suspected CNS infection were included. CSF examination showed leucocyte count >5/mm3 in 47% of episodes. Overall, 89 of 363 episodes were categorized as CNS infection (25%; most commonly viral meningitis [7%], bacterial meningitis [7%], and viral encephalitis [4%]), 36 (10%) episodes as CNS inflammatory disorder, 111 (31%) as systemic infection, in 119 (33%) as other neurological disorder, and 8 (2%) as other systemic disorders. Diagnostic accuracy of individual clinical characteristics and blood tests for the diagnosis of CNS infection or bacterial meningitis was low. CSF leucocytosis differentiated best between bacterial meningitis and other diagnoses (area under the curve [AUC] 0.95) or any neurological infection versus other diagnoses (AUC 0.93).
Conclusions
Clinical characteristics fail to differentiate between neurological infections and other diagnoses, and CSF analysis is the main contributor to the final diagnosis."

Objective
A 2-stage, phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled study in healthy adults to assess immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose at three dose levels of a 3-antigen Staphylococcus aureus vaccine (SA3Ag) containing recombinant clumping factor A (ClfA) and capsular polysaccharides 5 and 8 (CP5 and CP8) conjugated to a diphtheria toxoid.
Methods
Six months after initial single vaccination, in Stage 2, SA3Ag recipients were randomized (1:1) to booster vaccination or placebo, while Stage 1 placebo recipients received placebo again. Pre- and post-vaccination blood samples were analyzed.
Results
In Stage 2 (n = 345), pre-booster CP5 and CP8 titers remained high with no increase post-booster. ClfA titers remained high after initial vaccination and increased post-booster, approaching the peak response to the initial dose. Post-booster local reactions were more frequent and of greater severity than reported after the initial vaccination, particularly for the high-dose level recipients. Post hoc analysis showed no dose–response pattern and no obvious association between diphtheria toxoid titers and local reactions after initial or booster vaccination.
Conclusion
Immune responses after the initial vaccination persisted for the 12 months studied, with little additional response after the booster dose at 6 months. Post-booster injection site reactions were more frequent and more severe but self-limiting.

Objectives
We describe haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequencing in an apparent cross-site influenza A(H1N1) outbreak in renal transplant and haemodialysis patients, confirmed with whole genome sequencing (WGS).
Methods
Isolates were sequenced from influenza positive individuals. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using HA and NA sequencing and subsequently WGS. Sequence data was analysed to determine genetic relatedness of viruses obtained from inpatient and outpatient cohorts and compared with epidemiological outbreak information.
Results
There were 6 patient cases of influenza in the inpatient renal ward cohort (associated with 3 deaths) and 9 patient cases in the outpatient haemodialysis unit cohort (no deaths). WGS confirmed clustered transmission of two genetically different influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains initially identified by analysis of HA and NA genes. WGS took longer, and in this case was not required to determine whether or not the two seemingly linked outbreaks were related.
Conclusion
Rapid sequencing of HA and NA genes may be sufficient to aid early influenza outbreak investigation making it appealing for future outbreak investigation. However, as next generation sequencing becomes cheaper and more widely available and bioinformatics software is now freely accessible next generation whole genome analysis may increasingly become a valuable tool for real-time Influenza outbreak investigation."

Background
Human Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is one of the severest enteroviruses that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) among children. This study identified the mutations of EV-A71 VP1 amino acid residues over a number of years and explored the possible association of identified mutations and HFMD epidemic outbreaks in Shenzhen, China.
Methods
A total of 3760 stool specimens were collected from HFMD patients by Shenzhen Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between 1998 and 2013. In total 289 VP1 strains were sequenced in this study, and amino acids mutation frequency was calculated. There were 2040 China nationwide sequences downloaded from Genebank as replication data.
Results
In our samples, 1036 subjects (27.6%) were EV-A71 infected. Three amino acid positions on VP1 protein were found to have high mutation prevalence. These are Q22H, S283T, and A289H. Site 22 showed a fast mutation fixation in the year 2008, at the time of the large scale epidemic outbreak in Shenzhen. Analysis of the nationwide data replicated the same trend of mutation prevalence of the three sites.
Conclusion
The switching from Q to H on site 22 of the EV-A71 VP1 strain might be associated with the HFMD outbreak in Shenzhen in 2008. The identified amino acid sites 22, 283 and 289 provided information for developing anti-viral drugs against EV-A71 in the future."

Objectives
Given increasing frequency of heatwaves and growing public health concerns associated with foodborne disease, we examined the relationship between heatwaves and salmonellosis in Adelaide, Australia.
Methods
Poisson regression analysis with Generalised Estimating Equations was used to estimate the effect of heatwaves and the impact of intensity, duration and timing on salmonellosis and specific serotypes notified from 1990 to 2012. Distributed lag non-linear models were applied to assess the non-linear and delayed effects of temperature during heatwaves on Salmonella cases.
Results
Salmonella typhimurium PT135 notifications were sensitive to the effects of heatwaves with a twofold (IRR 2.08, 95% CI 1.14–3.79) increase in cases relative to non-heatwave days. Heatwave intensity had a significant effect on daily counts of overall salmonellosis with a 34% increase in risk of infection (IRR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01–1.78) at >41 °C. The effects of temperature during heatwaves on Salmonella cases and serotypes were found at lags of up to 14 days.
Conclusion
This study confirms heatwaves have a significant effect on Salmonella cases, and for the first time, identifies its impact on specific serotypes and phage types. These findings will contribute to the understanding of the impact of heatwaves on salmonellosis and provide insights that could mitigate their impact."

Objectives
To analyze the impact of late presentation (LP) on overall mortality and causes of death and describe LP trends and risk factors (2004–2013).
Methods
Cox models and logistic regression were used to analyze data from a nation-wide cohort in Spain. LP is defined as being diagnosed when CD4 < 350 cells/ml or AIDS.
Results
Of 7165 new HIV diagnoses, 46.9% (CI95%:45.7–48.0) were LP, 240 patients died. First-year mortality was the highest (aHRLP.vs.nLP = 10.3[CI95%:5.5–19.3]); between 1 and 4 years post-diagnosis, aHRLP.vs.nLP = 1.9(1.2–3.0); and >4 years, aHRLP.vs.nLP = 1.5(0.7–3.1). First-year's main cause of death was HIV/AIDS (73%); and malignancies among those surviving >4 years (32%). HIV/AIDS-related deaths were more likely in LP (59.2% vs. 25.0%; p < 0.001). LP declined from 55.9% (2004–05) to 39.4% (2012–13), and reduced in 46.1% in men who have sex with men (MSM) and 37.6% in heterosexual men, but increased in 22.6% in heterosexual women. Factors associated with LP: sex (ORMEN.vs.WOMEN = 1.4[1.2–1.7]); age (OR31–40.vs.<30 = 1.6[1.4–1.8], OR41–50.vs.<30 = 2.2[1.8–2.6], OR>50.vs.<30 = 3.6[2.9–4.4]); behavior (ORInjectedDrugUse.vs.MSM = 2.8[2.0–3.8]; ORHeterosexual.vs.MSM = 2.2[1.7–3.0]); education (ORPrimaryEducation.vs.University = 1.5[1.1–2.0], ORLowerSecondary.vs.University = 1.3[1.1–1.5]); and geographical origin (ORSub-Saharan.vs.Spain = 1.6[1.3–2.0], ORLatin-American.vs.Spain = 1.4[1.2–1.8]).
Conclusions
LP is associated with higher mortality, especially short-term- and HIV/AIDS-related mortality. Mid-term-, but not long-term mortality, remained also higher in LP than nLP. LP decreased in MSM and heterosexual men, not in heterosexual women. The groups most affected by LP are low educated, non-Spanish and heterosexual women."

Objective
In three U.S. State Public Health Laboratories (PHLs) using a fourth-generation immunoassay (IA), an HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation antibody IA and a nucleic acid test (NAT), we characterized the yield and time to reporting of acute infections, and cost per positive specimen.
Methods
Routine HIV testing data were collected from July 1, 2012–June 30, 2013 for Massachusetts and Maryland PHLs, and from November 27, 2012–June 30, 2013 for Michigan PHL. Massachusetts and Michigan used fourth-generation and differentiation IAs with NAT conducted by a referral laboratory. In Maryland, fourth-generation IA repeatedly reactive specimens were followed by a Western blot (WB), and those with negative or indeterminate results were tested with a differentiation IA and HIV-1 NAT, and if positive by NAT, confirmed by a different HIV-1 NAT. Specimens from WB-positive persons at risk for HIV-2 were tested with a differentiation IA and, if positive, with an HIV-2 WB and/or differential HIV-1/HIV-2 proviral DNA polymerase chain reaction.
Results
Among 7914 specimens from Massachusetts PHL, 6069 from Michigan PHL, and 36,266 from Maryland PHL, 0.10%, 0.02% and 0.05% acute infections were identified, respectively. Massachusetts and Maryland PHLs each had 1 HIV-2 positive specimen. The median time from specimen receipt to laboratory reporting of results for acute infections at Massachusetts, Michigan and Maryland PHLs was 8, 11, and 7 days respectively. The laboratory cost per HIV positive specimen was $336 (Massachusetts), $263 (Michigan) and $210 (Maryland).
Conclusions
Acute and established infections were found by PHLs using fourth-generation IA in conjunction with antibody tests and NAT. Time to reporting of acute HIV test results to clients was suboptimal, and needs to be streamlined to expedite treatment and interrupt transmission."

Objectives
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is strongly associated with anti-biotic treatment, and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading indication for anti-biotic prescription in hospitals. This study assessed the incidence of and risk factors for CDI in a cohort of patients hospitalized with CAP.
Methods
We analysed data from a prospective, observational cohort of patients with CAP in Edinburgh, UK. Patients with diarrhoea were systematically screened for CDI, and risk factors were determined through time-dependent survival analysis.
Results
Overall, 1883 patients with CAP were included, 365 developed diarrhoea and 61 had laboratory-confirmed CDI. The risk factors for CDI were: age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06 per year; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03–1.08), total number of antibiotic classes received (HR, 3.01 per class; 95% CI, 2.32–3.91), duration of antibiotic therapy (HR, 1.09 per day; 95% CI, 1.00–1.19 and hospitalization status (HR, 13.1; 95% CI, 6.0–28.7). Antibiotic class was not an independent predictor of CDI when adjusted for these risk factors (P > 0.05 by interaction testing).
Conclusions
These data suggest that reducing the overall antibiotic burden, duration of antibiotic treatment and duration of hospital stay may reduce the incidence of CDI in patients with CAP."

As individuals may be colonized with multiple strains of Staphylococcus aureus at different body sites, the objectives of this study were to determine whether S. aureus polyclonal colonization exists within one body niche and the optimal sampling sites and culture methodology to capture the diversity of S. aureus strains in community-dwelling individuals.
Methods
Swabs were collected from the nares, axillae, and inguinal folds of 3 children with community-associated S. aureus infections and 11 household contacts, all with known S. aureus colonization. S. aureus isolates were recovered from each body niche using 4 culture methods and evaluated for polyclonality using phenotypic and genotypic strain characterization methodologies.
Results
Within individuals, the mean (range) number of phenotypes and genotypes was 2.4 (1–4) and 3.1 (1–6), respectively. Six (43%) and 10 (71%) participants exhibited phenotypic and genotypic polyclonality within one body niche, respectively. Broth enrichment yielded the highest analytical sensitivity for S. aureus recovery, while direct plating to blood agar yielded the highest genotypic strain diversity.
Conclusions
This study revealed S. aureus polyclonality within a single body niche. Culture methodology and sampling sites influenced the analytical sensitivity of S. aureus colonization detection and the robustness of phenotypic and genotypic strain recovery."

Objectives
Beijing strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) is characterized by a high incidence of transmission, relapse, and drug resistance. This study aimed to determine host immune responses to antigens derived from the Beijing/K strain which has been highly prevalent in tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks in South Korea.
Methods
We recruited 52 TB patients and 96 healthy subjects comprising 31 individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI) and 65 TB-naïve controls based on QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-IT) tests. Blood samples were obtained for diluted whole-blood assays, multiplex bead arrays, ELISpot assays, and HLA typing. Molecular genotyping of M. tb was performed using clinical isolates.
Results
Active TB and LTBI groups were differentiated by TNF-α concentrations induced by the Beijing/K strain-derived antigens, MTBK_24790 and MTBK_24800 (P < 0.001). MTBK_24800-induced IFN-γ and CXCL10 concentrations discriminated the TB-infected groups from TB-naïve controls (P < 0.001). IFN-γ-producing T cells were generated in 87.2% of TB patients in response to MTBK_24800 peptide antigens. The major immunogenic epitope was at C-terminal of the antigen, and predominantly recognized by HLA-DR4 and -DQ4.
Conclusions
Measurement of IFN-γ, CXCL10, and TNF-α concentrations induced by MTBK_24790 and MTBK_24800 may contribute to improved diagnosis of TB and vaccine development in regions where the Beijing/K strain is endemic."

Objectives
Legionnaires' disease (LD) is a severe disease associated with community and hospital-acquired pneumonia, frequently under diagnosed. The main aim of our study was to determine the value of PCR for the diagnosis of LD in routine clinical practice.
Methods
In a prospective study, from March 2007 to April 2010, the value of PCR on non-invasive respiratory specimens (NIRS) was compared to those of the other available tools for LD diagnosis in patients hospitalized for pneumonia.
Results
Among 254 consecutive cases of pneumonia included, 24 cases were LD (19 confirmed and 5 probable) representing the first documented microbiological etiology. Molecular diagnosis of LD was performed on NIRS by using 16S rRNA PCR, and secondarily mip PCR, with no discrepant results between the 2 methods: it was found positive in 14 cases and led to identify 2 supplementary probable cases of LD. Based on clinical and at least 2 positive LD tests, PCR yielded a better diagnostic value than antigen urinary test (12 vs 10 cases).
Conclusion
These results revealed that molecular diagnosis of LD on NIRS is reliable and may contribute to better identify cases of LD."

abstract = "Summary
Pertussis or whooping cough, mainly caused by the Gram-negative coccobacillus Bordetella pertussis, is a severe respiratory disease that can by life-threatening especially in young infants. It has recently made a spectacular come-back in high vaccination-coverage countries, such as the US, Australia and many European countries. Although a trend towards increased pertussis incidence was already visible before the switch from whole-cell to acellular vaccines, it was really since the introduction of the acellular vaccines that the number of cases reached record highs. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these observations. Unexpectedly fast waning of acellular vaccine-induced protection may be one of the major reasons. Furthermore, evidence from a recent non-human primate model suggests that acellular vaccines, although protective against pertussis disease, do not protect against B. pertussis infection, which may explain many of the current observations on the resurgence of pertussis. Optimized use of current vaccines has been explored, including cocoon vaccination of persons in close contact with newborn infants, neonatal vaccination and maternal immunization during pregnancy. All have their inherent limitations. New vaccines are therefore desperately needed, and current efforts have been geared towards the identification of novel antigens and adjuvants to prolong immunity and ameliorate protection. The most advanced vaccine candidate is live attenuated nasal BPZE1, a genetically modified B. pertussis derivative that has recently completed a first-in-man phase I trial and was shown to be safe in young male volunteers, able to transiently colonize the naso-pharynx and to induce antibody responses to B. pertussis antigens. This vaccine candidate is designed to protect against both pertussis disease and B. pertussis infection and may therefore be useful for long-term control of pertussis."

Objectives
We aimed to identify clinical characteristics and to assess effectiveness of different initial antibiotic regimens in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Haemophilus influenzae.
Methods
Characteristics were compared between patients with H. influenzae monoinfection versus CAP of other and unknown aetiology enrolled by the German prospective cohort study CAPNETZ. Impact of initial antibiotic treatment on “early clinical response” according to FDA criteria and overall clinical cure were analysed.
Results
H. influenzae was found in 176 out of 2790 patients with pathogen detection (6.3%). Characteristics significantly associated with a H. influenzae CAP (p < 0.017) included purulent sputum, prior pneumococcal vaccination and respiratory co-morbidities. Early clinical response rates on day 4 did not differ between patients receiving any mono- versus combination therapy (85.9% versus 88%), but were numerically higher for regimens including any fluoroquinolone (96.7%) and lower under macrolide monotherapy (70%). Initial CURB-65 score and chronic liver disease were identified as negative predictors for “early clinical response”. At day 14, overall clinical cure was 91.9%.
Conclusions
H. influenzae was a common CAP pathogen, particularly in patients with previous pneumococcal vaccination and respiratory co-morbidities. Severity of illness and chronic liver disease were associated with a lower rate of “early clinical response”."

abstract = "Summary
The incidence and likely causes of fever of unknown origin (FUO) have changed over the last few decades, largely because enhanced capabilities of laboratory testing and imaging have helped confirm earlier diagnoses. History and examination are still of paramount importance for cryptogenic infections. Adolescents who have persisting nonspecific complaints of fatigue sometimes are referred to Pediatric Infectious Diseases consultants for FUO because the problem began with an acute febrile illness or measured temperatures are misidentified as “fevers”. A thorough history that reveals myriad symptoms when juxtaposed against normal findings on examination and simple laboratory testing can suggest a diagnosis of “fatigue of deconditioning”. “Treatment” is forced return to school, and reconditioning. The management of patients with acute onset of fever without an obvious source or focus of infection is dependent on age. Infants under one month of age are at risk for serious and rapidly progressive bacterial and viral infections, and yet initially can have fever without other observable abnormalities. Urgent investigation and pre-emptive therapies usually are prudent. By two months of age, clinical judgment best guides management. Between one and two months of age, a decision to investigate or not depends on considerations of the height and duration of fever, the patient's observable behavior/interaction, knowledge of concurrent family illnesses, and likelihood of close observation and follow up. Children 6 months–36 months of age with acute onset of fever who appear well and have no observable focus of infection can be evaluated clinically, without laboratory investigation or antibiotic therapy, unless risk factors elevate the likelihood of urinary tract infection."

To disclose the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and cryptococcosis in HIV-uninfected patients.
Methods
Case patients' diagnoses with cryptococcosis and cryptococcal meningitis were based on data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2000 to 2010, and diagnoses were defined using the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. A case–control study comprising inpatient and outpatient populations was conducted using 4 controls for each patient (4587 case patients and 18,348 controls) matched for age, sex, monthly income, and urbanization level.
Results
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected patients with cryptococcosis were more likely to have diabetes than matched control patients (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.36–1.64; p < 0.001).

Objectives
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia is a leading cause of infant mortality worldwide. The risk of RSV infection associated with preterm birth is not well-characterized in resource-limited settings. We aimed to obtain precise estimates of risk factors and disease burden of RSV in infants in rural southern Nepal.
Methods
Pregnant women were enrolled, and along with their infants, followed to six months after birth with active weekly home-based surveillance for acute respiratory illness (ARI). Mid-nasal swabs were obtained and tested for RSV by PCR for all illness episodes. Birth outcomes were assessed at a postpartum home visit.
Results
311 (9%) of 3509 infants had an RSV ARI. RSV ARI incidence decreased from 551/1000 person-years in infants born between 28 and 31 weeks to 195/1000 person-years in infants born full-term (p = 0.017). Of 220 infants (71%) evaluated in the health system, 41 (19%) visited a hospital or physician. Of 287 infants with an assessment performed, 203 (71%) had a lower respiratory tract infection.
Conclusions
In a rural south Asian setting with intensive home-based surveillance, RSV caused a significant burden of respiratory illness. Preterm infants had the highest incidence of RSV ARI, and should be considered a priority group for RSV preventive interventions in resource-limited settings."

Background
The role of galactomannan (GM) in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) has been extensively evaluated in hematological patients, however its performance in non-hematological patients is not well established.
Methods
We performed a multicenter retrospective study in 3 university hospitals in Madrid, Spain between 2010 and 2014. The study population comprised patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and patients with immunosuppressive conditions in whom IPA was suspected and for whom BALF GM was available. Patients with hematological disorders were excluded.
Results
A total of 188 patients (35 with COPD and 153 with immunosuppressive conditions) were analyzed, and 31 cases of IPA (proven or probable) were identified. The global sensitivity of BALF GM (optical density index [ODI] ≥ 1.0) was 77.4%; sensitivity was higher in patients with immunosuppressive conditions than in patients with COPD (81.8% vs 66.7%; p: 0.38). In COPD patients, the best performance was obtained for BALF GM (ODI ≥ 0.5), although sensitivity (88.9%) was similar to that of BALF fungal culture (88.9%). The sensitivity of GM in serum was very poor in both populations (36.4% and 11.6%, respectively).
Conclusions
In the present series, the diagnostic performance of BALF GM was good for IPA in non-hematological patients, especially in patients with immunosuppressive conditions."

To describe a spatio-temporal cluster of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) due to serogroup C meningococci, occurred in a restricted area of Tuscany between January and October 2015, and the results of whole genome sequencing (WGS).
Methods
Surveillance activities and public health measures were implemented in the Region. Bacterial isolates from IMD cases were characterized by the National Reference Laboratory of the Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS), and WGS was performed on available strains. The kSNP software was used to identify core genome SNPs.
Results
Overall, 28 IMD cases due to meningococcus C were identified up to 31st October, 2015. Of them, 26 were due to meningococcus C:P1.5-1,10-8: F3-6:ST-11 (cc11) and 2 to C:P1.5-1,10-8: F3-6:ST-2780 (cc11). WGS of 13 meningococci isolated during the outbreak occurred in Tuscany in 2015 showed higher similarity when compared with those of 47 C: P1.5-1,10-8: F3-6:ST-11 (cc11) invasive strains from sporadic cases previously detected in Italy.
Conclusions
A highly aggressive meningococcal C strain was involved in the cluster of severe IMD occurred in Tuscany, a Region with high vaccine coverage among children. Whether this was due to low herd immunity related to the short duration of vaccine protection needs further investigation."

We reported on occurrence and impact of neurological sequelae after bacterial meningitis.
Methods
We reviewed occurrence of neurological sequelae in children and adults after pneumococcal and meningococcal meningitis.
Results
Most frequently reported sequelae are focal neurological deficits, hearing loss, cognitive impairment and epilepsy. Adults with pneumococcal meningitis have the highest risk of developing focal neurological deficits, which are most commonly caused by cerebral infarction, but can also be due to cerebritis, subdural empyema, cerebral abscess or intracerebral bleeding. Focal deficits may improve during clinical course and even after discharge, but a proportion of patients will have persisting focal neurological deficits that often interfere in patient's daily life. Hearing loss occurs in a high proportion of patients with pneumococcal meningitis and has been associated with co-existing otitis. Children and adults recovering from bacterial meningitis without apparent neurological deficits are at risk for long-term cognitive deficits. Early identification of neurological sequelae is important for children to prevent additional developmental delay, and for adults to achieve successful return in society after the disease.
Conclusions
Neurological sequelae occur in a substantial amount of patients following bacterial meningitis. Most frequently reported sequelae are focal neurological deficits, hearing loss, cognitive impairment and epilepsy."

Objectives
To compare the distribution of capsular groups and factor H-binding protein (fHBP) variants among meningococcal isolates and non-culture clinical specimens and to assess the representativeness of group B isolates amongst group B cases as a whole.
Methods
A PCR sequencing assay was used to characterise fHBP from non-culture cases confirmed from January 2011 to December 2013. These were compared to genotypic data derived from whole genome analysis of isolates received during the same period.
Results
Group W and Y strains were more common among isolates than non-culture strains. The distribution of fHBP variants among group B non-culture cases generally reflected that seen in the corresponding isolates. Nonetheless, the non-culture subset contained a greater proportion of fHBP variant 15/B44, associated with the ST-269 cluster sublineage.
Conclusions
Differences in capsular group and fHBP distribution among culture and non-culture cases may be indicative of variation in strain viability, diagnostic practice, disease severity and/or clinical presentation. Future analyses combining clinical case information with laboratory data may help to further explore these differences. Group B isolates provide a good representation of group B disease in E&W and, therefore, can reliably be used in fHBP strain coverage predictions of recently-licensed vaccines."

To determine changes in mortality among adults with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) after introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in children.

An active surveillance of adults with culture-proven IPD in Barcelona. Serotype-specific mortality and rates of disease and death were analysed in three periods: baseline (1994–2001), PCV7 (2002–2009) and PCV13 (2010–2013).
Results
Overall, IPD caused by PCV7 serotypes was associated with increased case fatality rate (24 percent). In patients 18–64 years (baseline vs. PCV7 vs. PCV13 periods), case fatality rate from IPD decreased (22 vs.14 vs. 12 percent), and it was associated with a decline in PCV7 serotypes (3.56 vs. 2.80 vs. 1.49 cases/105 person-years) and in PCV7 serotypes-specific death (0.74 vs. 0.53 vs. 0.09 deaths/105 person-years). In patients ≥65 years, case fatality rate did not change (24 vs. 22 vs. 24 percent); however, there was a decline in PCV7 serotypes-specific death (4.94 vs. 3.58 vs. 2.45 deaths/105 person-years), and an increase in non-PCV serotypes-specific death (2.55 vs. 3.70 vs. 4.09 deaths/105 person-years).
Conclusions
The use of PCVs for children was associated with a reduction of mortality from IPD in adults 18–64 years, through the indirect effect of herd protection. In older adults, age-related factors could play a role in IPD mortality."

abstract = "Summary
Multi-drug resistance in Gram negative bacteria, particularly in Enterobacteriaceae, is a major clinical and public health challenge. The main mechanism of resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the production of beta-lactamase hydrolysing enzymes such as extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), AmpC beta-lactamases and carbapenemases (Carbapenemase Producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)). ESBL and CPE resistance genes are located on plasmids, which can be transmitted between Enterobacteriaceae, facilitating their spread in hospitals and communities. These plasmids usually harbour multiple additional co-resistance genes, including to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, making these infections challenging to treat. Asymptomatic carriage in healthy children as well as community acquired infections are increasingly reported, particularly with ESBL. Therapeutic options are limited and previously little used antimicrobials such as fosfomycin and colistin have been re-introduced in clinical practice. Paediatric experience with these agents is limited hence there is a need to further examine their clinical efficacy, dosage and toxicity in children. Antimicrobial stewardship along with strict infection prevention and control practices need to be adopted widely in order to preserve currently available antimicrobials. The future development of novel agents effective against beta-lactamases producers and their applicability in children is urgently needed to address the challenge of multi-resistant Gram negative infections."

Early diagnosis and timely treatment of early onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) are essential to prevent life threatening complications. Subtle, nonspecific clinical presentation and low predictive values of biomarkers complicate early diagnosis. This uncertainty commonly results in unnecessary and prolonged empiric antibiotic treatment. Annually, approximately 395,000 neonates (7.9% of live term births) are treated for suspected EOS in the European Union, while the incidence of proven EOS varies between 0.01 and 0.53 per 1000 live births. Adherence to guidelines for the management of suspicion of EOS is poor. Pragmatic approaches to minimise overtreatment in neonates with suspected EOS, using combined stratified risk algorithms, based on maternal and perinatal risk factors, clinical characteristics of the neonate and sequential biomarkers are promising."

Objectives
We aimed to determine the hospital burden of varicella-zoster virus infection (VZV) in England during 2004–2013 to support a future cost-effectiveness analysis of a childhood varicella vaccination programme.
Methods
We analysed the incidence, duration, outcome and costs of hospitalisations for VZV using the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database for the general and immunocompetent population. Mortality in HES was validated using data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Results
The average annual incidences of admissions due to varicella and herpes zoster were 7.6 (7.3–7.9) and 8.8 (8.6–9.0) per 100,000, respectively. The immunocompetent population accounted for 93% and 82% of the admissions due to varicella and herpes zoster, respectively. The average yearly number of hospital days was 10,748 (10,227–11,234) for varicella and 41,780 (40,257–43,287) for herpes zoster. The average yearly hospital costs (£2013/14) were £6.8 million (6.4–7.2) for varicella and £13.0 million (12.8–13.4) for herpes zoster. The average annual numbers of deaths identified in HES due to varicella and herpes zoster were 18.5 (14.3–22.8) and 160 (147–172), respectively. Comparison with ONS mortality data indicated a high level of uncertainty.
Conclusions
Most of the hospital burden due to VZV-virus in England occurs in the immunocompetent population and is potentially vaccine-preventable."

Objectives
The hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes usually benign and spontaneously resolving acute hepatitis in immunocompetent individuals. In immunocompromised patients with a solid-organ transplant (SOT), chronic infections occur in about 2/3 of cases. We aimed to evaluate the immune cells implicated at the acute phase of HEV infection.
Methods
We studied the activation and memory markers on CD4, CD8, γδ and NK cells in 32 HEV-free control SOT patients and 23 SOT recipients, including 14 who became chronically infected. Samples from 7 immunocompetent individuals with an acute infection and 8 healthy donor samples were included for comparison.
Results
In acutely-infected SOT patients, NK and Vδ2 cells, but not other γδ cells, had an increased expression of CD69. Based on CD45RA/CD27 markers, solid-organ recipients infected with HEV contained a larger pool of circulating naive subsets among lymphocyte Tγδ cells. However, these alterations of Vδ2 cells were not associated with HEV clearance. Only the adaptive IFN-γ responses to HEV peptides, determined by ELISpot, were associated with a favorable outcome in immunocompromised patients.
Conclusions
Transplanted patients mobilized their γδ cells at the acute phase of infection. Their precise role in HEV infection will thus deserve further investigations as they could be specifically immunomanipulated."

Objectives
Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a common viral agent causing central nervous system (CNS) infections, normally diagnosed by detection of VZV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our aim was to investigate trends in VZV DNAemia in VZV CNS infections, which could potentially contribute to diagnosis and secondly, correlate the amount of VZV DNA in serum to severity of disease.
Methods
Seventy-two patients with VZV CNS infections diagnosed by detection of VZV DNA in CSF and concomitant neurological symptoms were included. The amount of VZV DNA was measured by real-time PCR in paired serum and CSF samples and compared to a control group of herpes zoster (n = 36).
Results
An increased amount of VZV DNA was detected in serum in patients with encephalitis compared to patients with meningitis or Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, respectively (p = 0.003 and p = 0.024). A greater proportion of patients with VZV CNS infections and detectable VZV DNA in serum had ongoing rash compared to those without detectable VZV DNA in serum (p ≤ 0.001). The viral load in serum of patients with neurological symptoms was lower compared to in patients with herpes zoster without neurological symptoms (p ≤ 0.001) and only 32/72 of the patients with VZV CNS disease had VZV DNA detected in serum.
Conclusion
Increased amount of VZV DNA in serum of patients with VZV CNS infections seems associated with encephalitis and ongoing rash. Additionally, viral DNA analysis by PCR in serum may be a helpful diagnostic tool although viral DNA analysis by PCR in CSF is the method of choice for diagnosis."

Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from chronic lung infection and airway inflammation. Respiratory failure secondary to chronic or recurrent infection remains the commonest cause of death and accounts for over 90% of mortality. Bacteria as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex have been regarded the main CF pathogens and their role in progressive lung decline has been studied extensively. Little attention has been paid to the role of Aspergillus spp. and other filamentous fungi in the pathogenesis of non-ABPA (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis) respiratory disease in CF, despite their frequent recovery in respiratory samples. It has become more apparent however, that Aspergillus spp. may play an important role in chronic lung disease in CF. Research delineating the underlying mechanisms of Aspergillus persistence and infection in the CF lung and its link to lung deterioration is lacking. This review summarizes the Aspergillus disease phenotypes observed in CF, discusses the role of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator)-protein in innate immune responses and new treatment modalities."

Objectives
Many outer multidomain proteins play fundamental virulent roles in an allele-dependent manner. We aimed to investigate the influence of the outer SP1992 protein, here renamed DiiA (Dimorphic invasion-involved A), in pneumococcal disease.
Methods
The presence and type of diiA allele was screened by PCR in 560 clinical isolates. Isogenic mutants carrying progressive diiA deletions were constructed and checked in mouse models of infection. DiiA binding to human molecules was carried out by surface plasmon resonance.
Results
The diiA gene is exclusive of Streptococcus pneumoniae and included in the core genome. DiiA variants contain one or two imperfect repeats (R1 and R2), an unstructured region and a cell-wall anchor domain. Clonal complexes carrying both repeats were associated with invasive disease, while those carrying R2 preferentially caused non-invasive syndromes in patients with underlying risk factors. Mutants lacking both repeats were less efficient in nasopharyngeal colonization and dissemination from lungs. Moreover, the ΔdiiA defective strain suffered a severe impairment in bacterial proliferation in blood. Purified DiiA bound to collagen and lactoferrin with high affinity.
Conclusions
DiiA is a distinctive pneumococcal virulence factor contributing to colonization and long-term invasion in this pathogen."

Background
The 17D live attenuated yellow fever (YF) vaccine is contra-indicated in immune-compromised individuals and may elicit a suboptimal immunologic response. The aim of this study is to assess whether long-term immune responses against the YF vaccine are impaired in immune-compromised patients.
Materials and methods
Fifteen patients using different immunosuppressive drugs and 30 healthy individuals vaccinated 0–22 years ago were included. The serological response was measured using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses were measured following proliferation and re-stimulation with YFV peptide pools. Phenotypic characteristics and cytokine responses of CD8+ T-cells were determined using class I tetramers.
Results
The geometric mean titre of neutralizing antibodies was not different between the groups (p = 0.77). The presence of YFV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell did not differ between patients and healthy individuals (15/15, 100.0% vs. 29/30, 96.7%, p = 0.475). Time since vaccination correlated negatively with the number of YFV-specific CD8+ T-cells (r = −0.66, p = 0.0045). Percentages of early-differentiated memory cells increased (r = 0.67, p = 0.017) over time.
Conclusion
These results imply that YF vaccination is effective despite certain immunosuppressive drug regimens. An early-differentiated memory-like phenotype persisted, which is associated with effective expansion upon re-encounter with antigen, suggesting a potent memory T-cell pool remains."

Immunizing the pregnant woman to protect both the mother and her infant from infection has been utilized increasingly over the last decade. New outbreaks of pandemic influenza and the resurgence of pertussis have resulted in policy changes and shifts in health authority recommendations for a number of vaccines aimed to protect both pregnant women and their infants in the first months of life. The ability of maternal immunoglobulin IgG antibodies to be transported readily across the healthy intact placenta depends on many different factors including gestational age in the pregnancy, nature and timing of the immunization and presence of maternal HIV or malaria infections. In this paper, the history of maternal immunization is described, and specifically the studies that prompted the recommendations for tetanus, influenza, pertussis, and, when needed, meningococcus vaccines in pregnant women are reviewed. Ongoing research may result in new maternal vaccines against other pathogens including respiratory syncytial virus and group B streptococcus.

Objectives
Infections are a common cause of hospitalization in breast cancer patients. We studied the risk, clinical characteristics and outcomes of infection-related hospitalizations in this patient population.
Methods
A Swedish registry-based study including 8338 breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2008, followed prospectively for infection-related hospitalizations until 2010. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated using background rates from the general female population. Associations with clinical characteristics and mortality were analyzed using flexible parametric survival models.
Results
In total, 720 patients experienced an infection-related hospitalization during a median follow-up of 4.9 years. Infection rates were highest within the first year of diagnosis (SIR = 5.61, 95% CI; 4.98–6.32), and site-specific risks were most pronounced for sepsis (SIR = 3.14, 95% CI; 2.66–3.71) and skin infections (SIR = 2.80, 95% CI; 2.24–3.50). Older age at diagnosis, comorbidities, markers of tumor aggressiveness, chemotherapy and axillary node dissection were independent predictors of infectious disease risk. Infection-related hospitalizations were also independently associated with overall and breast cancer-specific death.
Conclusions
A significant number of breast cancer patients are hospitalized with an infection following diagnosis, which in turn predicts poor prognosis. The risk profile of infection-related hospitalizations is multifactorial, including patient, tumor and treatment-related factors."

Objectives
Melioidosis is an often fatal disease in humans and animals and endemic in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is caused by the environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. We analysed weather and climate factors preceding new melioidosis cases in Darwin and compared the time between weather event and admission to hospital for severe and average wet season rainfall.
Methods
In a time-series analysis from 1990 to 2013 we applied a boosted regression tree and a negative binomial model to investigate the association between melioidosis cases and weather events. Fitted Fourier terms controlled for long-term seasonal trends.
Results
We found a rise in the dew point, cloud cover, rainfall, maximum temperature and groundwater to be associated with an increased risk to acquire melioidosis. A shorter ‘putative’ incubation period was evident after severe rainfall events. Rainfall occurring early in the wet season was linked to more cases as was an increase in the local sea surface temperature reflecting local weather dynamics and precipitation.
Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate a statistical association between frequency of recorded melioidosis cases and the nature and timing of rainfall related events and suggest a future rise in the sea surface and ambient temperature may lead to increased melioidosis."

Objectives
To investigate the genetic character of Human bocavirus (HBoV) among children with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in China.
Methods
We screened 993 respiratory samples for HBoV by PCR among hospitalized children with SARI between September 2007 and March 2014. Four of HBoV1 samples were selected for complete genomes analysis by next-generation sequencing.
Results
The results show that 200 (20.1%) out of 993 samples were HBoV-positive, most of these HBoV belong to HBoV1 subtype (n = 197), HBoV2 (n = 1) and HBoV3 (n = 2) were also detected. Fifty (5.04%) of 993 SARI patient were detected as HBoV-positive only. Four HBoV1 genomes in this study were conserved and showed no significant difference among the nucleotide diversity from different regions. Analyses of evolutionary rates showed that NS1 exhibited the highest degree of conservation while the VP1 gene exhibited the fastest rate of evolution at 4.20 × 10−4 substitutions/site/year. The nucleotide deletions and substitutions occurred in NP1 and VP1 represented novel molecular signatures enabling subtype differentiation between HBoVs.
Conclusions
We described some new characteristics in the epidemiology of HBoV among children with SARI, these data will significantly expand the current knowledge of HBoV epidemic and genomic characterization among children with SARI."

abstract = "Summary
Kawasaki disease (KD) is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries.1,2 The primary goal of treatment is to prevent coronary artery aneurysms (CAA). Between 10 and 20% of KD patients are resistant to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and have an almost nine-fold increased risk of developing CAA.3 In addition, approximately 80–90% of patients who go on to develop CAA have abnormal coronary artery dimensions on their first echocardiogram and can therefore be identified as high-risk patients. These two subsets of KD patients are candidates for adjunctive therapy, in addition to IVIG. Understanding the mechanism of action of IVIG may provide insight into IVIG resistance and guidance for choosing adjunctive therapies in KD. Therapeutic options in the treatment of refractory KD and patients with early CAA include additional IVIG, glucocorticoids, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, calcineurin inhibitors and interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockers.3–10 Animal studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of statins may also be beneficial in blocking CAA progression.6 It is unlikely that these therapies will be studied in large, randomized controlled trials in the future due to required sample size and funding constraints. Thus, data from the research laboratory may be helpful in guiding selection of the most promising adjunctive therapies."

Objectives
Refractory and recurrent cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation were independent risk factors of CMV disease and transplant-related mortality post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Our aims were to identify the recovery of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells with a central memory phenotype (TCM) associated with refractory and recurrent CMV reactivation.
Method
We analyzed findings in a prospective study comprising (n = 107) post allo-HSCT. CMV-specific CD8+ T cells were determined using HLA class I pentamers together with extended phenotypic analyses.
Result
The patients with lower level of CMV-specific CD8+ TCM at day 30 post-HSCT had an increased risk of refractory and recurrent CMV (68.5%) comparing with the higher one (13.2%) (p < 0.001) and poorer long term CMV-specific CD8+ T cell reconstitution post-HSCT (p = 0.026). Multivariate analysis revealed that CMV-specific CD8+ TCM at day 30 was an independent prognostic factor for refractory and recurrent reactivation (p = 0.002).
Conclusion
The CMV-specific CD8+ TCM subset at day 30 post-HSCT is associated with CMV-specific T cell immunity recovery as well as the refractory and recurrent CMV reactivation post-HSCT."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are environmental mycobacteria associated with a range of infections. Reports of NTM epidemiology have primarily focused on pulmonary infections and isolations, however extrapulmonary infections of the skin, soft tissues and sterile sites are less frequently described.
Methods
We comprehensively reviewed laboratory reports of NTM isolation from North Carolina residents of three counties during 2006–2010. We describe age, gender, and race of patients, and anatomic site of isolation for NTM species.
Results
Among 1033 patients, overall NTM isolation prevalence was 15.9/100,000 persons (13.7/100,000 excluding Mycobacterium gordonae). Prevalence was similar between genders and increased significantly with age. Extrapulmonary isolations among middle-aged black males and pulmonary isolations among elderly white females were most frequently detected. Most isolations from pulmonary sites and blood cultures were Mycobacterium avium complex; rapidly growing NTM (e.g. Mycobacterium chelonae, Mycobacterium fortuitum) were most often isolated from paranasal sinuses, wounds and skin.
Conclusions
We provide the first characterization of NTM isolation prevalence in the Southeastern United States (U.S.). Variation in isolation prevalence among counties and races likely represent differences in detection, demographics and risk factors. Further characterization of NTM epidemiology is increasingly important as percentages of immunocompromised individuals and the elderly increase in the U.S. population."

Objectives
This study examined the prevalence of Pneumocystis jirovecii in the sputum of adults with cystic fibrosis during clinical stability and acute pulmonary exacerbation.
Methods
This was a prospective, longitudinal observational study of patients attending the Manchester Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre. Sputum samples were analysed for P. jirovecii DNA using PCR at enrolment and up to 5 follow-up visits. Patients were classified as stable or exacerbating using a modified Fuch's pulmonary exacerbation score.
Results
226 samples were tested from 111 patients. P. jirovecii was more likely to be detected in samples at acute pulmonary exacerbation (7/76 (9.2%)) compared with stable visits (3/150 (2%)), p = 0.03. P. jirovecii was detected less frequently if patients had received co-trimoxazole within 3 months of sample collection (0% versus 29.7%, p = 0.03).
Conclusions
Prevalence of P. jirovecii in stable patients is low, but P. jirovecii is detected in approximately 1 in 10 patients experiencing an acute pulmonary exacerbation."

Objective
To estimate the true incidence of pertussis in Chinese adults who are at a childbearing age.
Methods
A total of 897 serum samples from healthy individuals aged 20–39 years were selected randomly from a large number of serum samples collected in 2010 in Beijing, China. Anti-pertussis toxin (Ptx) IgG antibodies were determined with the Virion/Serion ELISA kits using purified Ptx as a coating antigen.
Results
Only 124 (13.8%) were found to have undetectable anti-Ptx IgG antibodies. The mean concentration was 13.76 IU/ml (95% CI, 12.37–15.15). Forty-six (5.1%) subjects had anti-Ptx IgG levels greater than or equal to 40 IU/ml, indicative of a pertussis infection, and nine (1%) had IgG antibodies greater than or equal to 100 IU/ml, indicative of a recent infection within a year. No significant differences were observed between age groups of 20–29 and 30–39 years, or between genders.
Conclusions
Our study showed that about 5% of adults aged 20–39 years had positive anti-Ptx IgG antibodies, suggesting that adult pertussis is common in China. Giving a booster vaccination to pregnant women should possibly be considered in order to protect young infants who are too young to be vaccinated in this country."

Objective
We investigated the accuracy of host markers detected in Mtb antigen-stimulated whole blood culture supernatant in the diagnosis of TB.
Methods
Prospectively, blood from 322 individuals with presumed TB disease from six African sites was stimulated with four different Mtb antigens (Rv0081, Rv1284, ESAT-6/CFP-10, and Rv2034) in a 24 h whole blood stimulation assay (WBA). The concentrations of 42 host markers in the supernatants were measured using the Luminex multiplex platform. Diagnostic biosignatures were investigated through the use of multivariate analysis techniques.
Results
17% of the participants were HIV infected, 106 had active TB disease and in 216 TB was excluded. Unstimulated concentrations of CRP, SAA, ferritin and IP-10 had better discriminating ability than markers from stimulated samples. Accuracy of marker combinations by general discriminant analysis (GDA) identified a six analyte model with 77% accuracy for TB cases and 84% for non TB cases, with a better performance in HIV uninfected patients.
Conclusions
A biosignature of 6 cytokines obtained after stimulation with four Mtb antigens has moderate potential as a diagnostic tool for pulmonary TB disease individuals and stimulated marker expression had no added value to unstimulated marker performance."

Objectives
Cholera is potentially a life threatening disease caused by toxigenic Vibrio cholerae. Here we report the identification and characterisation of 76 non-7th pandemic clone O1 V. cholerae isolates including 65 clinical isolates from diarrhoeal patients from 2005 to 2014 in Zhejiang Province, China.
Methods
We used multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to characterise 65 V. cholerae isolates. Pulse-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on a subset of the isolates and whole-genome sequencing was done on 13 isolates.
Results
MLST separated 65 isolates into 19 sequence types (STs). Thirty three isolates belonged to ST75 which also contains the US Gulf Coast clone. PFGE separated the 33 isolates into 16 pulsotypes. Whole genome sequencing of 10 ST75 isolates showed that the US Gulf Coast clone and the Chinese ST75 isolates can be separated into two distinct lineages, ST75a and ST75b. All Zhejiang ST75 isolates were ST75b.
Conclusion
PFGE and genome sequencing confirmed the linked cases and identified small outbreaks caused by ST75b. The emergence and potential spread of ST75b may pose significant threat to public health. Epidemiological surveillance is required to further understand its epidemic potential."

Objectives
Fungal empyema thoracis (FET) is a rare life-threatening infection. We sought to describe the clinical characteristics of FET in a large academic cancer center.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective chart review of all cancer patients who had a fungal isolate from the pleural fluid culture between 1/2005 and 8/2013.
Results
A total of 106 fungal isolates were identified in 97 patients. Yeasts accounted for 62% of the isolates whereas 38% were identified as molds. The most frequent pathogens were Candida spp. (58%) and Aspergillus spp. (12%). All patients with Aspergillus and 83% with Candida met criteria for proven fungal disease. Compared to the Aspergillus group, Candida FET was associated with recent abdominal or thoracic surgical procedures (44% vs. 0%, p = 0.01). Overall, 6-week mortality was high, with no significant differences between Candida and Aspergillus (31% vs. 45%, respectively [p = 0.48]). Only 1 out of 11 patients with uncommon molds died at 6 weeks, despite only 2 of them received appropriate antifungal therapy.
Conclusions
Development of FET carries a high mortality in cancer patients. A history of a recent surgical procedure is a risk factor for FET due to Candida. Isolation of uncommon molds is likely to represent a contamination of the pleural fluid."

Methods
We conducted a prospective, case–control study in three acute-care hospitals in Hong Kong. Adult inpatients who developed CDI diarrhoea confirmed by PCR (n = 139) were compared with the non-CDI controls (n = 114). Ribotyping of isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed.
Results
The estimated crude annual incidence of CDI was 23–33/100,000 population, and 133–207/100,000 population among those aged ≥65 years. The mean age of CDI patients was 71.5. Nursing home care, recent hospitalization, antibiotics exposure (adjusted OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.3–7.1) and proton-pump inhibitors use (adjusted OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2–3.9) were risk factors. Severe CDI occurred in 41.7%. Overall mortality was 16.5% (among severe CDI, 26.5%). The commonest ribotypes were 002 (22.8%), 014 (14.1%), 012 and 046; ribotype 027 was absent. Ribotype 002 was associated with fluoroquinolone resistance and higher mortality (47.6% vs. 12.7%; adjusted HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.1–7.0).

abstract = "Summary
Background
Maternal pertussis immunisation was introduced during the pertussis resurgence in England in 2012 as a temporary measure to protect infants too young to be vaccinated. The programme was shown to be safe and highly effective. However, continuation of maternal vaccination as a routine programme requires a cost-effectiveness analysis.
Method
The estimated prevented disease burden among mothers and their infants was obtained assuming 89% (95% CI: 19%–99%) vaccine efficacy for mothers and 91% (95% CI: 84%–95%) for infants. Future incidence was projected based on the disease rates in 2010–2012, including the four-year cycle of low and high incidence years. Full probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed for different scenarios.
Results
Assuming a vaccine coverage of 60%, there were 1650 prevented hospitalisations in infants (3.5% discounting, the first 10 years), including 55–60 deaths and ∼20,500 cases among mothers, of which around 1800 would be severe. The annual costs of the programme are £7.3 million assuming a price of £10 per dose and £9.4 million assuming £15 per dose. Using discounting of 3.5%, a 200 year time horizon and a price of £10 per dose (+£7.5 administration costs) only 25% of the iterations were below £30,000 per QALY. Using a 35% higher incidence resulted in 88% of the scenarios below this threshold. Assuming that the incidence remains at the level at the height of 2012, then the programme would be highly cost effective, with an ICER of £16,865 (£12,209–£25,976; price of £10 and 3.5%/3.5% discounting).
Conclusion
Maternal vaccination is effective in preventing severe illness and deaths in infants but the cost-effectiveness of the programme is highly dependent on future incidence which is necessarily uncertain. However, the duration and magnitude of protection against transmission afforded by the current acellular vaccines is also uncertain as are the associated effects on future herd immunity. The direct protection offered by the maternal dose provides the only certain way of protecting vulnerable infants from birth."

Management of common infections and optimal use of antimicrobial agents are presented, highlighting new evidence from the medical literature that enlightens practice. Primary therapy of staphylococcal skin abscesses is drainage. Patients who have a large abscess (>5 cm), cellulitis or mixed abscess–cellulitis likely would benefit from additional antibiotic therapy. When choosing an antibiotic for outpatient management, the patient, pathogen and in vitro drug susceptibility as well as tolerability, bioavailability and safety characteristics of antibiotics should be considered. Management of recurrent staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections is vexing. Focus is best placed on reducing density of the organism on the patient's skin and in the environment, and optimizing a healthy skin barrier. With attention to adherence and optimal dosing, acute uncomplicated osteomyelitis can be managed with early transition from parenteral to oral therapy and with a 3–4 week total course of therapy. Doxycycline should be prescribed when indicated for a child of any age. Its use is not associated with dental staining. Azithromycin should be prescribed for infants when indicated, whilst being alert to an associated ≥2-fold excess risk of pyloric stenosis with use under 6 weeks of age. Beyond the neonatal period, acyclovir is more safely dosed by body surface area (not to exceed 500 mg/m2/dose) than by weight. In addition to the concern of antimicrobial resistance, unnecessary use of antibiotics should be avoided because of potential later metabolic effects, thought to be due to perturbation of the host's microbiome."

Objectives
We describe the first published cluster of extensively drug resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the UK and show how early whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Mtb can assist in case management and contact investigations.
Methods
We describe the contact tracing investigation undertaken after the presentation of an adult with XDR-TB. Active cases were treated with an XDR-TB drug regimen and contacts underwent a programme of follow-up for 2 years. All isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) were assessed early using whole genome sequencing (WGS) as well as routine drug susceptibility testing (DST).
Results
Thirty-three contacts were screened. In the first year one confirmed and one probable case were identified through contact tracing. A further possible case was identified through epidemiological links. Two confirmed cases were identified through WGS 2 years later. Twenty-five (80%) contacts without evidence of tuberculosis were adherent to 1 year of follow-up and 14 (45%) were adherent to 2 years of follow-up. WGS of Mtb was used to guide drug choices, rapidly identify transmission events, and alter public health management.
Conclusion
WGS of Mtb enabled rapid effective individualized treatment and facilitated public health interventions by early identification of transmission events."

A growing body of evidence warrants a revision of the received/conventional wisdom of rotavirus infection as synonymous with acute gastroenteritis. Rotavirus vaccines have boosted our interest and knowledge of this virus, but also importantly, they may have changed the landscape of the disease. Extraintestinal spread of rotavirus is well documented, and the clinical spectrum of the disease is widening. Furthermore, the positive impact of current rotavirus vaccines in reducing seizure hospitalization rates should prompt a reassessment of the actual burden of extraintestinal manifestations of rotavirus diseases. This article discusses current knowledge of the systemic extraintestinal manifestations of rotavirus infection and their underlying mechanisms, and aims to pave the way for future clinical, public health and research questions."

Objectives
Neisseria meningitidis, together with the non-pathogenic Neisseria species (NPNs), are members of the complex microbiota of the human pharynx. This paper investigates the influence of NPNs on the epidemiology of meningococcal infection.
Methods
Neisseria isolates were collected during 18 surveys conducted in six countries in the African meningitis belt between 2010 and 2012 and characterized at the rplF locus to determine species and at the variable region of the fetA antigen gene. Prevalence and risk factors for carriage were analyzed.
Results
A total of 4694 isolates of Neisseria were obtained from 46,034 pharyngeal swabs, a carriage prevalence of 10.2% (95% CI, 9.8–10.5). Five Neisseria species were identified, the most prevalent NPN being Neisseria lactamica. Six hundred and thirty-six combinations of rplF/fetA_VR alleles were identified, each defined as a Neisseria strain type. There was an inverse relationship between carriage of N. meningitidis and of NPNs by age group, gender and season, whereas carriage of both N. meningitidis and NPNs was negatively associated with a recent history of meningococcal vaccination.
Conclusion
Variations in the prevalence of NPNs by time, place and genetic type may contribute to the particular epidemiology of meningococcal disease in the African meningitis belt."

Objectives
Despite over a century of research and the careful scrutiny of many promising targets, there is currently no vaccine available for the prevention of Streptococcus pyogenes infection. Through analysis of the protective, anti-streptococcal components of pooled human immunoglobulin, we previously identified ten highly conserved and invariant S. pyogenes antigens that contribute to anti-streptococcal immunity in the adult population. We sought to emulate population immunity to S. pyogenes through a process of active vaccination, using the antigens targeted by pooled human immunoglobulin.
Methods
Seven targets were produced recombinantly and mixed to form a multicomponent vaccine (Spy7). Vaccinated mice were challenged with S. pyogenes isolates representing four globally relevant serotypes (M1, M3, M12 and M89) using an established model of invasive disease.
Results
Vaccination with Spy7 stimulated the production of anti-streptococcal antibodies, and limited systemic dissemination of M1 and M3 S. pyogenes from an intramuscular infection focus. Vaccination additionally attenuated disease severity due to M1 S. pyogenes as evidenced by reduction in weight loss, and modulated cytokine release.
Conclusion
Spy7 vaccination successfully stimulated the generation of protective anti-streptococcal immunity in vivo. Identification of reactive antigens using pooled human immunoglobulin may represent a novel route to vaccine discovery for extracellular bacteria."

Objectives
The objectives of this study were to examine the prevalence of penicillin-susceptible bacteremic Staphylococcus aureus in the Malmö area in 2014, to re-evaluate the phenotypic methods of penicillinase detection on these isolates, and to investigate the clonal distribution of penicillin-susceptible isolates.
Methods
All non-redundant S. aureus from blood in the Malmö catchment area in southern Sweden 2014 were screened for penicillin susceptibility using PcG 1U disk diffusion, E-test PcG and the nitrocefin test. All isolates screened as likely susceptible were subjected to PCR for detection of penicillinase (blaZ) and spa-typing.
Results
Almost one out of three bacteremic isolates (80/257; 31.1%) were susceptible to penicillin. All screening methods except for the nitrocefin test alone had a low proportion of isolates falsely tested as susceptible, but no method used in the study had perfect specificity compared with PCR. Penicillin-susceptible isolates had a distinct phylogenetic distribution, and two clonal complexes (CC5 and CC45) constituted half of the isolates.
Conclusion
Almost one third of S. aureus isolated from blood in southern Sweden in 2014 was susceptible to penicillin. Considering that intravenous penicillin has theoretical advantages compared with the standard treatment in the study area, we argue that routine testing of penicillin susceptibility should be reconsidered."

Objectives
To develop and validate a prediction score, to quantify, within 48 h of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) diagnosis, the risk of IE, and therefore determine priority for urgent echocardiography.
Methods
Consecutive adult patients with SAB in 8 French university hospitals between 2009 and 2011 were prospectively enrolled and followed-up 3 months. A predictive model was developed and internally validated using bootstrap procedures.
Results
Among the 2008 patients enrolled, 221 (11.0%) had definite IE of whom 39 (17.6%) underwent valve surgery, 25% of them within 6 days of SAB diagnosis. Ten predictors independently associated with IE were used to build up the prediction score: intracardiac device or previous IE, native valve disease, intravenous drug use, community or non-nosocomial-acquisition, cerebral or extracerebral emboli, vertebral osteomyelitis, severe sepsis, meningitis, C-reactive protein above 190 mg/L, and H48-persistent bacteremia. Patients with a score ≤2 (n = 792, 39.4%) were at low IE-risk (1.1%; negative predictive value: 98.8% (95% CI, 98.4–99.4)) compared to those ≥3 who were at higher risk (17.4%).
Conclusions
Physicians must be strongly encouraged to urgently perform echocardiography in SAB patients with a score ≥3 to establish IE diagnosis, to orient antimicrobial therapy and to help determine the need for valvular surgery."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Although a CMV-specific T-cell response is associated with reduced risk for infection after transplantation, some patients still develop CMV disease. Thus, the characterization of additional parameters of the CMV-specific immune response that correlate with the control of CMV infection and disease and their use in defining thresholds that can be applied to clinical practice is of interest.
Methods
In a cohort of high risk solid organ transplant recipients we characterized CMV-specific T-cell responses using intracellular cytokine staining upon stimulation with pp65 and IE-1 peptides, and levels of CMV-specific antibodies neutralizing infection in fibroblast (MRC-5) and epithelial (ARPE-19) cells using microneutralization assays.
Results
Although patients with a positive (≥0.25%CD8+CD69+IFN-γ+) T-cell response were 6.4 fold more protected (OR 6.4, 95% CI 1.6–25.3; p < 0.001) from CMV infection than patients without a response, 2 (4.2%) patients developed disease. We defined a cut-off titer for epithelial cell neutralizing antibodies of ≥480 that correlated with disease protection. Thus, patients with a CMV-specific T-cell response and titers ≥480 were 14.2 fold more protected from CMV infection (OR 14.2, 95% CI 5–40.2; p < 0.001) and had no episodes of CMV disease.
Conclusions
Our results indicate that antibodies neutralizing epithelial cell infection may have an important role in long-term protection. Quantification of antibodies neutralizing epithelial cells, in addition to the T-cell response, may be useful for identifying patients with lower risk for CMV disease."

Purpose
The efficacy of immunization mandates for childcare or school entry is a long-standing controversy. The United States (US) adopted school entry immunization mandates in the 1800s, while most countries still do not have mandates. The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the evidence that immunization uptake increases with mandates.
Methods
A search was conducted for studies that compared immunization uptake in a population prior to and after mandates, or in similar populations with one group having and the other not having mandates. Data were extracted and synthesized qualitatively due to the heterogeneity of study design.
Results
Eleven before-and-after studies and ten studies comparing uptake in similar populations with and without mandates were included. Studies were from the US (n = 18), France (n = 1) and Canada (n = 2). Eleven of the 21 studies looked at middle school mandates. All but two studies showed at least a trend towards increased uptake with mandates. Higher uptake was associated with a more long-standing mandate.
Conclusions
Immunization mandates have generally led to increased short-term and long-term uptake in the group to whom the mandate applies. Many studies have centered around middle school mandates in the US and there is a paucity of studies of childcare mandates or of studies of mandates in other countries or in settings with relatively high baseline immunization uptake."

SAPHO syndrome manifests as chronic inflammation of bones and joints, which may or may not be accompanied by skin changes. The term SAPHO is an acronym that stands for synovitis, acne, pustulosis (usually palmoplantar), hyperostosis and osteitis. The bones most commonly affected are those in the anterior chest wall (mainly the sternum, clavicles and sternocostoclavicular joints), the vertebrae and the sacroiliac joints, but peripheral and flat bones may also be involved, especially in children. There are no validated diagnostic criteria for SAPHO, and diagnosis is based on clinical and radiological findings. One of the main challenges in diagnosis is that the clinical features may occur many years apart. Additionally, patients may not develop all manifestations. Delayed diagnosis, as a result of a lack of awareness of SAPHO, can lead to patients suffering ongoing pain and disfiguring skin manifestations. One theory is that Propionibacterium acnes (isolated from bone biopsies in many SAPHO patients) triggers an auto-immune mediated chronic inflammation in genetically predisposed individuals. Treatment involves the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular steroids, bisphosphonates and biologicals. The course of SAPHO is often prolonged but, despite the challenges in diagnosis and treatment, the long-term prognosis is good."

Objectives
HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis is commonly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, whilst infections with Cryptococcus gattii sensu lato are historically rare. Despite available studies, little is known about the occurrence of C. gattii sensu lato infections among HIV-infected individuals in Zimbabwe.
Methods
In a prospective cohort, we investigated the prevalence of C. gattii sensu lato meningitis among HIV-infected patients (n = 74) in Harare, Zimbabwe.
Results
Of the 66/74 isolates confirmed by molecular characterization, 16.7% (11/66) were found to be C. gattii sensu lato and 83.3% (55/66) C. neoformans sensu stricto. From one patient two phenotypically different C. gattii sensu lato colonies were cultured. The majority (n = 9/12; 75%) of the C. gattii sensu lato isolates were Cryptococcus tetragattii (AFLP7/VGIV), which has been an infrequently reported pathogen. In-hospital mortality associated with C. gattii sensu lato was 36.4%.
Conclusions
Our data suggests that C. tetragattii (AFLP7/VGIV) is a more common cause of disease than C. gattii sensu stricto (genotype AFLP4/VGI) among patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis in Harare, Zimbabwe and possibly underreported in sub-Saharan Africa."

1.Malaria is the tropical disease most commonly imported into the UK, with 1300–1800 cases reported each year, and 2–11 deaths. 2. Approximately three quarters of reported malaria cases in the UK are caused by Plasmodium falciparum, which is capable of invading a high proportion of red blood cells and rapidly leading to severe or life-threatening multi-organ disease. 3. Most non-falciparum malaria cases are caused by Plasmodium vivax; a few cases are caused by the other species of plasmodium: Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae or Plasmodium knowlesi. 4. Mixed infections with more than one species of parasite can occur; they commonly involve P. falciparum with the attendant risks of severe malaria. 5. There are no typical clinical features of malaria; even fever is not invariably present. Malaria in children (and sometimes in adults) may present with misleading symptoms such as gastrointestinal features, sore throat or lower respiratory complaints. 6. A diagnosis of malaria must always be sought in a feverish or sick child or adult who has visited malaria-endemic areas. Specific country information on malaria can be found at http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/. P. falciparum infection rarely presents more than six months after exposure but presentation of other species can occur more than a year after exposure. 7. Management of malaria depends on awareness of the diagnosis and on performing the correct diagnostic tests: the diagnosis cannot be excluded until more than one blood specimen has been examined. Other travel related infections, especially viral haemorrhagic fevers, should also be considered. 8. The optimum diagnostic procedure is examination of thick and thin blood films by an expert to detect and speciate the malarial parasites. P. falciparum and P. vivax (depending upon the product) malaria can be diagnosed almost as accurately using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) which detect plasmodial antigens. RDTs for other Plasmodium species are not as reliable. 9. Most patients treated for P. falciparum malaria should be admitted to hospital for at least 24 h as patients can deteriorate suddenly, especially early in the course of treatment. In specialised units seeing large numbers of patients, outpatient treatment may be considered if specific protocols for patient selection and follow up are in place. 10. Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria should be treated with an artemisinin combination therapy (Grade 1A). Artemether–lumefantrine (Riamet®) is the drug of choice (Grade 2C) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (Eurartesim®) is an alternative. Quinine or atovaquone–proguanil (Malarone®) can be used if an ACT is not available. Quinine is highly effective but poorly-tolerated in prolonged treatment and should be used in combination with an additional drug, usually oral doxycycline. 11. Severe falciparum malaria, or infections complicated by a relatively high parasite count (more than 2% of red blood cells parasitized) should be treated with intravenous therapy until the patient is well enough to continue with oral treatment. Severe malaria is a rare complication of P. vivax or P. knowlesi infection and also requires parenteral therapy. 12. The treatment of choice for severe or complicated malaria in adults and children is intravenous artesunate (Grade 1A). Intravenous artesunate is unlicensed in the EU but is available in many centres. The alternative is intravenous quinine, which should be started immediately if artesunate is not available (Grade 1A). Patients treated with intravenous quinine require careful monitoring for hypoglycemia. 13. Patients with severe or complicated malaria should be managed in a high-dependency or intensive care environment. They may require haemodynamic support and management of: acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute kidney injury, seizures, and severe intercurrent infections including Gram-negative bacteraemia/septicaemia. 14. Children with severe malaria should also be treated with empirical broad spectrum antibiotics until bacterial infection can be excluded (Grade 1B). 15. Haemolysis occurs in approximately 10–15% patients following intravenous artesunate treatment. Haemoglobin concentrations should be checked approximately 14 days following treatment in those treated with IV artemisinins (Grade 2C). 16. Falciparum malaria in pregnancy is more likely to be complicated: the placenta contains high levels of parasites, stillbirth or early delivery may occur and diagnosis can be difficult if parasites are concentrated in the placenta and scanty in the blood. 17. Uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the second and third trimester of pregnancy should be treated with artemether–lumefantrine (Grade 2B). Uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy should usually be treated with quinine and clindamycin but specialist advice should be sought. Severe malaria in any trimester of pregnancy should be treated as for any other patient with artesunate preferred over quinine (Grade 1C). 18. Children with uncomplicated malaria should be treated with an ACT (artemether–lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) as first line treatment (Grade 1A). Quinine with doxycycline or clindamycin, or atovaquone–proguanil at appropriate doses for weight can also be used. Doxycycline should not be given to children under 12 years. 19. Either an oral ACT or chloroquine can be used for the treatment of non-falciparum malaria. An oral ACT is preferred for a mixed infection, if there is uncertainty about the infecting species, or for P. vivax infection from areas where chloroquine resistance is common (Grade 1B). 20. Dormant parasites (hypnozoites) persist in the liver after treatment of P. vivax or P. ovale infection: the only currently effective drug for eradication of hypnozoites is primaquine (1A). Primaquine is more effective at preventing relapse if taken at the same time as chloroquine (Grade 1C). 21. Primaquine should be avoided or given with caution under expert supervision in patients with Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), in whom it may cause severe haemolysis. 22. Primaquine (for eradication of P. vivax or P. ovale hypnozoites) is contraindicated in pregnancy and when breastfeeding (until the G6PD status of child is known); after initial treatment for these infections a pregnant woman should take weekly chloroquine prophylaxis until after delivery or cessation of breastfeeding when hypnozoite eradication can be considered. 23. An acute attack of malaria does not confer protection from future attacks: individuals who have had malaria should take effective anti-mosquito precautions and chemoprophylaxis during future visits to endemic areas."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Study of the effect of HIV on disease progression in heterogeneous severe malaria syndromes with imprecise diagnostic criteria has led to varying results. Characteristic retinopathy refines cerebral malaria (CM) diagnosis, enabling more precise exploration of the hypothesis that HIV decreases the cytokine response in CM, leading to higher parasite density and a poor outcome.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed data on clinical progression and laboratory parameters in 877 retinopathy-positive CM cases admitted 1996–2011 (14.4% HIV-infected) to a large hospital in Malawi. Admission plasma levels of TNF, interleukin-10, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM-1) were measured by ELISA in 135 retinopathy-positive CM cases.
Results
HIV-infected CM cases had lower median plasma levels of TNF (p = 0.008), interleukin-10 (p = 0.045) and sICAM-1 (p = 0.04) than HIV-uninfected cases. Although HIV-infected children were older and more likely to have co-morbidities, HIV-status did not significantly affect parasite density (p = 0.90) or outcome (24.8% infected, vs. 18.5% uninfected; p = 0.13).
Conclusion
In this well-characterised CM cohort, HIV-coinfection was associated with marked blunting of the inflammatory response but did not affect parasite density or outcome. These data highlight the complex influence of HIV on severe malaria and bring into question systemic inflammation as a primary driver of pathogenesis in human CM."

HPV associated disease is a global health problem: 5.2% of all cancers are HPV associated with HPV 16 and 18 accounting for 70% of cases of cervical cancer. Genital warts caused by HPV 6 and 11 have a lifetime risk of acquisition of 10%. HPV vaccines are subunit vaccines consisting of virus like particles comprised of the L1 major capsid protein. Two vaccines have been licenced since 2006/2007 and are in the National Immunisation programmes in 62 countries. Both vaccines include HPV 16 and 18 VLPs and one also includes HPV 6 and 11. The vaccines are highly immunogenic and well tolerated. Genital HPV is a sexually transmitted infection with peak incidence occurring just after the onset of sexual activity and the routine cohort for immunisation in almost all countries are adolescent girls 9–15 years of age with or without catch up for older adolescents and young women. Population effectiveness is now being demonstrated for these vaccines in countries with high vaccine coverage. HPV vaccines are highly immunogenic and effective and the original 3 dose schedules have already been reduced, for those 14 years and under, to 2 for both licenced vaccines. There is preliminary evidence that 1 dose of vaccine is as effective as 2 or 3 in preventing persistent HPV infection in the cervix in young women and further reductions in dosage may be possible if supported by appropriate virological, immunological and modelling studies."

Objectives
Empyemas require aggressive antimicrobial and surgical management. However, the specifics of antimicrobial therapy have not been studied in clinical trials. The present study examines management and outcomes among a cohort of patients with empyema cared for in a tertiary-care referral hospital over a decade.
Methods
We retrospectively identified patients hospitalized with empyema from January 2000 through December 2010 at one institution. Patient demographics, laboratory findings, treatments, and patient outcomes were abstracted using a standard form. Data were summarized with standard descriptive statistics.
Results
A total of 91 patients were identified. The predominant organisms were viridans group streptococci, which were isolated in 64% of cases with cultures. The median length of hospitalization was 9 days. Length of antimicrobial therapy from time of source control was variable, with a median (interquartile range) duration of 27 (15–31) days. Of note, longer courses of parenteral, but not oral, therapy were associated with fewer cases of clinical failure.
Conclusions
This descriptive analysis demonstrated a higher rate of viridans group streptococci than expected. Three weeks of therapy was generally adequate and prevented clinical failure, but further study is needed with a much larger cohort to better define the optimal drug regimen, route, and duration of antimicrobial therapy for empyema."

Objectives
To enhance timely surveillance of bacterial enteric pathogens, space-time cluster analysis was introduced in Israel in May 2013.
Methods
Stool isolation data of Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter from patients of a large Health Maintenance Organization were analyzed weekly by ArcGIS and SaTScan, and cluster results were sent promptly to local departments of health (LDOHs).
Results
During eighteen months, we identified 52 Shigella sonnei clusters, two Salmonella clusters, and no Campylobacter clusters. S. sonnei clusters lasted from one to 33 days and included three to 30 individuals. Thirty-one (60%) of the S. sonnei clusters were known to LDOHs prior to cluster analysis. Clusters not previously known by the LDOHs prompted epidemiologic investigations. In 31 of the 37 (84%) confirmed clusters, educational institutes (nursery schools, kindergartens, and a primary school) were involved.
Conclusions
Cluster analysis demonstrated capability to complement enteric disease surveillance. Scaling up the system can further enhance timely detection and control of outbreaks."

Unlike its mosquito-borne relatives, such as dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses, which can cause severe human diseases, Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged from obscurity by its association with a suspected “congenital Zika syndrome”, while causing asymptomatic or mild exanthematous febrile infections which are dengue- or rubella-like in infected individuals. Despite having been discovered in Uganda for almost 60 years, <20 human cases were reported before 2007. The massive epidemics in the Pacific islands associated with the ZIKV Asian lineage in 2007 and 2013 were followed by explosive outbreaks in Latin America in 2015. Although increased mosquito breeding associated with the El Niño effect superimposed on global warming is suspected, genetic changes in its RNA virus genome may have led to better adaptation to mosquitoes, other animal reservoirs, and human. We reviewed the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, virology, pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis, management, and prevention of this emerging infection. Laboratory diagnosis can be confounded by cross-reactivity with other circulating flaviviruses. Besides mosquito bite and transplacental transmission, the risk of other potential routes of transmission by transfusion, transplantation, sexual activity, breastfeeding, respiratory droplet, and animal bite is discussed. Epidemic control requires adequate clearance of mosquito breeding grounds, personal protection against mosquito bite, and hopefully a safe and effective vaccine."

Objectives
Platelet activation seems to be implicated in the cardiovascular events occurring in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Aim of the study was to assess the mechanism involved in platelet activation in CAP patients.
Methods
Two-hundred-seventy-eight consecutive patients hospitalized for CAP were recruited and followed-up until discharge. Hospitalized patients matched for sex, age and comorbidities but without acute infectious diseases were used as controls.
Results
At hospital admission patients disclosed enhanced plasma levels of sP-selectin, a maker of in-vivo platelet activation, serum sNOX2-dp, a marker of NADPH-oxidase activation, serum Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and serum zonulin, a marker of gut permeability, compared to controls (p < 0.001). Baseline sP-selectin was independently associated to serum LPS, sNOX2-sp and Pneumonia Severity Index score (p < 0.001). Plasma sP-selectin, serum sNOX2-dp, LPS and zonulin coincidentally decreased at hospital discharge (p < 0.001). An in vitro study showed that LPS, at concentration similar to that found in CAP patients, induced sP-selectin release by agonist-activated platelets, a phenomenon that was counteract by treating cells with gp91ds-tat, a specific inhibitor of NOX2.
Conclusions
CAP patients display enhanced platelet activation, which is related to LPS-mediated NOX2 activation. Enhanced gut permeability seems be implicated in enhancing circulating levels of LPS."

Respiratory viruses place a great disease burden especially on the youngest children in terms of high rates of infection, bacterial complications and hospitalizations. In developing countries, some viral infections are even associated with substantial mortality in children. The interaction between viruses and bacteria is probably much more common and clinically significant than previously understood. Respiratory viruses frequently initiate the cascade of events that ultimately leads to bacterial infection. Effective antiviral agents can substantially shorten the duration of the viral illness and prevent the development of bacterial complications. Viral vaccines have the potential to not only prevent the viral infection but also decrease the incidence of bacterial complications. At present, antivirals and vaccines are only available against influenza viruses, but new vaccines and antivirals against other viruses, especially for RSV, are being developed."

Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) can be positive in patients infected with Mycobacterium kansasii (M. kansasii), which carries some of Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific antigens adopted for IGRAs. Our aim is to evaluate positive rate and factors associated with positive IGRAs in patients with M. kansasii pulmonary infection.
Methods
We retrospectively investigated 105 M. kansasii cases in which IGRAs were performed before or ≦14 days after treatment initiation. Clinical characteristics including a history of tuberculosis, radiographic features and laboratory data were collected from medical records.
Results
Positive rate of each IGRA was 25.9% (15/58) in QuantiFERON TB-Gold (QFT-G), 31.8% (7/22) in QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT-GIT), and 33.3% (7/21) in T-SPOT. TB (T-SPOT). After excluding cases having a history of tuberculosis, positive rate of each IGRA decreased to 19% (8/42) in QFT-G, 20% (3/15) in QFT-GIT, and 18.8% (3/16) in T-SPOT. The multivariate analysis revealed that only previous tuberculosis was significantly associated with positive IGRAs (odds ratio, 4.758; 95% confidence interval, 1.73–13.05; p = 0.002).
Conclusions
Positive rates of IGRAs were low in patients with M. kansasii, especially in those without previous tuberculosis. M. kansasii pulmonary infection alone might induce less interferon-gamma production with the antigens."

Objectives
Magnesium is a co-factor in natural killer and T cell reactivity and may modify the course of infections. We examined the association between baseline serum magnesium concentration and infections requiring admission the first year after kidney transplantation.
Methods
Inclusion of adults transplant recipients between January 2003 and 31 December 2013. Cox piecewise linear regression model estimating the hazard ratio for first admission for infection. Outcomes until one year post-transplantation or up to May 1, 2014.
Results
Overall, 371 of 873 persons were admitted at least once the first year after transplantation (65 events per 100 person-years). The infection-specific cumulative incidence increased with lower serum magnesium concentration (P = 0.008). After adjustment for confounders, a low serum magnesium was associated with an increased hazard of infection (P < 0.0001 in type 3 test). With 2 mg/dL as the reference value, every 0.1 mg/dL reduction in serum magnesium at baseline below 2 mg/dL (N = 165) increased the hazard ratio by 15% (HR 1.15, 95%CI 1.05–1.27; P = 0.002) while every increase of 0.1 mg/dL in those with a serum magnesium between 2 and 3 mg/dL (N = 661) decreased the hazard ratio by 4% (HR 0.96, 95%CI 0.93–1.00; P = 0.08).
Conclusion
A lower baseline serum magnesium concentration is associated with an increased risk of infection after kidney transplantation."

abstract = "Summary
Autosomal dominant chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (AD-CMC) is a rare and severe primary immunodeficiency that is characterized by mucocutaneous fungal infection, autoimmunity, cerebral aneurysms, and oropharyngeal and esophageal cancer. Recently, it was discovered that STAT1 mutations are responsible for AD-CMC. These mutations lead to the inability of STAT1 to be dephosphorylated, resulting in hyperphosphorylation, increased binding to the DNA, and gain of function (GOF) effects on STAT1 signaling. Furthermore, a characteristic feature of AD-CMC patients is deficiency in the T-helper 17 (Th17) responses, which is believed to be the immunological cause of the mucocutaneous fungal infection. No targeted treatment other than lifelong antifungal prophylaxis exists for AD-CMC. However, the discovery of the genetic and immunological defects makes it now possible to explore new treatment strategies. This review will discuss immunomodulatory treatment options that can be explored in patients with STAT1 GOF mutations."

Objectives
Whether immunological mechanisms underlie Q-fever fatigue syndrome (QFS) remains unclear. For acute Q-fever, the antigen-specific interferon-γ (IFNγ) response may be a useful tool for diagnosis, and the IFNγ/interleukin(IL)-2 production ratio may be a marker for chronic Q-fever and treatment monitoring. Here we explored the specific IFNγ production and IFNγ/IL-2 ratio in QFS patients.
Methods
IFNγ and IL-2 production were tested in ex-vivo stimulated whole blood of QFS patients (n = 20), and compared to those previously determined in seropositive controls (n = 135), and chronic Q-fever patients (n = 28). Also, the correlation between patient characteristics and IFNγ, IL-2, and IFNγ/IL-2 ratio was determined.
Results
QFS patients were younger (p < 0.001), but gender distribution was similar to seropositive controls and chronic Q-fever patients. Coxiella burnetii Nine Mile stimulation revealed a higher IFNγ production in QFS (median 319.5 pg/ml) than in seropositive controls (120 pg/ml, p < 0.01), but comparable to chronic Q-fever (2846 pg/ml). The IFNγ/IL-2 ratio was similar to that in seropositive controls, but lower than in chronic Q-fever patients (p < 0.01). Symptom duration was positively correlated with IL-2 production, and negatively correlated with the IFNγ/IL-2 ratio.
Conclusions
These results point to an altered cell-mediated immunity in QFS, and suggest a different immune response than in chronic Q-fever."

Kanafani and Michael Otto and Vance G. Fowler",
keywords = "Phenol-soluble modulin, Methicillin-susceptible , Skin and soft tissue infection, Pneumonia, Endocarditis",
abstract = "Summary
Background
Phenol-soluble modulins (PSM) are amphipathic proteins produced by Staphylococcus aureus that promote virulence, inflammatory response, and biofilm formation. We previously showed that MRSA isolates from soft tissue infection (SSTI) produced significantly higher levels of PSM than MRSA isolates from hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or infective endocarditis (IE). In this investigation, we sought to validate this finding in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates.
Methods
MSSA isolates (n = 162) from patients with SSTI, HAP, and IE were matched 1:1:1 based on geographic origin of the infection to form 54 triplets (North America n = 27, Europe n = 25, Australia n = 2). All isolates underwent spa typing and were classified using eGenomics. In vitro PSM production was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Fischer's Exact Test and the Kruskal–Wallis test were used for statistical analysis.
Results
Spa1 was more common in SSTI (14.81% SSTI, 3.70% HAP, 1.85% IE) (p < 0.03). Spa2 was more common in HAP (0% SSTI, 12.96% HAP, 3.70% IE) (p < 0.01). Levels of PSMα1-4 all differed significantly among the three clinical groups, with SSTI isolates producing the highest levels and IE producing the lowest levels of PSMα1-4. Spa1 isolates produced significantly more delta-toxin (p < 0.03) than non-Spa1 isolates. No associations between PSM levels and clinical outcome of SSTI, HAP, or IE were identified.
Conclusion
Production of PSMα1-4 is highest in SSTI MSSA isolates, supporting the hypothesis that these peptides are important for SSTI pathogenesis. These findings are similar to those described in MRSA, and demonstrate that associations between PSM levels and type of infection are independent of the methicillin-resistance status of the isolate."

Objectives
To compare clinical and microbiological characteristics, treatment and outcomes of MRSA bacteraemia among elderly and younger patients.
Material and methods
Prospective study conducted at 21 Spanish hospitals including patients with MRSA bacteraemia diagnosed between June/2008 and December/2009. Episodes diagnosed in patients aged 75 or more years old (≥75) were compared with the rest of them (<75).
Results
Out of 579 episodes of MRSA bacteraemia, 231 (39.9%) occurred in patients ≥75. Comorbidity was significantly higher in older patients (Charlson score ≥4: 52.8 vs. 44%; p = .037) as was the severity of the underlying disease (McCabe ≥1: 61.9 vs. 43.4%; p < .001). In this group the acquisition was more frequently health-care related (43.3 vs. 33.9%, p = .023), mostly from long-term care centers (12.1 vs. 3.7%, p < .001). An unknown focus was more frequent among ≥75 (19.9 vs. 13.8%; p = .050) while severity at presentation was similar between groups (Pitt score ≥3: 31.2 vs. 27.6%; p = .352). The prevalence of vancomycin resistant isolates was similar between groups, as was the appropriateness of empirical antibiotic therapy. Early (EM) and overall mortality (OM) were significantly more frequent in the ≥75 group (EM: 12.1 vs. 6%; p = .010 OM: 42.9 vs. 23%; p < .001). In multivariate analysis age ≥75 was an independent risk factor for overall mortality (aOR: 2.47, CI: 1.63–3.74; p < .001).
Conclusion
MRSA bacteraemia was frequent in patients aged ≥75 of our cohort. This group had higher comorbidity rates and the source of infection was more likely to be unknown. Although no differences were seen in severity or adequacy of empiric therapy, elderly patients showed a higher overall mortality."

Objectives
The objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic potential of 1,3-beta-d-glucan (BDG) testing in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples.
Methods
A total of 300 BALF samples from 252 patients were investigated for BDG (Fungitell® assay). Prognostic potential of BALF BDG was evaluated by using: i.) Kaplan–Meier analysis, and ii.) multivariable Cox hazard regression analyses.
Results
BALF BDG levels were found to be significantly higher in samples with Candida spp. colonization (p < 0.001). A total of 61/252 patients (24.2%) died within 90-days of BALF sampling (18.1% of patients with BALF BDG <200 pg/mL, 32.4% with BALF BDG ≥200 pg/mL). Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that overall cumulative 90-day mortality was significantly higher in those with BALF BDG levels ≥200 pg/mL when compared to those with levels <200 pg/mL (log-rank p = 0.006, Breslow p = 0.005 and Tarone–Ware p = 0.005). The multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that BALF BDG levels were a strong predictor of 90-day overall mortality, with a hazard ratio of 1.048 (per 100 pg/mL increase of BALF BDG).
Conclusion
False positive BALF BDG results in the presence of Candida spp. colonization of the lower respiratory tract may explain the limited diagnostic potential of BALF BDG testing. In contrast, prognostic potential of BALF BDG may be promising."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Early diagnosis and treatment of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is essential for a positive outcome, but sensitive, specific, and rapid diagnostic tests for TBM are lacking. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays in HIV-uninfected patients with suspected TBM.
Methods
All HIV-uninfected patients with suspected TBM were prospectively enrolled at a tertiary care hospital in an intermediate TB-burden country, during a 6-year period. ELISPOT assays were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and cerebrospinal fluid-mononuclear cells (CSF-MC).
Results
Of the 276 evaluable patients, 90 (33%) were classified as having TBM (30 definite cases, 19 probable, and 41 possible), and 186 (67%) as having non-TBM. When comparing definite TBM versus non-TBM, the sensitivity and specificity of the PBMC ELISPOT assay (≥6 spots; manufacturer's recommended cut-off) for diagnosing TBM were 96% (95% CI, 82–100) and 58% (95% CI, 50–66), respectively. The CSF-MC ELISPOT assay (≥38 spots; receiver operating characteristic [ROC]-derived cut-off) was a useful rule-in test with specificity of 95% (96% CI, 90–98). Its sensitivity was 68% (95% CI, 45–86), which was superior those of AFB smear microscopy (14%; P < 0.001) and CSF Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR (41%; P = 0.07). Combining this assay with M. tuberculosis PCR, clinical score, and both together increased sensitivity to 86%, 91%, and 95%, respectively, while retaining about 95% specificity.
Conclusions
The CSF-MC ELISPOT assay appears to be a rapid and accurate rule-in test for the diagnosis of TBM and a useful adjunct for diagnosing TBM in HIV-uninfected patients."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) remains difficult, particularly in resource-limited settings. The development of nucleic acid-based tests for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) has significantly increased sensitivity compared to conventional smear microscopy and provides results within a matter of hours compared to weeks for the current gold-standard, liquid culture.
Methods
In this study we performed side-by-side comparison of mycobacterial detection assays on sputum samples from 285 subjects presenting with symptoms suggestive of TB in The Gambia and a cross-sectional cohort of 156 confirmed TB patients with a median of 2 months of treatment. A novel assay, Loop-Mediated Amplification test for TB (TB-LAMP), was compared to smear microscopy, MGIT culture and GeneXpert MTB/RIF for all samples.
Results
When culture was used as the reference standard, we found an overall sensitivity for TB-LAMP of 99% (95% CI: 94.5–99.8) and specificity of 94% (95% CI: 89.3–96.7). When latent class analysis was performed, TB-LAMP had 98.6% (95% CI: 95.9–100) sensitivity and 99% (95% CI: 98.2–100) specificity compared to 91.1% (95% CI: 86.1–96) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI: 98.2–100) specificity for MGIT culture. GeneXpert had the highest sensitivity 99.1% (95% CI: 97.1–100) but the lowest specificity 96% (95% CI: 92.6–98.3). Both TB-LAMP and GeneXpert showed high sensitivity and specificity regardless of age or strain of infection.
Conclusion
Our findings show the diagnostic utility of both GeneXpert and TB-LAMP in The Gambia. Whilst TB-LAMP requires less infrastructure, it is unable to detect drug-resistant patterns and therefore would be most suitable as a screening test for new TB cases in peripheral health clinics."

Objectives
Urinary antigen testing for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 is the leading rapid diagnostic test for Legionnaires' Disease (LD); however other Legionella species and serogroups can also cause LD. The aim was to determine the utility of front-line L. pneumophila and Legionella species PCR in a severe respiratory infection algorithm.
Methods
L. pneumophila and Legionella species duplex real-time PCR was carried out on 1944 specimens from hospitalised patients over a 4 year period in Edinburgh, UK.
Results
L. pneumophila was detected by PCR in 49 (2.7%) specimens from 36 patients. During a LD outbreak, combined L. pneumophila respiratory PCR and urinary antigen testing had optimal sensitivity and specificity (92.6% and 98.3% respectively) for the detection of confirmed cases. Legionella species was detected by PCR in 16 (0.9%) specimens from 10 patients. The 5 confirmed and 1 probable cases of Legionella longbeachae LD were both PCR and antibody positive.
Conclusions
Front-line L. pneumophila and Legionella species PCR is a valuable addition to urinary antigen testing as part of a well-defined algorithm. Cases of LD due to L. longbeachae might be considered laboratory-confirmed when there is a positive Legionella species PCR result and detection of L. longbeachae specific antibody response."

Immunocompromised patients, especially those receiving treatment with corticosteroids and cytotoxic chemotherapy are at increased risk for developing Legionella pneumonia.
Objective
The aim of this study was to determine clinical and radiographic characteristics of pulmonary infection due to Legionella in persons undergoing treatment for cancer and stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients.
Methods
Retrospective review of Legionella cases at MSKCC over a fifteen-year study period from January 1999 and December 2013. Cases were identified by review of microbiology records.
Results
During the study period, 40 cases of Legionella infection were identified; nine among these were due to non-pneumophila species. Most cases occurred during the summer. The majority [8/9, (89%)] of patients with non-pneumophila infection had underlying hematologic malignancy, compared to 18/31 (58%) with Legionella pneumophila infections. Radiographic findings were varied-nodular infiltrates mimicking invasive fungal infection were seen only among patients with hematologic malignancy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients and were frequently associated with non-pneumophila infections (50% vs 16%; P = 0.0594). All cases of nodular Legionella pneumonia were found incidentally or had an indolent clinical course.
Conclusions
Legionella should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nodular lung lesions in immunocompromised patients, especially those with hematologic malignancy and SCT recipients. Most cases of nodular disease due to Legionella are associated with non-pneumophila infections."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
The pneumonia severity index and CURB-65 are risk assessment tools widely used in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, limitations in these prognostic scores have led to increasing interest in finding biomarkers that might provide additional information. To date, the role of these biomarkers has not been fully elucidated.
Methods
We systematically searched the Medline, Web of Knowledge, Science Direct, and LILACS databases. We included studies that assessed the accuracy of biomarkers for the prediction of in-hospital or ≤30-day mortality, in hospitalized adults with CAP. Two independent investigators extracted patient and study characteristics, which were thereafter pooled using a random effects model. Relationships between sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers and prognostic scores were plotter using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC).
Results
We included 24 articles and 2 databases from 1069 reviewed abstracts, which provided 10,319 patients for analysis. Reported mortality rates varied from 2.4% to 34.6%. The highest AUC values for predicting mortality were associated with pro-adrenomedullin (0.80) and prohormone forms of atrial natriuretic peptide (0.79), followed by cortisol (0.78), procalcitonin (0.75), copeptin (0.71), and C-reactive protein (0.62). There were no statistically significant differences between the AUCs of the studied biomarkers, other than for copeptin and C-reactive protein, which performed comparatively poorly. When compared with the CAP-specific scores, the AUCs were not significantly different from those of most biomarkers.
Conclusions
The identified biomarkers are able to predict mortality with moderate to good accuracy in CAP. However, biomarkers have no clear advantage over CAP-specific scores for predicting mortality."

Objectives
Immunological dysregulation is now recognised as a major pathogenic event in sepsis. Stimulation of immune response and immuno-modulation are emerging approaches for the treatment of this disease. Defining the underlying immunological alterations in sepsis is important for the design of future therapies with immuno-modulatory drugs.
Methods
Clinical studies evaluating the immunological response in adult patients with Sepsis and published in PubMed were reviewed to identify features of immunological dysfunction. For this study we used key words related with innate and adaptive immunity.
Results
Ten major features of immunological dysfunction (FID) were identified involving quantitative and qualitative alterations of [antigen presentation](FID1), [T and B lymphocytes] (FID2), [natural killer cells] (FID3), [relative increase in T regulatory cells] (FID4), [increased expression of PD-1 and PD-ligand1](FID5), [low levels of immunoglobulins](FID6), [low circulating counts of neutrophils and/or increased immature forms in non survivors](FID7), [hyper-cytokinemia] (FID8), [complement consumption] (FID9), [defective bacterial killing by neutrophil extracellular traps](FID10).
Conclusions
This review article identified ten major features associated with immunosuppression and immunological dysregulation in sepsis. Assessment of these features could help in utilizing precision medicine for the treatment of sepsis with immuno-modulatory drugs."

Objectives
Human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) can reactivate after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and may be associated with significant clinical manifestations.
Methods
Case control study of HHV-6 infections after allo-HSCT. Chromosomal integration (ciHHV-6) for viral loads ≥ 5.5-log10 copies/mL was investigated. Viral co-infections, T-cell recovery, risk factors and outcome were compared in HHV-6- and non-HHV-6-infected patients. Antiviral treatment strategies were reviewed.
Results
Among 366 adult allo-HSCT recipients, 75 HHV-6 infections occurred. Three (4%) recipients were ciHHV-6. HHV-6 infections were associated with CMV (p = 0.05; sdHR 1.73, CI 0.99–3.02) and/or BKV infections (p < 0.0001; sdHR 4.63, CI 2.04–10.53) but not EBV reactivation (p = 0.34). A slower CD8+ T-cells recovery was observed until 6 months after allo-HSCT in the HHV-6-infected group (p < 0.001), independently of acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease. The overall probability of survival after allo-HSCT was diminished for active HHV-6-infected patients (p = 0.0326). Cord blood unit recipients had a higher risk of developing HHV-6 infection compared to bone marrow recipients (p = 0.0007; sdHR 3.82, CI 1.76–8.27). Anti-HHV-6 treatment achieved complete response in only 2/3 of the cases.
Conclusions
In this series of allo-HSCT recipients, 4% were ciHHV-6, active HHV-6 infection was likely associated with CMV and BKV co-reactivations, delayed CD8+ T-cell recovery and poorer outcome."

Objectives
Blood-based Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRA) identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) sensitisation with increased specificity, but sensitivity remains impaired in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected persons. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test contains peptide 38–55 of Rv2654c, based on data indicating differential recognition between tuberculosis patients and BCG vaccinated controls in Europe. We aimed to fine map the T cell response to Rv2654c with the view of improving sensitivity.
Methods
Interferon-gamma ELISpot assay was used in HIV uninfected persons with latent and active tuberculosis to map peptide epitopes of Rv2654c. A modified IGRA was tested in two further groups of 55 HIV uninfected and 44 HIV infected persons, recruited in South Africa.
Results
The most prominently recognised peptide was between amino acids 51–65. Using p51-65 to boost the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay, the quantitative performance of the modified IGRA increased from 1.83 IU/ml (IQR 0.30–7.35) to 2.83 (IQR 0.28–12.2; p = 0.002) in the HIV uninfected group. In the HIV infected cohort the percentage of positive responders increased from 57% to 64% but only after 3 months of ART (p = ns).
Conclusions
Our data shows the potential to population tailor detection of MTB sensitization using specific synthetic peptides and interferon-gamma release in vitro."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
This study aimed to elucidate the antibody response pattern of multiple influenza subtypes through a 4-year serological study of a general population in Shenzhen, Southern China.
Methods
A serial cross-sectional serological survey was conducted at eight time points between 2009 and 2012. A total number of 5876 subjects were recruited from all age groups. The influenza subtypes tested were A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata, B/Victoria, and A/H1N1pdm. Genetic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed on 127 H3 genes and 28 H1pdm genes.
Results
We found concurrent epidemics of A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm with simultaneous peak times at March 2011. A/H3N2 was the dominant subtype. Ten residue substitutions (S61N, T64I, K78E, K160N, N161S, A214S, T228A, A229V, V239I, N294K, and N328S) were found in the H3 gene that might underlie its epidemic. The elderly group showed an antibody response cycle that was weaker in magnitude and slower in peak time than in younger groups.
Conclusions
The study provides a broad transmission picture and epidemiological characteristics of the major flu subtypes. The findings suggest that it may be necessary to include the A/H1N1pdm strain to the current trivalent or quadrivalent vaccine design. The delayed antibody response cycle in the elderly group indicates the need for better protection of elderly people that might be achieved by an earlier vaccination at a higher dose."

To identify associations between nasopharyngeal Bordetella pertussis DNA load and clinical and epidemiological characteristics and evaluate DNA load prognostic value in pertussis severity.
Methods
Prospective observational multi-centre study including nasopharyngeal samples positive to pertussis DNA by real-time PCR collected from children and adult patients in more than 200 health centres of Catalonia (Spain) during 2012–2013.
Results
B. pertussis load was inversely correlated with age (rho = −0.32, p < 0.001), time to diagnosis (rho = −0.33, p < 0.001) and number of symptoms (rho = 0.13, p = 0.002). Median bacterial load was significantly higher in inpatients versus outpatients (4.91 vs. 2.55 log10 CFU/mL, p < 0.001), patients with complications versus those without (6.05 vs. 2.82 log10 CFU/mL, p < 0.001), disease incidence in summer and autumn versus spring and winter (3.50 vs. 2.21 log10 CFU/mL, p = 0.002), and unvaccinated-partially vaccinated patients versus vaccinated (4.20 vs. 2.76 log10 CFU/mL, p = 0.004). A logistic regression model including bacterial load and other candidate prognostic factors showed good prediction for hospital care (AUC = 0.94) although only age and unvaccinated status were found to be prognostic factors.
Conclusions
We observed strong positive associations of nasopharyngeal bacterial load with severity outcomes of hospitalisation and occurrence of complications. Bacterial load and other independent variables contributed to an accurate prognostic model for hospitalisation."

Results
From March 2006 to December 2013, 1354 episodes of community-acquired meningitis were included in the cohort. Thirteen patients were HIV-infected (1.0%). The annual incidence of bacterial meningitis was 8.3-fold higher (95%CI 4.6–15.1, P < 0.001) among HIV-infected patients as compared to the general population (10.79 [95%CI 5.97–19.48] vs 1.29 [95%CI 1.22–1.37] per 100.000 patients per year). Predisposing factors (other than HIV), clinical symptoms and signs, ancillary investigations, causative organisms and outcome were comparable between HIV-infected and patients without HIV infection.
Conclusions
HIV-infected patients in the Netherlands have a 8.3-fold higher risk for bacterial meningitis as compared to the general population despite cART therapy. Clinical presentation and outcome of patients with acute bacterial meningitis with and without HIV are similar."

Background and objectives
Severe infection with avian influenza A (H5N6) virus in humans was identified first in 2014 in China. Before that, it was unknown or unclear if the disease or the pathogen affected people. This study illustrates the virological and clinical findings of a fatal H5N6 virus infection in a human patient.
Methods
We obtained and analyzed the clinical, epidemiological, and virological data from the patient. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing were conducted for determination of the causative pathogen.
Results
The patient, who presented with fever, severe pneumonia, leucopenia, and lymphopenia, developed septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and died on day 10 after illness onset. A novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A (H5N6) virus was isolated from the throat swab or trachea aspirate of the patient. The virus was reassorted with the HA gene of clade 2.3.4.4 H5, the internal genes of clade 2.3.2.1 H5, and the NA gene of the H6N6 avian virus. The cleavage site of the HA gene contained multiple basic amino acids, indicating that the novel H5N6 virus was highly pathogenic in chicken.
Conclusions
A novel, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N6 virus with a backbone of H5N1 virus acquired from the NA gene from the H6N6 virus has been identified. It caused human infection resulting in severe respiratory disease."

abstract = "Summary
The development of effective Mycobacterial antigen diagnostic reagents remains a high priority. Mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) is a lipoglycan serving as a major cell wall component. ManLAM is also an early released antigen in the blood circulation system during Mycobacteria tuberculosis (M.tb) infection and is a perfect target antigen for TB diagnosis. In this study, ssDNA aptamers “antibodies” against ManLAM of the predominant clinical epidemic M.tb Beijing genotype strains were generated by the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) technique. The selected single aptamer T9 demonstrated the highest specificity and binding affinity, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 668 ± 159 nmol/L. We further detected ManLAM antigens in serum and sputum samples from active pulmonary tuberculosis (aPTB) patients, extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) patients and healthy donors by using a T9 based enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA). The results showed that the specificity and sensitivity were 95.31% and 83.00% (for 100 aPTB serum samples), 98.70% and 92.71% (for 96 aPTB sputum samples), and 94.44% and 88.71% (for 62 EPTB serum samples), respectively. A good correlation was observed between the T9 aptamer-based ELONA and the clinical T-SPOT.TB. Thus, T9 based ELONA has potentials for diagnosis of TB, including inactive TB, smear-negative TB, EPTB, and TB with immunodeficiency, and assist the diagnosis of LTBI albeit it could not distinguish LTBI and active TB."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA) is a surface protein involved in epithelial attachment and extrapulmonary dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. HBHA is attracting increasing attention for its vaccine and diagnostic potential. In a longitudinal study, we investigated non-methylated, recombinant HBHA-specific cytokine and antibody profiles in cohorts of TB patients, their contacts and community controls in an endemic setting.
Methods
Whole blood assay was done at baseline, 6 and 12 months in patients and contacts, and at entry in controls. ELISA was used to measure IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-10 (from supernatants), and IgG, IgM and IgA (from sera).
Results
Fifty-three percent of controls and 72.1% of contacts were QFT-GIT positive. Baseline IFN-γ was significantly higher in community controls and contacts compared to untreated TB patients (p < 0.0001). Controls had significantly higher IgA and lower IgM compared to both untreated TB patients and contacts (p < 0.0001). IL-10 was significantly higher in untreated TB patients compared to contacts and controls (p < 0.0001). In treated TB patients, IFN-γ significantly increased (p < 0.0001) whereas IL-10 significantly decreased (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
This study reports for the first time that anti-HBHA IgA could have the potential as a biomarker of protective immunity. In addition, non-methylated, recombinant HBHA-induced IFN-γ could be used as a biomarker of protective immunity and latent TB."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Stringent measures have been implemented in Hong Kong to prevent human infections due to avian influenza viruses (AIVs). Here, we report the seroprevalence of AIVs among high risk population.
Methods
In this prospective study, blood samples were collected in October and November 2013 and in July 2014 from workers at live poultry market (LPM) and pig/cattle slaughterhouse (SH) in Hong Kong. Serum antibody titers against A(H5N1), A(H7N9) and A(H9N2) were determined.
Results
When an hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer of 40 was used as the cutoff, the A(H5N1) seropositive rate among LPM workers increased from 0% in 2013 to 37.8% in 2014 (P < 0.001) and the A(H9N2) seropositive rate increased from 10% to 55.6% (P < 0.001). There was no significant increase in A(H7N9) seropositive rate for LPM workers irrespective of cutoff titer. For SH workers, there was no significant increase in HI titer for any AIVs. Significantly more LPM workers had a ≥4-fold increase in A(H5N1) HI titer from 2013 to 2014 than SH workers (60% vs 8.3%, P = 0.020).
Conclusions
There was a significant increase of serum A(H5N1) and A(H9N2) HI titers among Hong Kong LPM workers between 2013 and 2014. Although we cannot exclude some degree of antibody cross-reactivity with other influenza viruses, our results suggest the occurrence of subclinical AIV infections in this population."

Objectives
To determine risk factors for GBS colonisation in Gambian mothers and in their infants from birth to day 60–89 of age.
Methods
Swabs and breastmilk from mothers/infant pairs were collected and cultured on selective agar. Negative samples were analysed for GBS DNA via real-time PCR. Positive isolates were serotyped using multiplex PCR and gel-agarose electrophoresis.
Results
Seven hundred and fifty women/infant pairs were recruited. 253 women (33.7%) were GBS-colonised at delivery. The predominant serotypes were: V (55%), II (16%), III (10%), Ia (8%) and Ib (8%). 186 infants were colonised (24.8%) at birth, 181 (24.1%) at 6 days and 96 at day 60–89 (14%). Infants born before 34 weeks of gestation and to women with rectovaginal and breastmilk colonisation at delivery had increased odds of GBS colonisation at birth. Season of birth was associated with increased odds of persistent infant GBS colonisation (dry season vs. wet season AOR 2.9; 95% CI 1.6–5.2).
Conclusion
GBS colonisation is common in Gambian women at delivery and in their infants to day 60−89 and is dominated by serotype V. In addition to maternal colonisation, breastmilk and season of birth are important risk factors for infant GBS colonisation."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Individuals with perinatally acquired HIV infection have benefited from antiretroviral therapy. However, they often have complex patterns of major resistance mutations that limit the effectiveness of available antiretroviral medications. Knowledge of incidence rates of major antiretroviral resistance mutations should provide a benchmark enabling comparisons of different HIV care delivery modalities.
Methods
We test the hypothesis that incidence rate of major antiretroviral resistance mutations will decline with improvement in HIV care between 1998 and 2009 to NRTI, NNRTI, PI and triple class resistance in perinatally HIV infected individuals. Logistic regression is used to evaluate predictors of single and triple class resistance.
Results
Sixty-six individuals are included from a total population of 97 perinatally HIV infected individuals. The incidence rate of NRTI, NNRTI, PI and triple class resistance decreases with decreasing age in parallel with the introduction of new HIV treatment regimens. The youngest children (born 2000–2007) are free of triple class resistance. Mono-therapy associates with major resistance mutations to NRTI (OR 8.7, CI 1.5–50.9, P 0.02); NNRTI exposure associates with major resistance mutations to NNRTI (OR 24.4, CI 5.7–104.5, P 0.01) and triple class resistance (OR 10.7, CI 1.8–67.1, P 0.01). Cumulative viral load is an important predictor of PI resistance (OR 4.0, CI 1.3–12.3, P 0.02).
Conclusions
There is a progressive decrease in the incidence rate of major resistance mutations to antiretroviral drugs and triple class resistance from the oldest to the youngest birth cohort; where adolescents have the highest risk of harboring resistant viruses. The incidence rate of major antiretroviral resistance mutations provides a benchmark for the comparative measurement of effectiveness of different HIV care delivery modalities."

Objectives
We tested the hypothesis that declines in Listeria monocytogenes in infants are related to declines in rates of early-onset Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infections associated with widespread prophylaxis using agents with Listeria activity.
Methods
We performed a retrospective cohort analysis using a national administrative database Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS). We searched for ICD-9 codes for Listeriosis in infants <30 days old and for early-onset GBS infection of any kind in infants <5 days old during the study period.
Results
We identified 183 cases of Listeriosis in infants <30 days in the PHIS database from 1992 to 2013. We noted a statistically significant decline in case rates over the years studied: 4.78 cases per 10,000 admissions (1992–1995) to 2.24 (1996–2002) to 1.31 from (2003–2013) (p < 0.0001). Case rates of early-onset GBS dropped significantly over the study period: 30.10 cases per 1000 admissions (1992–1995) to 21.70 (1996–2002) to 18.57 (2003–2013) (p < 0.0001). There was a statistically significant correlation between yearly rates of Listeriosis and early-onset GBS (rho: 0.53; p = 0.01).
Conclusions
These results support the hypothesis of a “collateral benefit” to widespread GBS prophylaxis and further support the position that empiric antibiotic regimens for febrile infants may no longer require Listeria activity."

abstract = "Summary
Differentiating between inflammatory disorders is difficult, but important for a rational use of antimicrobial agents. Biomarkers reflecting the host immune response may offer an attractive strategy to predict the etiology of an inflammatory process and can thus be of help in decision making. We performed a review of the literature to evaluate the diagnostic value of inflammatory biomarkers in adult patients admitted to the hospital with suspected systemic acute infections. Elevated procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations indicate a bacterial infection in febrile patients with an auto-immune disease, rather than a disease flare. CD64 expression on neutrophils can discriminate between non-infectious systemic inflammation and sepsis, and limited evidence suggests the same for decoy receptor 3. PCT is useful for both diagnosing bacterial infection complicating influenza and guiding antibiotic treatment in lower respiratory tract infections in general. In undifferentiated illnesses, increased CD35 expression on neutrophils distinguishes bacterial from viral infections. Compared to bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections are characterized by low concentrations of PCT. No biomarker predicting a specific infecting agent could be identified."

abstract = "Summary
Introduction
The incidence of Candida spp. infections is worrisome, particularly in critically ill patients. Previous reports suggested that increasing use of antifungal therapy might affect resistance profiles of invasive strains. The study objective was to describe the distribution resistance profile of Candida spp. strains, and to correlate it with antifungal consumptions within one ICU.
Method
Antifungal drug consumption was measured as the number of defined daily doses per 1000 hospital days. The distribution of Candida spp. over a 10 year period 2004–2013 and the MICs of antifungal drugs over 2007–2013 were determined. Time series analyses were performed.
Results
Of 2403 identified Candida spp. from 5360 patients, Candida albicans predominated (53.1%), followed by Candida glabrata (16.2%), Candida parapsilosis (7.9%) and Candida tropicalis (7.5%). C. parapsilosis increased from 5.7% in 2004 to 8.4% in 2013 (P = 0.02). The increase in caspofungin use is correlated with the increase in caspofungin MICs of C. parapsilosis (P = 0.01), C. glabrata (P = 0.001) and C. albicans (P = 0.02). Polyenes consumption correlated with an increase in amphotericin B MICs of C. glabrata (P = 0.04).
Conclusion
Previous history of antifungal prescription within an ICU influences Candida species distribution and susceptibility profile to antifungal agents. The significant selective pressure exerted by caspofungin and amphotericin B on C. glabrata is a concern."

Objectives
The galactomannan (GM) test is a useful method for early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Recently, multiple myeloma has newly been suggested to be related to false-positive results of GM. We performed a case-control study to validate this finding.
Methods
Electronic medical records were reviewed for patients admitted March through June 2014. Patients with false-positive GM results were selected as cases and those with negatives as controls. To verify the results of the four-month analysis, additional analysis was performed in multiple myeloma patients over a three-year period.
Results
There were 30 false-positive and 316 negative cases during the four-month period. Among the factors evaluated, multiple myeloma was the only significant factor in the adjusted analysis (OR = 3.59, CI 1.28–10.04). In the three-year analysis of 145 multiple myeloma patients, 25.5% showed false-positive results, which was 3 times higher than overall. GM false-positivity was not related to serum monoclonal protein level or type of immunoglobulin. GM optical density indexes (ODIs) in all false positives were lower than 3.0.
Conclusions
Multiple myeloma was a major cause of GM false-positivity in adult cancer patients. GM was false-positive in 25.5% of multiple myeloma patients with GM ODIs lower than 3.0."

Objectives
The third largest historical outbreak of dengue occurred during July to December 2014, in 20 of 21 cities of Guangdong, China. The epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the introduction, expansion and phylogeny of the DENV isolates involved in this outbreak were investigated.
Methods
A combination analyses of epidemiological characteristics and genetic diversity of dengue virus was performed in this study.
Results
In total, 45,236 cases and 6 fatalities were reported. Unemployed individuals, retirees and retailers were the most affected populations. A total of 6024 cases were verified to have DENV infections by nucleic acid detection, of which 5947, 74 and 3 were confirmed to have DENV-1, -2, and -3 infections, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of DENV-1 isolates were assigned into three genotypes (I, IV, and V). Genotype V was the predominant genotype that likely originated from Singapore. The DENV-2 isolates were assigned to the Cosmopolitan and Asian I genotypes. A unique DENV-3 isolate (genotype III) shared high similarity with isolates obtained from Guangdong in 2013.
Conclusions
A combination analyses demonstrated the multiple geographical origins of this outbreak, and highlight the importance of early detection, the case management and vector surveillance for preventing further dengue epidemics in Guangdong."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is estimated to affect 3 million persons worldwide. Aspergillus-specific IgG is a key component in CPA diagnosis. We aimed to establish the optimal diagnostic cut offs for CPA and the comparative performance of six assays in this context.
Methods
Sera from 241 patients with CPA and 100 healthy blood donors were tested using five Aspergillus-specific IgG assays plus precipitin testing using Microgen Aspergillus antigens.
Results
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) results were as follows: ThermoFisher Scientific ImmunoCAP 0.996 (95% confidence interval 0.992–1), Siemens Immulite 0.991 (0.982–1), Serion 0.973 (0.960–0.987), Dynamiker 0.918 (0.89–0.946) and Genesis 0.902 (0.871–0.933). Optimal CPA diagnostic cut-offs were; ImmunoCAP 20 mg/L (96% sensitivity, 98% specificity), Immulite 10 mg/L (96% sensitivity, 98% specificity), Serion 35 U/ml (90% sensitivity, 98% specificity), Dynamiker 65 AU/ml (77% sensitivity, 97% specificity) and Genesis 20 U/ml (75% sensitivity, 99% specificity). The precipitin test was 59% sensitive and 100% specific.
Conclusions
ImmunoCAP and Immulite were statistically significantly superior to the other assays. Precipitins testing performed poorly. The currently accepted ImmunoCAP cut-off of 40 mg/L appears sub-optimal for CPA diagnosis and may require revision in this context."

Objectives
We aimed to examine the dynamics of Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in healthy adults.
Method
Selected S. aureus strains isolated from weekly nasal swabs obtained from 122 healthy young adults over a 13 week period were spa typed.
Results
The median duration of intermittent carriage was 4 weeks (IQR 2–6) and the median interval between episodes of carriage of different spa types was 3.5 weeks (IQR 2.25–4). 6/19 (32%) Persistent carriers were colonised with more than one spa type during the study, and in two persistent carriers a brief period of mixed colonisation with two spa types was observed. Even when the carriage strain changed, it was very rare for persistent carriers to have a period during which they were culture-negative (only 6/188 (3%) swabs submitted by persistent carriers failed to culture S. aureus).
Conclusions
Our results imply that at least every eight weeks a healthy young adult is exposed to S. aureus sufficient to cause a new episode of carriage among intermittent carriers. Persistent carriers are almost always colonised with S. aureus and over the course of a year there will be at least one replacement of the dominant strain."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Most available information on carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) is usually associated with specific types of infection or patient or with descriptions of outbreaks. The aim of this study was to comprehensively analyse the clinical epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of colonisation and infections due to CPE in Spain.
Methods
A multicentre prospective cohort study was carried out in 34 Spanish hospitals from February to May 2013. All new patients testing positive for CPE in clinical samples were included. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of mortality.
Results
Overall, 245 cases were included. The most frequent organism was Klebsiella pneumoniae (74%) and the carbapenemases belonged to the OXA-48 (74%), metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) (24%) and KPC (2%) groups. Acquisition was nosocomial in 145 cases (60%) and healthcare-associated (HCA) in 91 (37%); 42% of the latter were nursing home residents, in whom OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae ST405 predominated. MBLs and OXA-48 predominated in ICU and medical patients, respectively. Overall, 67% of patients had infections. The most frequent infections identified in this study were urinary tract (43%) and skin structure (21%) infections, and 10% of infections were bacteraemic. Crude mortality was 20%. Inappropriate antibiotic therapy was independently associated with an increased risk of death (OR = 3.30; 95% CI: 1.34–8.11).
Conclusions
We found some differences in the epidemiology of CPE depending on the type of carbapenemase produced. Although a low proportion of CPE infections were bacteraemic, active antibiotic therapy was a protective factor for reducing mortality."

Background & aims
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has been approved for chronic hepatitis B treatment, and favorable susceptibility of hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been indicated. However, differences in TDF susceptibility among HBV genotypes and drug-resistant strains are unclear. In this study, TDF susceptibilities between genotypes A and C were evaluated in vitro and in vivo using several drug-resistant HBV clones.
Methods
HBV expression plasmids were constructed from sera of HBV carriers, and drug-resistant substitutions were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. TDF susceptibility was evaluated by changes of core-associated HBV replication intermediates in vitro or by change of serum HBV DNA in human hepatocyte chimeric mice carrying each HBV clone in vivo.
Results
TDF susceptibilities of lamivudine-resistant clones (rtL180M/M204V) and lamivudine plus entecavir-resistant clones (rtL180M/S202G/M204V) were similar to wild type clones in vitro. However, lamivudine plus adefovir-resistant clones (rtA181T/N236T) acquired tolerance to TDF, and the rtN236T mutation was considered to be a causal substitution for TDF resistance. Furthermore, genotypic differences in TDF susceptibility were also observed between genotypes A and C in vitro, and the differences could be confirmed in vivo (p = 0.023).
Conclusions
The present study indicates that TDF susceptibility varies among HBV genotypes and drug-resistant HBV clones."

Objective
Mortality and morbidity of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) still remains considerably high. We aimed to evaluate the impact of infectious disease consultation (IDC) on the management and outcomes of patients with SAB.
Methods
We systematically searched 3 publication databases from inception to 31st May 2015 and reference lists of identified primary studies.
Results
Our search returned 2874 reports, of which 18 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, accounting for 5337 patients. Overall 30-day mortality was 19.95% [95% CI 14.37–27.02] with a significant difference in favour of the IDC group (12.39% vs 26.07%) with a relative risk (RR) of 0.53 [95% CI 0.43–0.65]. 90-day mortality and relapse risk for SAB were also reduced significantly with RRs of 0.77 [95% CI 0.64–0.92] and 0.62 [95% CI 0.39–0.99], respectively. Both, the appropriateness of antistaphylococcal agent and treatment duration was improved by IDC (RR 1.14 [95% CI 1.08–1.20] and 1.85 [95% CI 1.39–2.46], respectively). Follow-up blood cultures and echocardiography were performed more frequently following IDC (RR 1.35 [95% CI 1.25–1.46] and 1.98 [95% CI 1.66–2.37], respectively).
Conclusions
Evidence-based clinical management enforced by IDC may improve outcome of patients with SAB. Well-designed cluster-randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this finding from observational studies."

Objectives
This study aimed to estimate the frequency of hospitalizations due to herpes zoster (HZ) and to describe their clinical characteristics by sex and age group.
Methods
Descriptive population-based cross-sectional study of hospital admissions due to HZ from 2003 to 2013 among residents in the Autonomous Community of Madrid. Sex, age, comorbidities, length of stay and outcomes were collected and described. Crude and age-adjusted cumulative incidence rates, and stratified by sex and age, were estimated. Robust Poisson regression analysis was used to calculate the incidence rate ratios by age group.
Results
2039 hospitalizations were identified (51.0% in women). Complicated HZ caused 48.7% of them (50.9% in women). The hospitalization rate was 2.98/100,000 person-years and 7.19/1000 cases of HZ in primary care. Both rates were significantly higher in men, except in the extreme age groups. An immunosuppression-associated comorbidity was identified in 32.8% of the cases and was less common in patients ≥75 years of age. The median length of stay was 6 days, and in-hospital mortality was 1.4%.
Conclusions
Hospitalization rates due to HZ were higher in men and increased with age. In two out of every three cases, a comorbidity that potentially caused immunosuppression could not be identified. These cases could benefit from vaccination."

Bacterial meningitis and meningococcal sepsis are rare conditions with high case fatality rates. Early recognition and prompt treatment saves lives. In 1999 the British Infection Society produced a consensus statement for the management of immunocompetent adults with meningitis and meningococcal sepsis. Since 1999 there have been many changes. We therefore set out to produce revised guidelines which provide a standardised evidence-based approach to the management of acute community acquired meningitis and meningococcal sepsis in adults. A working party consisting of infectious diseases physicians, neurologists, acute physicians, intensivists, microbiologists, public health experts and patient group representatives was formed. Key questions were identified and the literature reviewed. All recommendations were graded and agreed upon by the working party. The guidelines, which for the first time include viral meningitis, are written in accordance with the AGREE 2 tool and recommendations graded according to the GRADE system. Main changes from the original statement include the indications for pre-hospital antibiotics, timing of the lumbar puncture and the indications for neuroimaging. The list of investigations has been updated and more emphasis is placed on molecular diagnosis. Approaches to both antibiotic and steroid therapy have been revised. Several recommendations have been given regarding the follow-up of patients."

Objectives
To identify factors which regulate MAIT cell response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, and to investigate the role of MAIT cells in patients with active tuberculosis.
Methods
Immune response of MAIT cells to M. tuberculosis antigens were compared between patients with active TB and healthy controls by flow cytometry and RNA sequencing.
Results
IFN-γ response of MAIT cells to M. tuberculosis lysates was dramatically improved by signal 3 cytokine IL-15 (p = 0.0002). Patients with active TB exhibited highly reduced IFN-γ production in MAIT cells stimulated with M. tuberculosis lysates/IL-15 compared with healthy controls (p < 0.0001) and individuals with latent TB infection (p = 0.0008). RNA sequencing of flow-sorted MAIT cells from patients with TB and healthy controls identified numerous differentially expressed genes, and the expression of genes that encode IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-17F, granulysin and granzyme B were all down-regulated in patients with TB. MAIT cells from patients with TB has significantly lower expression of γc receptor than those from healthy controls under condition of Mtb lysates/IL-15 stimulation (p = 0.0028). Blockade of both γc and IL-2Rβ receptors resulted in highly reduced frequency of IFN-γ-producing MAIT cells (79.4%) (p = 0.0011).
Conclusions
MAIT cells from patients with active TB exhibited impaired cytokine and cytotoxic response to M. tuberculosis antigens."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
To define which variables upon ICU admission could be related to the presence of coinfection using CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection) analysis.
Methods
A secondary analysis from a prospective, multicentre, observational study (2009–2014) in ICU patients with confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. We assessed the potential of biomarkers and clinical variables upon admission to the ICU for coinfection diagnosis using CHAID analysis. Performance of cut-off points obtained was determined on the basis of the binominal distributions of the true (+) and true (−) results.
Results
Of the 972 patients included, 196 (20.3%) had coinfection. Procalcitonin (PCT; ng/mL 2.4 vs. 0.5, p < 0.001), but not C-reactive protein (CRP; mg/dL 25 vs. 38.5; p = 0.62) was higher in patients with coinfection. In CHAID analyses, PCT was the most important variable for coinfection. PCT <0.29 ng/mL showed high sensitivity (Se = 88.2%), low Sp (33.2%) and high negative predictive value (NPV = 91.9%). The absence of shock improved classification capacity. Thus, for PCT <0.29 ng/mL, the Se was 84%, the Sp 43% and an NPV of 94% with a post-test probability of coinfection of only 6%.
Conclusion
PCT has a high negative predictive value (94%) and lower PCT levels seems to be a good tool for excluding coinfection, particularly for patients without shock."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Changes in circulating Bordetella pertussis genotypes, including a novel pertussis toxin promoter ptxP3 allele and absence of pertactin (Prn) antigen, have been reported from several countries but limited data on relative severity are available. We compared markers of disease severity in children with B. pertussis infection due to strains of differing genotype.
Methods
Culture confirmed cases presenting to tertiary paediatric hospitals in three Australian states between 2008 and 2012 were classified as severe if they required a hospital stay greater than seven days, were admitted to intensive care, or if death occurred. Associations between age, vaccination, genotype and severity were assessed.
Results
Of 199 pertussis cases, 81 (41%) were <3 months, including 32/39 (82%) of severe cases. The proportion of isolates from these cases that were Prn deficient increased markedly between 2008 and 2012. Of B. pertussis isolates, the proportion considered severe was similar for Prn positive (27/128, 21%) and Prn deficient (12/71, 17%) cases but only 1/22 (4.5%) of non ptxP3 cases were severe versus 38/177 (21.4%) ptxP3 positive. Adjusting for ptxP type, vaccination status and age, disease severity was not significantly associated with Prn status (RRA: 0.95, [0.57–1.56]; p = 0.83).
Conclusions
In children, we found no relationship between Prn status and markers of severe pertussis. An increased proportion of severe disease in isolates with the ptxP3 allele was observed."

Objective
The objective of this analysis was to assess human papillomavirus (HPV) infection persistence and incidence 7-months post-enrollment by HPV vaccine study arm (vaccine or placebo).
Methods
HIV-negative, sexually active women aged 16–24 years in the Western Cape, South Africa, were enrolled in the EVRI Trial and were randomized to receive 4-valent HPV vaccine or placebo. Cervical specimens were collected at enrollment and at the 7-month visit and were genotyped for HPV. HPV prevalence, persistence, and incidence were calculated. Prevalence ratios and odds ratios were calculated to assess factors associated with a prevalent and incident HPV infection.
Results
HPV incidence rates were marginally higher for the placebo group (n = 163) compared to the vaccine group (n = 169). A large proportion of the prevalent high-risk (HR-HPV) HPV types (49%) persisted over the 7-month period in both arms. Prevalent HR-HPV infection was significantly associated with a prevalent gonorrhea infection and detection of Herpes simplex type 2 antibodies. Incident HR-HPV infection was significantly associated with abnormal cervical cytology at enrollment and younger age.
Conclusions
Women living in geographic areas, such as southern Africa, at high-risk for HPV need to receive HPV vaccination at a very young age to maximally prevent infection and subsequent disease."

Sepsis is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to an infective insult. This process often leads to widespread tissue injury and multiple organ dysfunction. In particular, the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most frequent complications, which increases the complexity and cost of care, and is an independent risk factor for mortality. Previous suggestions highlighting systemic hypotension, renal vasoconstriction and ischaemia–reperfusion injury as the primary pathophysiological mechanisms involved in sepsis-induced AKI have been challenged. Recently it has been shown that sepsis-induced AKI occurs in the setting of microvascular dysfunction with release of microparticles, inflammation and energetic adaptation of highly metabolic organs to cellular stress. The intolerable high mortality rate associated with sepsis-induced AKI is partially explained by an incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology and a delay in diagnosis. The aim of this review is to focus on advances in understanding the sepsis pathophysiology, with particular attention to the fundamental mechanisms of sepsis-induced AKI and the potential diagnostic and prognostic markers involved."

Objectives
Pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (NTM) is a challenging and increasingly prevalent infection. Antimicrobial resistance is common and may be associated with poor outcomes. This retrospective study aimed to report longitudinal trends in mycobacterial isolation and NTM drug susceptibility.
Methods
Mycobacterial culture and drug sensitivity testing results were obtained over a 13 year period. Drug sensitivity testing was performed by broth macrodilution for slow-growing mycobacteria and disc diffusion for rapidly growing mycobacteria.
Results
Culture results were obtained from 109,311 samples (31,758 subjects) of which 5960 samples (1209 subjects) isolated NTM over 13 years. Drug susceptibility results were obtained for 2637 NTM isolates (898 subjects). NTM isolation increased over time, driven by the Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus. Amongst most species, resistance to the key agents clarithromycin and amikacin was rare. The highest rate of resistance was found in M. abscessus and Mycobacterium simiae. Most M. abscessus isolates were sensitive to macrolides, aminoglycosides and tigecycline; M. simiae isolates were only consistently sensitive to clofazimine, amikacin and cycloserine.
Conclusions
NTM isolation is increasingly common in our centre. Reassuringly, resistance to clarithromycin and amikacin is rare in most species. Tigecycline, cycloserine and clofazimine may be useful in the treatment of the most resistant species, M. abscessus and M. simiae."

Objectives
To explore risk factors for sporadic salmonellosis at the individual and household level in children in tropical Darwin, where animal faeces contaminated with Salmonella is thought to be common.
Methods
A 2-year community based case–control study of children aged 0–4 years residing in Darwin and Palmerston from June 2006. Variables included behaviour, health, food, family and housing characteristics. Environmental samples were taken from houses of case and control children.
Results
Of children whose parents were contacted, 59/131 cases and 95/222 controls were included. Salmonella was isolated from 41/56 (73%) case houses and 18/29 (62%) control houses (p = 0.29). Multivariate analyses showed breastfeeding 0.16 (p = 0.02), increasing age (months) 0.89 (p = 0.00) and daily vacuuming 0.18 (p = 0.06) were protective; consuming powdered formula milk 4.88 (p = 0.02), pet ownership 4.86 (p = 0.02), oral contact with animals 7.85 (p = 0.05), recent antibiotic use 10.01 (p = 0.03) and sweeping in the presence of children 3.73 (p = 0.04) were associated with sporadic salmonellosis.
Conclusions
Salmonellosis in children under 5 years of age is associated with potentially modifiable risk factors other than food. Breastfeeding beyond 6 months, careful hygiene when preparing formula milk and around pets, frequent cleaning of infant play areas especially quick removal of animal faeces are behaviours likely to reduce childhood sporadic salmonellosis."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Human studies on the role of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) in patients with invasive candidiasis have yielded conflicting results. We investigated the influence of MBL and other lectin pathway proteins on Candida colonization and intra-abdominal candidiasis (IAC) in a cohort of high-risk patients.
Methods
Prospective observational cohort study of 89 high-risk intensive-care unit (ICU) patients. Levels of lectin pathway proteins at study entry and six MBL2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed by sandwich-type immunoassays and genotyping, respectively, and correlated with development of heavy Candida colonization (corrected colonization index (CCI) ≥0.4) and occurrence of IAC during a 4-week period.
Results
Within 4 weeks after inclusion a CCI ≥0.4 and IAC was observed in 47% and 38% of patients respectively. Neither serum levels of MBL, ficolin-1, -2, -3, MASP-2 or collectin liver 1 nor MBL2 genotypes were associated with a CCI ≥0.4. Similarly, none of the analyzed proteins was found to be associated with IAC with the exception of lower MBL levels (HR 0.74, p = 0.02) at study entry. However, there was no association of MBL deficiency (<0.5 μg/ml), MBL2 haplo- or genotypes with IAC.
Conclusion
Lectin pathway protein levels and MBL2 genotype investigated in this study were not associated with heavy Candida colonization or IAC in a cohort of high-risk ICU patients."

Objectives
We sought to assess the importance of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae in urinary tract infections in outpatients in France.
Methods
Retrospective laboratory based survey analysing susceptibility patterns of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates providing from urines collected from outpatients during three months in 2013.
Results
Four hundred and ninety-nine laboratories collected data on 51,643 E. coli and 3495 K. pneumoniae isolates. The overall proportion of ESBL-producing E. coli was 3.3%. The proportion was higher for males (4.8%) than for females (3.0%) and increased with age: 2% for patients <20 years to 5.4% for those aged >80 years. More than 95% of isolates we susceptible to cefixime, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin. In nursing homes, the ESBL-producing E. coli proportion was 12.1%. For K. pneumoniae, the proportion of ESBL-positive isolates was 6.6%, and this proportion increased with age. Data from 2010 collected from a subset of the network showed that the ESBL-producing E. coli proportion was 2.0%.
Conclusion
ESBL-producing isolates were rather frequent in urines in French outpatients in 2013. Males and persons residing in nursing homes were at higher risk of ESBL-positive infection. Despite the increase in ESBL-positive isolates, the susceptibility to antibiotics used to treat cystitis remains high."

Objectives
The treatment of Candida implant-associated infections remains challenging. We investigated the antifungal activity against planktonic and biofilm Candida albicans in a foreign-body infection model.
Methods
Teflon cages were subcutaneously implanted in guinea pigs, infected with C. albicans (ATCC 90028). Animals were treated intraperitoneally 12 h after infection for 4 days once daily with saline, fluconazole (16 mg/kg), amphotericin B (2.5 mg/kg), caspofungin (2.5 mg/kg) or anidulafungin (20 mg/kg). Planktonic Candida was quantified, the clearance rate and cure rate determined.
Results
In untreated animals, planktonic Candida was cleared from cage fluid in 25% (infected with 4.5 × 103 CFU/cage), 8% (infected with 4.8 × 104 CFU/cage) and 0% (infected with 6.2 × 105 CFU/cage). Candida biofilm persisted on all explanted cages. Compared to untreated controls, caspofungin reduced the number of planktonic C. albicans to 0.22 and 0.0 CFU/ml, respectively, and anidulafungin to 0.11 and 0.13 CFU/ml, respectively. Fluconazole cured 2/12 cages (17%), amphotericin B and anidulafungin 1/12 cages (8%) and caspofungin 3/12 cages (25%).
Conclusion
Echinocandins showed superior activity against planktonic C. albicans. Caspofungin showed the highest cure rate of C. albicans biofilm. However, no antifungal exceeded 25% cure rate, demonstrating the difficulty of eradicating Candida biofilms from implants."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Despite high pertussis vaccination coverage, Australia experienced a prolonged epidemic in 2008–2012. The predominant Bordetella pertussis genotype harboured pertussis toxin promoter allele, ptxP3, and pertactin gene allele, prn2. The emergence and expansion of prn non-expressing isolates (Prn negative), were also observed. We aimed to investigate the microevolution and genomic diversity of epidemic B. pertussis isolates.
Methods
We sequenced 22 B. pertussis isolates collected in 2008–2012 from two states of Australia which are geographically widely separated. Ten of the 22 were Prn negative isolates with three different modes of silencing of prn (prn::IS481F, prn::IS481R and prn::IS1002). Five pre-epidemic isolates were also sequenced for comparison.
Results
Five single nucleotide polymorphisms were common in the epidemic isolates and differentiated them from pre-epidemic isolates. The Australian epidemic isolates can be divided into five lineages (EL1–EL5) with EL1 containing only Prn negative isolates. Comparison with global isolates showed that three lineages remained geographically and temporally distinct whereas two lineages mixed with isolates from 2012 UK outbreak.
Conclusion
Our results suggest significant diversification and the microevolution of B. pertussis within the 2008–2012 Australian epidemic."

During the 2014 human parechovirus type 3 (HPeV3) epidemic in Niigata, Japan, this prospective observational study identified HPeV3 from 43/85 (51%) febrile young infants <4 months using PCR analysis of serum (n = 42) and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n = 32) and genetic sequencing of the VP1 region of HPeV3. HPeV3-infected patients (median age, 32 days; range, 4–113 days) were diagnosed as having sepsis (79%), sepsis-like syndrome (19%), or encephalitis with septic shock (2%). Other than fever, mottled skin (67%) was significantly more frequent in HPeV3-infected patients than other virus-infected patients (P = 0.005). The rate of HPeV3 RNA detection in CSF without pleocytosis was high (88%; 28/32). Among the 32 patients whose serum and CSF samples were available, all patients were positive for serum PCR; however, 4 (12%) patients were negative for CSF PCR. Serum HPeV3 RNA level on admission was associated with younger age (P = 0.002), bad temper (P = 0.041), and grunting (P = 0.008). Among 6 patients with sequential data on serum HPeV3 RNA level, levels decreased rapidly without specific therapy. In conclusion, serum samples at disease onset are the most useful compared to CSF in detection of HPeV RNA and serum HPeV3 RNA level on admission was associated with important clinical manifestations in HPeV3-infected patients."
