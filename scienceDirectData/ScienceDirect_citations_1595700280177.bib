abstract = "Aims
Liver biopsy is currently the gold standard test for NAFLD diagnosis and staging but has many drawbacks. In addition, other tools such as transient elastography are limited to specialized research centers. To assess the usefulness of CK-18 as a non-invasive biomarker for detecting therapeutic responses in patients with liver fibrosis.
Materials and methods
Sixty overweight and obese patients with liver fibrosis were evaluated by a dietitian and given a weight-reducing diet with a calorie deficit of 500–1000 kcal/day over a 6-month period. Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) both were performed at the beginning and at the end of the trial to determine liver steatosis and liver fibrosis, respectively. Serum CK-18 levels were measured by enzyme linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after intervention.
Results
Patients experienced a rapid weight loss of −7.6 kg (8.5%) during the trial. Among all participants, liver steatosis decreased from 76.5 ± 12.2% to 51.8 ± 24.4% (baseline to end-point) (p < 0.001) and fibrosis score decreased from 9.9 ± 3.7 to 7.2 ± 2.4 (p < 0.001) (a 27.2% decrease). Serum CK-18 levels decreased from 290.2 ± 98.1 U/L to 217.6 ± 64.8 U/L (p < 0.001) (a 25.0% decrease). ΔCK-18 was found to be significantly associated with delta fibrosis score (r = 0.25, p = 0.05)
Conclusions
This trial showed a significant positive association between changes in CK-18 levels and changes in liver fibrosis over a 6-month dietary intervention"

In recent times, evidences point to the link between thyroid hormones andT2DM in particular. Several lines of evidences suggest an array of biochemical and molecular events. Gene polymorphism, disturbances in gene expression and regulation, enhanced and bizarre absorption of dietary glucose from intestine, decreased utilization of glucose by tissues and aberrations in hepatic handling of glucose with the onus on Gluconeogenesis are some of the projected mechanisms. Insulin resistance, a progressive condition is the hallmark in T2DM. Hypothyroidism as well as hyperthyroidism have been associated with insulin resistance which are synonymous with impaired glucose metabolism in T2DM. A multitude of basic, clinical and molecular studies provide an insight into thyroid comorbidity in T2DM, though there are a few instances to suggest equivocal link denoting cause-effect relationship. In biochemical pharmacology, as fortified by pharmacogenomics, modalities have now been proposed, through drug trials, to underline the utility of specifically designed thyroid hormone analogues in addressing metabolic syndrome, DM and associated cardiovascular pathology. A thorough understanding of the physiological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms would certainly open newer vistas in the perspectives of T2DM with special reference to alterations in thyroid status."

Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. This study was set to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on peripheral neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
Materials and methods
This study was a quasi-experimental trial in Yazd diabetic research center. Sixty T2DM subjects (30–65 years old) with painful diabetic neuropathy enrolled in this study from March 2017 till April 2018. Patients received weekly 50000 IU of vitamin D3 for 12 weeks orally. Evaluation of diabetic neuropathy was performed by using Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) before and after trial. Also fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, calcium and vitamin D checked before and after the trial. SPSS version 20 software was used for statistical analysis. P ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Among 60 T2DM patients, 58 completed the study. Most of them (53.4%) were male. At the end of study, HbA1c, vitamin D, MNSI (both questionnaire and physical examination) improved that is statistically significant (p-value: <0.001).
Conclusion
Oral supplementation of vitamin D 3 (50,000 IU) once weekly for 12 weeks was associated with improvement in the serum level of vitamin D and significant decrease in the symptoms and sign of diabetic neuropathy. So serum vitamin D level should be checked in persons with diabetic neuropathy and low levels of it should be corrected in order to reducing neuropathy severity."

Essential hypertension is an important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Important candidate genes such as NOS3 gene have been widely studied and reported to be associated with essential hypertension (HTN) in human populations.
Aim
We aim in this study to analyze the relationship between NOS3 -786T/C, a common genetic variant and HTN in a sample of the Algerian population of the Oran city.
Methods
A case-control study has been performed in 154 subjects including 77 hypertensives and 77 normotensives. The recruitment of these subjects was done in local Health Centers of the city of Oran, West Algeria. HTN was defined as elevated systolic blood pressure SBD≥140  mmHg and or sustained diastolic blood pressure DBP≥90  mmHg, measured using an Omron® Automatic BP Monitor - M-3W machine. Consents were obtained from all participants. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with restrictive fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was used to genotype the NOS -786T/C variant.
Results
The distribution of the allelic frequencies did not differ between cases and controls (OR = 1.48; 95%CI [0.94–2.32], P = 0.09). However, after adjustment with the age, sex, and body mass index, we observed significant association between NOS -786C allele and HTN status (OR = 2.08; 95%CI [1.18–3.66], P = 0.01).
Conclusion
Our results indicate that the C allele of the NOS3 gene is associated with increased risk of essential hypertension in this sample of the Algerian population of the Oran city. Further validation in larger samples is needed to confirm this finding."

abstract = "Background
Diabetic nephropathy may be a common complication of diabetes mellitus. Endoglin is glycoprotein located on cell surfaces of endothelial cells and is part of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF- β) receptor. Endoglin expression is enhanced in endothelial cells during injury and inflammation. The aim of this study was to estimate the plasma level of soluble endoglin (sEng) in type 2 diabetic patients (with and without nephropathy). Also to explore its availability as marker for disease progression.
Methods
In this study, sixty eight patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were included; the patients were sub-grouped to normoalbuminuria without nephropathy and moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) with nephropathy groups with 13 individuals as control group. Plasma soluble endoglin level was determined using ELISA technique. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, and creatinine were determined using colorimetric assay, whereas glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated.
Results
The plasma level of sEng of both normoalbuminuria group 1 and microalbuminuria group 2 were significantly higher when compared to control group. While, the plasma level of sEng in microalbuminuria group 2 was nonsignificant lower when compared to normoalbuminuria group 1. Also, there was a significant positive association between plasma level of sEng and HbA1c, HDL-C and urinary albumin concentration in normoalbuminuria group.
Conclusion
Plasma level of soluble Endoglin is markedly increase prior to alteration in endothelial function, and increases to lesser extent with the developing of diabetic nephropathy which indicated disease progression and development of vascular abnormalities."

The role of dietary patterns in metabolic syndrome has not been investigated sufficiently among Iranian population. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of major dietary patterns with the risk of metabolic syndrome and its components among healthy individuals of Iran.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study that was performed on 5895 men and women who participated in MASHAD study project. Factor analysis was employed to determine major dietary patterns with regard to a validated 65-item food frequency questionnaire. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed using international diabetes federation (IDF). Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between dietary patterns and metabolic syndrome risk to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Results
Three major dietary patterns (Balanced, Western and high carbohydrate) were identified. The Western pattern showed a positive association with metabolic syndrome (OR [95%CI] for highest vs. lowest tertile: 1.58 [1.21–2.06]; p value = 0.001). The high carbohydrate dietary pattern was associated with higher metabolic syndrome risk (OR [95%CI] for highest vs. lowest tertile: 1.17 [1.02–1.33]; P value = 0.022). The Balanced dietary pattern was unrelated to metabolic syndrome, but was related to some individual risk factors for metabolic syndrome.

Previous studies have explored the relation of metabolic syndrome (MetS), its components and the risk of albuminuria/proteinuria but their results are inconsistent. Then, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis in order to resolve these controversies.
Method
PubMed and Scopus were systematically searched from their inception to 1 march 2018. Risk estimates and their 95% confidence intervals were extracted and pooled using the random-effects approach.
Result
A total of 57 studies, 44 studies on albuminuria and 13 studies on proteinuria, with a total sample size of 10,603,067 participants, were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, MetS was contributed to higher risks of proteinuria (OR = 2.08, 95%CI = 1.85–2.34) and albuminuria (OR = 1.92, 95%CI = 1.71–2.15), independent of diabetes status; although, this relationship was more noticeable in studies that used the WHO definition of MetS and in non-East Asian populations. Also, the relationship between MetS and proteinuria was sex independent, while, for albuminuria was significant only in men. MetS components such as obesity, impaired fasting glucose, elevated blood pressure and hypertriglyceridemia were associated with significant increases in proteinuria and albuminuria risk, while lower HDL-Cholesterol was only linked to greater risk of proteinuria. Moreover, the total impact of MetS on proteinuria was more remarkable than each component of the syndrome and an escalating dose-response association was found between the number of MetS components and albuminuria risk.
Conclusion
MetS and its components are potential risk factors for albuminuria and proteinuria."

The following associated comorbidities were observed: hypertension (n = 41), dyslipidemia (n = 29), polyneuropathy (n = 30), peripheral arteriopathy (n = 32), retinopathy (n = 21), nephropathy (n = 15), cardiac ischemic disease (n = 14), obesity (n = 9). Thirty-eight patients presented with 3 or more associated comorbidities. The more frequent ulcer locations were sole of the foot (n = 13) and heel (n = 10). The median number of applications was 16, during 8.5 weeks. Nineteen patients (44%) achieved complete healing, 3 patients (7%) had a partial response and 21 (49%) had no progression. We did not observe a statistically significant relationship between patient age and response nor between number of comorbidities and response. We observed a more favorable evolution in patients with good compliance and good glycemic control.
Conclusion
Platelet gel is an effective therapeutic alternative, provided compliance and effective metabolic control are ensured."

Recent studies have implicated possible contribution of adipocytokines in development and progression of microvascular complications in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). The aim of our study was to investigate relationship between adipocytokines, namely leptin, resistin, adiponectin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) activity, with albuminuria in T1DM.
Methods
This study included 202 T1DM without or with incipient microvascular complications. Urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE) was measured from at least two 24-h urine samples. Serum DPP-4 activity was measured by a colorimetric assay, and the level of adiponectin, leptin, and resistin was determined by the ELISA method.
Results
Serum DPP-4 activity and adiponectin were significantly higher in patients with normoalbuminuria compared to patients with microalbuminuria (47 vs 36 U/L, and 10.9 vs 7.3 μg/mL, respectively, p ≤ 0.02). In multivariate logistic regression analysis adiponectin and serum DPP-4 activity were significantly associated with risk of microalbuminuria in our subjects (p ≤ 0.04), with odds ratios of 0.72–0.99. However, after adjustment for age, sex, HbA1c, duration of diabetes and BMI, only serum DPP-4 activity was significantly associated with risk of microalbuminuria (p = 0.008).
Conclusion
The results of our study suggest that serum DPP-4 activity is lower in T1DM with microalbuminuria. Prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the relationship between serum DPP-4 activity and progression and development of albuminuria and nephropathy in T1DM."

Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) is a formula to estimate visceral fat accumulation which has been reported to have a better prediction for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Caucasian population. This systematic review is proposed to inquire whether VAI can be used as a predictor of T2DM in Asian population with different body composition compared to the Caucasian.
Methods
All studies performed in Asia and published in English on VAI prediction on the incidence of T2DM were included. The search keywords used in Pubmed and Cochrane database were visceral adiposity index, VAI and T2DM.
Results
Seven included studies, of which six studies were conducted in China and one in Iran. Four studies were prospective cohorts and the other three were cross-sectional. The largest study population were 7639 subjects, while the longest observation period was 15 years. This study found that VAI can be used as a predictor of T2DM in Asian population with better prediction values compared to Caucasian population. The reported odds ratio or hazard ratio ranged from 1.2 to 3.6.
Conclusions
VAI is a practical formula used to estimate the accumulation of visceral fat which can be used as a predictor for T2DM in Asian population."

abstract = "Diabetes is a common metabolic disorder associated to elevated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that is not explained by hyperglycemia or traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking or hypercholesterolemia. Intensive glycemic control with insulin that achieves near-normal glycemia does not reduce significantly macrovascular complications compared with conventional glycemic control. Cardiovascular disease continues to develop in patients with diabetes despite adequate glycemic control. In contrast, intensive control with metformin (leading to insulin resistance improvement) reduces diabetes complications, including cardiovascular events, suggesting that enhancement of insulin sensitivity rather than plasma glucose level has a major role improving diabetes outcomes. Accordingly, insulin resistance estimated by glucose tolerance tests is better predictor of future cardiovascular events than fasting glucose level in nondiabetic individuals. Insulin resistance precedes for decades the clinical onset of type 2 diabetes and deteriorates metabolic control of type 1 diabetes. Numerous investigations including cross-sectional and prospective studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews provide compelling evidence that insulin resistance by itself is a cardiovascular risk factor in a variety of population groups, including the general population and patients with diabetes. Several estimations of insulin resistance have been consistently associated with elevated rate of cardiovascular events independently of other cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes status. The clinical expression of insulin resistance (the metabolic syndrome or any of its components including obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, and dyslipemia) has been related to cardiovascular disease as well. An estimation conducted by the Archimedes model confirms that insulin resistance is the most important single cause of coronary artery disease."

Obesity is an emerging public health concern in Bangladesh. This study aimed to find the levels of the serum malondialdehyde (MDA), non-enzymatic antioxidants (vitamin A, C and E), trace elements (zinc and iron) and macro-minerals (calcium, potassium and sodium) in obesity and its action in disease advancement.
Methods
Level of lipid peroxidation was estimated by measurement of the serum concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA). Vitamin A and E concentration was found by RP-HPLC method and vitamin C was assessed for serum ascorbic acid by UV spectrophotometric method. Serum trace elements (Zn and Fe) and macro-minerals (Na, K and Ca) were estimated by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS).
Results
Our study observed significantly elevated concentrations of MDA (p < 0.001) and depleted concentrations of antioxidants (vitamin A, E and C) (p < 0.05) in the patient than control group. Analysis of serum trace elements (Zn and Fe) and macro-minerals (Na, K and Ca) and found that the mean values of Zn, Fe, Na, K and Ca were 0.39 ± 0.02 and 0.43 ± 0.03, 3284.81 ± 34.51, 162.18 ± 3.72, 44.62 ± 2.13 mg/L for the patient and 0.91 ± 0.13, 0.88 ± 0.06, 2562.74 ± 95.92, 243.58 ± 8.97, 87.66 ± 2.10 mg/L for the controls, consequently.

To determine optimal waist circumference cutoff values for predicting metabolic syndrome (MetS) among adults aged 60 years and older in Ecuador.
Material and methods
The National Survey of Health, Wellbeing, and Aging survey was used to describe the prevalence of MetS according to standard definitions. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses and the Younden index J (YI) were performed to examine optimal waist circumference cutoff values for predicting MetS. Moreover, the prevalence of MetS according to country-specific waist circumference cutoff values was compared with those using standard definitions.
Results
Among 2306 participants with a mean age of 70.6 years, the optimal waist circumference cutoff value for predicting MetS was 90.7 cm in women with a sensitivity of 66.1%, specificity of 65.6% and YI of 0.31. In men, a waist circumference of 91.2 cm with a sensitivity of 73.2%, specificity of 62.8%, and YI of 0.36 was the optimal cutoff point for predicting MetS. In general, applying country-specific cutoff values decreased the prevalence of MetS among older Ecuadorian women. In men, except with the ATP III definition, similar MetS prevalence rates were seen whether the country-specific or standard waist circumference cutoff values were applied.
Conclusions
The optimal waist circumference cutoff values for predicting metabolic syndrome among older Ecuadorians adults were 90.7 cm for women and 91.2 cm for men. Moreover, current standard definitions of abdominal obesity may overestimate the prevalence of MetS, particularly in Latin American women."

To assess the association between high waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) levels and insulin resistance (IR) or hyperinsulinemia after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in a sample of normal-weight women.
Methods
We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study in euthyroid non-diabetic women, who attended the outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru from 2012 to 2016. Participants were divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of high WHR levels, IR or hyperinsulinemia after OGTT. We considered WHR values > 0.85 as high levels. IR was defined as a Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) value > 2.39 and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT as a serum insulin value ≥ 80μU/mL after 120 min of 75-g glucose intake. We elaborated crude and adjusted Poisson generalized linear models to evaluate the association between high WHR levels and IR or hyperinsulinemia after OGTT and reported the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
We analyzed the data of 248 euthyroid, non-diabetic and normal-weight women. The prevalence of high WHR levels was 68.9% (n = 171) while the prevalence of IR and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT was 25% (n = 62) and 15.3% (n = 38), respectively. WHR values were positively correlated with HOMA-IR (r = 0.307; p < 0.001) and serum insulin after OGTT (r = 0.260; p < 0.001). In the adjusted model, high WHR levels were associated with both IR (aPR = 2.63; 95%CI: 1.39–5.01) and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT (aPR = 2.35; 95%CI: 1.03–5.38).
Conclusion
High WHR levels were associated with both IR markers used in our study, appearing to be a useful anthropometric indicator to assess IR in euthyroid normal-weight women without type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Materials and methods
A total of 300 T2DM female aged (25–60 years) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Subjects were recruited from Baghdad medical city during the period from January 2017 to July 2018. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), blood pressure was measured and fasting blood sample was analyzed for blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin(HbA1c), and lipid profile. VAI was calculated in addition to triglyceride-glucose (TyG) derived indices. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS version 23. The study was ethically approved.
Results
Patients with high VAI showed poor glycemic control, dyslipidemia, elevated TYG index, TYGWC and TYGBMI. The number of diabetics with poor glycemic control increased across the VAI quartiles. The area under the curve in ROC analysis demonstrated that VAI had a good predictive ability to identify the state of glycemic control as compared to other anthropometric measures (WC, BMI) or combined metabolic and anthropometric measures (TyGWC, TyGBMI).

Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) has been shown to protect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) against oxidative-modification and thereby might protect against coronary-artery-disease (CAD). Here we explored the relationship of a genetic variant (a substitution (R) Arg with (Q) Gln at position 192) of PON1 in 250 patients with/without CAD.
Materials and methods
Genotyping of PON1 Q192R was carried out using Real-Time-PCR TaqMan-based-probe. Demographic-characteristics and biochemical-analyses, including fasting blood sugar (FBS), HDL, LDL, triglycerides (TG) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated. Univariate/multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association of the genetic polymorphism and CAD as well as with clinical-characteristics of population.
Results
Our findings showed that RR-genotype was more frequent in CAD-patients, compared to the wild-type genotype. Moreover, CAD patients with RR-genotype had an odd ratio of 5.0 (95% CI: 1.3–18.6; p = 0.017), versus wild-type genotype, in multivariate-analysis. Of note we also observed that CAD-patients with QQ-genotype had a significantly lower Hs-CRP level, compared to the RR-genotype.
Conclusion
we demonstrate that PON1-Q192R-polymorphism was associated with CRP and FBS levels; R-allele of PON1-Q192R may be an independent risk factor for CAD. Further studies are warranted to determine the value of this marker as a surrogate marker in CAD patients."

Diabetic foot is a major comorbidity of diabetes, with 15–25% of diabetic patients developing diabetic foot ulcer during their lifetime. Other major diabetic foot complications include cellulitis, abscess, wet gangrene, dry gangrene, and necrotizing fasciitis. Dry gangrene involves tissue necrosis due to chronic ischemia whereby the tissue becomes numb, dry, wrinkled, and dead. Although diabetic foot complications have been extensively studied in literature, there is limited data on the management of dry gangrene.
Methods
We report a case series of 12 patients with diabetes-related dry gangrene in the toes, initially planned to be managed conservatively with autoamputation.
Results
One patient had an autoamputation, while eight patients underwent surgical amputations (six major amputations, two minor amputations) for better clinical outcomes. Two patients died, while no change was observed in one patient even after 12 months of follow-up.
Conclusion
Managing diabetic dry toe gangrene by waiting for autoamputation may lead to worse clinical outcomes and should be practiced cautiously on a case-by-case basis. Early surgical intervention should be opted to improve patients’ quality of life."

abstract = "Aims
Metabolic syndrome increases the risk of chronic diseases including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The present study investigated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in Iran.
Materials and methods
Published articles in English and Persian during 2000–2016 identified using keywords of prevalence, metabolic syndrome, and Iran in the following databases: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar, SID and Magiran. Random effect model used to calculate the pooled estimates. Heterogeneity of studies assessed using Q statistic, and geographical distribution of metabolic syndrome demonstrated via GIS map. Data were analyzed by STATA-11.
Results
The overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 30.4% (95%CI: 28.3–32.6) with no significant heterogeneity by diagnostic criteria. The lowest frequency was reported in Sistan and Baluchestan Province [18.3% (95% CI: 12.9–25.8)] compared to the highest in Bushehr [57.8% (95% CI: 41.8–80.0)]. It was significantly more prevalent in women [(34.8% (95%CI: 31.2–38.8)] compared to men [25.7% (95%CI: 23.4–28.3)] (P = 0.001)]. A significant increasing trend (P = 0.001) was observed in different age groups, as metabolic syndrome increased from 12.1% (95% CI: 9.37–15.6) in 20–29 years-old age group to 51.7% (95%CI: 47.4–56.4) in the over 60 years-old age group.
Conclusions
Approximately one-third of Iranian adults have metabolic syndrome which varied by regions, age and gender. Then, appropriate intervention based on behavioral patterns of inhabitants and local conditions may help to reduce the burden of disease."

abstract = "Aim
We aimed to screen for prediabetes, diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors among family members of people with diabetes registered for care in a primary health centre in South India.
Methods
During 2017–2018, we screened eligible family members of individuals with diabetes at their homes. We measured fasting capillary blood glucose (FCBG); for those with FCBG≥126 mg/dl, we confirmed the diagnosis of diabetes with fasting plasma glucose (FPG). We defined prediabetes as FCBG between 100 and 125 mg/dl; diabetes as both FCBG and FPG ≥126 mg/dl. We assessed non-communicable disease risk factors using WHO STEPS questionnaire.
Results
Of total 884 participants, 873 (99%) underwent screening; 280 (32%) had prediabetes, and 19 (2.2%) were confirmed with diabetes. Of newly diagnosed, 17 (90%) were initiated on treatment. Of 873 participants, 180 (20.6%) were newly diagnosed with hypertension. Of the total, 7.3%, 5.2% and 16% reported tobacco use, alcohol use and high salt intake respectively. Nearly half (48%) had overweight.
Conclusion
Though the yield for diabetes is modest (3%), the house to house approach was able to screen 99% of eligible population. High prevalence of prediabetes and undiagnosed hypertension emphasize the need for screening and life style modifications."

Methods
Fifty overweight-females were enrolled in current randomized-clinical-trial and randomly divided into two groups. The case group received RF/US twice a week for 5 weeks with a low calorie diet whilst the control-group received just a low calorie diet. Demographic, biochemical markers as well as serum-leptin were determined.
Results
The level of leptin was reduced from 1.29 ± 0.32 ng/ml to 1.14 ± 0.34 ng/ml in case group, before and after therapy, respectively, whilst no significant differences were observed in the serum leptin levels of subjects in the control group. The combination of RF and US decreased the leptin-level. In particular, the mean reduction of abdominal-circumference and waist-circumference was significant (P < 0.05) after therapy. This reduction was inversely correlated with LDL levels. Weight was reduced in case and control groups and in both was significant, but no statistically significant differences were detected for weight between the groups(P < 0.93).

Obesity and overweight are among the main causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Dyslipidemia, fatty liver index, is strongly related to CVD. Vitamin E as an antioxidant protects the hepatic cells against oxidative stress and prevents fatty liver disease. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the relationship between anthropometric parameters and fasted lipid profile with serum vitamin E levels.
Study design
A randomized trial was designed based on data from the Mashhad stroke and heart atherosclerotic disorders (MASHAD: 2010–2020).
Methods
363 CVD subjects (173 males and 190 females) was selected at random, among 9704 subjects in three regions of Mashhad, northeast of Iran to investigate the specific correlations among their serum vitamin E, lipid profile (TG, HDL-C, LDL-C and TC), and anthropometric features (height, weight, BMI, hip and waist circumferences.
Result
The results indicated the significant relationships between vitamin E, and fasting serum lipid profile in subjects. Serum vitamin E was negatively correlated to TC, TG, and LDL-C and positively related to HDL-C. Also, statistically negative correlations were found between vitamin E and anthropometric parameters (weight, waist and hip circumference, middle Arm, and Systolic Blood Pressure). Moreover, vitamin E ratios such as vitamin E/(TC + TG) and vitamin E/TC values as standardized vitamin E, had significant negative correlation with BMI, the whole of anthropometric parameters, and dyslipidemia risk factors including TC, TG and LDL-C.
Conclusion
We found that vitamin E profile was significantly lower in the dyslipidemia subjects. It is generally suggested that vitamin E monitoring might be used as a useful prognostic and therapeutic agent in dyslipidemia disorder."

abstract = "Background
Diabetes is rising at an alarming rate in India and the national capital forms a significant part of the nation's diabetic population. The metabolic disorder is no more a disease specific to the rich countries but has also markedly spread its roots in middle-income countries.
Objective
To ascertain the prevalence of associated co-morbidities in the diabetic population of Delhi, a metropolitan city in India. Moreover, this study was conducted to help with adding information to the limited shreds of evidence of diabetes prevalence in Delhi along with the usually preferred therapies.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional, observational, survey-based study was conducted on people (n = 798) of different age groups (18 years and above) belonging to different regions of Delhi. All subjects were enrolled after obtaining oral consent. Detailed information about clinical, demographic and metabolic profiles was obtained with the help of a pre-structured, open-ended questionnaire. The data were analyzed, and the correlation between diabetes and several other fields was drawn.
Results
Out of the 798 diabetic patients 458 (57.39%) were males and 340 (42.60%) were females. The presence of diabetes was higher in the age group of 50–60 years irrespective of the gender.
Co-morbidities
54.13% of patients suffered with additional co-morbidities which is significantly high. The associated co-morbidities found in the survey included Hypertension, Hypothyroidism, Dyslipidemia, Obesity, Coronary Artery Diseases etc. About 30.57% of patients suffered from hypertension making it the most commonly associated co-morbidity. The other diseases included hypothyroidism (11.52%), Dyslipidemia (10.27%), Obesity (9.27%) etc.
Medication
Majority of patients i.e about 60.65% received oral hypoglycemic agents (including patients receiving both insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents). About 19.92% of patients were prescribed with insulin. 14.16% of patients were found to be following diet control and yoga with about 3.13% more females the males. A small percentage of patients (5.25%) were also following alternative systems (Ayurvedic/Unani/Homeopathic) of treatment. Overall, amongst oral hypoglycemic agents, the combination of metformin and DPP4 inhibitors (Vildagliptin, Sitagliptin) was being prescribed majorly i.e 16.41%.
Conclusion
The number of diabetic population is high in Delhi. It was evident that a significant percentage of diabetic patients suffered from additional diseases that may lead to worsening of the health conditions. Thus, there is an urgent need to educate and spread awareness amongst the masses about the potential benefits of lifestyle modifications like the incorporation of a healthy diet and physical activities. Additionally, continuous and regular tests should be taken to avoid further complications."

Assessing of QoL in patients with DR is a prerequisite for the evaluation of their needs and for understanding the perception of the patients themselves about their health status and how the disease affects their lives. Additionally, QoL indicators detect individual psychosocial problems that may impact therapeutic response.
Materials and methods
A total of 70 subjects with T2DM and DR as well as 70 T2DM individuals without DR were included. For the evaluation of QoL we used (a) WHO QoL – BREF for the estimation of QoL, (b) Life Satisfaction Scale for the estimation of satisfaction from life, and (c) the special recording document for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical data. At the same time, blood was collected for the measurement of glucose control and renal function. DR was diagnosed by dilated fundoscopy.
Results
Patients with DR had significantly worse scores in all scales of QoL and Life Satisfaction in comparison with those without DR. We found significant impact of the severity of DR in many domains of the QoL and Life Satisfaction. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that DR was associated with worse QoL and Life Satisfaction scores as well as lower income, while no significant associations were found with education level, family, insurance and employment status as well as type of residence.
Conclusion
DR affects QoL and Life Satisfaction and is associated with lower income."

Non-Caucasian migrants require dedicated approaches in diabetes management due to specific genetic; socio-cultural; demographic and anthropological determinants. Documenting such phenotypes allows for better understanding unmet needs and management priorities.
Methods
This age- and sex-adjusted case-control (1:6 ratio) study compared 56 T2DM Turkish migrants (70% males) resident in Belgium [Tu] with 336 T2DM Caucasians [Ca], all benefiting from state-funded healthcare.
Results
The 2 groups did not differ regarding BMI; waist circumference; fat mass; visceral fat; muscle mass; insulin sensitivity; insulinemia; metabolic syndrome; hypertension; lipid-modifying drugs; and macroangiopathy. They also had similar renal function and (micro)albuminuria. Education (low/high) and ethanol consumption were lower among [Tu]: 83/17% and 2.0 U/wk vs 43/57% and 13.6 U/wk in [Ca] (p < 0.0001). β-cell function loss (BCF) was higher in [Tu]: 1.58(0.45) vs 1.35(0.54)%/yr (p 0.0027), as was HbA1c: 8.39(1.91) vs 7.48(1.35)% in [Ca] (p < 0.0001). Diabetes duration and insulin use were increased in [Tu]: 19(9)yr and 70% vs 16(8)yr and 48% in [Ca] (p 0.0111 and 0.0024). Atherogenic dyslipidemia (AD) was more prevalent in [Tu]: 64% vs 49% (p 0.0309), who had higher non-HDL-C; apolipoprotein B100; LDL-C; and triglycerides; and lower HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I levels (all p < 0.05). Overall microangiopathy; retinopathy; and neuropathy were more prevalent in [Tu]: 55-35-37% vs 40-18-20% in [Ca] (all p < 0.05).
Conclusions
These results should raise concerns about poor glycaemic control; rapid BCF loss; severe AD; and microangiopathy among Turkish migrants with T2DM. Targeting AD could improve the cardiometabolic profile of this minority given the relationship between AD and residual vascular risk."

Compared to control group, being a patient with type 1 or type 2 Diabetes found as a risk factor for somatization, depression, anger-hostility and additional scales. Moreover being a patient with type 1 DM was found as a risk factor for having OBS symptoms (p = 0.039) and type 1 DM was protective against having interpersonal sensitivity symptoms (p = 0.006).
Conclusion
In diabetic patient groups, an increase in the rate of psychiatric symptoms was observed. Therefore a careful psychiatric examination is required in DM."

abstract = "Aims
The study intended to investigate the impact of controlled glycemia on morbidity and estimated 10-year survival (ES-10Y).
Methods
A cross-sectional investigation was conducted at General Penang Hospital, Malaysia. Demographic criteria and laboratory tests of patients were investigated. Controlled glycemia (CG) was recognized as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤7% depending on American Diabetes Association guidelines 2018. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to estimate the confounding influence of co-morbidities and predict ES-10Y. Data was managed by IBM-SPSS 23.0.
Results
A total of 400 cases categorized to (44.25%) patients with CG, and (55.75%) cases had uncontrolled glycemia (UCG). HbA1c mean in CG and UCG group was (6.8 ± 0.9 vs 9.5 ± 1.6, P-value: 0.001). Fasting blood glucose was (7 ± 2.3 vs. 9.9 ± 4.3, P-value: 0.001) in CG and UCG group. CCI was (3.38 ± 2.38 vs. 4.42 ± 2.70, P-value: 0.001) and, ES-10Y was (62% vs 46.2%, p-value: 0.001) in CG vs. UCG respectively. Spearman test indicates a negative correlation between CG and CCI (r: 0.19, p-value: 0.001). Logistic regression confirmed HbA1c as a significant predictor of CCI (r2: 0.036, P-value: 0.001). CG has a positive correlation with survival (r: 0.16, P-value: 0.001) and logistic regression of survival (r2: 0.26, P-value: 0.001).
Conclusions
More than one-half of the investigated persons had UCG. Controlled HbA1c was associated with lower co-morbidities and higher ES-10Y."

Prediabetes associate with known micro and macrovascular complications of diabetes. Also gastrointestinal symptoms are present in diabetics higher than general population. The aim of this study was evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects with prediabetes.
Methods
This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 130 persons 30–65 years old, 65 pre-diabetic patients and 65 persons without glucose disorders from 2014 to 2015 in YAZD province. FBS and HbA1c used for diagnosis prediabetes. Demographic and medical history were collected. A questionnaire according to Rome III Criteria was used to collect digestive information (diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, abdominal bloating, heartburn, increased gas passing, nausea, intermittent diarrhea and constipation in the last 6 months ago). Frequency of GI symptoms in subjects with and without glucose disorders were compared. Data were analyzed by SPSS software Version 20. Data were reported as mean ± standard deviation or frequency and T-test, Chi Square and Spearman correlation coefficient tests were used. P-value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Higher frequency of bloating, early satiety, nausea, heartburn, gas passing and constipation are seen in the pre-diabetes group than in the control group; (p-value 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.001 and 0.0001 respectively). 96.9% in prediabetics had at least one gastrointestinal symptom, while in the normal groups 50% had at least one GI symptom (p-value: 0.0001).
Conclusions
Gastrointestinal symptoms were seen in prediabetics higher than healthy persons. So, prediabetes can not be considered an entirely benign and asymptomatic condition. Lifestyle interventions maybe necessary at this state."

abstract = "Background
Diabetes mellitus, a lifelong disease is achieving pandemic proportions. The prevalence of diabetes is on the rise and is expected to be worlds 7th leading cause of death by 2030. Studies have associated a number of risk factors like obesity, lack of physical activity, sedentarism, diet, and stress to diabetes mellitus. The job of bank employees is both sedentary in nature and involves high levels of stress. These people spend almost all their working hours seated as they carry out their work. With this background, the primary objective study of this project is to identify risk factors of diabetes mellitus among bank employees of selected banks in Ndola town. This study also aims to find the prevalence of diabetes among bank employees in the selected nine banks.
Methods
A cross-section study was conducted on 121 bank employees from nine (9) selected banks of Ndola town center. Information about their biosocial characteristics, their weight, height, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose was measured and recorded and a questionnaire on physical activity of participants was administered. Data was analyzed by SPSS 20.0 for Windows. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to ascertain any correlation between the dependent variables and independent variables.
Results
Prevalence of diabetes mellitus was found to be 15%. The risk of developing Diabetes mellitus was high in obese participants (OR 5.1 [cl95%] p = 0.000). And in physical inactive participants it was also high (OR 7.6 [cl95%] p = 0.046).
Conclusion
and recommendations: Diabetes mellitus shows significant correlation with physical inactivity, body mass index, blood pressure, age and sex. Findings in this study support the need for programs to promote employee health, to help prevent and monitor the enormity and temporal trends of these factor as well as asses the actions that are directed toward this population group."

We aimed at assessing cardiovascular risk of first degree relatives of diabetes (FDRD).
Methods
A cross sectional study involving 90 apparently healthy normoglycemic volunteers aged between 15 and 50 years (45 FDRD and 45 FDRs of non-diabetics). We measured anthropometric parameters, baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability, cardiac autonomic function tests, and aerobic capacity, fasting blood glucose and insulin, lipid profile, inflammatory markers, nitric oxide and oxidative stress markers.
Results
FDRD had significantly higher hip circumference and BF%. Blood pressure, total peripheral resistance and cardiac output were comparable. FDRD had higher HR and rate pressure product. There were no significant differences in cardio-respiratory fitness (VO2max) and physical activity level. Time and Frequency domain parameters were comparable except for reduced NN50 and total power. Baroreflex sensitivity, 30:15 ratio and E: I ratio were significantly less in FDRD. Fasting glucose was comparable. Fasting Insulin, HOMA IR, HOMA %B and HOMA AD were higher while HOMA %S and QUICKI index were lower in FDRD. Lipid profile or lipid derived parameters were comparable except for higher non-HDLc in FDRD. Adiponectin was lower while Leptin and Leptin/apidonectin ratio was higher in FDRD. IL-6, hsCRP, TNF- alpha and MDA were significantly higher in FDRD, while TAS and nitric oxide were significantly lower in FDRD.
Conclusion
Higher body fat percentage, with insulin resistance, deranged cardiac autonomic function, higher oxidative stress and inflammation, lower adiponectin and nitric oxide levels places FDRD at higher cardiovascular risk and necessitates early lifestyle modification/intervention."

With numerous controlled experimental studies of dapagliflozin, evaluation of real-life data after entry into clinical practice is an important condition. In our study, the effects of dapagliflozin (10 mg) on lipid profile were investigated retrospectively.
Methods
A total of thirty-one type 2 diabetic patients with HbA1c level between 6,5% and 13%, aged 45–80 years and whose body mass index higher than 20 kg/m2 were enrolled to the study. Data before dapagliflozin treatment and three and six months results were recorded.
Results
Dapagliflozin reduced HbA1c levels by 0,9% at 3 months and 0,79% at 6 months. Total cholesterol level decreased 17,6 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol level decreased 13,4 mg/dl and triglyceride level by 25.9 mg/dl at the 6th months and it is observed that there is no serious side effect on the usage for 6 months.
Conclusion
There are conflicting results about the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the lipid profile in the literature. According to our data, dapagliflozin has positive effects on lipid profile as weight and glycemic control and it is well tolerated. Therefore, dapagliflozin therapy is beneficial because of the positive change in lipid profile and weight loss in diabetic patients with overweight and hyperlipidemia."

Background
Non high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in people with type 2 diabetes. The aim of our study is to estimate the relative multivariate risk of non-HDL-C in the occurrence of CVD in a population in the extreme western Algeria with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods
Our study was carried out in western Algeria on a population of 1111 subjects, 371 cardiopaths with T2DM and 740 controls. The biochemical balance was established using standard enzymatic procedures (SFBC or IFCC recommendations) on the Beckman CX7® PLC (Beckman-Coulter®, NY, USA). Information on the pathologies was collected by means of a questionnaire.
Results
The logistic model retained the two levels of non-HDL-C: 130 mg/dl < non-HDL-C≤160 mg/dl (OR = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.03–0,47, P = 0.003) and 160 mg/dl < non-HDL-C≤190 mg/dl (OR = 5.02; 95% CI = 1.1–22.87, P = 0.037) and smoking (OR = 19.27; 95% CI = 3.39–109.63, P = 0.001), inbreeding (OR = 3.65; 95% CI = 1.12–11,85, P = 0.031) and the two age groups 60–70 years (OR = 2.36; 95% CI = 1.32–4.2, P<<0.01) and 70 years and over (OR = 2.26; 95% CI = 1.19–4.29, P<<0.05).

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is undertreated in Japan. We sought to understand the potential factors associated with reluctance to initiate/continue oral antihyperglycemic agents (OAHA) treatment in Japan.
Methods
A two-phase study was conducted which included cognitive interviews in the first phase (N = 12) to ensure retrieval from memory of relevant information to respond to questions. The second phase included recruitment of respondents from an internet re-contact survey (N = 560) using NHWS or other Lightspeed panels. Patients’ self-reported measures were collected to identify the potential barriers to T2DM treatment initiation or continuation. All measured variables were summarized descriptively using means and standard deviations for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.
Results
A total of 560 respondents were assessed. Of those who were drug-naïve and ever been recommended prescription medication, only 17.3% were satisfied with how physicians presented the treatment options compared to current users or those who discontinued treatment (47.2% and 47.6% respectively). More than 50% of respondents did not realize neuropathic pain and end organ damage as potential consequences of untreated T2DM. 34.8% and 47.6% of drug-naïve and T2DM respondents who discontinued treatment were likely to start/restart treatment after realizing potential complications. Among those who discontinued treatment, 23.1% were extremely dissatisfied with their dosing frequency and less than 15% reported that their physicians discussed the importance of staying on medication long-term.
Conclusion
The potential barriers addressed in this study should be considered when planning intervention strategies targeted at T2DM patients to promote their treatment in Japan."

abstract = "Background
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important cause of global mortality and morbidity. Body mass index (BMI) is the measure of adiposity that is used most frequently in CVD risk algorithms.
Aims
We aimed to assess the relationship between several CVD risk factors (RFs) and percent body fat (PBF), and to compare the predictive values obtained using PBF for these cardiovascular RFs with the values obtained using BMI. The CVD RFs included, hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM) and the presence of dyslipidemia (DLP).
Methods and materials
The data were derived from the MASHAD study, a cohort study of 9704 volunteers, aged 35–65 years and living in the city of Mashhad. Based on BMI and PBF values, subjects were classified into 4 groups; group 1 (low or normal BMI and PBF, N = 1670), group 2 (low or normal BMI but high PBF, N = 992), group 3 (high BMI and low or normal PBF, N = 837), and group 4 (high BMI and PBF, N = 6245). Chi-square, covariance and logistic regression were used to analyze the data at a significance level of 0.05.
Results
There was an increasing trend from group 1 to group 4 for the mean values of all CVD RFs and their prevalence. There were significant differences in the frequency of a low HDL-C, this was substantially higher in Group 3 (38.6% in Group 3 versus 12.2% in Group 2); the frequency of a high serum TG (24% in Group 3 versus 9.9% in Group 2) and the frequency of dyslipidemia overall (56.2% in Group 3 and 28.8% in Group 2) (P-value<0.001 for all comparisons). The frequency of hypertension (22.9% in Group 3 versus 16.2% in Group 2) and IFG (8.5% in Group 3 versus 5.0% in Group 2) were also substantially higher in Group 3 compared to Group 2 (P-value<0.001 for both comparisons). All the mean values for the RFs were higher in group 3 from group 2 except HDL-C. When Group 1 was used as a reference and calculated OR of any RF for any group 2–4 rather than group 1, OR for all RF in group 3 was higher from group 2.
Conclusion
The differences in frequency, means and OR of RFs between Groups 2 and 3 showed a differential impact of a high BMI or high PBF. Compared to PBF, BMI may be a better predictor for several RFs for CVD."

abstract = "Endothelial progenitor cells are recognized as the potential targets for the revascularization and angiogenesis because of their ability to get themselves transformed into mature endothelial cells. Underlying pathophysiology in diabetes mellitus leads to decrease in circulatory endothelial progenitor cells, resulting in diabetic macro-vascular and micro-vascular complications. Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) gamma analogues serves as an effective therapy for controlling blood sugar levels and preventing its complications. Reports of clinical trials and meta-analysis of clinical trial suggests the beneficial aspects of PPAR gamma therapy in increasing the number and function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells. This review highlights the pleotropic effect of PPAR gamma analogs, apart from their antidiabetic action via reduction of oxidative stress, increasing expression of eNOS, reducing level of miR 22, miR 222 levels and positive modulation of rapamycin/Protein kinase B/phosphoinoside3-kinase pathways, preventing the early apoptosis, enhanced mobility proliferation and transformation into mature endothelial cells. PPAR gamma therapy in diabetes regulates endothelial progenitor cells, reduces complications of diabetes like retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, deep vein thrombosis, and maintains the healthy vasculature."

Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 (IL-6) and acute phase protein like C-reactive protein (CRP) are supposed to contribute to development of GDM, however clinical data supporting this hypothesis is limited. This study was designed to analyze the association of IL-6 and CRP with development of GDM in Indian females.
Methods
This case control study included pregnant women diagnosed as GDM (n = 53) and those having normal glucose tolerance (n = 50). Serum levels of IL-6 and CRP were analysed and correlated with various clinical parameters.
Results
Serum IL-6 levels were significantly high (p < 0.05) in GDM females as compared to control females. IL-6 levels correlated with pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), fasting blood sugar (FBS) and postprandial sugar (PPBS). Unlike IL-6, CRP levels did not show significant differences between GDM and control females. However, positive correlation of CRP levels with BMI, FBS and PPBS was observed.
Conclusion
High IL-6 levels in gestational diabetes may indicate a possible role for inflammation in pathophysiology of GDM."

To evaluate the predictive accuracy of surrogate measures of fasting insulin resistance/sensitivity like the Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA –IR), Fasting glucose/insulin ratio (FG-IR), Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), and the 20/fasting C peptide x fasting plasma glucose [20/(FCP × FPG)] index in comparison to M value derived from hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (HEC) studies in two birth weight based cohorts of Asian Indian males.
Methods
HEC studies were performed in non-diabetic Asian Indian males (n = 117), born of normal birth weight (n = 59, birth weight > 2.5 kgs) and low birth weight (n = 58, birth weight < 2.5 kgs). Anthropometry and biochemical analysis were done. Surrogate indices of fasting insulin resistance were calculated and data were analysed by Pearson's correlation and Random calibration model analysis.
Results
Amongst surrogate indices of fasting insulin resistance/sensitivity, the mean values for HOMA-IR, QUICKI, FG-IR, 20/(FCP × FPG) index and M value were similar between the two groups. Significant positive correlation was observed for FG-IR and QUICKI with M value (the gold standard measure of insulin sensitivity derived from HEC procedure) in the low birth weight cohort in contrast to the normal birth weight cohort, wherein no significant correlation was observed for any of the indices. Random calibration model analysis showed highest predictive accuracy for QUICKI in both the study groups.

Extensive literature search have been carried in regard with the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of DN, drug targets and updates on clinical trials, the consequences associated with DN and the potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of DN are discussed in this review. DN is characterised by microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, and morphological changes such as glomerular thickening, interstitial fibrosis, formation of nodular glomerulosclerosis and decreased endothelial cell fenestration. Besides, the involvement of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, inflammation and genetic factors are the key pathways in the progression of DN. In regard with drug development drugs targeted to epidermal growth factor, inflammatory cytokines, ACTH receptor and TGFβ1 receptors are in pipeline for clinical trials whereas, several drugs have also failed in phase III and phase IV of clinical trials due to lack of efficacy and severe adverse effect. The research on DN is limited with respect to its pathogenesis and drug development. Thus, a more detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of DN is very essential to progress in the drug development process."

Phenols affect diabetes in different ways. CGA suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis through the inhibition of G6Pase and is also an insulin sensitizer that potentiates insulin action. Curcumin reduce insulin resistance so decrease AGE's products in diabetes mellitus. Hydroxytyrosol regulates the calcium channels which plays key role in insulin secretion. Resveratrol increase the stimulation of glucose uptake and insulin secretion. CGA has similar antioxidant activity as vitamin E and ellagic acid maybe is even more potent than vitamin E. curcumin inhibits lipid peroxidation and scavenge superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals. The antioxidant activity of hydroxytyrosol protects pancreatic cells from damage and death. Treatment with resveratrol significantly decreases the level of glucosylated hemoglobin.
Conclusion
All these phytochemicals have potent antidiabetic and antioxidant effects in different ways beside their other effects like anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties in ellagic acid, or like anti-angiogenic and apoptogenic activities in curcumin. So we suggest further studies in the field of diabetes and antioxidation."

The aim of this study was to determine the association between the intake of omega-3 PUFAs and the serum level of resolvin D1 and insulin resistance in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) compared to healthy women.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015–2016 in Tehran, Iran, among females referred to the infertility clinic at Valie-Asr Reproductive Health Research Centre. Thirty-one patients with PCOS (according to the criteria of the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM)) and 29 healthy, normal cycling (NC) women of similar age, weight and height were enrolled. Anthropometric measurements, levels of resolvin D1, fasting insulin, glucose levels and insulin resistance index (HOMA) for each of the patients were determined.
Results
Intakes of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and total fat) and omega-3 PUFAs were higher in the PCOS group compared to the control group; also, the PCOS group had significantly higher resolvin D1, fasting insulin, glucose levels and HOMA when compared with the control group. Moreover, resolvin D1 correlated negatively with HOMA and fasting insulin levels among both the PCOS and control women.
Conclusion
PCOS is associated with insulin resistance. We showed that omega-3 PUFAs can increase the synthesis of resolvin D1. Resolvin D1 is involved in insulin sensitivity by affecting insulin signaling and inflammatory pathways. Therefore, it can be a contributing factor in reducing insulin resistance in PCOS patients."

Obesity-related to metabolic syndrome was associated with a greater risk for development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We aimed to assess the association between obesity and micro/macroalbuminuria in hypertensive patients with a poor estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Methods
One hundred old patients (median age 79 years ± inter-quartile range 68–84.7) with manifested hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 85 mmHg) and a permanently poor eGFR for a duration time more than 3 months were enclosed. Albuminuria was defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥ 30 mg/gr and it was classified according to KDIGO 2012. The obesity was defined by a high body mass index (BMI>30 kg/m2). The waist circumference, HDL-C, triglycerides and serum glucose were measured. Chi-square tests and an adjusted model were performed.
Results
Chi-square tests showed significant association between classified albuminuria and both obesity and high serum triglycerides (x2 = 7.2, p = 0.02 and x2 = 8.3, p = 0.01 respectively). However, the adjusted model for the prediction of albuminuria showed that the presence of a high BMI was a non-significant risk factor, although diabetes mellitus and eGFR value were found to be significant risk factors (p = 0.03, OR = 4.3, 1.2–22.07 and p = 0.04, OR = 0.9, 0.9–1.007 respectively) adjusting to covariates including the high waist circumference.
Conclusion
Obesity defined by a high BMI was not found to be a significant risk factor for micro/macroalbuminuria in hypertensive patients with a poor estimated glomerular filtration rate, when diabetes mellitus and the low eGFR value act as confounders."

Fibrinogen has been implicated as a cause of atherosclerosis and its complications in patients with type 2 DM. We aimed to measure the plasma fibrinogen level in type 2 diabetics and to correlate it with the duration, type of treatment, HbA1c, smoking, lipid profile, diabetic retinopathy, hypertension and ischemic heart disease in comparison to control.
Methods
A case control single center study included 50 patients with type 2 DM between the ages of 35–85 y who were randomly selected from the medical units of Baghdad Teaching Hospital compared to 30 non-diabetics as a control. After taking verbal consents; plasma fibrinogen levels were estimated and correlated with aimed variables. Odds ratios with 95% CI were calculated and regression analysis was performed for correlations. P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
There were statistically significant differences regarding total cholesterol, TG, and LDL between cases and control. Mean HbA1c of diabetics was 8.31 ± 1.75% (P < 0.001). Cases showed plasma fibrinogen of (4.01 ± 1.89 g/dL) compared to (2.79 ± 0.55 g/dL) of control (P < 0.001). ROC curve revealed that the AUC was (0.679 ± 0.06, 95%CI = 0.561–0.797, P < 0.008). The sensitivity and specificity of the test at cut off value of 3.05 g/dL were 0.62 and 0.567 respectively. There was a significant correlation between fibrinogen level and each of HbA1c (r = 0.497, P < 0.001) and TG (r = 0.359, P = 0.01).
Conclusions
HbA1c has a significant positive effect on plasma fibrinogen and it is important to measure plasma fibrinogen level in patients with type 2 DM."

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that is well known for its long term serious complications. Proteinuria whether micro or macroproteinuria is one of these complications. Many studies has related proteinuria to other complications of diabetes as retinopathy and cardiovascular disease of diabetes, while the lungs of diabetic patients which is the largest organ in the body with a large macro and microvascular bed, has not been related to this complication.
Aim
The aim of the study was to find out whether proteinuria in diabetic patients can predict lung involvement.
Patients and methods
A comparative cross sectional study in which we compared the lung function of 100 type 2 diabetic patients with proteinuria with that of 100 type 2 diabetic patients without proteinuria. Proteinuria is measured in a random sample by “urine protein/urine creatinine ratio”. FEV1 and FVC were measured by spirometer.
Results
The results showed that patients with proteinuria had a high frequency of abnormal PFT (86%), while patients without proteinuria had a low frequency of abnormal PFT (11%).Also diabetic patients with proteinuria had lower FVC (72.9 ± 6.5 vs. 88.2 ± 8.2), than diabetic patients without proteinuria.
Conclusions
We concluded that diabetes mellitus causes a significant impairment in pulmonary function test. This impairment is significantly related with proteinuria."

Results
Prevalence of type 1 DM was 3.5% and of type 2 DM 96.5%. Prevalence of type 1 DM declined while of type 2 DM increased with age. No gender or residency differences were found between type 1 and type 2 DM. A total of 72.0% of subjects with type 2 DM were treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD), 11.5% were treated with insulin and 7.1% were treated with both OAD and insulin. Internists specialized in DM were mainly doctors who started insulin treatment. Almost half of insulin naive subjects were skeptical towards insulin initiation and their main concern was the needle punch.

One of the most frequently encountered endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Recent studies have reported varied prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in women with PCOS. The aim of this study is to determine if the women with PCOS are at a higher risk of MetS.
Method
The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. To collect articles, we searched online databases of PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EBSCO and Google scholar search engine and the reference list of the retrieved articles using MeSH keywords of “metabolic syndrome”, “woman” and “polycystic ovary syndrome” without time limit until October 2018. Cochran's Q test and I2 Index were used to evaluate the heterogeneity among studies and the random effects model was used for combining the results. Data analysis was performed in STATA software version 11.1.
Result
Finally, 72 studies involving 10075 PCOS patients with an average age of 26.2 ± 5.01 years were included in the meta-analysis. The heterogeneity rate was high (I2 = 76.5%; p < 0.001) and the pooled estimate of the association between MetS and PCOS was significant (OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 2.18–3.02; P < 0.001).
Conclusion
According to the results, there is higher risk of MetS in women with PCOS. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment of MetS in women with PCOS may have a significant impact on this patients health and reduce the rate of mortality and morbidity."

The aim of the study was to assess the association of physical activity (PA) with the presence of diabetes related complications among Bangladeshi type 2 diabetic subjects.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Out Patient Department (OPD) of BIRDEM, Bangladesh. A group of 977 subjects were randomly selected and followed up. Diabetes was diagnosed following the WHO study group criteria. The level of PA was categorized into inactive/low (<150 min/week) and moderate-to-vigorous (≥150 min/week). The WHO recommended Asian criteria was used to identify general obesity. Retinopathy was detected by fundal photography, CKD by serum creatinine and hypertension was diagnosed clinically. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the associations of PA with diabetes related complications.
Results
Out of the 977 subjects investigated, 468 were male and 509 were female (mean ± SD of age, 56 ± 8 years). In the study subjects, 74% were either inactive or in low PA and of them 65.1% were overweight/obese. Analysis showed that inactive/low PA was associated with all the three diabetes related complications (p < 0.001)–hypertension, retinopathy, and nephropathy. Multivariate analysis showed that inactive/low level of PA was strongly associated with complications like retinopathy (p < 0.001) and hypertension (p = 0.01) in the female patients. It was also found to be highly associated with retinopathy (p < 0.001) among the male patients.
Conclusion
A large number of urban Bangladeshi population are involved only in low PA or remain inactive themselves, which is leading to obesity and it seems to have a strong association with diabetes related complications in this population."

A total of 100 healthy subjects and 200 patients diagnosed with different MetS components were enrolled in the study. Eligible patients were allocated into four groups (50 patients). Group1 include patients with 2 criteria of MetS components, group 2 with 3 criteria, group 3 with 4 criteria and group 4 had patients with 5 criteria.
Results
Regarding white blood cell indices, data showed that total leukocyte and neutrophil count as well as neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio were significantly increased in all groups of MetS patients when compared to the healthy group. Additionally, platelets count, platelet distribution width (PDW), and main platelet volume (MPV) levels and platelets/lymphocyte (P/L) ratio were significantly higher in all patients with MetS as compared to the healthy subjects. Serum leptin concentration and leptin-to-adiponectin ratio (LAR) were elevated significantly, while adiponectin level was significantly diminished in all MetS groups when compared to the control.

Patients and methods
Fasting serum FGF21 was measured in 120 type 2 diabetes patients without clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (mean age 51.1 ± 7.7 years; 63.3 women). In addition to basic laboratory tests, serum adiponectin and ultrasonographic examination of CIMT, ankle brachial index (ABI) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) were performed.
Results
Patients with subclinical atherosclerosis have higher serum FGF21 than those without (218 ± 66.8 pg/mL Vs 170 ± 43.1 pg/mL, P < 0.001). FGF21 correlated positively with CIMT and cfPWV (P < 0.001) regardless of patient gender. In logistic regression analysis, circulating FGF21 was found to be an independent predictor for subclinical atherosclerosis (P = 0.023) in addition to dyslipidemia, hypertension and adiponectin. FGF21 was also found to be an independent determinant of cfPWV in stepwise multiple regression analysis. ROC curve analysis was done and cutoff high risk FGF21 level of 184 pg/mL for the prediction of subclinical atherosclerosis with a sensitivity and specificity of 66.7%.
Conclusions
Serum FGF21 levels correlated with carotid intima media thickness and predict subclinical atherosclerosis. Serum FGF21 is also correlated positively with cfPWV and arterial stiffness in type 2 diabetes patients."

abstract = "Aims
Stage 0 Acute Charcot's Neuroarthropathy (ACN)in Type 2 Diabetes patients is a challenging diagnosis with subtle clinical features and normal appearing plain radiographs of the affected foot. Delay in diagnosis can lead to progression of disease and irreversible deformities. There is a paucity of data on Stage 0 ACN from India. The aim of this study was to assess clinical and radiological characteristics and treatment outcomes in Indian Type 2 Diabetes patients with Stage 0 ACN.
Materials and methods
A comparative, case-control study was carried out amongst patients attending the Integrated Diabetes Foot Clinic at a tertiary care South Indian hospital. During the 3-year study period, a total of 1811 patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus were screened. Of these, n = 10 patients with stage 0 ACN Charcot's arthropathy were identified based on clinical features and MRI imaging of the foot for confirmation of diagnosis. These were compared with an age and duration of diabetes-matched group of n = 50 patients without ACN as controls.
Results
Our study identified 10 patients (0.5%) with Stage 0 Acute charcot neuroarthropathy (ACN) in the study population. Those with ACN had higher BMI, poorer glycaemic control and greater degree of peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.05). Clinically relative lack of pain and infrared thermometric temperature difference >2 °C in the affected foot were the most significant findings, while MRI foot was useful in early detection of active and severe stage 0 disease. Total contact cast was the preferred initial offloading modality, with delay in initiating complete immobilization leading to worse outcomes.
Conclusions
This is the first study to highlight the characteristic features of Stage 0 ACN in Indian Type 2 Diabetes patients. Thorough clinical evaluation, infrared thermometry and radiological findigs on MRI foot leads to early disease detection. Complete offloading, preferably with total contact casts can prevent disease progression and chronic deformities."

The response variables was categorized in adherent MGT (>80) and non-adherent MGT (≤80).
Results
The mean age of patients was 63.6 ± 9.5 with predominance for the sex male 66.4% and 42% of patients with T2DM do not adherence to treatment. We found an associated odds ratio (OR) = 2.3 (1.1–5.1) between heart failure and non-adherence in patients with T2DM.
Conclusion
Heart failure is a factor associated with non-adherence to treatment in patients with T2DM and in the practice clinical, the screening for heart failure and interventions may improve adherence to pharmacotherapy."

Demonstrating the risk factors of diabetes can help to plan for prevention of this disease. This study aimed at quantification of the impact of physical activity, hypertension, general obesity, central obesity, high cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglyceride, smoking, hookah, drug use, alcohol consumption on the incidence of type 2 diabetes at a population level in Yazd, Iran. And this study calculated population attributable risk (PAR) of them.
Methods
For this study, data from the first phase of the cohort study of chronic diseases in the adults of Yazd city were used, which began in 2016. Data was recorded through a cohort trained team. To calculate PAR and its the Bayesian confidence interval were performed using software R (version 3.4.3).
Results
Of the 9967 subjects studied, age ≥30, 14.67% (n = 1432) has type 2 diabetes. The most common risk factors for diabetes were Inadequate physical activity and central obesity (WHR). The PAR for Inadequate physical activity of diabetes in women was 17.92%, in men 18.53, And PAR for WHR in women was 57.62%, in men 43.03.
Conclusions
In this study, age was the strongest determinant of diabetes. And then type 2 diabetes is mainly attributable to WHR, significantly more so in women than men. Therefore, central obesity probably should be considered as a major strategy for reducing incidence of type 2 diabetes."

The purpose of this review is to scientific evidence on the safety and efficacy of the current hypoglycemic agents during Ramadan.
Methods
An extensive Electronic search via PubMed and Google scholar was accomplished through using different search terms. The eligible studies were limited to only published Randomised controlled trial (RCT) and prospective observational studies from 2007 to 2018 on patients with all types of diabetes on any pharmacological management, who intended to fast in Ramadan.
Results and Conclusions
The current era witnessed a gradual shift in the management of these patients with diabetes who elected to fast in Ramadan, despite the variable health-related risks with fasting. Results from available RCTs and observational studies in patients with type 2 diabetes showed lower risk of hypoglycemia, similar or better efficacy for glycemic and weight control with SGLT2 inhibitors, incretin mimetics and the newer insulin analogues compared to Sulfonylurea. Gliclazide is a relatively safer option among all sulfonylurea. Patients requiring insulin did better with insulin analogues, especially the newer premixed formulation at the time of breaking fast compared to the former insulin formulation. Current commonly used newer hypoglycemic agents are generally safe during Ramadan, however, their safety in the higher risk diabetes patients is highly needed."

With the increased worldwide prevalence of hypertension among the underprivileged populations, fewerstudies have reported such risks among Indian tribes. In the context of high prevalence of undernutrition, no such study has examined hypertension among lean and underweight Indian tribal individuals separately.
Methods
We selected total samples of 1066 adult males and 1090 adult females in 20–60 years age-group cross-sectionally to examine the status of hypertension and its risks among nine major tribes in three Indian states; separate analyses for lean and underweight tribal individuals were done.
Results
Increased prevalence of hypertension (females, 14.2%; males, 9.3%) was observed among the tribes with the overall percentage of individuals at adversity (hypertensive + isolated hypertensive) at more than 20% (males 20.1%; females 26.5%). Age-group-wise prevalence showed a sharp rise in the prevalence of hypertension in the 40 + year individuals; additionally, this rise was alarming among females. Undernutrition was observed to be a potential risk factor as a remarkable prevalence of hypertension was observed among the undernourished (approximately 9%) and lean tribal participants (12%). Underweight females were observed to be at higher risk. Tribal statuses were observed to be alarming than the national trends due to their very low average BMI along with high average SBP. A curvilinear prevalence of hypertension was observed while comparing through both the nutritional extremes.
Conclusion
The increased prevalence and risks of hypertension in the background of lean and underweight status of Indian tribes indicates their epidemiological transition burdened with alarming cardio-metabolic health risks that warrant an early and consistent surveillance."

Diabetic foot ulcer is one of the common complications of diabetes disease that is costly and difficult to treat. This problem can lead to morbidity and even mortality. Ozone is a gas that can optimize cellular metabolism and, because of its antioxidant and antibacterial effects, can help the better healing of diabetic foot ulcer.
Method
Two hundred patients, aged 18–85 with diabetic foot ulcers ranging from grade 1 to 4 according to Wagner classification in two groups were studied. Group 1 was treated by full ozone therapy besides the standard regular DFU treatment while group two just was received routine diabetic foot care. Wound size, wound grade, healing time, Fasting blood sugar and inflammatory biomarker before and after treatment were checked.
Results
All patients have had complete wound closure in the ozone group. The mean age of the patients included in the results was 59.03 ± 12.593 and 53.5 ± 10.212 for ozone group and control group. The baseline average surface area of ulcers was 13.41 ± 14.092 cm2 (range 1–70 cm2) in ozone group and 12.72 ± 0.911 (range 1_64 cm2) in the control group. Average healing time was 69.44 ± 36.055 days (range 15–180 days), which is significantly lower than the median healing time measured in the control group and some previous studies.
Conclusion
Our study results support the efficacy of ozone therapy especially in its comprehensive use in DFU healing and reduction in the chances of infection and amputation."

Methods
Patients using insulin between the age of 18–90 years were selected to complete the MedTake questionnaire, to evaluate the indication, dosage, regimen and drug interaction. The MedTake test was employed. For each medicine, the test was scored as the percentage of correct actions and compared with printed instructions one single researcher downloaded all the data was from the municipality's computerized system.
Results
The median age of recruits was 60.2 ± 14.3 and MedTake test scores were low 60.3 ± 20. One hundred patients missed the correct dose question, 40 missed why they were prescribed the drug, indication and 65 missed the therapeutic regimen. These diabetes patients did not know the DDIs between insulin combined with other medicines. Drugs that had more interaction with insulin were: acetylsalicylic acid (40%), enalapril (18%), losartan (32%) and hydrochlorothiazide (23%).
Conclusions
Diabetes patients without practical knowledge about insulin interacting with other pharmaceutical drugs that can produce DDIs with other medicines illustrates a need to develop education programs for diabetics."

This study was undertaken to inspect the preponderance of multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms in microbial infected diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) in north Egypt. Moreover, their later impact on the patients and previous antibiotic therapies were taken into consideration.
Methods
To accomplish this goal, twenty-two of diabetic foot patients with purulent wounds were enrolled in this prospective study. These wounds were swabbed and the antibiotics susceptibility patterns of most virulent bacteria and yeast were studied. Furthermore, bacterial and yeast strains were identified using 16S rRNA and 16S rRNA nucleotide sequences, respectively, and following their phenotypic characteristics employing the VITEK 2 system.
Results
Microbial profiles showed a predominance of monomicrobial infections (77.3%), while polymicrobial infections were found in 22.7%. A total of 24 bacterial isolates (15 Gram-positive and 9 Gram-negative) and four yeast isolates were perceived. Four bacteria were selected based on their resistance toward more than six of empirical antibiotics. They were identified and deposited in GenBank as Acinetobacter baumanni MT3 (KY421195), Staphylococcus aureus MT1 (KY421197), Klebsiella pneumonia MT2 (KY421196), and Staphylococcus aureus MT4 (KY421198). On the other hand, one strain belonged to yeast was opted and identified as Candida albicans MT5 (MG851796).
Conclusion
These findings might effectively help to avert the severe complications of diabetic foot infections (DFIs) besides our endeavours to find new antimicrobial wound dressings."

To validate bioimpedance based predictive equations for fat free mass (FFM) against DEXA and to derive a novel birth weight based predictive equation for FFM in a birth weight based cohort of healthy Asian Indian men.
Methodology
Whole body composition was done using DEXA and bioimpedance in 117 young Asian Indian men, born of normal birth weight (n = 59, birth weight ≥2.5 kg) or low birth weight (n = 58, birth weight < 2.5 kg). Predictive accuracy of 11 different bioimpedance based equations for FFM was evaluated using Pearson's correlation analysis and the root of mean squared prediction error (RMSE) analysis.
Results
The mean FFM (on DEXA) and total lean mass & impedance index (on bioimpedance) were significantly higher in the low birth weight cohort. Significantly higher body fat percentage was noted on bioimpedance, for the normal birth weight cohort, but not on DEXA. In addition, the mean values of predicted FFM were significantly higher in the low birth weight cohort for 9 different predictive equations. Specifically, the mean FFM values obtained using the predictive equations of Schaefer et al., Hoot cooper et al. and Hughes et al. were in close agreement with the actual FFM values on DEXA. A novel predictive equation (CMC equation) for FFM based on birth weight was derived. FFM = 32.637 + (−0.222*age) + (−32.51*waist-to-hip ratio) + (0.33*body mass index) + (1.58 * 1 or 2 (1 = normal birth weight, 2 = low birth weight) + (0.510*waist circumference).
Conclusions
Our study findings substantiate the validity of Bio-impedance analysis (BIA) as a reliable and noninvasive tool for estimating body composition measures in birth-weight based cohorts of Asian Indian males. Further, we have devised a novel BIA-based predictive equation that can be useful in larger epidemiological studies to look at alterations in body fat in this cohort."

There is currently limited data published on the prognostic factors and prevalence of diabetic eye disease in children and young people (CYP) with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), yet diabetic retinopathy remains one of the commonest causes of blindness in young adults. The aim of this study was to determine the risk and prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and to evaluate the risk factors associated with diabetic retinopathy in CYP with T1DM.
Methods
All CYP with Type 1 diabetes between 12 and 18 years of age, registered with the regional diabetic retinopathy screening programme were evaluated from 2012 to 2013 in four diabetes units within the north west region of the United Kingdom. Patients who had evidence of diabetic retinopathy were reviewed to identify risk factors for presence or absence of diabetic retinopathy.
Results
237 patients between the ages 12–18 years were included in the. The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 11%. Out of 27 patients with evidence of diabetic retinopathy, 44% were reported as background changes and 56% had pre-proliferative DR. Significant risk factors for diabetic retinopathy disease in the population using univariate analyses were duration of diabetes, puberty, age at diagnosis and mean HbA1c in the preceding 12 months. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found age of diagnosis (p = 0.04) and mean HbA1c as significant independent risk factors for presence of diabetic retinopathy (p = 0.02).
Conclusions
The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in this paediatric population was 11%. Early age at diagnosis and poor metabolic control are independent risk factors for diabetic retinopathy."

The prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide. Abnormal plasma level of some trace elements may be associated with obesity. The present study was designed to compare the plasma level of zinc, phosphate, calcium and magnesium with the degree of body mass index and waist circumference.
Material and methods
In this cross sectional study 149 persons (20–60 years old) from March 2014 till April 2017 were included. Definition of central obesity was waist circumference (WC)≥ 102 cm and ≥88 cm in men and women, respectively. Also BMI categorized to: normal weight: 18.50–24.99, overweight: 25.00–29.99 and obese: ≥30 kg/m2 respectively. Mg, Ca, P and Zinc in plasma was checked after12 h fasting in each persons. Comparison between the level of Mg, P, Ca and Zinc by three categories of BMI or waist circumference performed. The data were analyzed by independent T-test and one-way ANOVA. Scheffe method was used to determine post-hoc pair-wise comparisons. The relationship between BMI and concentration of elements was detected by linear correlation and Cubic model. A p ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were executed by SPSS version 20.
Results
In this study, 32.2% male and remainder female, mean age of 42.26 ± 13.03 were participated. 40.9% were normal and 59.1% obese base on waist circumference. Also 24.8% normal,44.3% overweight and remainder was obese according to BMI.

Findings from few studies that investigated the relation between dietary habits and obesity are inconsistent so we aimed to assess the association between dietary habits with general and abdominal obesity in central Iran.
Methods
This study has been conducted on 8652 adults aged 20–70 years participated in Yazd Health Study (YAHS). Data regarding dietary habits, socio-demographic characteristics and history of chronic illnesses were collected via questionnaire. Anthropometric parameters were measured using a scale and body analyzer. Odds ratio of obesity were assessed using a Binary Logistic Regression test.
Results
Study participants consisted of 49.6% men and 50.4% women. The prevalence of general and abdominal obesity in this population was 25.9 and 45.3%, respectively. Our analysis revealed that subjects who drank carbonated drinks ≥3 times/week had significantly higher odds of general and abdominal obesity compared to participants never did so (OR 1.89; 95%CI: 1.37–2.61, OR 1.11; 95%CI: 1.50–2.04) and those ate fast food more than 4 times a month had higher odds of abdominal obesity (OR 1.51; 95%CI: 1.12–2.03). The results also pointed that intake of low fat dairy products was inversely associated with general obesity (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.63–0.98) and abdominal obesity (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.54–0.82) when compared with full fat dairy products.

abstract = "Background
The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of Metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the people of Gwalior. Three criteria viz., National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria, International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria and Harmonized criteria for MetS were employed to assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in this region, their concordance with respect to this population was recorded.
Methods
The cross-sectional study involved the people, who had attended the Diabetes clinic at the Centre for Translational Research, Jiwaji University during 2015-2017. A total of 1190 participants within the age group of 20–79 years of either gender were included in the study. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid profile of all subjects were assessed. Student's ‘t’ test, Kappa statistics and Binary logistic regression model were used to analyze the data.
Results
The percentage of prevalent MetS was found to be 72.7, 50.2 and 53.9 following Harmonized criteria, NCEP ATPIII and IDF criteria respectively. The prevalence was found to be maximum in centrally obese female population, aged between 51 and 60 years with the presence of hyperglycemia and reduced HDL– C. Harmonized and IDF criteria showed good agreement (κ 0.85). Regression analysis showed that, high body mass index, hypertension and dyslipedimia were the most critical predictive risk factors of MetS.
Conclusions
Maximum prevalence of MetS was recorded when the Harmonized criteria was followed. A good agreement was observed between Harmonized vs. IDF criteria. MetS if detected early especially in apparently healthy subjects; paves way for preventive measures to be designed in order to avert the incidence of diabetes and other risks related to cardio vascular disease."

abstract = "Background
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) has been growing rapidly in the world. It is smashing particularly the lower and middle income countries (LMICs) severely. Due to its acute and chronic complications many lives have fallen under its bad shadow. Therefore, we aimed to review the existing evidence on major types and specific complications of DM among diabetic patients in Ethiopia.
Methods
Both relevant quantitative and qualitative studies, conducted after 1990s, investigated and reported DM and complications from MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, DAOJ and Cochrane library databases were explored. In addition, System for Information for grey literature in Europe (SINGLE) database was investigated for the existence of unpublished grey literature. Total of 161 titles were identified and 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings were narrated descriptively.
Results
In this review 17 studies were included, and both macro and micro complications were summarized. Among the diabetic complications retinopathy, nephropathy, metabolic syndrome, impotence and depression were the main findings among diabetic patients in Ethiopia.
Conclusion
The burden of DM and its microvascular and macrovascular complications have been increasing among diabetic patients in Ethiopia. The increased duration of the diseases, lower socio economic level, existence of other complications, old age attributed the diabetic complications. Therefore, close monitoring and follow up of diabetic patients is necessary to reduce the incidence and prevalence of diabetic complications among the patients."

abstract = "Diabetes mellitus is the most common endocrine disease, characterized by chronic hyperglycemia. The hyperglycemic milieu leads to endothelial injury in blood vessels of variant size, which results in microangiopathy and macroangiopathy (atherosclerosis). Consequential ischemia of nerves and hyperglycemia by itself lead to nerve degeneration and generalized neuropathy, affecting most often the sensory peripheral nerves and the autonomic nervous system. Auditory, vestibular and olfactory sensorium may be compromised by DM. People with DM have an increased susceptibility to infection, as a result of neutrophil dysfunction and impaired humoral immunity. Therefore DM predisposes to certain infectious diseases, such as fungal sinusitis or malignant otitis externa, which are rare in general population. Recovery from infections or from injuries may be compromised by coexisting DM. In this review we discuss complications of DM in the head and neck region. Otolaryngologists and general practitioners should be alert to specific conditions related to DM and be minded of the relevant complications and consequences."

abstract = "Background
Despite epidemiological studies worldwide have documented erectile dysfunction (ED) as a major complication of type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in men, only limited research reported on determinants of ED in this population. The study aimed at examining the association of ED with dyslipidaemia in T2DM patients.
Methods
The study enrolled 813 consecutive eligible adult male T2DM patients attending the endocrinology departments of a tertiary teaching hospital in Bangladesh. Sexual function was assessed using modified International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) in face-to-face interview and collected along with sociodemographic information. Diabetes and lipid profile and treatment history were collected from patient's treatment records. Association of ED with dyslipidaemia was assessed using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders.
Result
Prevalence of ED among the T2DM patients was very high (72.7%), of which around half had moderated-to-severe ED. Odds of having dyslipidaemia among T2DM patients with ED is 2.3 times higher than those without. The odds increased by approximately 3 fold for an abnormal High Density Lipoprotein level and by 2.7 fold for abnormal Low Density Lipoprotein.
Conclusion
Dyslipidaemia was associated with increased ED risk among T2DM. Abnormal lipoprotein level particularly were found to pose greater risk."

abstract = "Background
Diabetic Peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the most distressing complication of diabetic population leading to loss of sensation, pain, and amputation. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been used to manage nerve injuries as it holds the potential to induce a biostimulatory effect with no side effects. Hence we planned to study the biochemical effect and therapeutic outcomes of LLLT on patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy as a preliminary work.
Materials and methods
Pre-posttest analysis was done on 40 patients diagnosed with DPN confirmed using 10 g Monofilament test and Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI). Vibration sensation and pain measured by Vibration perception threshold (VPT) and Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS). All patients were given LLLT (3.1 J/cm2) on plantar and dorsal of the foot for 10 days. Serum samples were collected at baseline and 4 weeks after LLLT to estimate Vitamin D and Magnesium and compared the results.
Results
There was a significant increase in Vitamin D and Magnesium levels after LLLT. We observed a considerable improvement in the quality of life after LLLT demonstrated by a decrease in VPT and MNSI and a reduction in NPRS in DPN patients.
Conclusion
In this study, we found that LLLT improved the QL and hence may be a useful therapeutic option in treating peripheral neuropathic pain in type 2 diabetic patients. The progress in the serum Magnesium and Vit. D levels were proportional to the QL and may be a good indicator of the prognosis of DPN after LLLT."

abstract = "Aims
In the present study we intended to study autonomic functions and its association with telomerase level, oxidative stress and inflammation in complete glycemic spectrum.
Materials and methods
Age, gender and BMI matched 28 subjects in the age group of 25–50 years were recruited across complete glycemic spectrum as follows: 1) Normoglycemics (controls) 2) Prediabetics and 3) Frank diabetics. We assessed heart rate variability, cardiac autonomic function, lipid profile, adiponectin, malondialdehyde and telomerase level.
Results
Time domain parameters and frequency domain parameters were significantly lower, and LFnu and LF/HF ratio were significantly higher in prediabetes and diabetes than control. Serum Adiponectin and HDL levels were significantly lower in diabetes than prediabetes and control, and prediabetes had significantly lower HDL than controls. Other lipid profile parameters (TC, TG, VLDL, LDL, non-HDL & derived lipid parameters were significantly higher in diabetes than prediabetes and control and prediabetes had significantly higher values than controls. MDA levels were significantly higher and TAS was significantly lower in diabetics than prediabetics and control group. Telomerase level was significantly higher in diabetes as compared to prediabetes and control. Telomerase had significantly negative correlation with SDNN, HF, TP, HDL and adiponectin, and significant positive correlation with MDA, fasting insulin, HOMA IR, TC, and AIP.
Conclusion
Oxidative damage, inflammation and autonomic dysregulation may be involved in Telomere/Telomerase dysregulation in diabetes and telomerase levels can be used as a cardio-metabolic marker of diabetes."
