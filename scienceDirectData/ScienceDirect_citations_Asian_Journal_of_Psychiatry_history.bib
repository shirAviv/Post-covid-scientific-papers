abstract = "This paper describes the development and validation of the Case Management Quality Scale (CMQS) to measure the quality of care provided by case managers in an early intervention service for clients with first episode psychosis. A total of 300 client participants from the Singapore Early Psychosis Programme completed a self-administered survey comprising 52 items measuring case management, the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 8-item version (CSQ-8), Recovery Self-Assessment – person in recovery version (RSA-R), and Working Alliance Inventory – long form client version (WAI-C), and Recovering Quality of Life 10-item version (ReQoL-10). Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the 52-item scale and the items were reduced using criterion validity. Psychometric properties of the 25-item CMQS were tested using internal consistency and concurrent validity. A 2-factor structure of the CMQS was established comprising two subscales - Therapeutic alliance and Care and empowerment. The test of normality for CMQS and subscales was largely found to be within the acceptable range. The Cronbach’s alpha for the CMQS scale was high (0.97) and in terms of convergent validity, the CMQS and the two subscales had a moderate correlation with the CSQ-8, RSA-R, and WAI-C (r ranging from 0.596–0.711) and a mild correlation with the ReQoL-10. In conclusion, the CMQS is a user-friendly, and psychometrically sound instrument that is potentially useful for measuring case manager-client therapeutic alliance, and the level of care and empowerment in a case management service."

Pandemics can lead to heightened levels of stress; Anxiety is a common response to any stressful situation. This study attempted to assess the knowledge, attitude, anxiety experience, and perceived mental healthcare need among adult Indian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire using a non-probability snowball sampling technique. A total of 662 responses were received. The responders had a moderate level of knowledge about the COVID-19 infection and adequate knowledge about its preventive aspects. The attitude towards COVID-19 showed peoples' willingness to follow government guidelines on quarantine and social distancing. The anxiety levels identified in the study were high. More than 80 % of the people were preoccupied with the thoughts of COVID-19 and 72 % reported the need to use gloves, and sanitizers. In this study, sleep difficulties, paranoia about acquiring COVID-19 infection and distress related social media were reported in 12.5 %, 37.8 %, and 36.4 % participants respectively. The perceived mental healthcare need was seen in more than 80 % of participants. There is a need to intensify the awareness and address the mental health issues of people during this COVID-19 pandemic."

However, as recent expansion of the undergraduate training in psychiatry in SL may have instigated favorable changes in students’ attitudes, we assessed the attitudes of students regarding psychiatry by administering Attitude towards psychiatry-30 (ATP-30) scale to final-year medical students in nine medical schools in SL. This 30-item questionnaire covers eight domains of psychiatry and is rated on a Likert scale, producing a total score out of 150. A multiple linear regression was performed to investigate associated factors. A total of 743 fin. l-year students participated. Of them, 54 % were male. The mean attitude score was 107.7 (SD = 12.3) and 92.2 % showed an overall “positive” attitude. 22.2 % of students considered psychiatry as a potential future career. Students with more than one month of clinical exposure to psychiatry showed a better attitude compared to those with shorter exposure. Female gender and the presence of a close person with mental illness were also associated with better attitudes and career interest. The generally positive attitude towards psychiatry among medical students may be explained, at least partly, by recent advances in undergraduate psychiatry education in SL. Longer clinical exposure to psychiatry being associated with better attitudes indicates the need to ensure adequate duration of clinical training in psychiatry in the undergraduate curriculum."

In this study, we aimed to investigate predictors of NSSI in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) and the role of lifetime substance use disorder (SUD). A sample of 165 patients with a diagnosis of SSD who were in remission participated in the study. Lifetime NSSI was assessed using the Inventory of Statements About Self-injury (ISAS). Lifetime SUD were evaluated. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to predict NSSI. SUD was found to be related to NSSI in patients with SSD, and it was associated with an approximately fourfold increase in the risk of NSSI. The rates of lifetime SUD in our sample and in the NSSI (+) group were 38.2 % and 55.6 %, respectively. The most commonly abused substances among patients with NSSI were cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids. The prevalence of NSSI was 43.6 % in our sample. ‘Self-cutting’ was the most common type and ‘affect regulation’ was the most common function of NSSI. One of the most significant risk factors for NSSI was a previous history of suicide attempts. SUD appears to be a significant predictor of NSSI in patients with SSD. Further investigation of treatable risk factors such as SUD which are related to NSSI is needed. It is also essential to screen SSD patients for NSSI due to the probable relation to high risk of suicide."

Several studies have been conducted to highlight the shrines in Muslim countries to demonstrate the Sufi tradition in Islam, where the followers seek healing and use the Sufi saints as intermediaries for the fulfillment of their desires. In Pakistan, the shrine of Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar provides a vital cultural, religious, psychological, and social resource where people get involved in religious rituals and trances. A sample of 70 devotees was randomly interviewed with the help of qualitative research methods such as semi-structured and in-depth interviewed, key informants included observation were used for data collection. The major focus of this study is on the religious rituals of healing and the overall assumption that people engage in this practice according to their socio-cultural needs, and followers of the shrine in the living community seek healing rituals to address their social ailments as well as physical and emotional problems. They engage in different types of rituals, including trances, with different objectives. The research goal is to discover the chief motive of devotees who visit the shrine for the rituals and religious practices. These findings of this study propose that shrine ritual healing is powerful not so much because of the specific practice of exorcist rituals, but because the practice is associated with sacred activities and religious rituals performed by thousands of people throughout the years."

abstract = "Objective
Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with significant genetic predisposition. In a subset of schizophrenia patients, mitochondrial dysfunction could be explained by the genomic defects like mitochondrial DNA Copy Number Variations, which are considered as a sensitive index of cellular oxidative stress. Given the high energy demands for neuronal functions, altered Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) and consequent impaired mitochondrial physiology would significantly influence schizophrenia pathogenesis. In this context, we have made an attempt to study mitochondrial dysfunction in schizophrenia by assessing mtDNAcn in antipsychotic-naïve/free schizophrenia patients.
Method
mtDNAcn was measured in 90 antipsychotic-naïve / free schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and 147 Healthy Controls (HC). The relative mtDNAcn was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using TaqMan® multiplex assay method.
Result
A statistically significant difference between groups [t = 5.22, P < 0.001] was observed, with significantly lower mtDNAcn in SCZ compared to HC. The group differences persisted even after controlling for age and sex [F (4, 232) = 22.68, P < 0.001, η2 = 0.09].
Conclusion
Lower mtDNAcn in SCZ compared to HC suggests that mtDNAcn may hold potential to serve as an important proxy marker of mitochondrial function in antipsychotic-naïve/free SCZ patients."

In absence of any such prior study, the present study compared the hemodynamic changes in brain associated with craving effect in adolescent inhalant users and healthy controls using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) mechanism. This was an observational case control study with twelve adolescents, aged 12-18 years, with current use of inhalants as their primary drug, and twelve healthy, age and gender-matched adolescents, with no lifetime use of inhalants. Clinical assessments included Teen Addiction Severity Index and Visual Analogue Scale for craving. Participants abstained from all substances during 48 h prior to fMRI, confirmed by urinalysis. A validated visual cue block paradigm with neutral and craving cues was presented during the BOLD assessments in a 3 T MR system. The inhalant users exhibited BOLD activation in inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, superior occipital gyrus, cingulate gyrus, lentiform nucleus, thalamus, and culmen as compared to control group. The control group exhibited activation of insula as compared to cases. The results may be attributed to visuo-spatial attention, visual perception, working memory, and motivation associated with visual cue reactivity. This preliminary study provides important findings pertaining to activation patterns in response to cue-induced craving among adolescent inhalant users."

Majority (98 %) were satisfied with the format of the program in which it was conducted and felt that their expectations were either partially or completely satisfied with appropriate content (93 %). The health authorities (43 %) gained better insights into the magnitude of mental health concerns and agreed that mental health service delivery should scale up. The service providers (17 %) felt the need to upgrade their skills in specialty areas of psychiatry in order to gear up for comprehensive mental health care delivery.

Glucosamine hydrochloride normalizes GABA antagonist- and social defeat-induced behavioral alterations and upregulation of immune response genes in Drosophila and mice, respectively, increases hippocampal neurogenesis in mice, and demonstrates efficacy in murine behavioral models of depression. This suggests that it may have antidepressant potential in humans.
Methods
In an open label, 4-week pilot study, patients (n = 20) diagnosed with mild to moderate, nonpsychotic (unipolar) major depressive episode (DSM-IV) were treated with glucosamine in monotherapy at 1 g/day for 1 week and 2 g/day for 3 more weeks. Patients were assessed at baseline, and at 2- and 4-week follow up using the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale, and other measures. An intent-to-treat analysis with last-observation-carried-forward was conducted on the whole sample.
Results
Three patients dropped out before the first follow up; the rest completed the study. HAM-D scores dropped by a third in the sample as a whole; however, only 4 patients (20 %) were considered HAM-D responders (improvement by >50 %) and only 2 patients (10 %) were CGI-I responders (endpoint score of 1 or 2). There were only 2 (10 %) HAM-D remitters (endpoint score <8). There were no serious adverse events and the treatment was well tolerated.
Conclusions
Encouraging preclinical results notwithstanding, glucosamine monotherapy does not appear to be effective against major depression. A more authoritative conclusion would require a randomized controlled trial."

Although social cognitive impairments are evident in patients with schizophrenia across many cultures, psychosocial interventions are less used in Eastern countries. Despite a growing emphasis on community care in mental health services in Eastern countries, the synergistic effects of social cognitive intervention strategies on routine community mental health services are not well documented. This study aimed to adapt a group-based social cognitive skills training (SCST) program for use in a Korean context and evaluate its feasibility and preliminary effects among community-dwelling individuals with schizophrenia. Forty-six patients were assigned to either the SCST + treatment as usual (TAU) group (n = 22) or the TAU only group (n = 24). Participants completed tasks to assess social cognition, social functioning, neurocognition, and psychiatric symptoms before and after treatment. Over a period of approximately 12 weeks, drop-out rates were comparably low in both groups, and the attendance rates for the SCST program was high (85.7%, mean sessions attended = 20.56/24 sessions). The SCST + TAU group demonstrated significant facial affect recognition, social functioning, and psychiatric symptoms compared to the TAU only group. A non-significant trend in theory of mind was observed, along with no improvements in social perception and neurocognition. The adapted version of the SCST program is feasible for implementation and demonstrates promise for enhancing social cognition and functioning in Korean outpatients with schizophrenia."

Schizotypy has been shown to be a time-stable construct that exists across the schizophrenia spectrum. The Multidimensional Schizotypy Scale (MSS) was developed to capture the three factors underlying schizotypy: positive, disorganized and negative schizotypy. However, a recent validation study reported a four-factor construct with an additional negative social anhedonia factor. The factor structure of the Chinese version of the MSS remains unknown. This study aimed to identify and validate the factor structure of the Chinese version of the MSS.
Methods
We recruited 641 Chinese speakers via on-line advertisement. We administered the Chinese version of the MSS, which was a self-report instrument. The scale consists of 77 items with true or false response options. We identified and removed 43 outliers. Finally, a total of 294 participants were randomly selected as the derivative sample for exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The remaining 304 participants were retained as the validation sample for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
Results
EFA identified four factors: the positive factor, the disorganization factor, the negative affective and motivational anhedonia factor, and the negative social anhedonia factor. The EFA-identified four-factor model was compared with the unidimensional, three-factor bifactorial and theoretical three-factor models using CFAs. The three-factor bifactorial model fitted the data better than the EFA-identified four-factor model.
Conclusion
Our finding suggests that the Chinese version of the MSS is a valid tool for assessing schizotypy in the Chinese setting."

Evidence indicates that a majority of the world’s population, including traditionally underserved populations and low- and middle-income countries, has access to mobile technologies (phones, tablets, mobile devices). Given the widespread access to mobile technology worldwide, health behavior-change tools delivered on mobile platforms enable broader reach and scalability of evidence-based assessment and interventions, especially for addressing the growing burden of mental health disorders globally. The purpose of this article was to present a qualitative review of mobile mental health applications in an Asian context. We searched on-line databases and included 22 articles in this review. We have identified mobile health applications that address eight categories of mental illnesses. These applications were developed in only six countries and regions in Asia. Future studies from more diverse countries for diverse cultures should be conducted to examine the advantages and disadvantages of mobile health technology."

Random-effects models were used. For continuous results, the standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to synthesize the effects. Thirty studies were included, with a total of 2651 patients with schizophrenia. Compared to pharmacotherapy alone and standard care alone, Morita therapy plus pharmacotherapy and Morita therapy plus standard care both had significant effects on mental state (pooled effect size = −1.09, 95% CI: −0.35, −0.83), social functioning (pooled effect size = −0.61, 95% CI: −2.30, −0.92) and behavior (pooled effect size = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.75, 1.51). Significant heterogeneity between studies was found for mental state (I2 = 89%, p < 0.05) and social functioning (I2 = 95%, p < 0.05), but no heterogeneity was found for behavior (I2 = 0%, p = 0.84). Morita therapy has positive effects on mental state and social functioning among patients with schizophrenia, but it leads to some problems with behavior among these patients. Most included studies have unclear bias, and the forest plots show high heterogeneity among the results. Thus, Morita therapy cannot be implemented in clinical practice as a feasible strategy, the conclusion has yet to be confirmed, and new trials and future studies are desired."

Treatment naive children with clinically normal intelligence diagnosed with ADHD were enrolled in the study. Children were treated naturalistically with MPH and ATX. Treatments were started at 0.5 mg/ kg/ day and titrated weekly to a maximum of 1.2 mg/ kg/ day. The daily equivalent dose was calculated according to clinician toolkits of Utah Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. DSM-IV Based Screening and Assessment Scale for Disruptive Behavior Disorders- Parent form (DBSASDBD) and Clinical Global Impression Scale were used to assess ADHD symptoms and Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)- Short Form was used to assess the sleep habits and problems before and after the treatment. Both MPH and ATX reduced symptom severity of ADHD in all domains and also reduced total CSHQ scores with similar effect sizes. (0.7 for MPH vs. 0.8 for ATX). The rate of clinically significant sleep problems at baseline was 93.5 %. At the end-point, 83.9 % of the sample still displayed clinically significant sleep problems while none of the children were judged to have moderate-severe sleep problems. Our results suggest that both ATX and MPH may selectively improve different sleep domains in children with ADHD. Studies using standardized dosing schemes for longer durations and evaluating sleep with objective measurements may clarify the differential effects of treatments on sleep among children with ADHD."

The MARS showed good internal consistency; Cronbach’s alpha of total MARS was 0.83. Among the cohort of patients affected by schizophrenia with an episodic course, 28.5 % met the criteria of good adherence to antipsychotic medication; age, steady income, and severity of illness had significant effects on medication adherence. Medication adherence of patients affected by schizophrenia in mainland China was found to be relatively low, calling for urgent attention and intervention. Risk factors for non-adherence to medication among patients affected by schizophrenia with an episodic course include older age, unsteady income, being in the acute period of the disease, and severity of illness."

Overall, the BP prevalence was 0.2 %, as of 2017, with consistently higher rates in women. The BP prevalence was highest among those aged ≥60 years (0.27 %) and was lowest among those aged 0–29 years (0.12 %), as of 2017. The average annual rate of increase among those aged 0–29 years and ≥60 years was 8.48 % and 7.39 %, respectively, which exceeded the overall mean of 6.58 %. The average annual rate of increase in BP prevalence for those aged 30–59 years was 4.67 %. The proportion of inpatients who were hospitalized for longer than 180 days decreased, while the proportion of those hospitalized for 0–14 days increased. The estimated BP prevalence was higher when using the most recent NHIS data rather than in the surveys. These prevalence rates can be used to support the development of future mental health policies."

Seven electronic databases were searched to retrieve relevant peer-reviewed articles published during 2000-2018. Primary research studies published in English that evaluated the relationship between maternal antenatal and postnatal depression with dietary intake were selected. We screened 1585 articles, of which 13 met the inclusion criteria. These included five cohort studies (including two birth cohorts) and eight cross-sectional studies representing a total of 12,742 participants altogether. Studies were divided into five groups depending on whether they analyzed all nutrients, micronutrients, dietary patterns, dietary behavior or intake of fish and vegetables. The studies exploring the association of depression with dietary patterns found a protective association of “Health Conscious”, “Healthy” and “Brazilian” diet patterns with maternal depression. The group of studies which analyzed all nutrients, found an inverse relationship of the “Healthy Eating Index” with maternal depression. Deficiency of calcium, iron, and folate were also associated with maternal depression. Prenatal and early postpartum eating attitudes and BMI were found as predictors of depressive symptoms in the late post-partum period in a diet behavior study. It is important to identify modifiable lifestyle risk factors which may contribute to maternal depression. A limitations of our review is the absence of meta-analysis which was not possible due to heterogeneity of the studies."

We hereby report the first case of opioid dependence who developed a rare phenomenon of moderate to severe opioid withdrawal symptoms on administration of sublingual BNX after several days of being stabilized on plain buprenorphine (BUP). The case demonstrates the need to consider using buprenorphine monotherapy whenever such adverse effects are encountered.

By learning from previous experiences of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and previous studies, psychiatric hospitals can provide safeguards to prevent nosocomial infection among patients and staff during an epidemic or biological disaster. These strategies include a series of actions such as following national guidelines for infection control, reserving adequate support for disinfection equipment, providing relevant and sufficient pro-service and in-service education and training, establishing regular surveillance of hand hygiene habits, proper communication and health education, and providing opportunities for vaccination if possible. Based on the harm reduction concept, staff division of office breaks and ward classification and shunting are recommended and should be further implemented."

Suicide is a global phenomenon and a major public health concern and ‘it is possibly preventable if it is well understood’.
Aim
The article is an attempt to understand ‘suicide in India’ with the existing literature and the lacuna for the four decades.
Methods
The information is collected from 270 articles on suicide research in India, published in various electronic data bases and different official sites as surprisingly the nation is with highest suicide mortality rate among all regional countries.
Results
The review shows an increase in the number of articles on suicide in India over the period of time. Though the suicide mortality rate in India is significantly high, the number of intervention studies remains very minimal. India’s understanding about ‘the concept’ remains questionable as the data from different sources for the same time period shows a huge disparity. Sex, age, socio-economic status, substance abuse, mental illness, medical illness, psychological and environmental stressors etc make individuals vulnerable to end their lives.
Conclusion
Appropriate official documentation and more qualitative studies would help in understanding the phenomena better. Intervention studies and policy level changes are the need of the hour to save the nation from the dangerous ‘iceberg of suicide’."

Caregivers of 100 patients with schizophrenia, currently in clinical remission, were evaluated on Ways of the coping questionnaire, Brief religious coping scale, and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). More often use of adaptive coping mechanisms (such as seeking social support, accepting responsibility, planful problem solving, and positive reappraisa) was associated with a lower level of residual symptoms and better functioning of the patient, and lower level of psychological morbidity as per the GHQ-12 among the caregivers. A higher grade of negative symptoms, general psychopathology, and PANSS total score was associated with lower use of positive religious coping and higher use of negative religious coping in the caregivers. More severe psychological morbidity among the caregivers was associated with lower use of positive religious coping and higher use of negative religious coping. To conclude, this study depicts that caregivers of patients with schizophrenia use a mixture of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies, including religious coping. The use of adaptive coping is associated with better patient-related outcomes and lower levels of psychological morbidity/distress among caregivers. Whereas, more frequent use of maladaptive coping is associated with both patients' and caregivers' outcomes."

abstract = "The objectives of this study were to identify the risk factors for metabolic syndrome in patients on antipsychotics and to compare the frequency of metabolic monitoring with evidence-based guidelines. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary care health institution of South India. The study included patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorders prescribed with antipsychotic drugs. Data was collected from the medical records department. American Diabetic Association/American Psychiatric Association (ADA/APA) guidelines were used as a reference standard to assess the monitoring for metabolic parameters. Diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was done according to the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) guidelines. Risk factors for metabolic syndrome and frequency of metabolic monitoring were analyzed. A total of 668 patients were included for clinical audit. About 16.5 % of the patients were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Age >50 years (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.00; p value <0.001) and duration of antipsychotic treatment>5 years (OR 1.55; p value< 0.05) were recognized as the independent risk factors for metabolic syndrome using multiple logistic regression. Blood pressure (BP) and fasting blood sugar (FBS) levels were documented in 99.7 % and 47 % of cases at baseline respectively, however, subsequent annual data on BP and FBS monitoring was reduced to 72.7 % and 46 % respectively. Weight was documented in 60 % of the cases at baseline, whereas the subsequent data on four times the annual assessment of weight was reduced to 9.8 %. The extent of documentation of metabolic monitoring parameters was inadequate."

One of the most vulnerable, but neglected, an occupational community of internal migrant workers is prone for development of psychological ill-effects due to double whammy impact of COVID-19 crisis and concomitant adverse occupational scenario. Permutations and combinations of the factors viz susceptibility for new viral infections, potential to act as vectors of transmission of infection, high prevalence of pre-existing physical health morbidities such as occupational pneumoconiosis, tuberculosis, HIV infections, pre-existing psychological morbidities, adverse psychosocial factors like absence of family support and caretaker during the crisis, their limitations to follow the rules and regulations of personal safety during the COVID 19 crisis, social exclusion, and inability to timely access the psychiatric services; all give rise to the peri-traumatic psychological distress to internal migrant workers. Superadded, is the blow of financial constraints due to loss of work, absence or suspension of occupational safety and health-related basic laws with associated occupational hazards, which make this occupational group highly vulnerable for the development of psychological illnesses. We attempt to draw the attention of mental health professionals, general medical practitioners and occupational health policymakers to the various, interrelated and interdependent predisposing and causative factors for the development of psychological ill-effects amongst internal migrant workers with the interventions needed to address it, from an occupational health perspective angle."

Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the correlates and stages of the psychological recovery of patients with schizophrenia. 100 patients, in clinical remission, were evaluated on Stages of Recovery Instrument (STORI), Functional Social Support Questionnaire, WHO Quality of life-BREF, Ways of Coping Checklist, Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness Scale, Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder and Knowledge of mental illness scale. Majority of the patients (N = 50) belonged to the stage-5 (Growth), and this was followed by those in the stage-4 (stage of rebuilding; N = 22) and stage-3 (stage of preparation; N = 16) of recovery. A higher stage of recovery was associated with lower stigma in all the domains except stigma resistance. Higher use of confrontative coping and accepting responsibility was associated with a higher score in the awareness stage of recovery. In terms of insight, higher awareness about the effect of medication was associated with a higher stage of recovery. Higher disability in the domain of self-care was seen in the lower stage of recovery. Better quality of life in the physical health domain was associated with being in a higher stage of recovery. To conclude, findings of the present study suggest that stigma plays a significant role in determining the outcome in the form of personal recovery. These findings suggest that to organize the services to promote personal recovery, clinicians should not only aim at symptom amelioration but also must focus on stigma to promote psychological recovery."

The results showed that people without public health emergency treatment experience showed worse performance in mental health, resilience and social support, and tended to suffer from psychological abnormality on interpersonal sensitivity and photic anxiety. This finding suggested that high levels of training and professional experience, resilience and social support were necessary to health care workers who are first taking part in public health emergence."

Symptom severity was measured using Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS).Sex hormone estimation was done at baseline using radioimmunoassay method (RIA) prior to antipsychotic initiation. 51 healthy controls were recruited to participate in the study. Mildly elevated prolactin levels were associated with higher total PANSS scores in women. Hallucinatory behavior and Grandiosity are positively correlated in patients with raised prolactin levels at baseline. Testosterone and estradiol were not associated with psychopathology. Women perceived more stress than men. Elevated prolactin levels in drug naïve Schizophrenia can be a putative marker for predicting gender differences in symptom severity and treatment responses in future."

Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16–28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations."

Despite the above, there are several aspects that hinder a broader interpretation of these findings, the most common being a lack of consensus on the criteria required for diagnosing catatonia. Whilst being the most frequently used tool for diagnosis, the number of signs from Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) needed to diagnose catatonia remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the number of signs required to accurately diagnose catatonia using BFCRS and delineate its dimensions in an acute inpatient unit in the Indian setting. A random sample of 300 patients were evaluated for catatonia within 24 h of admission. Cluster Analysis followed by discriminant analysis and receiver operating curve analysis (ROC) provided cut-off values for diagnosing catatonia syndrome. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was used to identify factors in those with catatonia. Findings revealed that a cut off of two signs from both Bush-Francis Catatonia Screening Instrument or BFCSI (sensitivity of 100 %, specificity of 96.2 % as well as a positive predictive value [PPV] of 79.6 % and negative predictive value [NPV] 100 % with ROC AUC value of 0.98) and complete BFCRS (sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 90.7 %, PPV of 80.7 and NPV of 100 % with ROC AUC for at least two items cut-off being 0.95) accurately detected catatonia. However, the prevalence of catatonia in the same population increased by 4% from 16.3% to 20.3% using the BFCRS rather than the BFCSI. The BFCRS generated a 3-factor model accounting for 65.48 % variance offering the best fit, indicating three discrete dimensions to catatonia, namely retarded, excited and what we named as “aberrant volitional”. Interestingly, the aberrant volitional dimension comprises of signs that need to be elicited rather than passively observed and excluding one, none of them are part of the BFCSI. Findings of this study suggest that the BFCRS more accurately detects catatonia rather than the BFCSI. Additionally, three dimensions of catatonia more coherently explain the catatonic syndrome given that 55.7 % of the sample had signs from more than one factor concurrently. We propose that the BFCRS rather than BFCSI be routinely administered for evaluating all suspected cases of catatonia to ensure more accurate detection as well as identifying the aberrant volitional dimensional signs more consistently. The three-dimensional model also offers great opportunities to further unravel the pathophysiological basis of catatonic signs more systematically."

We explain with the help of examples the many reasons why journal articles that contain patient data need to provide information about where and when the study was conducted. We examined compliance to this requirement in two leading Indian psychiatry journals.
Methods
We examined all issues of the Indian Journal of Psychiatry (IJP) and the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine (IJPM) for the years 2017–2018 to determine how many articles that required to provide location and period information actually did so.
Results
In these two journals, about 30–40 % of papers did not provide location data. About 50 % of papers did not provide period data. There were no significant differences between the two journals, in these regards. Only about a third of the papers provided both location and period data.
Conclusion
During 2017–2018, most authors of papers in the IJP and the IJPM did not provide location and/or period data in their papers. The instructions to contributors for these journals and, in fact, all journals, therefore need to inform authors that such information must be included in submitted manuscripts."

Depression is a serious mental health issue and a major concern among middle-aged women, especially during the menopause transition time. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of depression among the middle-aged women of the menopause transition in Dhaka.
Methodology
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 41 to 60 years older women in Dhaka city using a multistage cluster sampling technique and face to face interview.
Result
In total 326 middle-aged women participated in the study, and among them, 30.4% had major depression. No statistically significant association was observed between menopause status and major depression. However, peri-(34.2%) and post-menopausal (33.3%) groups were more depressed compared to pre-menopausal (26.8%) groups. Our adjusted analysis indicates, marital status (p = 0.004), having salaried job (p < 0.001), number of offspring (p = 0.003), sedentary hours (p = 0.002), smoking habit (p = 0.012), hypertension (p = 0.012), chronic disease other than diabetes/hypertension (p = 0.006), vasomotor symptoms (p = 0.004) and sleep problem (p = 0.007) were significantly associated with depression status.
Conclusion
The study result indicates a high prevalence of major depression among middle-aged Bangladeshi women during the menopause transition. Therefore, depression should be routinely evaluated among middle-aged women for the monitoring and prevention of depression."

These changes may contribute to the development of schizophrenia and associate with psychotic genes. However, specific metabolic changes of brain sub-regions in individuals at risk have still been controversial. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the brain metabolic changes including glutamate, Glx, GABA, GABA/Glx, NAA, Cr, MI and Cho levels in individuals at risk by conducting a case-control meta-analysis and meta-regression of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies. Primary outcomes revealed that individuals at risk exhibited increased Cr levels at the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC), decreased NAA and Cr levels at the thalamus, and increased MI levels at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Sub-group analyses further indicated that individuals with clinical high-risk (CHR) exhibited increased Cr levels at the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and decreased Glx levels at the thalamus, while individuals with genetic risk (siblings of psychiatric patients) exhibited significant increased Glx and MI levels at the mPFC. However, GABA, GABA/Glx and Cho levels showed no significant result. These findings suggest that the dysfunctional metabolites at the mPFC and the thalamus may be an essential neurobiological basis at the early stage of psychosis."

However, little is known about how adolescents in these countries conceptualise mental health and its determinants which is essential to informing effective responses. This study aimed to explore how adolescents in Indonesia (a populous and rapidly developing country) conceptualise mental health and what they identify as important determinants. Eight focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 86 Indonesian adolescents (aged 16–18 years), sampled from schools and community settings from Jakarta and South Sulawesi. FGDs were recorded, transcribed, translated and thematically analysed. Mental health was recognised as a significant concern by adolescents in Indonesia. Good mental health was conceptualised as emotional wellbeing and happiness. By contrast, poor mental health was predominantly described in terms of substantial mental illness manifesting as behavioural and physical disturbance. Further, poor mental health only happened to ‘other’ people, with stigmatising views prevalent. Absent from the discussions were common symptoms of poor mental health (stress, loneliness, poor sleep) and common mental disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety) or a conceptualisation that reflected poor mental health to be a normal human experience. Discussions around determinants of poor mental health suggested that family connections (particularly with parents), school pressures, and adverse exposures on social media were important drivers of poor mental health, with religion also surfacing as an important determinant. In highlighting mental health as an important issue for Indonesian adolescents, this study provides a foundation for targeted responses."

Occurrence of any life event including reproductive life events in the year before the onset of OCD was assessed using the Interview of Recent Life Events (IRLE). Reproductive life events in the year prior to onset of OCD were overrepresented in women compared to men. Postpartum onset and worsening of OCD was reported in 14 % and 11 % of women respectively. Menarche and menopause as life events were infrequently reported (3% and 1%). Symmetry obsessions and ordering compulsions were more common in women with post-partum onset of OCD than those without. Post-partum period seems to be associated with onset and exacerbation of OCD; therefore, routine screening for OCD during this period is necessary."

Participants were assessed on Screening for Somatoform Disorders Instrument, Beck’s Depression Inventory, Somatosensory Amplification Scale, Whitley Index, Twenty-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale-Hindi version, Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill Scale, World Health Organization-Quality of Life Scale-BREF version (Hindi) and Indian Disability Evaluation and Assessment Scale.

In the present study, we investigated the relationship between CTLA4 mRNA expression and SCZ. We examined the expression of CTLA4 mRNA in blood from patients with SCZ, bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). We compared 50 SCZ subjects, 46 BD subjects, and 63 MDD subjects with age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to examine CTLA4 mRNA expression in peripheral blood using TaqMan probes. Levels of CTLA4 mRNA expression were significantly lower in patients with SCZ compared with HCs (p < 0.001), whereas no differences were found between affective disorder (BD and MDD) patients and HCs. We analyzed the correlation between CTLA4 mRNA expression and clinical parameters, but no significant correlation was found. The expression of CTLA4 mRNA was lower specifically in SCZ, suggesting that abnormal CTLA4 expression may be particularly related to the pathogenesis of SCZ. CTLA4 may be a useful diagnostic marker and a potential therapeutic target of SCZ."

However, it is unclear whether similar brain changes are also found in individuals with high schizo-obsessive traits (SOT), high schizotypal traits (SCT) and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS). We examined grey matter volume (GMV) and white matter integrity (WMI, including fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity) in 26 individuals with high SOT, 30 individuals with high SCT, 25 individuals with OCS and 30 individuals with low trait scores (LT) in this study. Correlation analysis between GMV, WMI, Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) scores and Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) scores in the subclinical groups was also carried out. We found that the SOT group exhibited increased GMV at the right superior occipital gyrus and the left postcentral gyrus compared with the LT group. The SCT group exhibited increased GMV at the right precentral gyrus and the bilateral cuneus compared with the LT group, and decreased fractional anisotropy at the anterior corona radiata compared with the other three groups. The OCS group exhibited increased GMV at the left superior temporal gyrus and decreased GMV at the left pre-supplementary motor area compared with the LT group. These ﬁndings highlight specific brain changes in individuals with high SOT, high SCT and OCS, and may thus provide new insights into the neurobiological changes that occur in sub-clinical populations of these disorders."

The study recruited a sample of 95 stabilized schizophrenia patients with insight impairment. Patients were divided into 2 groups of either minimal insight impairment (n = 25, PANSS G12 = 2–3) or moderate-to-severe insight impairment (n = 70, PANSS G12 ≥ 4). Patients with moderate-to-severe insight impairment displayed lower HF-HRV, clinician-rated psychosocial function, medication adherence, and working memory capacity, and higher self-reported psychosocial function and life quality, but comparable cognitive insight compared to those with minimal insight impairment. A logistic regression model predicted moderate-to-severe insight impairment based on HF-HRV values at the optimal cut-off point of 3.655, with the sensitivity and specificity 84% and 72%, respectively. HF-HRV seems a peripheral marker sensitively reflecting central pathophysiology implicated in insight impairment of schizophrenia."

However, their relative role in real world functioning has not been clarified. This study aimed to clarify the relative role of experience and expression in real world functioning, and their associations with positive symptoms and neurocognitive function. In total 107 patients with schizophrenia were enrolled. The Social Function and the Brief Negative Symptom Scales were used to evaluate the real world functioning and negative symptoms, respectively. The analysis showed that the expression factor influenced real world functioning through the experience factor. In addition, neurocognitive function affected real world functioning independent of expression and experience. These results suggested that interventions that enhance the communicative expression, such as oxytocin therapy and SST, could successfully be combined with motivational interventions, such as the cognitive behavioral therapy. In addition, real world functioning could be improved by separately performing interventions to compensate for vulnerabilities in neurocognitive function and motivation."

abstract = "Purpose
The pathways to care in children with mental health problems remain relatively unexplored. Investigating the factors that drive the pathway will help determine interventions and also draft policies for a streamlined Child and adolescent mental health service. Method Children who attended the Child Guidance Clinic sampled by WHO Pathways Encounter questionnaire. Statistical tests applied to find key influencers like gatekeepers, intermediate points of care, symptoms initiating referral, duration of untreated illness, time to arrive at appropriate care and primary diagnosis.
Results
The most common diagnostic category was externalizing disorder 51(37.5%). The gatekeepers identified were 111(81.6%) Parents/Relatives/Guardians and teachers 25 (18.3%). Academic concerns identified by teachers took a mean of 72 m (30.271) to arrive at appropriate care versus 50.4 m (23.18) when identified by Parents/Relatives/Guardians group. Significant delays were observed with Neurodevelopmental disorders arriving to care with delays up to 130.2 (70.11) months (p < 0.001) and having 64.2 (33.7) months (p < 0.001) duration of untreated illness. Externalizing disorders took a duration of 94.08 (54.17) months (p < 0.001) to arrive to appropriate care and had 54.2 (36.33) months (p < 0.001) duration of untreated illness. Teachers took longer time in detecting the indicators and this caused duration of untreated illness of 73.44 (36.05) months (p < 0.001) and a delay of 128.08 (71.23) months (p < 0.001) to arrive to appropriate care.
Conclusions
The pathways to care in children are characterized by long duration of untreated illness and undue time to care. Gatekeepers like teachers and intermediary points of care were associated with inadvertent delays along the pathway."

We recruited a consecutive sample of predominantly adult subjects (n=100), who presented to the specialty OCD Clinic with a primary diagnosis of OCD along with a suitable caregiver. Patient and family members completed measurements assessing FA along with other clinical variables of interest. Clinical variables found statistically significant in bivariate analyses (p < 0.05) were examined in multivariate linear regression analysis to determine the predictors of FA. Age, gender and marital status of the patient, contamination symptom dimension, severity of avoidance, severity scores on Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and scores on work and social adjustment scale were associated with FA in bivariate analysis. In multiple regression analysis, contamination dimension, the severity of avoidance, relationship of caregiver and poorer work and social adjustment predicted FA. Patients with poor socio-occupational functioning, severe avoidance, caregiver being spouse and contamination related symptoms are accommodated more by family members. Screening and management of FA, particularly in patients with the contamination dimension may thus help improve treatment outcome."

This review examined the efficacy of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
Methods
PubMed was searched for reports between 01 January 1996 and 31 December 2019 by using combinations of key words bipolar disorder, pregnancy, postpartum period, puerperium, prophylaxis, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, lithium, lamotrigine, valproate, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine.
Results
The present reports included a total of 256 patients using lithium (n = 143), lamotrigine (n = 73), valproate (n = 17), olanzapine (n = 17), quetiapine (n = 4) and haloperidol (n = 1) during pregnancy or the postpartum period. Recurrence rates in pregnant patients using lithium (n = 79) and lamotrigine (n = 17) were 22.7 % and 41.2 %, respectively. According to very limited data, none of the patients using valproate (n = 2), quetiapine (n = 3) or olanzapine (n = 6) experienced a new episode during pregnancy. A recurrence was reported in 12 (70.6 %) of 17 patients using valproate during the postpartum period. The same recurrence rates in patients using lithium (n = 123), lamotrigine (n = 63), olanzapine (n = 17) and quetiapine (n = 3) were 20.3 %, 7.9 %, 11.7 %, and 33.3 %, respectively.
Conclusions
This review suggests that lithium, lamotrigine and olanzapine seem to be effective in preventing new mood episodes in patients with bipolar disorder during the perinatal period."

Previous studies have evaluated the effect of multidisciplinary outreach services on readmission prevention, but results were inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted a single-centre, retrospective, propensity score-matched cohort study to determine whether multidisciplinary outreach services for people with first-episode schizophrenia effectively prevent readmission in Japanese real-world settings. We adjusted potential confounding factors prospectively collected for another study. The primary outcome measure was days until readmission. We used data from 124 people with first-episode schizophrenia for matching and included 86 matched patients in the analyses; 43 patients with multidisciplinary outreach services and 43 without. The result showed that the percentage of patients not readmitted with and without multidisciplinary outreach services were 77% and 72% at 6 months, 63% and 67% at 12 months, and 53% and 67% at 18 months. Although not statistically significant, the risk of compulsory readmission was less in the group with multidisciplinary outreach services than in the group without. In conclusion, we failed to demonstrate that our hospital-based multidisciplinary outreach service had a significant effect on first-episode schizophrenia patients following their first hospitalisation. Improved treatment adherence in the group with multidisciplinary outreach services could be a reason for our insignificant readmission results. Larger real-world studies with detailed confounding data would be needed to confirm our results."

However, given the topic’s multifacetedness, no single explanation is found sufficient in itself. ‘Silencing the Self’ theory sheds new light on this issue because it acknowledges the importance of social and cultural processes. Besides with its relational perspective, it centers on the primacy of core relationships and its influence on a woman’s mental health. Even though, since its inception three decades ago, the theory has been studied in relation to various psychological and physical disorders; it has hitherto received inadequate attention by scholars. Nonetheless, it has the potential to inform our understanding when formulating women’s mental health issues. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive narrative account of the extant work on ‘silencing the self’ in relation to psychiatric illnesses like depression, eating disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It attempts to synthesize the work done till date, as a starting point for further investigation of unexamined areas."

There is robust research evidence particularly from LMICs to state that interventions delivered by non-specialist lay counsellors at the grass root level is emerging as an effective alternative to address the large treatment gaps.MAMTA Health Institute for mother and child(HIMC) is a pioneer organization in the field of RMNCH+A. Against this background, MAMTA HIMC explored the feasibility of remote training level health workers in the delivery of simple psycho social interventions for women in the perinatal period. Philips PAN India is a project at MAMTAHIMC which attempts to task shift expert mental health services to front line workers by interspersing simple psycho services into the framework of routine RMCH+A services. The paper aims to (1) Describe the experience of remote training of persons with no previous knowledge or experience of mental health to recognize mental health problems and deliver psychosocial services at the grassroot level 2) Discuss the impact and acceptability of the training.The paper recommends using non- specialized strategies, digital platforms, engaging community level human resources and low cost resources as opposed to complex conventional psychotherapies."

Generated abstracts were grouped according to their thematic focus and summarized. A total of 49 articles were reviewed. Articles directly evaluating cyberchondria were very few and most of the treatment evidence was extrapolated from trials on health anxiety. Cyberchondria appears to be a phenomenologically overlapping entity with, yet distinguishable from, health anxiety and there may be merit in studying the two constructs separately. Four validated self-assessment measures for cyberchondria are available in literature. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) delivered either physically or through the internet (iCBT) have been found to be effective for both health anxiety and cyberchondria. Pharmacologic strategies for health anxiety have mainly involved the use of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, with mean effective dosages higher than for depression/anxiety. Prevention of cyberchondria needs to focus on appropriate harm reduction strategies as well as supply and demand side measures. Internet based CBT therapies hold promise for management of cyberchondria. This finding must be considered preliminary due to limited evidence. Further study is required to establish the diagnostic validity of cyberchondria."

The inpatients' drug prescriptions at discharge and after one-year outpatient follow-up, as well as treatment compliance and re-hospitalization, were examined. The mean duration of illness was 109.3 ± 109.7 months, and the mean duration of hospitalization was 24.6 ± 19.1 days. For a total of 599 patients, multiple antipsychotic medication was used in 21.2% of hospitalizations. 11.2% of patients using single antipsychotic and 14.2% of patients using multiple antipsychotics were re-hospitalized within one year (X 2 :0.830, p:0.362). Disease duration (Z:-3.654, p < 0.001) and duration of hospitalization (Z:-3.333, p < 0.001) were found to be longer in multiple antipsychotic users. 37.8% of the patients used a depot antipsychotic. There was no significant difference between depot antipsychotic use and oral antipsychotic use as it related re-hospitalization rates. As a conclusion, multiple antipsychotic use has reduced in Turkey. Contrary to popular belief, the use of multiple antipsychotics does not shorten, but rather may prolongs hospitalization, and it has no effect in reducing re-hospitalization. Drug combinations are generally used together with a depot treatment, clozapine treatment is preferred less frequently in combinations, clinicians have proven effectiveness of the drug combination they prefer, and they should give priority to the treatments recommended in treatment guidelines."

The increase was significant beginning at mild AD (p = 0.006) with an inverse correlation with HMSE scores (p = 0.0344), thus implying that prolidase mediated alterations in ECM may be associated with the cognitive deficits seen in AD."

Studies that reported prevalence of smoking cessation were synthesized using a random-effects model. Fourteen studies were included. The pooled prevalence of smoking cessation among schizophrenia patients was 14.0 % (95 % CI: 9.2–18.8 %; I2 = 97.3 %). Compared with schizophrenia patients, both healthy controls (OR = 0.45, 95 % CI:0.38−0.54, p < 0.001) and controls with other psychiatric disorders (OR = 0.79, 95 % CI:0.63−0.99, p = 0.004) had significantly higher prevalence of cessation. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses found that year of survey (after 2005), duration of smoking cessation (<6 months), outpatient setting and poor study quality were significantly associated with higher prevalence of smoking cessation. This meta-analysis found that the prevalence of smoking cessation was significantly lower among schizophrenia patients compared to healthy control and those with other psychiatric disorders. Better understanding of the barriers to smoking cessation and more effective measures for quitting smoking should be developed for patients with schizophrenia."

Among 2591 citations, a total of 23 reviews met all the criteria of this umbrella review. The synthesized findings from those reviews suggest high prevalence rates for mental disorders, including depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, suicidal behavior and self-harm, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, dementia, and other mental health problems. Also, findings suggest a high burden of maternal depression, psychiatric comorbidities in chronic physical illnesses, and various mental disorders among children, elderly adults, refugees, and other vulnerable populations. Most studies were from India whereas evidence from Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Maldives was limited. The findings of this review are constrained with heterogeneity in prevalence estimations, methodologies, sampling issues, and limitations in the existing literature, which should be addressed in future research. The evidence synthesized in this review provides national and regional overview of the prevalence of mental disorders, which may inform better policymaking and practice advancing mental health in South Asia."

abstract = "Background
Early interventions are important for improving outcome in autism. However, the diagnosis of autism is often delayed for 3–4 years, which leads to missed opportunities to initiate early intensive behavioural interventions, thus jeopardizing its prognosis. The lack of knowledge among healthcare workers about the features of autism is postulated to be the main reason for this delay.
Methodology
A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among the PHMs in the Colombo and Kalutara districts of the Western Province, Sri Lanka. A specifically designed self-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information about the socio-demographic details. The knowledge about the signs and symptoms and common comorbidities of ASD were assessed using the "Knowledge about Childhood Autism among Health Workers (KCAHW) Questionnaire".
Results
Out of 406 participants, 56.9 % (n = 231) were from the Colombo District. The mean knowledge of the participants on the “Knowledge about Childhood Autism among Health Workers (KCAHW) Questionnaire” was 13.23/19 (SD = 2.647). The knowledge was significantly higher in those who had participated in training programmes on autism (p < 0.01) and in those who have had contact with a child with autism (p < 0.05). Of the participants, 17.2 % (n = 70) believed that autism could be completely cured. 43.6 % and 42.2 % believed that poor attention from parents and parental conflicts during pregnancy and early childhood caused autism in children respectively.
Conclusion
The knowledge of PHMs on autism is inadequate, with regard to the comorbidities, aetiology and treatment options. In service programmes are useful in improving the knowledge of PHMs on autism."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with hypertension and to evaluate the association of MCI with metabolic syndrome (MetS).
Methodology
186 subjects with hypertension were evaluated on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for cognitive decline and depression, respectively and MetS was diagnosed as per the Consensus definition.
Results
The prevalence of MCI was 65.6 % and that of MetS was 45.7 %. Compared to those without MetS, those with MetS had significantly poorer cognitive functioning on the all cognitive domain of the MoCA, even after controlling for age, education, severity of the depression and duration of illness. Low High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) was found to have a positive correlation with MoCA. Higher age, lower education, higher duration of illness and use of higher numbers of medications were associated with significantly lower score on MoCA.
Conclusion
Presence of MetS among persons with hypertension is associated with cognitive decline. Hence, there is a need to monitor and manage other parameters of MetS among patients with hypertension, to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and future dementia."

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ACEs on depression, psychological distress and suicidal thought among Vietnamese adolescents across different areas in Vietnam. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted among 4957 secondary school and high school students aged 13–20 in urban area, rural area, border area and mountainous area. The students were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire which included the Center for Epidemiological studies – Depression, the Kessler-10 and ACE questionnaire from the WHO Adverse Childhood Experiences Study. Suicidal thought was evaluated by a single question from the U.S. Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Among 4720 students included in the analysis, 54.4% were female. The prevalence of depression, psychological distress and suicidal thought was 22.9%, 30.6% and 10.9% respectively. About 86% of participants experienced at least one type of ACEs and nearly 56% reported multiple types of ACEs. Students with four or more types of ACEs had 6.98 (95% CI 5.09 –9.56), 4.72 (95 % CI 3.58–6.23) and 6.43 (95 % CI 4.45–9.30) times higher in odds of having depression, psychological distress and suicidal thought respectively. In conclusion, ACEs are common in Vietnamese adolescents and are strongly associated with depression, psychological distress and suicidal thought. Our finding indicates urgent needs for interventions targeting both ACEs and depression, psychological distress in Vietnamese adolescents."

They were administered the following subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale: logical memory (immediate and delayed), verbal paired association (immediate and delayed), digit span and spatial span as well as the Rey–Osterrieth complex figure test (RCFT). The results showed that BDD and OCD groups had lower performance in comparison to the control group across all measures, except for the immediate memory of the verbal paired associate task, which was similar across the three groups. Both the BDD and OCD groups showed poor performance on the auditory-verbal memory tasks. However, only the BDD group showed poor performance in the visual domain (i.e. spatial span and RCFT). This suggest that memory deficits are similar between BDD and OCD patients in the verbal domain. Furthermore, BDD patients demonstrated poorer visual working memory. The findings of this study reveal that BDD and OCD patients have more similarities than differences regarding neuropsychological features, in other words, the idea of the incorporation of BDD within the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) spectrum in DSM-5 is supported, at least through the viewpoint of neuropsychology."

abstract = "Background
The effect of antipsychotics adherence on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among schizophrenia patients has not been studied. While antipsychotic adherence is favorable for all-cause mortality, its association with CVD incidence is unclear due to the potential risk of CVD caused by antipsychotics.
Methods
Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service Database, we constructed a case-cohort of 80,581 newly-diagnosed schizophrenia patients between 2004 and 2013 from a cohort of all Koreans 20–40 years old. Patients were divided into quartiles by adherence determined by their two-year medication possession ratio. Patients were followed from two years following the diagnosis of schizophrenia until Dec. 31st, 2017 for the primary outcome of incident CVD and secondary outcomes of stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed adjusting for conventional risk factors.
Outcomes
Newly diagnosed schizophrenia patients were followed for a median of 7.0 years resulting in 1396 incident CVD cases over 5.73 × 105 person-years. When adjusted for potential confounders, the best adherence quartile group had significantly lower risk of CVD (HR, 95%CI; 0.78, 0.66−0.92; p-trend, 0.003), stroke (HR, 95%CI; 0.79, 0.66−0.94; p-trend, 0.015), and all-cause mortality (HR, 95%CI; 0.86, 0.78−0.95; p-trend, 0.003) compared to the worst adherent quartile group. Subgroup analysis by antipsychotics generation, concurrent medication, and comorbidities did not significantly alter results.
Interpretation
Among newly diagnosed schizophrenia patients, better adherence to antipsychotics lowered the risk CVD incidence despite previously suggested antipsychotic-associated CVD risk. Thus, efforts to improve antipsychotics adherence may improve CVD outcomes in schizophrenia patients."

The productivity of women authors in the field of mental health in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC) is not known. This study aims to explore women’s mental health research productivity in GCC countries.
Methods
The authors searched five databases for published articles from the GCC region in the field of mental health between 2015−2019. The gender of the authors was inferred from the first name. The authors examined the qualified articles for women authorship, h-index, and research design.
Results
The cumulative proportion of articles with women authors was 41.6 %. There was a significant difference across the countries; Bahrain has the highest percentage (79.3 %), while Oman had the lowest (33.8 %); p < 0.05. Out of the 428 articles that included at least one-woman author, 184 articles (43.0 %) had a woman first author, and 149 (30.4 %) had a woman as a senior author, the countries’ variations were significant; p < 0.05. The majority of women authors, except Qatar, were affiliated to academic institutes. The mean h-index of GCC women authors was 4. Descriptive research was the most common research design in most countries apart from Qatar, where experimental research was dominant.
Discussion
This is the first study to review GCC women’s research productivity in the field of mental health. Given the relatively short history of medical education and research in the region, the results appear promising, and the data generated shall serve as a foundation to promote further studies in the field."

Reduced cerebellar volumes and altered cerebellocerebral structural covariance have been reported in patients with schizophrenia. However, it is not clear whether such altered cerebellocerebral structural covariance would be observed before the onset of psychosis. We examined brain structural changes, including cerebral and cerebellar volumes, and cerebellocerebral structural covariance in individuals with attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS).
Materials and methods
Twenty-one individuals with APS and 24 healthy controls (HC) were recruited and underwent structural MRI brain scan. Differences in voxel-based grey matter (GM) volume and cerebellar volume between the APS and HC groups were examined. The correlation between cerebellar volumes and voxel-based cerebral GM volumes were calculated to measure cerebellocerebral structural covariance in each group followed by group comparisons.
Results
Compared with HC, individuals with APS exhibited extensive GM volume reduction in the frontal and striatal areas and reduced cerebellar volume. Structural covariance analysis indicated that the anterior and posterior parts of the cerebellum showed disparate correlation with cerebral voxel-based GM volumes. Abnormal cerebellar-cerebral correlation was also found in individuals with APS at the medial prefrontal gyrus.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that prefrontal and striatal structural changes as well as cerebellar structural covariance at the medial prefrontal gyrus may underpin the risk for psychosis and may serve as a potential target for early intervention in individuals at-risk for psychosis."

In line with the introduction of universal health coverage in 2014, the Indonesian government plans to redress this by delegating detection and early intervention of mental health services to health practitioners without specialist training in mental health, however, there is limited evidence that they can perform this role effectively. This study aims to evaluate current workforce capacity by assessing differences in mental health literacy between Indonesian mental health and non-mental health practitioners. Compared to non-mental health practitioners, mental health practitioners are significantly less likely to hold stigmatising views towards individuals with mental illness. They are also significantly more likely to correctly recognise symptoms of depression and schizophrenia and recommend and implement evidence-based interventions for these conditions. These findings suggest that task-shifting is unlikely to be an effective solution to reduce the mental health treatment gap, and it is recommended that mental health system reform in Indonesia should initially focus on expansion and retention of the specialist mental health workforce."

Neurocognitive dysfunction with buprenorphine has mixed evidence, with many confounding factors. We compared the neurocognitive functions in patients with opioid dependence on buprenorphine maintenance (Index Group; IG) with those on naltrexone (NG), opioid-dependent in early detoxification (OD), and healthy control (CG).
Materials & Methods
The four groups were matched for age, sex, and years of education. Except for the healthy control group (CG; n = 30), the two other comparison groups had twenty participants each. Subjects with other substance use disorders, HIV infection, head injury, epilepsy, and severe mental illness were excluded. Cognitive tests consisted of Trail Making Tests (TMT-A & B), Digit Vigilance test (DVT), verbal and visual N-Back Test (NBT), Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWA), and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS).
Results
IG performed significantly worse in TMT-B, DVT, verbal NBT, and WCST (non-perseverative error) than CG. When IQ was controlled for, significance persisted in TMT-B, a marker of poor cognitive flexibility. The OD showed significantly poorer performance than NG and CG in the TMT-A & B, visual and verbal NBT, DVT, and RAVLT. When compared to the IG, the performance of the OD was significantly poor in the TMT-A & B. IG performed worse than NG in TMT-B, and NG performed poorer (than CG) in RAVLT.
Conclusion
Patients on medication-assisted treatment had significant cognitive impairment limited to fewer cognitive domains, however, the extent and severity were highest in the group with active opioid dependence."

Little attention has been devoted so far to this topic from policymakers, stakeholders and researchers, resulting in a lack of replicable, scalable and applicable frameworks to help plan, develop and deliver MH care during pandemics. As a response, we have attempted to develop a conceptual framework (CF) that could guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of MH interventions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This CF was developed by early career psychiatrists from 16 countries that cover all the WHO regions. Their opinions were elicited via a semi-structured questionnaire. They were asked to provide their views about the current MH situation in their countries and to elaborate on existing 'myths' and misinformation. They were also asked to name the resources available and to propose solutions and approaches to provide accessible and affordable care. The CF was prepared based on the extant literature and the views discussed in this group; it illustrates the epidemiology of MH problems, preparedness plans, stage-specific plans or innovative solutions, opportunities to integrate those plans and possible outcomes at policy level. This CF can serve as a technical guide for future research regarding pandemics. It can be used to monitor trends and to optimize efforts, and to develop evidence based MH interventions. Still, further research focusing on the individual components of this framework is needed."

Control and emotional violence were the most commonly reported form of violence, followed by physical violence, and sexual violence was the least reported. Significant association of IPV with suicidal behaviour, depression scores, physical health and somatic symptoms were found. IPV is prevalent in women with SMI and needs to be addressed. It is important to assess all types of IPV as it can impact the illness and the lives of these women, overall."

abstract = "Objective
The effects of childhood infection exposure on the risk of subsequent psychosis are unclear and no overview is available. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the link between childhood infection and the risk of psychosis in later life.
Methods
We performed systematic searches of the PubMed and Embase databases to identify relevant articles published up to March 1, 2020. Random-effects models were used to pool the odds ratios [OR] of childhood infection and later psychosis.
Results
Thirteen observational studies (seven on hospital exposure to infection and six on central nervous system (CNS) infection) were included in the meta-analysis. Hospital contact with any infection during childhood was associated with an increased risk of psychosis (OR, 1.27; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.13–1.44; p < 0.001; I2 = 84 %) or schizophrenia (OR, 1.44; 95 % CI, 1.19–1.73; p < 0.001; I2 = 54.2 %) later in life. In further analysis, the association also existed for children exposed to CNS infection (OR, 1.68; 95 % CI, 1.08–2.62; p = 0.021; I2 = 68.7 %). However, the risk was modulated by the timing and frequency of infection.
Conclusions
Our results suggest an increased risk of psychosis later in life with infection exposure in childhood. However, non-causal explanations for the association cannot be ruled out."

abstract = "Objectives
We aimed to analyze the mental health status of incarcerated offenders in the detention centers and related factors; and introduce psychological resilience, self-acceptance and perceived social support for further analyses, to explore the relationships between them and mental health in these special populations.
Methods
Incarcerated offenders in two detention centers of Guangdong province were recruited. General demographic questionnaire, Self-acceptance Questionnaire (SAQ), Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), Connor and Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-20) were addressed to the participants for investigation. Pearson correlation analysis, multiple linear regression and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were used to identify the associations and related factors.
Results
Scores for GHQ-20, CD-RISC, SAQ and PSSS were 7.72 ± 4.49, 57.85 ± 17.30, 40.94 ± 5.40 and 42.99 ± 9.90, respectively. Some socio-demographic factors influenced significantly to the mental health status. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors, the scores of self-acceptance (B = -0.23, P < 0.001), perceived social support (B = -0.10, P < 0.001) and psychological resilience (B = -0.06, P < 0.001) were negatively associated with scores of mental health. Further SEM analyses suggested self-acceptance and resilience had not only mediating effects respectively, but also multiple mediating effects between perceived social support and mental health (r = -0.11, P < 0.01; r = -0.12, P < 0.01; r = -0.04, P < 0.01).
Conclusion
The levels of mental health, psychological resilience, self-acceptance and perceived social support among incarcerated offenders are generally low, and influenced by socio-demographic factors. In addition, self-acceptance, perceived social support and resilience are protective factors for mental health status of offenders; and self-acceptance and resilience mediate the association between perceived social support and mental health."

We examined the genetic and environmental contributions to internalizing, externalizing, and general psychopathological distress to clarify the role of individual/parental risk factors for suicide in young adults. Data from 1206 young adults were obtained from a publicly available dataset from the Human Connectome Project. Heritability estimates were analyzed by twin modelling using OpenMx and data from a subsample of 402 monozygotic and dizygotic twins. The estimated prevalence of psychopathological symptoms ranged from 9 to 16%. The heritability of internalizing, externalizing, and general psychopathological distress reached significance, with estimates ranging from 22 to 46%. Shared (common) environments contributed to aggressive behavior (30 %). Determining factors for psychopathological distress (internalizing, externalizing, general) were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. Household income (<$50,000), childhood conduct problems, and maternal drug or alcohol problems were common risk factors of internalizing, externalizing, and general psychopathological distress. Marijuana dependence and maternal anxiety were additional risk factors of externalizing distress. The presence of alcohol and maternal drug or alcohol problems was linked to general psychopathological distress. The results highlight risk factors associated with psychopathological symptoms that should be considered in the early detection of high-risk groups and implementation of family-based interventions. Providing continuous care and/or follow-up in at-risk children and young adults may improve mental health and well-being."

Impaired empathy has been reported in both individuals with schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Despite overlaps, few studies have directly examined the neural mechanisms of impaired empathy in these two clinical groups. We used resting-state fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of empathic functioning in adolescents with ASD (N = 11), early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) (N = 20), and typically developing (TD) controls (N = 26). Their parents completed the Griffith Empathy Measure (GEM) to assess the adolescents’ empathic capacity. We found that EOS and ASD participants both exhibited impaired empathy as measured by the GEM, especially in cognitive empathy (post-hoc ps < 0.05). Regions-of-interest-based functional connectivity revealed decreased connectivity between the salience network (SN) (i.e., the anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex) and core regions of the mentalizing network (e.g., the temporal-parietal junction and the precuneus), and among the SN and the bilateral superior temporal gyri (STG) and the left cerebellum in EOS participants. Subsequent comparisons revealed reduced grey matter volume in the STG bilaterally in both clinical groups. Increased resting-state functional connectivity within the social brain network was correlated with higher parent-reported scores of empathic capacity in TD adolescents, but such a brain-phenotype relationship was absent in the two clinical groups. These findings indicate that structural alterations and disturbed resting-state functional connectivity in the core empathy network may be the neural correlates of social cognitive deficits in individuals with EOS and ASD."

As a matter of fact, debiasing techniques which help medical students/residents become aware of the fact that they might be easily influenced by the frame used in scientific data, have started to be implemented in medical teaching programs. It is important to incorporate exercises that improve debiasing skills in the curriculum at all levels of medical education. An example of such exercises is decontextualization which consists of improving problem-solving in a non-medical context in order to consolidate the use of the same schema of critical thinking in a medical context afterwards."

In this context, four North Korean medical journals were selected from the Information Center on North Korea, with publication dates 2006–2017 (inclusive). For this bibliographic study’s scope, we targeted studies on psychiatric problems in humans. We first selected articles based on their titles, and then finalized the study sample after reviewing the full text of primary sample articles. For main outcome measures, we used the absolute number and proportion of mental health research articles relative to total publications and the distribution of papers by research themes as defined by ICD-10 categories. Collectively, four journals published 162 mental health research articles from 2006 to 2017. The yearly volume and proportion varied between two and twenty-four and between 0.3 % and 2.7 %, respectively. The most frequently addressed ICD-10 category was F40–48, namely ‘Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders,’ and the most frequently investigated condition was somatoform disorders. In conclusion, there has been a slow but steady increase in the research volume of psychiatry and mental health problems since 2011. The finding that the highest amount of research was conducted on somatoform disorders may suggest that mental disorder symptoms may be represented differently under the influence of socialism in North Korea."

The reliability and validity of the Griffiths Development Scales-Chinese (GDS-C) for autistic children in China are unknown. Thus, it is urgent to verify the instrument’s reliability and validity in this population. The aim of the study was to explore whether the GDS-C is reliable and valid for assessing neurodevelopment in autistic children.
Method
This study included 296 autistic children and 141 typically developing children from 3 to 8 years of age in China. The reliability of the scale was estimated based on its internal consistency, test-retest reliability and interrater reliability. The validity of the scale was calculated based on the construct validity, discriminate validity and criterion validity. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to calculate the general quotients (GQs) corresponding to the diagnostic classification within the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) scores.
Results
This study shows sufficient reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.957; test–retest reliability = 0.945 for the whole scale and 0.830–0.919 for the subscales; interrater reliability = 0.925 for the whole scale and 0.796–0.919 for the subscales). The results also provide good support for the validity of the GDS-C. In the discriminant analysis, 85.5% of the children in the autistic sample were correctly classified. The cutoff value for distinguishing autistic children from normal children within the CARS scale corresponds to a GQ of 84.83, and that for distinguishing severely autistic children from mild or moderately autistic children corresponds to a GQ of 66.60.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that the GDS-C may be a valid and reliable tool for assessing the neurodevelopment of autistic children."

To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province. Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures. Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio. Results also revealed that young people aged 21–40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use. To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.)."

Using Weber’s argument, this paper discusses the ambivalent relationship psychiatry has with technology. On one hand, based on the historical roots of the specialty and the influence of psychodynamic psychotherapy, psychiatrists believe themselves to be masters of the invisible space between physicians and their patients. They claim to have the skills and insight that enable them to establish a unique kind of relationship in which communication not only allows them to diagnose, but also to heal through a variety of psychotherapeutic techniques. As a result, many psychiatrists are wary of the introduction of technology into therapeutic setting and the potential for this type of communication to be disrupted or diminished in value, often basing their concern on the ways in which technology has been witnessed to be “disenchanting” in other medical specialties. On the other hand, others see the future practice of psychiatry best guided through whole-hearted embrace of brain-based medical technology, which has been stunted by the complexity of the brain and relative lack of research funding compared to other medical specialties. This discussion within the field is timely, as on the horizon lies the holy grail of technological advancement for psychiatric practice: definitive biomarkers to diagnose mental illness and provide individualized treatments."

Despite its significance, social decision making in schizophrenia (SCZ) has not been adequately examined. Hence, we examined social decision making in SCZ using the Ultimatum Game(UG), a neuroeconomic paradigm that involves financial transactions between a proposer and a responder to split a sum of money between them. Thirty male patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia as per DSM-IV (age = 30 ± 7.08) and thirty age-matched healthy male volunteers (HV;age = 28.48 ± 3.74) participated in the study. All participants functioned as responders and had to either accept or reject offers made by an anonymous proposer. We also examined whether the gender or emotional expression of the proposer influenced acceptance rates. SCZ had significantly lower acceptance rates than HV for slightly unequal offers (t = 3.94, p = < 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference between SCZ and HV for other offers. Gender and emotional expression of the proposer did not significantly influence the outcome. These results suggest aberrant social decision making and increased inequity aversion in patients with SCZ. The difficulty in incorporating social components while engaging in financial interactions could have important implications for rehabilitation, functional recovery, and successful community living in SCZ."

This research examines the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its related factors in students whose school burned down, one month and six months after the incident.
Methods
A total of 56 students from grades one through six were invited to participate in this study with permission from their parents. Subjects were screened for PTSD by using UCLA PTSD Reaction Index (DSM-5 Version) during three periods: 1, 6, and 12 months after the incident. Children diagnosed with PTSD were interviewed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist to confirm their diagnosis and obtain related factors. Percentage and logistic regression were used for statistical evaluation. 5 out of the 56 students (8.9 %) had PTSD one month after the incident, 2 of them recovered after six months. 6 out of 56 students (10.7 %) had PTSD at six months and 2 of 40 (5%) had PTSD at one year after the incident. Students who lived in the school’s dorms had significantly more PTSD than those who lived elsewhere, p < 0.01, RR = 5.16 (4.04–6.6). After one year, age was the only factor related to PTSD (p = 0.01, odds ratio = 0.452).
Conclusion
Post-traumatic stress disorder is a common disorder in children after a disaster. Although some can recover shortly after an incident, others develop symptoms one month after the incident. Age is a risk factor that can lead to the development of PTSD."

The study population consisted of patients diagnosed with BPAD and who are currently in remission. Anxiety symptoms among BPAD patients were assessed using the DASS-21 anxiety subscale and QOL was assessed using WHOQoL-BREF. Medications and severity of illness related information were gathered from both the patent and from their medical records. The study population consisted of 145 patients. The prevalence of anxiety among patients with BPAD who are currently in remission was 48.3 % (95 %CI 40.0–56.6). Multiple logistic regression revealed that being anxious was independently associated with currently not being married (aOR 2.92) and currently not being employed (aOR 2.1). Presence of anxiety significantly reduced the QOL in all the domains. Having anxiety was significantly associated with having one or more relapses within the past three years (aOR 4.1), one or more hospital admissions within the past three years (aOR 6.1), needing more psychoactive medications to maintain a euthymic state (aOR 7.7), and one or more suicidal attempts in the past (aOR 6.5). Anxiety was highly prevalent among patients with BPAD. Those with anxiety experienced significantly lower QOL and were found to be having significantly high adverse outcomes from the disease."

Tapentadol is a synthetic opioid analgesic available in India since 2011. International evidence suggests a low risk of abuse and diversion. Our study aims to question this perception in Indian context.
Method
We report the trend and profile of Tapentadol abuse cases that were treated at a tertiary level addiction treatment centre in southern India. We also describe the ease of repurposing oral tablets of Tapentadol into an injection. At the national level, we have examined the temporal and spatial trends of online interest in Tapentadol and compared it with a non-opioid drug Ilaprazole and an opioid drug Tramadol using Google Trends. We have used the National Drug Use Survey 2019 to illustrate the regional data.
Results
23 cases of Tapentadol abuse sought treatment between 01/01/2011 and 30/08/2019. In last one year, the number of cases has more than doubled. A majority (N = 19, 83 %) of cases had intravenous Tapentadol abuse, needle sharing and 60 % were diagnosed with Hepatitis C. Tapentadol is attracting new users (N = 13, 56.5 %) as well as replacing other opioids (N = 10, 43.5 %) amongst drug users. Tapentadol has received more online interest than Ilaprazole. Temporal and spatial trends of online interest in Tapentadol parallel Tramadol. States with high prevalence of opioid users have shown high online interest in both opioid drugs.
Conclusion
Tapentadol is being widely abused, and urgent regulatory measures are required."

To review the published literature on clozapine associated cardiotoxicity (CACT), summarize diagnostic features, and evaluate monitoring procedures for safe clozapine re-challenge.
Results
Clozapine-associated Myocarditis (CAM) - Incidence of early myocarditis (≤2 months) is infrequent but serious. Clinical diagnosis is confounded by variability in presentation and non-specificity of symptoms. Re-challenge considerations include clozapine impact on symptomatic severity and associated disability and risk of suicidality. Re-challenging is recommended only after full clinical resolution of myocarditis and cardiac function impairment, under closely controlled conditions, starting at very low dosage, extremely slow titration and frequent assays of lab and cardio biomarkers. Clozapine associated cardiomyopathy (CAC) -develops later but mortality has been reported at 12.5–24.0%. Re-challenge is generally not recommended due to paucity of outcome data. Monitoring Cardiac Toxicity: Plausible steps include closer clinical monitoring, repeated assays of biomarkers, and echocardiographic studies, and cardiac MRI changes with unremarkable findings of cardiac dysfunction with echocardiography. Subclinical clozapine associated cardiotoxicity is more prevalent than CAM and CAC. Diagnosis is often challenging due to non specific presentation. Active monitoring is recommended. Rechallenging is feasible but should be done under close monitoring conditions. A protocol is proposed based on literature review and clinical experience in order to reduce the risk of CACT.
Conclusion
Clozapine-associated myocarditis and cardiomyopathy may have been underreported worldwide. Identification of subclinical cardiotoxic effects can improve outcomes by earlier recognition before clinical manifestations of cardiac impairments. A pragmatic close clinical monitoring protocol including cardiac biomarkers aimed at timely detection of cardiac toxicity, in the initial phase of treatment is proposed."

A mother’s behaviour towards her infant is an important aspect of assessment in postpartum severe mental illness (SMI). The existing tools for this purpose need formal training, require time and do not include certain aspects of maternal behaviour. Hence, there is a need for a tool that may overcome some of the above problems and be simple to use, especially in limited resource low and middle income countries (LAMIC) settings. The NIMHANS Maternal Behaviour Scale was constructed for this purpose.
Methods
The 16 items were compiled based on 100 detailed assessments of mother-infant dyads. The NIMBUS is rated based on observations and information from caregivers, health assistants and nurses. The scale which has six domains was administered to 51 mother-infant dyads admitted to an MBU to establish construct validity and internal consistency. Inter-rater, and test retest reliability were also established. External validity was established using the Bethlem Mother infant Interaction Scale (BMIS) and the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ).
Results
The scale was found to have adequate inter-rater and test retest reliability (Cohen’s kappa > 0.81). The Cronbach’s alpha for internal consistency was 0.94 and it showed adequate external validity when used with the BMIS (R = 0.947, p = 0.000) and PBQ.
Conclusion
The NIMBUS appears to be a useful tool to assess maternal behaviour among mothers with SMI in the postpartum especially in LAMIC situations where observations are often made by family members and health assistants rather than trained perinatal nurses."

To evaluate the incidence of clozapine induced haematological side effects among patients receiving clozapine.
Methods
Data of 333 patients who were on clozapine for a mean duration of 52.96 (45.18) months were reviewed for haematological abnormalities.
Results
Most of the patients (n = 320; 96.1 %) were diagnosed with psychotic disorders, mainly schizophrenia. These patients were receiving clozapine in the dose range of 12.5 mg–600 mg/day, with a mean dose of 212.08 (102.43) mg/day at the time of review of their records. About one-tenth (N = 33; 9.9 %) of patients developed eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count >600), and 8.2 % (N = 27) experienced thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000 cmm3) and 7 patients developed anaemia (haemoglobin level <10 gm%). Only 2 (0.6%) patients developed neutropenia. Mean dose (mg/day) at which haematological side-effects occurred were as follows: 159.85 (87.65) mg/day for eosinophilia; 193.98 (148.93) mg/day for thrombocytopenia; 78.57 (22.49) mg/day for anaemia. In a small proportion of patients, clozapine was discontinued due to the haematological abnormalities and in other patients these abnormalities normalized on its own in subsequent follow-up.
Conclusion
Clozapine is associated eosinophilia and thrombocytopenia, which are often benign and in majority of the patients these normalize with time."

abstract = "Background
Depression is a wide-spread disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Recent studies in neuroinflammation suggested that increased plasma kynurenine (KYN) level was related to depressive symptoms, while animal studies indicated that KYN increase could be caused by environmental stressor. Recent study reported that exercise may prevent stress-induced depression by enhancing KYN metabolism in muscle. This study seeks to test the effect of voluntary exercise on depressive-like behavior induced by stress and KYN in mice.
Hypothesis
Exercise prevents depressive-like behavior induced by KYN.
Results
Our study found that two weeks of voluntary exercise greatly reduced stress-induced helplessness in mice. On non-stressed mice, naïve mice injected with KYN showed increased immobile time in the TST (214 ± 30 s for KYN vs. 181 ± 33 s for saline; p < 0.05) and higher failure rate in the escape test (39 ± 31 % for KYN vs. 16 ± 13 % for saline; p < 0.05), while exercised mice were not affected by KYN injection in neither test. We also observed that exercised mice’s plasma KYN concentration (3.29 ± 1.09 u M) was as low as a quarter of that of control (12.95 ± 3.44 u M) (P < 0.01) after KYN injection. Finally, we found that exercised mice expressed more kynurenine aminotransferase III (KAT3) in the muscle than control mice (1.62 ± 0.60 folds for exercise vs. 1.00 ± 0.22 folds for control; p = 0.005)
Conclusion
Exercise promotes KAT3 expression, enhances KYN metabolism, and consequently prevents mice from stress or KYN-induced depressive-like behavior."

A growing body of literature has suggested that effective emotion regulation is influenced by cognitive function. Maintenance and manipulation of internal representations occur in working memory (WM), and impairments of WM have been reported in patients with bipolar disorder.
Methods
We examined the manipulation ability of internal representations in WM using mental rotation (MR) tasks, and compared the task performances of euthymic bipolar I disorder patients to those of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. In this study, 20 euthymic bipolar I disorder patients, 20 schizophrenia patients, and 38 healthy controls were recruited. People and letter MR tasks were employed to evaluate the ability of WM manipulation.
Results
Compared to healthy controls, euthymic bipolar I disorder patients showed substantially higher error rates of people MR task and slower responses in both people and letter MR tasks. Schizophrenia patients showed no difference in error rate and response time in MR tasks compared to healthy controls; however, they showed significantly slower responses in people MR task compared to controls. MR task performance was not different between euthymic bipolar and schizophrenia patients.
Conclusion
Our study results indicate that manipulation of internal representation, especially in the egocentric MR, is impaired in bipolar disorder even in the emotionally-stable state. We speculate that impaired imagery manipulation might be related to alterations in empathic ability, susceptibility of mental imagery, and emotion regulation strategies observed in bipolar disorder."

A total of 21 participants, ranging from early to late adolescence participated and provided multiple forms of data with 112 photographs, 21 journals on their daily interactions and one-on-one interviews facilitated using the SHOWeD model. The analytical method involved compiling visual data from photographs, journal content and interview data pertaining to each participant as a single data file, developing codes using ATLAS.ti, version 8, and further developing sub-themes and themes as they emerged into narratives. Our study was able to elicit emotions and meanings that adolescents attached to social interactions with gendered nuances specific to the Indian cultural setting.

Most primary care in Malaysia is provided by general practitioners in private practice. To date, little is known about how Malaysian General Practitioners (GPs) manage patients with depression. We surveyed privately practising primary care physicians in the state of Penang, Malaysia, in relation to their experience of the Malaysian Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) in Major Depressive Disorder, their current practice and perceived barriers in managing depression effectively.
Material and methods
A questionnaire based on the study aims and previous literature was developed by the authors and mailed to all currently registered GPs in private clinics in Penang. Survey responses were analysed using SSPS version 21.
Results
From a total of 386 questionnaires distributed, 112 (29%) were returned. Half of the respondents were unaware of the existence of any CPG for depression. One quarter reported not managing depression at all, while one third used anxiolytic monotherapy in moderate-severe depression. Almost 75 % of respondents reported making referrals to specialist psychiatric services for moderate-severe depression. Time constraints, patient non-adherence and a lack of depression management skills were perceived as the main barriers to depression care.
Conclusions
Our findings highlight the need to engage privately practising primary care physicians in Malaysia to improve their skills in the management of depression. Future revisions of the Malaysian Depression CPG should directly involve more GPs from private practices at the planning, development and implementation stages, in order to increase its impact."

However, the estimation of prevalence for various psychoactive substances among the street children in a representative sample has not been attempted in the developing country like India. This is challenging due to the absence of an appropriate sampling frame, the population living in isolation, hiding their identity and concealing their behaviour. Use of psychoactive substances in street children is riddled with these challenges. The present investigation describes the findings from size estimation study on a representative sample of street child (n = 766) in Delhi, by implementing the Respondent Driven Sampling Methodology (RDS). The weighted prevalence for three commonest substances was found as Tobacco (31.1 %), alcohol (13.5 %) and inhalants (11.3 %) used during the last one year with the estimated number as –Tobacco (21,770), Alcohol (9450) and Inhalants (5600). Almost one third of street children were using some substance. Also, a large majority of ever users were also using substances currently. The study demonstrates successfully the implementation of RDS for the estimation of the prevalence of psychoactive substances in a representative manner. A large majority of street children use psychoactive substances, and there is a need for more of such studies in other metropolitan cities so that local level interventions and planning can be done for treatment and prevention of psychoactive substances among the street children.

To study and compare factors correlated with quality of life and subjective burden of primary dementia caregivers at the Psychiatric Outpatient Unit of Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand.
Methods
One hundred and fifty-five dementia caregivers were enrolled from September 2015 to May 2016. A set of general information questionnaires, the Pictorial Thai Quality of Life (PTQL) and the Thai version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) were used to collect general information, quality of life and subjective burden data. Factors correlated with quality of life and subjective burden were analyzed by Chi-square test. Multiple regression analysis was used to define factors predictive of the caregivers’ quality of life.
Results
Forty percent of the participants assessed themselves as having burden. Positive predictive factors of the caregivers’ quality of life included high education, income, satisfaction towards psychiatric care and having jobs. Female gender, having financial problems, sickness, long caregiving hours per day, burden from taking care of other dependents, and subjective burden (p < 0.05) were negative predictive factors of dementia caregivers’ quality of life.
Conclusion
The primary dementia caregivers’ quality of life was correlated with their subjective burden, socioeconomic status and caregiving experiences. It is crucial to promote confidence in caregiving, perceived social support and positive satisfaction towards mental health care for dementia caregivers."

abstract = "Background
Previous studies in Sri Lanka have shown a high prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD). Postpartum depression screening using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) has been validated and included in routine postnatal care in 2012.
Objectives
This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of PPD at 10 days and 4 weeks postpartum in 2017 in two medical officer of health (MOH) areas in Sri Lanka, and to assess the association between risk factors and postpartum depression.
Methods
An EPDS total score higher than 9 was used to estimate the prevalence of postpartum depression. PPD outcomes were assessed by mothers’ responses to the EPDS. Potential risk factors were extracted from routine paper-based medical records. The associations were examined using simple and multivariable linear regression and multivariate logistic regression models.
Results
A total of 1349 mothers in the two areas, 523 from Dankotuwa and 826 from Bope Poddala, were included. The prevalence of PPD was 15.5% and 7.8% among mothers assessed 10 days postpartum (in Dankotuwa) and 4 weeks postpartum (in Bope Poddala), respectively. EPDS total scores were positively related to delivery age of mothers. Presence of postpartum depression was significantly associated with delivery age over 35, having more than 4 living children and mothers’ diseases. Mothers who attended prenatal sessions and whose partners were employed were less likely to report postpartum depression.
Conclusion
The prevalence of PPD in Sri Lanka was 15.5% at 10 days and 7.8% at 4 weeks postpartum. Future studies on the effect of time since delivery on postpartum depression screening outcomes are warranted."

To determine common temporal change patterns (i.e., trajectories) of perceived antenatal psychological stress throughout the pregnancy, and to examine associations between these identified trajectories and neonatal birth outcomes.
Methods
926 participants from a prospective cohort study of multi-ethnic Asian women from an urban setting with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies completed the Perceived Stress Scale in their first, second, and third trimesters, and just prior to parturition. Gestational age, neonatal weight, length, and head circumference were recorded at birth. Longitudinal trajectories of antenatal psychological stress were characterized with group-based trajectory modelling; associations between trajectories and neonatal outcomes were assessed with analyses of covariance and covariate-adjusted linear regressions.
Results
Three distinct non-fluctuating trajectories of antenatal psychological stress were identified, with 43 % of women experiencing significant levels of stress throughout the pregnancy. Women in this persistently-higher stress trajectory delivered neonates who were 57.5 g lighter and with head circumferences of 20 mm less than their counterparts in the other trajectories. Each one-point increase on the Perceived Stress Scale was associated with a decrease of 5.64 g in birthweight and a decrease of 0.4 mm in head circumference.
Conclusions
This study delineated three meaningful trajectories of antenatal psychological stress. The persistently-higher antenatal psychological stress trajectory, experienced by two in five women, was associated with lower birthweight and possibly smaller head circumference. While further research is needed to better appreciate the clinical relevance of these findings, it highlights the importance of psychosocial support even for healthy pregnant women with uncomplicated pregnancies in Asian settings."

In this proof-of-concept study, we aimed at evaluating the effect of a single session online-tDCS on working memory(WM) and its transferability to other cognitive functions. Numerical n-back(NNB), digit symbol substitution test(DSST), emotional matching and labelling test(E-MALT), and anti-saccade eye movement beeforefore and after 20 min tDCS (anode: left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cathode: left temporoparietal junction) applied during Sternberg’s task(WM-task) were assessed. Twenty-three schizophrenia patients with cognitive deficits were randomized to receive either online-tDCS or offline-tDCS (without simultaneous Sternberg’s task) sessions. All patients received one session each of active and sham tDCS in a randomized counterbalanced double-blind cross-over design. RMANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect between tDCS type (Online/Offline) x activeness (active/sham) of tDCS; the reaction time during 2-back performance in the NNB test improved in online-sham (F = 5.23, p < 0.038) but not online-active tDCS session. No significant changes were noted in DSST, E-MALT, and anti-saccade performance. Improved performance after online-sham tDCS suggests that performing the Sternberg’s task enhanced 2-back performance. The counterintuitive observation was noted with respect to the non-enhancement of WM performance on combining the task to tDCS. Aberrant plasticity in schizophrenia might attain a transitional ceiling that would have resulted in restriction of enhancement on combining the two plasticity modulators. The transferability of improvement to other cognitive domains could not be ascertained."

Although parents are often the first to facilitate help-seeking in their children, parental perceptions regarding mental health serve as a significant barrier to the access of mental health services. This study examined mental health perceptions held by Chinese immigrant parents of youth.
Methods
Eighteen parents (13 female, 5 male), who identified as having children between the ages of 13 and 21 years, participated in audio-recorded interviews using five vignettes depicting depression with and without a somatic emphasis, schizophrenia with paranoid features, attenuated psychosis syndrome, and social anxiety in youth. Questions about potential causes, likely diagnosis, and health-seeking behaviors in relation to these vignettes were asked. Interviews were analyzed for themes using a deductive-inductive hybrid approach, informed by the explanatory models that have shed light on Asian perceptions of mental illness and approaches to help-seeking.
Results
While Asian groups are often considered as lacking in mental health knowledge, we found that Chinese immigrant parents were comfortable with psychological terminology as it pertained to identifying causes and describing supportive strategies and the seeking of Western-based providers. However, the majority of Chinese immigrant parent respondents did not easily note suicidality. Furthermore, respondents did not consider social anxiety as a major mental health issue among Chinese immigrant parents and attributed social anxiety to personality or cultural differences.
Discussion
These findings provide an understanding of how Chinese immigrant parents conceptualize mental illness and help-seeking, which may be helpful for providers when working with Chinese immigrant parents of children that have a mental health concern."

Aberrant salience is the incorrect assignment of salience or significance to innocuous stimuli, and been hypothesized to be a central mechanism in the development of psychosis. In addition to aberrant salience, social-cognitive models of psychosis suggest that the way people process information about the self is important in all stages of psychosis. The aim of the present study is to explore the relationship between aberrant salience and emotion processing in schizophrenia patients with psychotic relapse.
Methods
A sample of 42 patients with relapse was recruited. Aberrant salience was measured with the Aberrant Salience Inventory (ASI). Assessment of social cognition was carried out using the Facial Emotion Identification Test (FEIT). Partial correlations were controlled for possible confounding variables.
Results
The ASI factors “increase in meaning” and “heightened cognition” positively correlated with impaired recognition of positive emotions, and ASI total score inversely correlated to time to response to task. Most of incorrect answers corresponded to misclassification of positive emotions.
Conclusion
Our findings show that there is evidence for a relationship between aberrant salience and emotion processing during a psychotic episode; we propose that aberrant salience and alterations in emotion processing trigger the loss of modulating feedback from the external world to produce a self-referential mental state."

Amongst all the ailments among the elderly persons, cognitive impairment has significant impact on the quality of life. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes and hypertension increase the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. Little is known about the prevalence and correlates of cognitive impairment in elderly with NCDs.
Aim
The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and correlates of cognitive impairment among elderly patients living with NCDs.
Methodology
297 patients attending the chronic disease clinic of two Community Health Centres were evaluated using Hindi mini-mental scale (HMSE), University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale (UCLA LS), Geriatric Depression Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7 scale) and Vulnerability to Abuse Screening Scale.
Results
More than one-fourth (27.3 %) of participants had cognitive impairment as per the HMSE scores. The mean HMSE score was lowest (23.90+6.61) among patients with hypertension followed by patients with diabetes alone (26.90+4.46). People with hypertension had lower mean scores on all the domains of HMSE. Multivariable binary logistic regression depicted younger age, high education status, per capita income, long duration of diseases, loneliness, and hypertension emerged as the significant risk factors associated with cognitive impairment.
Conclusion
Older adults with non-communicable diseases have high prevalence of cognitive impairment. Physicians should make the patients and their family members aware about the association of non-communicable diseases with cognitive impairments and should encourage these persons to use remedial measures to reduce the risk of future development of dementia."

Results
The total sample size of participants was 230, of whom 115 completed questionnaires. There were no significant differences in demographic backgrounds between the good mental health (GHQ-12 ≤ 4) and the poor mental health (GHQ-12 ≥ 5) groups. The poor mental health group was more likely to think that people have the right to commit suicide.

We implemented a population-based cross-sectional study of 2,619 LBC aged from 10 to 17. Multivariate logistic regression model which incorporated the cross-product term of resilience and depression was used to determine the moderation effect of resilience in depression-DSH association, whereas the mediating role of resilience was measured by path analysis. We found that depression was positively associated with DSH whereas resilience was negatively associated with DSH. Resilience in general was a prominent effect moderator in depression-DSH association, meanwhile, resilience also played as a significant mediator in this association, accounted for 26.8 % of the total effect. Our findings indicated that resilience was important moderator and mediator in the association between depression and DSH among Chinese LBC.

To investigate association of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ABCB1(rs1045462) and DRD3(rs6280) with clozapine response and the dose in treatment resistant schizophrenia (TRS) patients.
Methods
200 TRS patients were enrolled in the study during their follow up visit post clozapine initiation. SNP assessment was performed for DRD3 (rs6280) and ABCB1(rs1045462) by sequencing. Blood sample for genotyping was collected with disease and treatment related variables recording on case record form. Patients were classified as responders or nonresponders based upon Andreasen criteria and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).
Results
Mean clozapine dose, the genotype frequency distribution of ABCB1, DRD3 SNPs were significantly different in clozapine responder and non-responder study population (p < 0.05). CT genotype of ABCB1 and AG genotype of DRD3 were observed to be more prevalent in the responder group. TT genotype of ABCB1 and AG genotype of DRD3 were prevalent in the nonresponder group. Clozapine dosing equations for responder and nonresponder TRS populations were developed through logistic regression analysis. 27% variability in clozapine dose was explained by possible combinations of ABCB1 and DRD3 SNP analysis.
Conclusion
Differential ABCB1(rs1045462) and DRD3(rs6280) genotype frequencies among the clozapine responders and non-responders explained clear feasibility of response predictor potential along with clozapine dose variability association. Pharmacogenetically guided clozapine dosing is possible if more SNPs are considered together with ABCB1(rs1045462) and DRD3(rs6280) in TRS patients."

Self-stigma has a negative impact on the lives of children with mental health illnesses. It is a massive obstacle in the way of seeking professional help and poses a challenge to clinician's efforts to timely intervene and provide treatment.
Aim
The aim of our study was to measure the stigma associated with mental illness in children with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses.
Methods
Following Institutional Review Board approval, an interviewer-based questionnaire was administered to children (aged 8–12 years), receiving treatment in Child Psychiatry Department at a tertiary care hospital in Lahore. The questionnaire comprised of Demographic Information Form and Paediatric Self-Stigmatization Scale (PaedS). In addition, parent / caregiver also completed a modified sub scale of the PaedS measuring the children’s rejection by others due to their mental health difficulties.
Results
110 children with various psychiatric problems, were interviewed with a mean age of 10 years + 1.7. Widespread presence of self-stigmatization was found in these children with particularly high scores for the scales of Societal Devaluation (2.6 + 0.54), Secrecy (2.85 + 0.59) and Self stigma (2.7 + 0.70). Almost two third of parents also answered in affirmative to statements about their children rejection by others due to their mental health difficulties. Children with emotional/ behavioral difficulties had statistically significant scores on secrecy and personal rejection subscales (P value<.05).
Conclusions
Significant self-stigmatization amongst the children diagnosed with mental health illnesses in Lahore, Pakistan emphasize negative societal attitudes, which need to be addressed effectively in a timely manner."

Forty-five suicides of patients with schizophrenia occurred in 27 hospitals, and 46 suicides of patients with depression occurred in 33 hospitals. Hanging was the most common suicide method in both diagnostic groups. More than half of the patients with schizophrenia had histories of suicide attempts, although there was no significant difference in previous suicide attempts or self-harm between both diagnostic groups. Medical staff should confirm whether inpatients with schizophrenia have such histories. In this study, there was no significant difference in characteristics between inpatients with schizophrenia or depression. In order to prevent suicides of patients with schizophrenia during hospitalization, nonspecific suicide attempt prevention needs to be undertaken, such as ensuring comprehension of the general risk factors of suicide among medical staff."

Postnatal depression is a highly prevalent disorder with serious implications on maternal and child outcomes. There are few studies examining feasible interventions in low-middle-income community settings.
Aims
To assess the effectiveness of a low intensity group intervention led by lay workers during the antenatal period in reducing postnatal depression at 6-2 weeks postpartum.
Methods
A parallel group design with both positive and negative controls was employed. 1 community site was allocated to each of the 3 arms. The active intervention consisted of problem based sessions with cognitive behavioural components. The primary outcome was the presence of depression on CIS-R and secondary outcome measures where Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores, EPNDS scores and participant perceptions.
Results
69, 75 and 70 women received active, positive control and negative control interventions respectively. Post partum depression diagnosed with the CIS-R was present in 14.06% (C.I.- 5.55%-22.57%) and 22.62% (C.I.15.62%-29.63%) in the active arm and two control (combined) arms respectively. There was a 1/3 lower proportion of postpartum depression and impaired functioning in the intervention group, though statistical significance was not reached (p = 0.30). There were high levels of satisfaction reported for the active intervention.
Conclusion
There were trends for the possible effectiveness for this low intensity intervention and conclusions regarding its effectiveness can’t be made as the sample size was small. There is a need to explore and develop locally relevant, innovative and feasible strategies for prevention of postnatal depression in resource constrained enviroments."

This led to the development of the concept of illness deception or malingering when one tries to assume a sick role and feigns signs and symptoms to gain external incentives. The conceptual framework of malingering has undergone several changes and there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that malingering exists. However, the diagnosis of malingering has not yet been established in the mainstream psychiatric nosological systems and still it is present in the appendices as an additional area requiring attention. This is due to the poor construct validity of the diagnosis, problems in defining malingering, problems in assessment by psychological tests and clinical assessment methodology, no well-established guidelines to detect malingering and issues related to labelling/reporting malingering. Because of several controversies in multiple domains of assessment and ethical-social issues, malingering as a distinct entity is grossly neglected. In the upcoming arena of law suits and consumer benefits suits, it is extremely important to have a better understanding of the conceptual issues related to malingering and the controversies related to it. In this review, a brief overview of evolution of concepts and controversies related to malingering is described."

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a treatment modality in children that can be life-saving but is rarely preferred. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the knowledge, experience, and attitudes of child and adolescent psychiatrists (CAPs) in Turkey about pediatric ECT and to draw attention to possible gaps and needs regarding this treatment in the child and adolescent psychiatric policies of Turkey.
Method
An electronic survey was prepared and shared with child and adolescent psychiatric residents and specialists. The participants were asked about their residency training, clinical experience, and opinion about ECT. The obtained data were entered in SPSS Statistics 23.0. Descriptive analyses and chi-squared tests were applied.
Results
One hundred and ninety-one CAPs filled in the questionnaire, 28.8% of whom assessed their knowledge level as “I have no knowledge.” Only 34% of them stated that their patients, most of whom had mood disorders, schizophrenia, and catatonia, had received ECT before. Four of these patients were under 12 years old. Sixty-six percent of the participants suggested that ECT was safe in adolescents, whereas only 5.8% held this view for prepubertal children. The most common reason for physicians not to apply ECT was “lack of means to apply ECT,” and 92.7% stated that opportunities should be provided for pediatric ECT treatment by the hospital administration.
Conclusion
This is the first data to present the knowledge and attitudes of CAPs in Turkey about ECT. The results suggest that physicians need to have more knowledge about ECT."

The study aimed to (1) examine the effects of age, gender, and education on neuropsychological test performance, and (2) establish regression-based norms in the Singapore older adult (≥ 60 years) population. Data on neuropsychological test performance was extracted from the Well-being of the Singapore Elderly (WiSE) study (n = 2033). Participants who met criteria for dementia were excluded. The data included scores from the 10/66 Dementia Research Group neuropsychological test battery measuring verbal fluency, immediate memory recall, delayed memory recall, and global cognitive function. The General Linear Model (GLM) was used to examine the effects of age, gender, and education on neuropsychological test performance. Stratified weighted means and standard deviations by age, gender and education were reported to establish regression-based normative data. Results from GLM showed that older age and having lower education were associated with poorer performance on all four neuropsychological test measures, and females showed better performance on the tests for immediate memory recall and delayed memory recall. The current study provides useful information on cognitive functioning based on the 10/66 neuropsychological test battery in the older adult population in Singapore. This may help to improve neuropsychological assessments for older adults."

Analyses indicated that the experimental group shows an improvement in the trained domain. The result found a lack of near transfer to selective attention and inhibitory control with a successful far transfer effect to the risky decision making and delay discounting. Furthermore, the transfer occurred to behavioral symptoms of the intervention group. Attention and working memory training decrease delay discounting and delay discounting. The near transfer is not a prerequisite of far transfer.

After extraction of prefrontal cortices, expression of BDNF IV splice variant and methylation level of its CpG island were evaluated.

This study aimed to evaluate the extent to stigma experienced by the PMI in the hands of their family members and friends/colleagues in the form of commonly used labels and factors associated with use of various labels for persons with mental illnesses.
Methodology
191 patients with severe mental illness (120 patients with mood disorders and 71 patients with psychotic illness) were assessed using a self-designed questionnaire for the derogatory labels faced by patients in the hands of their family members and friends/colleagues.
Results
60 % and 39.8 % of the patients reported of being teased by the family members and friends/colleagues respectively for being suffering from mental illness. The most commonly used label/adjective by the family members was Aalsi (lazy) (20.9 %), followed by sustt (lethargic) (15.2 %) and paagal (mad) (14.1 %). The commonly used labels/adjectives by friends/colleagues were paagal (mad) (6.3 %), followed by darpok (coward) (5.2 %). Mean number of labels used by the family members and friends/co-workers were 5.93 and 3.4 respectively. Around one third of the patients (32.5 %) reported that seeking treatment is associated with facing these labels and due to the same they stopped or wanted to stop their treatment. Significantly higher numbers of labels were used for patients with psychotic disorders, when compared to those with affective disorders. Poor functioning was associated with use of significantly higher number of derogatory labels.
Conclusions
Stigmatizing labels are commonly used by family members and friends of the patients with severe mental illness and these cause significant distress to the patients. There is a need to make the society aware that there is a need to stop use of these derogatory labels."

Depression is the most common mood disorder following stroke. It can negatively affects different domains of patient’s life. The present study aimed to explore demographic and clinical predictors of post stroke depression and determine discriminative cognitive, motor, and functional factors in stroke patients with and without depression.
Methods
In a cross sectional study, 100 patients with stroke were investigated. Measurements consisted of Beck Depression Inventory-II, Trail Making Test A & B, Digit Span Subtest of Wechsler Memory Scale, Motricity Index (arm and leg motor), Trunk Control Test, Barthel Index, and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Demographics and clinical data including educational level, marital status, limb affected, cigarette smoking habits, diabetes mellitus, cardiac diseases, and blood pressure were also collected.
Results
Multivariate logistic regression revealed that college level of education (OR = 8.78, 95% CI: 2.65–29.11, P < 0.001) and cardiac diseases (OR = 3.11, 95% CI: 1.19–8.13, P < 0.001) were significant demographic and clinical predictors of post stroke depression. Using stepwise discriminant function analysis, basic activities of daily living and trunk control with 88.0% classification accuracy, 81.1% sensitivity, and 95.7% specificity were as the best discriminators of post stroke depression.
Conclusions
Rehabilitation experts working with patients with stroke should pay special attention to trunk control and basic activities of daily living for preventing consequences of PSD particularly in those with higher educational level and cardiac diseases."

abstract = "Objectives
Public stigma against psychiatric disorders leads to delayed treatment utilization and worsens treatment outcome. This study analyses the impact of expectations regarding the course of illness and attribution as medical illness on the desire for social distance towards schizophrenia and depression in Vietnam.
Methods
In 2013, a survey (n = 771) using unlabelled vignettes either depicting a person with symptoms typical for schizophrenia or major depression was carried out in Hanoi. All respondents had to indicate whether the person was suffering from a medical illness or not. As an indicator of public stigma, the desire for social distance was measured. A possible correlation between expectations towards the course of illness and social distance was evaluated using a linear regression model.
Results
85 % of respondents endorsed that the person depicted in the schizophrenia vignette had a mental illness, compared to only 60 %, who were confronted with the depression vignette. This attribution of mental illness was correlated with higher levels of desire for social distance only in the schizophrenia vignette. While in the case of schizophrenia negative prognostic perceptions were associated with more desire for social distance, in the event of depression, it was only the expectation of lifelong dependency. Moreover, only for depression, positive expectations towards the course of illness correlated with less desire for social distance.
Conclusion
These results indicate an impact of prognostic expectations on the desire for social distance and support strategies that aim at maintaining social integration and strengthening autonomy."

abstract = "Background
Dyslexia is a type of specific learning disability (SLD) which has neurobiological origin. It is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. The impaired reading in dyslexia is associated with inability to process the sensory input that enters the nervous system. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a potential source in understanding the neurobiology and to identify the brain basis of sensory stimuli processed in dyslexic patients.
Methodology
The present study was conducted to assess the difference in neural changes using fMRI in children and adolescents with SLD compared with normal children and also the correlation of clinical parameters with BOLD – fMRI changes. Sixteen children and adolescents diagnosed as dyslexia were assessed with All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) SLD Battery, Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI KID) and Aggregated Neurobehavioral Student Health and Educational Review (ANSER) system and compared with 15 controls matched with age and sex. Participants of both groups were asked to perform 3 tasks during the fMRI acquisition (phonological, picture-naming and semantic tasks).
Result
As compared to control group, the participants with dyslexia show phonological decoding problem. During picture task, the participants with dyslexia use more areas of brain involve in recalling the memory events while during semantic tasks processing the occipito-temporal (fusiform) gyrus was less activated when in contrast to control.
Conclusion
This study shows that participants with dyslexia fail to use normal brain regions specialized in language processing, but rather use different areas."

Our team developed smartteen- a computer application designed to augment in-person CBT for treatment of depression in adolescents. This paper will present results of the pilot evaluation of smartteen (a cCBT) for its feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms. Twenty-one adolescents with unipolar depression seeking treatment at a tertiary care hospital were randomly assigned to smartteen (n = 11) and TAU (n = 10). Both groups received twelve weeks of treatment and were assessed at baseline, mid-treatment (6 weeks) and post-treatment (12 weeks) using four clinical measures including BDI-II, CDRS-R, CGI-S and CGAS. smartteen was shown to be feasible and acceptable treatment to adolescents. At 6 weeks, both treatments were effective in reducing depression. At 12 weeks, smartteen was significantly more effective than TAU in reducing depression symptoms and improving functioning on CGAS. Treatment compliance was better in smartteen group. smartten was shown to reduce the time spent by therapist to deliver 12 sessions of CBT treatment for depression. Results indicate that smartteen may be subjected to more rigorous evaluations with larger samples and considered for wider implementation if found effective."

Suicide is increasing in young Iranian population, which necessitates the employing of valid, yet abridged instruments assessing the constellation of suicide-related behaviors. The study aimed at validating Suicide Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) among Iranian undergraduates.
Methods
A total of 487 undergraduates were surveyed in 2018. Construct validity of SBQ-R was examined via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and Spearman’s correlation with two single-item indices of suicide acceptability (SA) and lifetime suicidal ideation (LSI) was determined. Logistic regression and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to examine the cut-off points (≥ 7 and ≥ 8) and categorizations as per item 1.
Results
The mean SBQ-R score was 5.79 ± 3.55. Cut-off points ≥ 7 and ≥ 8 categorized 150 (30.8%) and 123 (25.2%) samples with suicide risk, respectively. Women obtained significantly higher scores on all indices, except items 1 and 4. CFA confirmed the model with sound goodness-of-fit, with factor loadings of 0.70 to 0.83. Composite reliability and average variance extracted were 0.87 and 0.63, respectively. The SBQ-R’s correlation with SA and LSI confirmed its concurrent validity. Regression analysis confirmed the ability of both cut-off points to distinguish the participants with high SA and LSI; however, the cut-off point ≥ 8 produced better results regarding high LSI. Based on item 1, normal versus low- and high-risk samples were significantly different in terms of SA, LSI, and adjusted total score of SBQ-R (P < 0.0001).
Conclusion
SBQ-R is an economic and psychometrically sound tool, which can be utilized to identify suicide-related behaviors and risks in young Iranian population."

Methods
The Child Behavior Checklist was given to 650 children attending the primary school and 453 children constituted the sample of the study. 83 children with a total score of 180 in CBCL attention, anxious/depression and aggression subscale scores were evaluated as moderate risk group (MRG) and 14 children with a total score of 210 and higher were considered as high-risk group (HRG) in terms of DMDD. 30 (6.62%of the study sample) from MRG and HRG agreed to participate in the study. DSM-V based psychiatric interview (PI) was done by a child and adolescent psychiatrist.
Results
Eight of 30 children who underwent PI were within the high-risk group (HRG), and 4 of these children were diagnosed with DMMD (0.88% of the total sample). There was at least one comorbid diagnosis in all four children diagnosed with DMMD.
Conclusions
Our study is one of the few studies evaluating the frequency of DMMD in Turkey. Although the prevalence of DMMD is low, comorbid diagnosis rates require detailed examination and multifaceted perspectives in the follow-up and treatment process."

abstract = "Introduction
There is a global rise in the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and treatment gap exists across settings. In low-resource settings, there is a lack of professionals and specialist centres for intervention delivery. ‘Parent-mediated interventions’ is an essential strategy to bridge the existing treatment gap. While RCTs are required to establish evidence base, understanding parental perspectives is pivotal in designing culturally-relevant intervention models, to enhance parental involvement and sustainability. The current paper focuses on the results of a qualitative study to understand the parent perspectives and change process before and after a parent-mediated intervention program.
Methods
30 children (2–6 years) recently diagnosed to have ASD, participated in a brief parent-mediated interventions focusing on core-deficits, for 12 weeks. Parents were asked to narrate their experiences and perception of their child’s disorder and interventions before and after the intervention program, during one-on-one in-depth interview. A narrative guide was used to generate response. The narratives were recorded verbatim and thematic content analysis was carried out.
Results
Repetitive themes reflecting impact of the child’s disorder, treatment impact and change process was examined. The broad themes generated included: 1) Change in perception of the child’s developmental disorder after involvement in intervention process. 2) Change in parental attitudes from ‘lack of hope’ to ‘positive and appropriate expectations’ 3) Gain in knowledge and empowerment 4) Stress reduction 5) Appreciation of micro-gains 6) Validation of ‘hands-on training’. Behavioural interventions were the preferred treatment of choice in 66 % of parents, followed by combination therapy in 22 % and pharmacotherapy alone in 12 %.
Conclusion
Parent’s narratives highlighted the acceptability and feasibility of the parent-mediated interventions in our cultural setting. Understanding parental perspectives, more so when interventions are parent-mediated, is essential for tailoring interventions as well as improving sustainability."

Traditional psychiatric precepts suggests that good insight is inversely related to the severity of psychotic symptoms and directly related to depression scores, better clinical outcome, and treatment adherence. However, recent studies have recognised that insight does not predict outcomes, changes over time, and is dependent on the trajectory of the individual’s illness and the social and cultural context arguing that “insight” is an explanatory model and a coping strategy. Methodological issues related to the assessment of insight, the limitations of psychiatric classification and complex interaction between biology and the environment make simplistic explanations of the concept of insight less than useful. The paper argues that the biomedical model should be presented without dismissing or devaluing patient beliefs and explanations. Psychiatry needs to embrace the complexity of mental illness and value diverse attempts at restoring homeostasis."

Voluntary admission rates of schizophrenia vary widely across studies. In order to make the topic be informed by evidence, it is important to have accurate estimates. This meta-analysis examined the worldwide prevalence of voluntary admissions for patients with schizophrenia.
Method
PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Medline databases were systematically searched, from their commencement date until 19th November 2018. Meta-analysis of included studies was performed using the random-effects model.
Results
Thirty-five studies with 134,100 schizophrenia patients were included. The overall voluntary admission rate of schizophrenia was 61.9 % (95 %CI: 52.3 %–70.7 %), while the involuntary rate was 43.0 % (95 %CI: 34.8 %–51.7 %). Subgroup analyses revealed that patients in Europe had significantly higher voluntary admission rates, while their North American counterparts were more likely admitted involuntarily. Papers published prior to 2008 reported higher involuntary admission rates. Meta-regression analyses showed that higher male percentage and higher study quality were significantly associated with higher voluntary admission rate.
Conclusion
Although the worldwide prevalence of voluntary admissions was higher than that of involuntary admissions, the latter was common for schizophrenia. With the continuing liberalization of mental health laws broadening community-based psychiatric services, the rate of voluntary psychiatric admissions is expected to further increase over time."

Their socio-demographic and clinical characteristics including medication treatment status were collected and analyzed.
Results
The proportion of unmedicated schizophrenia patients was 22.5% (n = 953) in the whole sample, with 32.3% (556/1720) in rural and 15.8% (397/2520) in urban patients (X2=161.1, P < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that unmedicated schizophrenia patients in rural area were more likely to be older (OR=1.02, 95%CI: 1.01–1.03), male (OR=1.35, 95%CI: 1.07–1.71), unmarried (OR=0.71, 95%CI: 0.55-0.91), and have lower educational level (OR=0.39, 95%CI: 0.24-0.65), longer illness duration (OR=1.01, 95%CI: 1.00–1.02) and less frequent admissions (OR=0.46, 95%CI: 0.38-0.54). In contrast, unmedicated patients in urban area were more likely to be older (OR=1.01, 95%CI: 1.00–1.02), unmarried (OR=0.77, 95%CI: 0.61-0.98), employed (OR=2.38, 95%CI: 1.87–3.04), and have lower educational level (OR=0.49, 95%CI: 0.37-0.65), better financial status (OR=0.60, 95%CI: 0.48-0.76) and less frequent admissions (OR=0.81, 95%CI: 0.75-0.87).
Conclusions
The rate of unmedicated schizophrenia patients is high in economically underdeveloped areas of China, particularly in rural areas. Effective policies and measures should be implemented urgently to improve the treatment rate in this population."

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) as an add-on treatment for TD.
Methods
A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial was conducted at an outpatient, single-center academic setting. A total of 62 patients aged 6–17 years with TD and lack of clinical response to 4 weeks’ pharmacotherapy were enrolled. Patients were divided randomly into 2 groups and given 4 weeks’ treatment, including 30 min sessions of active CES (500 μA–2 mA) or sham CES (lower than 100 μA) per day for 40 d on weekdays. Change in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), Clinical Global Impression-severity of illness-severity (CGI-S) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale-14 items (HAMA-14) were performed at baseline, week 2, week 4. Adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated.
Results
53 patients (34 males and 9 females) completed the trial, including 29 in the active CES group and 24 in the sham CES group. Both groups showed clinical improvement in tic severities compared to baseline respectively at week 4. Participants receiving active CES showed a reduction of 31.66 % in YGTSS score, compared with 23.96 % in participants in sham CES group, resulting in no significant difference between the two groups (t = 1.54, p = 0.13).
Conclusion
Four-week’s treatment of CES for children and adolescents with TD is effective and safe, but the improvement for tic severity may be related to placebo effect."

Developed based on the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), the Motivation and Pleasure Scale-Self Report (MAP-SR) was designed to address the conceptual and psychometric limitations of other instruments assessing negative symptoms. We sought to validate and extend the applicability of the MAP-SR in the Chinese context across the schizophrenia spectrum.
Methods
Three samples, including college students, individuals with social anhedonia and patients with schizophrenia, were recruited. Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, factor structure, and convergent/discriminant validity of the MAP-SR were examined. The group differences between the three participant groups were examined.
Results
A four-factor structure of the MAP-SR was found consistently in all three groups of participants. The scale showed convergent/discriminant validity in patients with schizophrenia and individuals with social anhedonia, along with good reliability found in schizophrenia patients. The MAP-SR was also able to distinguish individuals with SocAnh and patients with SZ from matched controls.
Conclusions
The MAP-SR is a valid and reliable instrument in assessing negative symptoms in individuals along the schizophrenia spectrum."

Increasing evidence has suggested that childhood maltreatment might mediate the association between physical disability or chronic illness and depression among adolescents. We sought to identify whether childhood maltreatment mediated the relationship between physical disability or long-term health problems and depression in Chinese adolescents.
Method
A total of 5726 middle and high school students aged 12–18 years old were chosen to participant in this study. Participants completed the self-reported questionnaire on childhood physical or long-term health problems, childhood maltreatment and depression.
Results
The results showed that there were significant differences of childhood maltreatment, depression between adolescents with childhood physical disability or long-term health problems and those without. Physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect and emotional neglect mediated the association between childhood physical disability or long-term health problems and depression accounting for 8.7%, 20.6%, 14.5%, 16.3% and 14.7% of the total effect of physical disability or long-term health problems on depression in each single mediator model respectively, whereas the indirect effect of emotional abuse and sexual abuse in the association between physical disability or long-term health problems and depression explained 15.6% and 8.0% of the total effect in a multiple mediation model respectively.
Conclusion
Childhood physical disability or long-term health problems was associated with the increased risk for depression, and the associations between childhood physical disability and long-term health problems and depression were partially mediated by childhood maltreatment experiences. Childhood maltreatment exposure should be considered to prevent depression among adolescents with childhood physical disability or long-term health problems."

Collaboration between community and healthcare professionals plays an essential role in ADHD care. Therefore, this study aims to identify the level of knowledge/understanding, perception and attitude among community members, primary school teachers, medical students, general practitioners, pediatricians and psychologists in Indonesia regarding ADHD and its association with several related factors.
Methods
A cross-sectional study utilizing valid questionnaires to assess the level of knowledge/understanding, perception and attitude regarding ADHD among each respondent group was employed. 1,536 subjects participated in this study. Data was gathered and analyzed using the SPSS version 20.0 for Mac. A chi-square test was used to establish the associations. The value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in this study.
Results
Most of the participants showed poor to very poor levels of knowledge/understanding (community members = 56.8%, teachers = 58.9%, medical students = 60.4%, general practitioners = 54.9%, pediatricians = 65.6%, psychologists = 52.1%). The similar results were also found for perception and attitude levels. Several associations were found between practice experience and the level of knowledge/understanding, perception and attitude towards ADHD among general practitioners and psychologists (p < 0.05); educational level and level of attitude among community members and medical students (p < 0.05); practice experience and the knowledge/understanding level in the teachers group (p < 0.05); practice experience and the perception level among pediatricians (p < 0.05).
Conclusions
Further education regarding ADHD should be considered either through online media or formal education in order to achieve a better management of ADHD."

Because of high rates of co-occurrence, common familial risk, and phenotypic similarities, we conjectured that substance use and bipolar disorder might have a common substrate of origin in bipolarity and that they might lie on a continuum of bipolarity. Thus it was aimed to investigate the association between bipolarity and substance use through a controlled, clinic based study.
Methods
Cross sectional assessment and comparison of bipolarity as trait in four groups, namely the substance use disorder (SUD), bipolar disorder (BPAD), dual diagnosis (DD), and the healthy control (HC) groups. Bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale (BSDS) was used. The quality of life in these four groups was also assessed using WHOQOL-Bref scale.
Results
The mean Bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale (BSDS) score in SUD was 11.0 ± 5.3 which was more than that of HC (6.2 ± 3.9) and lesser than that in BPAD (18.4 ± 4.2) and DD (20.6 ± 3.6). Differences among all four groups were statistically significant. SUD group was found to have significantly higher score than healthy control. The BSDS score of DD and BPAD groups were higher than those of SUD but the difference between BPAD and DD was non-significant.
Discussion
The results showed a potential association between substance dependence and bipolarity. Mood dysregulation appears to be the link between the two. The gradient of bipolarity detected by BSDS screener suggests a continuum model between substance use and bipolar disorder. However, this is a clinic based study and only male patients have been taken for study."

Age differences exist in many aspects in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The present study aims to examine the effect of age on treatment outcomes in first-episode MDD.
Methodology
A total of 982 first-episode major depressive patients, who were above 18 years old and admitted in both psychiatric hospitals and units of general hospitals were recruited for the present study. These patients were newly treated and responded to 8–12 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Depressive symptoms, psychosocial functioning and quality of life were measured using standardized instruments. The study population was divided into three age groups: early adult (18–44 years old), middle adult (45–59 years old), and late adult (60–85 years old).
Results
Earlier age was associated with greater symptom severity, severer depressive symptoms in hypersomnia, concentration/decision making, negative view of the self, suicide ideation and restlessness, more impaired function, poorer satisfaction in social relationship and economic status, when compared to late adults with MDD (all P < 0.05). In the multivariable analyses, among the other variables, early age remained as an independent correlation of residual depressive severity (middle age vs. early age: OR = 0.631, 95%CI[0.462, 0.862]; old age vs. early age: OR = 0.521, 95%CI[0.348, 0.780]) and functional impairment. Comorbidity of physical illness had a negative contribution to all treatment outcomes.
Conclusion
In first major depressive episode, early age was strongly associated with depressive severity and functional impairment after responding to antidepressant treatment. Early-life depression may be an indicator of MDD for poor clinical outcomes and high clinical burden."

abstract = "Objective
This study aimed to explore the association between medication-associated anticholinergic burden and cognitive and daily living functions in patients with schizophrenia.
Methods
Sixty patients with schizophrenia were recruited. We used the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS) for evaluating medication-associated anticholinergic burden. The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and the University of California San Diego Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA) were used for evaluating cognitive and daily living functions. To assess clinical symptoms, psychiatrists conducted interviews using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia.
Results
Subjects were divided into low (n = 31) and high (n = 29) anticholinergic burden based on ADS scores of 3 or more. The “high ADS” group had poorer cognitive (composite MCCB score, p < 0.001) and daily living functions (total UPSA score, p = 0.001) than the “low ADS” group. Medication-associated anticholinergic burden was negatively correlated with cognitive functions (composite MCCB score, r = −0.512, p < 0.001) and daily living functions (total UPSA score, r = −0.355, p = 0.005). A regression analysis showed that anticholinergic burden significantly explained the decline in cognitive functions (composite MCCB score, R2 = 0.262, p < 0.001) and daily living functions (total UPSA score, R2 = 0.126, p = 0.005). Explanatory power was reduced after a covariate adjustment, but the effects of the composite MCCB score (p = 0.013) and of the transportation domain score of the UPSA (p = 0.048) remained significant.
Conclusions
Our analysis shows that anticholinergic burden reduces cognitive and daily living functions in patients with schizophrenia. A drug strategy with minimal anticholinergic burden may be helpful to patients if it does not adversely affect clinical symptoms."

Association between leptin plasma levels and alcohol craving has been seen previously. This study aims to research this correlation in a different population while comparing this correlation with respect to hyper-excitable state of alcohol withdrawal.
Methods
25 patients of alcohol dependence were assessed for withdrawal symptoms and craving for alcohol. Leptin levels were measured on 1st day, @ the end of 1st week, @ the end of 3rd week of stopping alcohol. Withdrawal was assessed using CIWA-A at day 1 and day 7, craving was assessed using PENN’s scale of craving at week 1 and week 3. Control group consisted of 15 first degree relatives.
Results
Leptin levels [t (38) = 2.95, p = 0.005] was significantly higher in alcohol dependent patients. Levels had no significant correlation with alcohol withdrawal scores [Leptin/BMI and CIWA Ar: r = 0.18, p = 0.40 on day 1] but had positive correlation with craving scores [Leptin/BMI and PACS: r = 0.684, p = 0.001].

In this study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the association of the rs3755557 polymorphism within GSK3B and schizophrenia in Han Chinese individuals. We recruited 782 patients with schizophrenia and 807 healthy controls from eastern China.

Two independent researchers searched of published articles in the databases of Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and WanFang Data, from January 1990 to March 2019. The following key words were used: “depression” or “depressive disorder”, "major depressive disorder", "unipolar depression", "brain-derived neurotrophic factor" or “BDNF”, and "electroconvulsive" or “ECT”. A total of 22 studies met the inclusion criteria of the meta-analysis and included into our analysis. BDNF levels were increased among patients with MDD after ECT (P = 0.000) in plasma samples. The standardized mean difference (SMD) was 0.695 (95 % CI: 0.402-0.988). We also found BDNF levels increased on one week and one month after finishing ECT (SMD = 0.491, 95 %CI: 0.150,0.833, P = 0.005; and SMD = 0.812, 95 %CI: 0.326,1.298, P = 0.001, respectively).

We surveyed the elicited information such as age, sex, period from symptom onset to the first visit, main symptoms, General Health Questionnaire GHQ-12, and perception of stigma associated with receiving a psychiatric consultation. We analyzed the factors affecting the duration until a psychiatric consultation was made using logistic regression analysis, examining age, sex, contents of the problem, GHQ-12, and stigma as independent variables. Of the participants, 48.2 % did not consult with a psychiatrist for more than 6 months and 51 participants (36.7 %) took more than a year before a consultation. We divided the study participants into two groups: early examinees and delayed examinees. In order to investigate the factors affecting the two groups, logistic regression analysis was performed. Of the independent variables, one consultation content (physical symptoms; odds ratio (OR) = 9.21, 95 % CI (confidence interval) = 2.00–42.62, p = 0.004) and the GHQ-12 (OR = 1.17, 95 % CI = 1.05–1.31, p = 0.005) were significant factors. It became clear that physical symptoms significantly accelerated consultation with psychiatry. When various problems occurred, the decision to seek a psychiatry consultation required a long time. Health education focusing on the values of seeking an early consultation is required so that when students have mental health problems they will seek psychiatric services in a timely manner."

Nine hundred and forty-eight Chinese adolescents (M = 462, F = 486) were recruited from two secondary schools. They completed the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, the Centrality of Events Scale, the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, the General Health Questionnaire-28, and the Educational Stress Scale for Adolescents. After controlling for demographic variables and levels of academic stress, structural equation modeling showed that PTSD was positively associated with trauma centrality and psychiatric co-morbidity but negatively associated with posttraumatic growth. Trauma centrality mediated the impacts of PTSD on posttraumatic growth and psychiatric co-morbidity. To conclude, PTSD from past trauma could impact adolescents’ ways of perceiving positive aspects of their trauma and psychological well-being. Such impact, however, was influenced by the changes in their self-concept."

Many evidence-based prevention and intervention approaches for youth mental health exist, but most are time-consuming and expensive to deliver. Innovative approaches are needed to develop and disseminate scalable mental health interventions, especially for youth in low- and middle-income countries. Computerized single-session interventions (SSIs) may be able to overcome many of these implementation barriers, especially if deployed in school settings.
Methods
Guided by this logic, we designed three computerized SSIs (based on behavioral activation, gratitude, and growth mindset exercises) for delivery in Indian high schools. Then, we conducted focus groups with Indian adolescents and school officials to inform adaptations of the interventions. Finally, we designed a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study to evaluate the interventions.
Results
In this paper, we present the rationale for selecting the interventions, the results of the focus groups, and the design of a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study. Our initial focus group data showed that the interventions were considered acceptable, feasible, and appropriate by both educators and students. We also describe feedback on the interventions which we incorporated to refine the interventions prior to our randomized controlled trial.
Discussion
Computerized SSIs may offer innovative, scalable ways to disseminate evidence-based interventions. By identifying which interventions are most acceptable and effective in this highly scalable format, we may understand which SSIs are best suited for continued development, testing, and, ultimately, widespread dissemination."

A retrospective chart review of case records of all the patients diagnosed with schizophrenia at the department of psychiatry from January 2011 to December 2018 was done. Frequency of antipsychotic polypharmacy, reasons influencing it and factors associated with polypharmacy were extracted using a proforma. Of 529 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, 232 patients (43.9 %) were receiving antipsychotic polypharmacy. Common reasons for polypharmacy included the usage of depot along with oral antipsychotic for a prolonged period (37.7 %), augmentation of response with the second antipsychotic (17.7 %) and treatment of a different symptom domain like negative symptoms (9.5 %). In comparison to monopharmacy, antipsychotic polypharmacy was more commonly associated with side effects and extrapyramidal symptoms. Patients on polypharmacy had a higher number of hospitalizations too. As the trend of antipsychotic polypharmacy is on the rise, it is important to assess for reasons influencing polypharmacy to avoid undesirable side effects. The side effect burden of polypharmacy is significantly more than those receiving single antipsychotics. Oral antipsychotics should ideally be discontinued after the depot antipsychotic reaches steady-state levels. Irrational usage of second antipsychotic to augment the response of first antipsychotic agent needs to be avoided."

The most common diagnostic pair of comorbid affective disorder was major depressive disorder (MDD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (0.4 % at 2010 and 0.7 % at 2016). Among comorbid substance misuse, comorbidity of MDD and alcohol related disorder (ARD) was most frequent (0.5 % and 0.7 % respectively), while comorbidity of nicotine dependence (ND) with ARD decreased from 0.5 % to 0.1 %. Logistic regression was utilized to identify the associations of socio-demographics/clinical characteristics with patterns of comorbid mental illness and the associations of number of comorbid mental illness with impaired functioning. The risk profileassociated with comorbid mental illnesses differed among various comorbidity groups. Moreover, in SMHS 2016, higher number of comorbidities within mental illness was associated with higher odds of functioning impairment. The increase in the prevalence of comorbid mental illnesses indicates the need for early diagnosis and integrated disease management. Moreover, certain subgroups in the general population are more at risk of comorbid mental illnesses."

Alcohol dependence causes impairment of neurocognitive functions. Abstinence for some time leads to improvement in neurocognitive functions. This study was conducted with the aim to observe the effects of abstinence on neurocognition.
Methods
The current study was an observational, single group with longitudinal design exploring the effect of abstinence on neuropsychological functioning and further exploring correlation of clinical factors with neuropsychological functioning in patients with Alcohol Dependence Syndrome (ADS). Sixty consecutive male patients of ADS meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were inducted. Neurocognitive tests were applied at baseline, one month and three months of abstinence.
Results
All neurocognitive functions showed significant improvement at three-time intervals (p < 0.05) except for visuomotor function, for which improvement was statistically insignificant (p > 0.05) at one month. The difference for scores on verbal fluency, working memory, set-shifting (WCST total trials and perseverative errors) and visuomotor function from 0 to 3 months was significant (p < 0.05). There was significant interaction (p < 0.05) between duration of regular but non-dependent use, total duration of use, duration of dependence, average intake per day, last intake and time period with verbal fluency, working memory, set -shifting (for WCST total trials, total errors, perseverative errors and non-perseverative errors) and visuomotor function.
Conclusion
The study showed improvement in neurocognitive functions with abstinence over three months, suggesting the need to address these cognitive deficits in the early part of abstinence. Also, correlates for drinking history were identified which may help in the future for the prevention and management of cognitive deficits in ADS patients."

Antenatal depression is recognized as one of the strongest predictors of postnatal depression, which itself is a strong predictor of mental disorders. The detection of antenatal depression is important and requires an accurate and valid screening tool. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is one of the most extensively studied screening instruments for assessing postnatal depression.
Aim
To validate a linguistically and contextually appropriate Hindi version of the EPDS for use in women attending antenatal care in Sehore, Madhya Pradesh.
Methods and Material
A rigorously translated and modified Hindi version of the EPDS was developed and validated using the Hindi version of the PHQ-9 as a gold standard. A consecutive sample of women (n = 100) attending antenatal check-ups in healthcare facilities in Sehore district were interviewed.
Results
The validity measure of Receiver Operator Characteristic curve was plotted for different cutoffs of EPDS. The optimal cutoff score for the Hindi validation of the EPDS was 9/10 for antenatal depression with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 65.38%, 79.73%, 53.13%, and 86.76% respectively and area under the curve 0.7346. The internal consistency using Cronbach’s alpha was 0.86 indicating good homogeneity.
Conclusion
Findings of this study suggest that the Hindi version of the EPDS can be used as a valid measure to screen antenatal depression in India."

Aggression is common in patients with schizophrenia and is clinically significant, but its prevalence is inconsistent across studies. This is a meta-analysis of the prevalence of aggression and its associated factors in patients with schizophrenia.
Methods
PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, Medline and Web of Science databases were systematically searched. Studies that reported the prevalence of aggression in patients with schizophrenia using the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) were included and analyzed using the random-effects model.
Results
Fifteen studies with 4855 patients were initially included; of these, 13 studies with 3929 patients were pooled in the final meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of aggression was 33.3% (95%CI: 21.5%–47.7%); specifically, the estimated prevalence of verbal, property-oriented, auto and physical aggression were 42.6% (95%CI: 17.0%–72.9%), 23.8% (95%CI: 10.1%–46.4%), 23.5% (95%CI: 6.5%–57.7%), and 23.7% (95%CI: 10.4%–45.3%), respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed that different MOAS cut-off values (P < 0.001) and source of patients (inpatients vs. community-dwelling patients) significantly moderated the results (P < 0.001). Meta-regression analyses found that studies published recently reported higher aggression rate, while higher quality assessment score was associated with lower aggression rate (both P < 0.01).
Conclusions
This meta-analysis confirmed that aggression is common in schizophrenia patients. Considering the significant clinical risk issues, appropriate treatments and effective management of aggression in this population need to be developed."

Modifiable lifestyle factors such as physical activity (PA) have ameliorative effects on commonly reported health conditions in schizophrenia like cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Similarly, reduction in sedentary behaviour (SB) promotes better physical health. However, engaging individuals with schizophrenia in PA and less SB can be challenging because of symptoms of schizophrenia. The aims of the present study are (i) to examine the profiles of PA and SB in individuals with schizophrenia; and (ii) to identify their respective clinical determinants.
Method
157 individuals with schizophrenia were recruited. PA and SB were examined via the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). Psychopathology was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Potential clinical predictors of PA and SB were identified via univariate regression analyses and subsequently included in the final multiple regression models for PA and SB respectively.
Results
63.7% met the WHO PA guidelines. Work-related activity was the largest domain specific contribution towards PA. Mean duration of SB was approximately 9 h and about 57.3% reported at least 8 h or more of SB daily. Positive symptom was associated with engagement in PA and reduced duration of SB. Negative symptom was associated with greater SB.
Conclusion
With emerging evidence of deleterious health effects of SB independent of PA, it is important to monitor SB in individuals with schizophrenia, particularly those presenting with negative symptoms. While the lack of treatment response for negative symptoms remains a challenge, effort should be made to reduce duration of SB."

Methodology
59 patients with BD, for whom details of the previous assessment of MetS were available, were evaluated for MetS at follow-up. MetS was diagnosed as per the consensus criteria.
Results
At the baseline, 54.2% (N = 32) of patients fulfilled the criteria for MetS, and after the mean follow-up duration of 62.1 (SD-55.3) months, the prevalence of MetS increased to 66.1% (N = 39). Raised waist circumference was the most common abnormality at both the assessments. At baseline, the second most common abnormality was abnormal triglyceride levels, and this was followed by low high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, raised fasting blood glucose levels and abnormal blood pressure. Whereas, at follow-up assessment, the second most common abnormality was raised fasting blood glucose levels and it was followed by raised blood pressure level, followed by, abnormal triglyceride levels, and this was followed by low HDL levels.
Conclusions
The present study suggests that over a mean period of about 5 years, there is increase in the prevalence of MetS among patients with BD. Accordingly, there is a need to periodically monitor the metabolic parameter of patients with BD and interventions must be started for the same at the earliest."

Parent-mediated early behavioral interventions are considered as effective approaches in the treatment of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The majority of these interventions focus on social-communication deficits rather than behavioral excesses which severely irrupt child and family social life as well as the child's appearance behavior and learning processes. The study examines the effectiveness and feasibility of Family-based Management of Behavioral Excesses of Autism Program (FMBEAP) on Iranian families.
Method
This pre-post and follow-up intervention study involved 17 parents of children with DSM-5 diagnosis of ASD recruited from Tehran Autism Center. All parents conducted FMBEAP on their children while receiving 10-weekly group supervision on top of everyday on-line individual coaching. The study's measures were Repetitive Behavior Scale-R, video-monitoring of child-parent Interaction, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale, Parental Self-Efficacy and Parenting Stress Index-short form. The measures were applied to the sample three times: pre and post-intervention and at one-month follow-up.
Results
The Results showed high and low order behavioral excesses significantly decreased at post-intervention and the follow-up. 15 out of 17 children reached to recovered or highly recovered at post-test. Parents showed significant improvements in self-efficacy and parenting stress scales. The intervention was highly accepted by them.
Conclusion
FMBEAP is shown to be a feasible, acceptable and effective intervention to improve autistic behavioral. The parents should also benefit from the program in terms of self-efficacy and parenting stress. FMBEAP is highly recommended for overcoming behavioral excesses along with those interventions focus on behavioral deficits in ASD."

A total of 158 participants, including 79 adolescents who received ECT and their caregivers (n = 79), were enrolled in this study. Their knowledge and experiences about and attitudes towards ECT were evaluated with self-administered data collection forms.
Results
Only around half of patients and caregivers reported that they received sufficient information about the process, the therapeutic and side effects, and the risks of ECT, although most believed that ECT is beneficial, and around half believed that ECT is safe. Around one third of patients and caregivers reported that only critically ill patients should receive ECT. More than half of patients experienced side effects, such as memory impairment, headache and short-term confusion.
Conclusions
Sufficient information about ECT should be provided to adolescents with severe psychiatric disorders and their caregivers prior to treatment, with particular focus on the treatment process and possible side effects."

OCD was found in 20.6 % of subjects. Earlier age at onset, male gender, higher level of education, comorbid panic disorder, and specific phobia were associated with comorbid OCD. In terms of lifetime symptoms, depression (p = 0.001) and anxiety (p = 0.014) showed significant association with the comorbidity, which corroborates with our previous study findings regarding OCD in bipolar disorder. In addition, decreased emotional response (p = 0.016), less formal thought disorder (p = 0.007), and less prodromal impairment (p = 0.005) were independently associated with the comorbidity. The OCD group showed better performance in working memory domain (p = 0.027) while other cognitive domains did not show any significant difference between the two groups. Association of OCSs with depressive symptoms and other comorbid anxiety disorders seems to be a common finding across schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This study also suggests that comorbidity of OCD in schizophrenia is associated with less impairment of thought process and cognitive function throughout the disease course."

Illness perceptions have been associated with patients’ reactions to health threats and further health outcomes. The Illness Perception Questionnaire for Schizophrenia (IPQS)11IPQS: Illness Perception Questionnaire for Schizophrenia has been applied in different contexts. However, the validity and reliability of IPQS remain unknown in mainland China.
Aims and objectives
To test the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of IPQS in mainland China.
Design
A cross-sectional survey.
Methods
A total of 200 community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia were surveyed in Beijing, China. The validity and reliability of the instrument were tested. As well as demographic data, the IPQS and the Knowledge About Schizophrenia Test (KAST)22KAST: Knowledge About Schizophrenia Test were also administered.
Results
Factor analysis was utilised to refine the factor structure of the IPQS. The difference between IPQS and KAST denoted the discriminant validity. The subscale scores among patients of different illness duration, educational attainment, and medication adherence in the past two years were significantly different (P＜0.05), indicating the known-group validity of the IPQS. Except for ‘personal control’ and ‘burdensome effect’, other subscales were internally consistent. Most of the subscales proved stable over a four-week period.
Conclusion
The Chinese version of IPQS can be used, with some refinements, to assess illness perceptions about schizophrenia for patients in future studies. This will provide empirical evidence for its generalizability and clinical utility and provide deeper insight into Chinese patients’ illness perceptions about schizophrenia."

Extant literature lack studies on behavioural training or pharmacotherapy in Indian preschool children. With adverse long term outcomes, effective, safe and affordable early interventions for ADHD are a priority. Aim of this prospective study is to report on short term outcome of preschool ADHD with specific focus on safety and tolerability of medications.
Methods
Children with ADHD aged 2.5–6 years were assessed for severity and adverse events at baseline and follow-up using Conner’s abbreviated rating scale and Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale. Children with Autism spectrum disorder and those with social quotient less than 50 were excluded. Statistical Analysis included descriptive statistics and Repeated measures ANOVA.
Results
Of 56 children recruited, 33.93 %(N = 19) were on behavioural interventions alone, 66.07 %(N = 37) were on a combination of medication and behavioural intervention. All children received treatment according to standard care. The most prescribed drug was clonidine (44.64%), then risperidone (28.7%), methylphenidate (10.7%) and atomoxetine (10.7%). Medication choice was determined by affordability, availability and comorbidity profile. Sedation occurred in 24 % of children on clonidine. Atomoxetine was not well tolerated in 2 children. Methylphenidate was well tolerated. Irrespective of medication choice, all children showed significant improvement at 12 weeks (p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Choice of interventions is largely determined by availability and affordability. There is a need for structured parent behavioural training program deliverable in low resource setting. Anti-ADHD medications should be made available under the NMHP, RBSK program and all government settings in India, to address over-prescription of antipsychotics in preschool ADHD."

Concomitant use of complementary, multimodal imaging measures and neurocognitive measures is reported to have higher accuracy as a biomarker in Alzheimer’s dementia. However, such an approach has not been examined to differentiate healthy individuals from Bipolar disorder. In this study, we examined the utility of support vector machine (SVM) technique to differentiate bipolar disorder patients and healthy using structural, functional and diffusion tensor images of brain and neurocognitive measures.
Methods
30 patients with Bipolar disorder-I and 30 age, sex matched individuals participated in the study. Structural MRI, resting state functional MRI and diffusion tensor images were obtained using a 1.5 T scanner. All participants were administered neuropsychological tests to measure executive functions. SVM, a supervised machine learning technique was applied to differentiate patients and healthy individuals with k-fold cross validation over 10 trials.
Results
The composite marker consisting of both neuroimaging and neuropsychological measures, had an accuracy of 87.60 %, sensitivity of 82.3 % and specificity of 92.7 %. The performance of composite marker was better compared to that of individual markers on classificatory.
Conclusions
We were able to achieve a high accuracy for machine learning technique in distinguishing BD from HV using a combination of multimodal neuroimaging and neurocognitive measures. Findings of this proof of concept study, if replicated in larger samples, could have potential clinical applications."

Adolescent behavioural problems are a growing public health concern. The authors in this study investigated paternal and maternal reports of parenting attitudes and dimensions as predictors of adolescent behavioural problems in the Indian context.
Materials and methods
Using stratified sampling at the community level, 640 parents including 419 mothers and 221 fathers participated in the study. Tools included a socio-demographic pro-forma; Parental attitude inventory (PAI) to assess parenting attitudes, Parent Global Report of the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ) to assess current parenting dimensions, and the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to assess behavioural problems among adolescents. We examined the prevalence and predictors of total difficulties, externalizing and internalizing behavioural problems among adolescents from paternal and maternal reports.
Results
Paternal and maternal reports of total difficulties (11.3 %, 13.6 %), externalizing (2.3 %, 1.9 %) and internalizing behaviours (8.6 %, 7.4 %) among adolescents are reported. Predictors of abnormal behaviours per paternal reports included lower social class and poor paternal control. Being a male adolescent increased the odds of total difficulties and externalizing problems. Favourable maternal attitude, good maternal warmth and control predicted the reduced likelihood of total difficulties and externalizing behaviours per maternal reports. Paternal control and maternal warmth and control were found to reduce the likelihood of internalizing behaviours among adolescents.
Conclusion
Maternal attitude, paternal control and maternal warmth and control dimensions emerged as significant predictors of total difficulties, externalizing and internalizing behavioural problems among adolescents."

Prevalence of Cyberbully victims was found to be 32 % with higher preponderance among boys. Of the Cyberbully victims, 27.3 % suffered from any kind of psychiatric disorder which was significant (P = 0.012). Both emotional and behavioral disorders were significantly higher among the victims (21.6 % and 12.5 % respectively). Major depressive disorder alone was present in 9.1 % of Cyberbully victims which was proportionately higher from the non-victims at significant level. Majority of the bullies (60.87 %) were virtual friends. The results indicate the rising problem of Cyberbullying associated with notable amount of psychiatric disorders that needs more attention."

The high frequency of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has drawn attention to the composition of gut microbiota as a possible factor in ASD pathogenesis. However, characterization of a distinctive ASD microbial pattern is still unclear.
Objective
To conduct a narrative review on ASD microbial profile and diversity changes relative to NT children and FGID comorbidity and ASD pathogenesis.
Methodology
First, we searched the PubMed database in peer-reviewed journals for evidence regarding the current epidemiological evidence on FGID comorbidity. For the identification of a microbial profile in ASD children, only original studies examining gut bacterial and fungal abundances and diversity in ASD children and adolescents were included. Lastly, research on the role of microbial dysbiosis as an interface between genetic and environmental risk factors in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders, and specifically ASD, was examined.
Results
Prevalence and risk of FGIDs is significantly higher in ASD children and correlates with the severity of ASD. Bacterial and fungal diversity differ between ASD and NT children, indicating a difference in taxonomic abundance profiles, which have been reported at all bacterial phylogenetic levels. However, studies analyzing gut microbiota have a heterogeneous methodology and several limitations that could account for the variety of findings for each taxon. Also, covariate analysis reveals influence of demographics, diet, disease severity, GI comorbidity and allergies. Integration of these findings with changes in metabolome and genetic risk factors allowed for a better understanding of microbiota involvement in ASD pathogenesis for future research."

The study was aimed at studying binge eating behavior in urban adolescents. This was in keeping with the increasing prevalence of obesity and lifestyle disorders amongst Indian population especially in adolescent groups.
Methods
2000 adolescents English speaking schools in Mumbai were administered the Binge Eating Scale and the Eating Behaviors and Pattern Questionnaire after assent and parental consent. The prevalence of Binge eating behavior was estimated along with the socio-demographic data and other data from scale which was analyzed using the Chi square test and ANOVA where appropriate.
Results
The mean age of the total sample was 15.05 ± 1.65 years. Females reported higher Binge eating behavior than males and majority of the sample belonging to upper and lower middle- class families reported high binge eating behavior. The prevalence of Binge eating behavior was high with 1002 (50.1 %) adolescents reporting moderate binge eating while 736 (36.8 %) reporting severe binge eating. Significantly greater adolescents in the binge eating group reported irregular menses and being overweight and obese. There was a significantly greater proportion of adolescents in the binge eating group that ate out weekly and ate more fried food.
Conclusion
There is an increasing trend of obesity and lifestyle disorders in adolescent population that can be linked to Binge eating behavior however, the role of binge eating in context of one of the potential cause of lifestyle disorders and obesity has not been studied in Indian adolescents despite the prevalence of Binge eating and overweight being high in this population, we need further larger studies to corroborate the findings of this study."

This study was designed to verify the cross-cultural psychometric properties of the Functional Remission of General Schizophrenia (FROGS) scale and the four-item version (mini-FROGS) in Chinese schizophrenic individuals.
Methods
Item clustering analysis was used to show the clustering relationship among items. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the structural validity of the scale. The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) was used as a criterion to test convergent validity. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under the ROC curve (ROC-AUC) were calculated to test the sensitivity and specificity of FROGS and mini-FROGS for functional assessment. Fifty participants were randomly selected for retest at two-month intervals.
Results
A total of 228 schizophrenia individuals were enrolled in our study. The results of the item clustering analysis and CFA supported the 3-factor structure of the original scale, and all items, except for the item “absence of antisocial or violent”, showed good psychometric characteristics. The correlated coefficients between FROGS and mini-FROGS with the GAF were excellent (FROGS: r = 0.74, p＜0.01; mini-FROGS: r = 0.65, p＜0.01). The retest showed that the scale had good stability and validity over time (ICC = 0.856; 95% CI = 0.701∼0.941). Both mini-FROGS and FROGS had good sensitivity and specificity for the measurement of social function (mini-FROGS: ROC-AUC = 84.3% (76.9%–91.6%), and FROGS: ROC-AUC = 89.2% (83.0%–95.4%)), and there was no difference between the two versions of ROC-AUC (P = 0.154).
Conclusion
The results of our study showed that the Chinese version of FROGS and mini-FROGS had good psychometric properties for assessing the social function of people with schizophrenia in China. In particular, the mini-FROGS version was better used in the clinical setting because of its convenience and efficiency."

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used in the treatment of Tourette's Syndrome (TS). However, the efficacy and safety of TCM in treating TS are mixed across studies. This is a meta-analysis of studies on the efficacy and safety of TCM compared to placebo and Western medicine (WM).
Methods
PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, SinoMed, and WanFang databases were systematically searched from inception date to October 16, 2018. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) on the efficacy and safety of TCM alone or TCM + WM combination for TS were included.
Results
A total of 15 studies comprising 21 treatment trials (n = 2824) were included. TCM alone was more efficacious than placebo in terms of response rate (Relative Risk, RR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.55–2.47, P < 0.01, I2 = 45 %) and the change in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale total score (Standard mean difference, SMDs: -0.67, 95% CI: -0.81, -0.53, P < 0.01, I2 = 0 %). The results remained positive when TCM alone was compared with WM alone (RR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00–1.12, P = 0.03, I2 = 29 %), and when TCM + WM were compared with WM alone (RR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.08–1.43, P < 0.01, I2 = 0 %).

Lack of access to perinatal mental health (PMH) services is a significant public health problem in India. Barriers to accessing PMH services include the stigma, non-availability of services, poor knowledge, negative perception, attitude among perinatal women (PWs) and service providers. The present study attempted to examine the knowledge gap regarding perinatal depression (PD) among service providers [Nursing providers (NPs), Medical Practitioners (MPs)] and service utilizers (PWs).
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted in two tertiary care teaching hospitals of India, one in a major metro and the other in a rural area. PWs, MPs and NPs were assessed for knowledge about PD using a semi-structured proforma and Perinatal Depression Monitor.
Results
Among the 270 PWs, 8.51% were knowledgeable (PWA) and 91.49% were ignorant (PWB) about depression. PWB group were low educated (n = 140, 56.68%), and unemployed (n = 207, 83.80%) with lower family income [(≤₹10,356 per month), n = 170, 68.28%)]. There was knowledge discrepancy among NPs, MPs and PWA group in terms of a) PD is a normal part of pregnancy (agree- NPs = 71.52%, MPs = 10.00%, PWA-17.39%), b)biological causes of PD (agree- NPs = 45.23%, MPs = 70.00%, PWA = 26.03%) and c)antidepressant medications for PD (useful- NPs = 23.80%, MPs = 70.00%, PWA = 21.73%). Majority of the respondents agreed that all women should be screened for depression during pregnancy (NPs = 34.78%, MPs = 80.95%, PWA = 95.00%) and postpartum periods (NPs = 34.78%, MPs = 76.19%, PWA = 90.00%).
Conclusions
Low PD literacy among the PWs, misconception about aetiology and management among the NPs could be major barrier for delivery and utilisation of PD services. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve PD literacy among PWs and NPs."

Sexual minority youth (SMY) had more risk behaviors and mental health problems than heterosexual youth. Relatively little research has differentiated among lesbian/gay, bisexual, and questioning (LGBQ) youth.
Objective
To examine the differences in emotional and behavioral problems between LGBQ youth in the city of Northern Thailand.
Methods
Data were from a school-based, cross-sectional study of grade 7–12 students in secondary and vocational schools. Five hundred and forty-three students who identified themselves as LGBQ and 3829 heterosexual peers completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR).
Results
Of 12.4% of LGBQ participants, 4.1% identified themselves as lesbian/gay, 4.8% as bisexual, and 3.5% were unsure. SMY had significantly higher scores in internalizing problems (16.84 VS 13.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.94–3.77, P < 0.001), externalizing problems (15.23 VS 13.51, 95% CI 0.97–2.45, P < 0.001), and total behavioral scores (55.26 VS 47.16, 95% CI 5.55–10.63, P < 0.001) than their heterosexual peers. In sexual minority subgroup analyses, all syndrome subscales were highest in the bisexual group followed by the lesbian/gay group, and the questioning group, respectively.
Conclusion
LGBQ high school students had greater psychosocial problems than their heterosexual counterparts. Bisexual students were at the greatest risks of emotional and behavioral problems. Pediatricians and school mental health providers should be aware of emotional and behavioral problems among LGBQ students."

abstract = "Background
Most individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) have little to no insight regarding the presence of their illness. Psychoeducational programs are state-of-the-art interventions that consist in delivering stabilized patients with accurate knowledge about their illness and its treatment. Evidence suggests a significant relationship between levels of illness-related knowledge and insight in SZ patients. However, the effect of psychoeducation on these related outcomes needs to be explored further.
Methods
In this open label study involving 30 French-speaking patients with SZ, we propose to compare levels of knowledge and insight before and after the French P.A.C.T.® psychoeducation program to investigate how this approach affects both outcomes. Knowledge levels were measured with the self-questionnaire “What do I know?”. Insight levels were measured using the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD). Symptoms were assessed with the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).
Results
A large significant improvement of knowledge was observed (p < 0.001; d = 0.77). By contrast, the analysis reported no significant effect of psychoeducation on insight (p = 0.86; d = 0.07). PANSS total scores were significantly decreased after treatment (p = 0.001; d = 0.66).
Conclusions
Although the P.A.C.T.® program is a promising tool for improving illness-related knowledge in SZ patients, its use is not sufficient to significantly improve insight levels."

In this cross-sectional survey, we intended to analyze factors associated with resilience in a large group of LBC. One-stage random cluster sampling was used to select 2898 LBC aged between 10 and 17 years in Yunnan province of southwestern China. Face-to-face interview was used to collect relevant information from the participants. Resilience was measured by the Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescents (RSCA). Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that having a better educated mother, feeling closer to people living in the same residence, and having more close friends were associated with higher psychological resilience in LBC. LBC who felt less close to people living in the same residence were consistently lower in all five dimensions of resilience. Compared with LBC with 2 or less close friends, LBC with more close friends had significantly greater resilience in goal concentration, family support, and interpersonal assistance. Higher mother’s education level was related to higher resilience in emotion regulation, family support, and interpersonal assistance. Our findings suggest that dimension-specific intervention measures should be developed and implemented to improve psychological resilience of LBC."

abstract = "Background
Impaired self-awareness has often been described in schizophrenia. Recent neuroimaging studies examining the self-reflection processes in schizophrenia have produced inconsistent results.
Method
We examined the self-reflective neural network using self- and other-evaluation tasks in schizophrenia. Fifteen schizophrenia patients and fifteen age- and sex-matched healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects were required to decide whether the sentence described their own personal trait (self-evaluation) and that of their close friends (other-evaluation).
Results
Unlike normal control subjects, the schizophrenia patients did not have greater activation of the left posterior cingulate gyrus and hippocampus during self-evaluation than during other-evaluation. On the other hand, the schizophrenia patients had higher activation of the right superior frontal and right supramarginal gyri during self-evaluation than control subjects. Only the patient group exhibited hyperactivation in the left hippocampus and right external capsule associated with the other-evaluation task.
Conclusions
These findings provide evidence for an altered neural basis of self-reflective processing, which may underlie the self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia."

This paper discusses issues related to mental disorder diagnosis from a cultural perspective. It argues that psychiatric diagnoses, while having good inter-rater reliability, lack external validity. It contends that psychiatric categories and labels are supported by the current political economy of health. Nevertheless, it suggests that (i) all symptoms have a metaphoricity to convey a variety of distress, (ii) idioms are polysemious and have a capacity for multiple meaning and pragmatic implications, beyond local and cultural inferences, (iii) idioms of distress are performative, are a form of social action that effects social change, and are prone to improvisation of expression that is associated with adoption in new and changing contexts, (iv) psychiatric idioms are as easily accepted as local and folk beliefs and expressions, (v) idioms of distress are used for negotiating access to care, cure and healing across regions and cultures. The paper argues that new (psychiatric) idioms are easily adopted across regions and societies, and that they eventually change contexts and cultures."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties and factor structure of the Indonesian version of the Quality of Psychiatric Care - Inpatient Staff (QPC-IPS) instrument.
Methods
A sample of 192 permanently employed members of staff at two general psychiatric wards in Indonesia completed the QPC-IPS, which consists of 30 items covering six dimensions of quality.
Results
Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the factor structure of the Indonesian version was equivalent to that proposed from the original Swedish QPC-IPS. Internal consistency for the full QPC-IPS was adequate, but poor for some of the factors. The results thus demonstrate that the concept of quality of care expressed in the QPC-IPS is to a large extent equivalent among staff in fundamentally different health care systems and cultural contexts.
Conclusion
The Indonesian QPC-IPS is a useful instrument for evaluating staff perception of psychiatric inpatient care in Indonesia, and thus contributes to health care improvement in the field of psychiatry. The QPC-IPS can be used together with the Quality of Psychiatric Care- In-Patient (QPC-IP) instrument, which is completed by the inpatients themselves, to improve the quality of psychiatric inpatient care and national as well as international benchmarking."

We included 11 studies for meta-analysis. Of these, 8 studies comprising 1311 participants reported blood zinc and 3 studies comprising 206 participants reported hair zinc. The zinc levels in blood (SMD: -0.91, 95% CI: -1.88-0.07, P(SMD) < 0.068), and hair (SMD: 1.42, 95% CI: -4.49-7.33, P(SMD) = 0.638) not significantly compare ADHD with controls. Nevertheless, high heterogeneity (I2 > 97.3%) emerged among the included studies. The subgroup analysis showed that the heterogeneity of samples >100 group was significantly reduced. The sensitivity analysis found that the results changed significantly after excluding the only cross-sectional study. In conclusion, our meta-analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference in blood zinc and hair zinc levels between ADHD children and adolescents compared with healthy children and adolescents."

Today, most of the individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have atypical sensory behaviors. The main aim of this study is to propose an assistive intervention for supporting the overloaded sensory responses in hypersensitive individuals with ASD.
Methods
The vision, auditory, smell, and physical balance related multi-sensors based hardware prototype, namely Assistive Companion for Hypersensitive Individuals (ACHI) has been designed for individuals with ASD. The proposed ACHI prototype is an assistive-technology based companion for hypersensitive individuals with ASD which is able to ‘fetch/detect the sensory information using electronic sensors’, ‘making the decision using fuzzy logic on the basis of fetched sensory information’ and then, ‘transmit the generated information over the internet through the Internet of Things (IoT)’, and also able for ‘generating alerts to caregivers’. The proposed design is also capable of providing audio & video feedback to calm down individuals with ASD.
Results
After testing, it is observed that 93% percent of the caregivers rated the proposed ACHI intervention on the scale of above average. The remarkable reduction in hyperactive states related triggering incidents in ASD has been found with the use of ACHI.
Conclusion
The present work and the proposed prototype can identify and control the sensory overload triggers in ASD and it can guide the caregiver or clinicians to optimize the responsible surrounding causes of explosive behavior in ASD and would help the individuals with ASD to become calm."

Lithium remains a cornerstone of prophylaxis in bipolar disorder (BD), but adherence continues to be a major clinical challenge and merits a closer attention. There is scant literature available in Indian as well as Asian context.
Methods
This study was conducted at Department of Psychiatry, AIIMS, New Delhi with an aim to assess the self-reported medication adherence and its correlates among a naturalistic, lithium-maintained cohort (n = 76) with bipolar disorder. Subjects were included if they were on lithium therapy ≥1 year, met DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar disorder and were in clinical remission (≥1 month). Besides sociodemographic and clinical performa, participants were assessed on medication adherence rating scale (MARS), lithium questionnaire for knowledge and lithium attitude questionnaire (LAQ).
Results
Mean age was 35.7 ± 10.6 years (males: 59.2%); median duration of illness and lithium therapy was 84 months and 24.5 months, respectively. Mean MARS score was 6.95 ± 2.81. Regression analysis (with MARS total as dependent variable) found LAQ score to be the single most significant predictor variable (β=−0.681, p < 0.0001), explaining over 75% of the total variance. In regression model with MARS factor-1 score as dependent variable, the 'LAQ score' (β=−0.601, p < 0.0001) and 'being accompanied by family during psychiatric visits (always/mostly) in the past year' (β = 0.193, p = 0.010) emerged as significant predictor variables.
Conclusion
Adherence in lithium-maintained treatment-seeking cohort of patients with BD remains far from ideal as observed in this naturalistic setting. Lithium-related attitudes and being accompanied by family during psychiatric visits were found to be significant predictors for adherence."

For a small minority, such mental health factors can contribute to suicide. Here we report a novel reason for suicide and seemingly COVID-19-related – negligence in getting treatment by Bangladeshi healthcare providers. It was alleged that a woman committed suicide at a hospital because she was not treated and because doctors and nurses suspected she was infected with COVID-19 and did not want to get infected themselves. To help allay the fears among HCPs and the patients they are treating with COVID-19, a number of initiatives are suggested."

This literature review aims to summarize current findings from studies examined experiences of stigma among parents of children with autism.
Method
A systematic literature search was carried out to identify relevant studies. Two reviewers independently screened each records based on the selection criteria. Discrepancies were resolved through discussions. Included articles were classified by social-cultural settings.
Result
25 studies were identified and included in the review, including 15 qualitative, 8 quantitative, and 2 mixed method studies. Parents do in fact experience courtesy stigma which subsequently develop into affiliate stigma. The study of stigma has not received enough attention for parents of children with autism. There lacked large prevalence studies and longitudinal studies examining stigma among parents of children with autism.
Conclusion
Parents of children with autism perceived and experienced stigma and various consequences which were varied with behaviors of autism and the severity of symptoms. Further studies should focus on developing intervention that help to erase stigma among parents of children with autism."

abstract = "Aim
Pregnancy is one of the most sensitive periods in a person's life; therefore maternal mental illness during pregnancy increases the risk for adverse developmental outcomes in children (Jha et al., 2018). The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of psychiatric interventions in the mental health of pregnant women in Kashan, Iran.
Methods
The purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate an integrated model of mental health during pregnancy over the period of 2015–2018 in Kashan. Subjects consisted in 202 pregnant women (101 in the intervention group and 101 in the control group) who were referred to Kashan Health Centers in the 6th to 10th weeks of pregnancy. The General Health Questionnaire-28, Golombok Rust Inventory of Marital State, an interview on psychiatric symptoms, and a review of the history of the mental health of the mother and first-degree relatives were utilized for data collection. In the intervention group, psychiatric measures and predictive drug treatments were presented.
Results
Overall, from among 102 pregnant mothers, 39 women (37.14%) were identified as at-risk and high-risk. The highest number of mothers identified as at-risk and high-risk were in the first trimester of pregnancy and in the 6th to 10th weeks of care (64%). With the start of psychiatric interventions in the intervention group, the subscale of physical complaints and anxiety showed a significant decrease compared to the control group (P < 0.01). Mental health improvement was achieved in 95% of expectant mothers through Level I predictive measures, and only 5% of participants required the specialist level of intervention.
Conclusion
By identifying psychiatric disorders in pregnant mothers during the first level of pregnancy care services and taking suitable measures, an integrated model for mental health services in primary health care for pregnant women can help managers, policymakers, and decision-makers to improve health and reduce the costs in the health system in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals."

We sought to investigate the relationship between circulating RA levels and PSD in patients with ischemic stroke. From September 2018 to March 2019, we prospectively screened patients with ischemic stroke who were hospitalized within 7 days of symptoms onset. RA levels were measured after admission. All patients were followed up at 3 months after stroke. Diagnosis of PSD was made in line with the Chinese version of Structured Clinical Interview of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition criteria. PSD risk was estimated using multivariable regression models. In total, 352 ischemic stroke patients were enrolled for the final analysis. Up to 3 months after symptoms onset, 102 subjects experienced PSD. PSD patients showed significantly lower RA levels at baseline as compared to non-PSD patients. In univariate logistic analysis, reduced levels of RA was a significant predictor of PSD. These results were further confirmed in multivariate regression additionally controlled for possible relevant confounders. Our study shows that decreased serum RA levels at admission might be associated with 3-month PSD in ischemic stroke patients."

Qualitative and quantitative validation through expert review resulted in modification of H-MoCA which was tested on purposive sample of 30 subjects, and analysis was done for internal consistency reliability, then the scale was re-administered to the same group to establish test-retest reliability. Internal consistency was reported in terms of Cronbach’s alpha (α) and test-retest reliability in terms of intra class correlation coefficient (ICC). Qualitative review and Content validation ratio (Lawshe) validate the content of H-MoCA with CVR of 0.99. The scale has good internal consistency, Cronbach’s alpha (α) = 0.64 and high test-retest reliability, intra class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.87. Thus the Hindi translated version of MoCA is a valid and reliable tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment."

Education provides a platform to persons to integrate into society for their livelihood. In countries like India, higher education is accorded a significant place in society and is an important pre-requisite for most professional and skilled occupations. However there are a number of illness related and psychosocial barriers to attaining educational goals, especially for persons with Severe Mental Disorders (SMDs’). The purpose of this qualitative study is to understand the bio-psychosocial barriers of students with severe mental disorders to academic reintegration.
Methods
Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with Mental Health Professionals (MHP’s) (n = 8), Lecturers (n = 9) and Students with SMD’s (n = 14). The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and coded into themes and sub-themes separately for each group manually. Triangulation of the themes derived data collected from the three groups were subject to thematic content analysis.
Results
A total of five barriers (themes) to academic reintegration were derived from triangulated data: 1. Illness and its treatment-related barriers, 2. Individual related barriers, 3. Family-related barriers, 4. Academic-related barriers and 5. Social barriers.
Conclusion
It is important for mental health professionals and researcher in the field to understand the above barriers in order to plan and implement supported education programmes effectively and enable the students to attain their post-secondary educational goals."

abstract = "Background
Mental Health problems are one of the leading disabilities worldwide. Individuals seeking help for their mental illness expect nurses to be cognisant of their needs without prejudice and discrimination. Existing evidences suggest a growing number of patient referral from primary healthcare to psychiatric consultations. This study aimed to explore primary healthcare nurses’ knowledge and attitude towards mental illness and people with mentally illness.
Methods
A cross-sectional study using the Mental Health Problem Perception and the Community Attitudes to Mental Illness questionnaires. Descriptive and multivariate regression using maximum likelihood procedures were applied.
Results
Regression analysis showed significantly high correlation between knowledge and authotarianism (β = 0.775, p = 0.007) and moderate inverse correlation with social restrictiveness (β = −0.517, p < 0.001). However, no significant correlation with benevolence (β = −0.057, p = 0.181) was detected. Nurses with higher educational level were significantly associated with authotarianism attitude.
Conclusions
This is the first study examining knowledge and attitude of primary healthcare nurses in Brunei. The relationship between the study variables as well as demographic factors, in comparison to other countries, were discussed. Overall, negative attitude among nurses is still a challenging issue; therefore, developing re-education initiatives and increase contact time, especially for healthcare front liners with negative attitudes regardless of education level, to favour change of attitude, is important to foster holistic care to people with mental illness and promote mental health in the population."

abstract = "Determining depression symptoms in schizophrenic patients is a challenging process because of a degree of similarity between depression symptoms and negative symptoms and the extrapyramidal side effects of neuroleptic drugs, but it is crucial to evaluate and measure depression among patients with schizophrenia for a better clinical outcome. The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) is a valid and reliable instrument used for the evaluation of depression in schizophrenia. This study aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the Persian version of CDSS in a sample of people with schizophrenia. Clinical interviews were conducted with 95 schizophrenic patients (40 inpatients and 55 outpatients), who were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17 and HDRS-24 items), and the Calgary Depression Rating Scale (CDSS). Then an exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine correlations between scales, Cronbach’s alpha, and cutoff scores. The factor analysis led to the extraction of a unifactorial solution. The CDSS had significant relationships with PANSS Negative and PANSS General. However, it had no significant relationship with PANSS Positive and the PANSS Total. The CDSS also had significant relationships with HDRS-17 and HDRS-24. In addition, Cronbach’s alpha of total score, test-retest reliability, and cutoff score were estimated at 0.86, 0.82, and 8 (sensitivity = 0.79 and specificity = 0.84), respectively. The findings support the CDSS unifactorial approach. Results also showed that the CDSS Persian version had acceptable psychometric properties; thus, it could be employed to evaluate depression among schizophrenic patients."

Internet use has increased worldwide exponentially over the past two decades, with no up-to-date cross-country comparison of Problematic Internet Use (PIU) and its correlates available. The present study aimed to explore the pattern and correlates of PIU across different countries in the European and the Asian continent. Further, the stability of factors associated with PIU across different countries were assessed.
Materials and methods
An international, cross-sectional study with a total of 2749 participants recruited from universities/colleges of eight countries: Bangladesh, Croatia, India, Nepal, Turkey, Serbia, Vietnam, and United Arab Emirates (UAE). Participants completed the Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale -2 (GPIUS2) assessing PIU, and the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS) assessing the depressive and anxiety symptoms.
Results
A total of 2643 participants (mean age 21.3 ± 2.6; 63% females) were included in the final analysis. The overall prevalence of PIU for the entire sample was 8.4% (range 1.6% to 12.6%). The mean GPIUS2 standardized scores were significantly higher among participants from the five Asian countries when compared to the three European countries. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were the most stable and strongest factors associated with PIU across different countries and cultures.
Discussion and conclusions
The PIU is an important emerging mental health condition among college/university going young adults, with psychological distress being the strongest and most stable correlate of PIU across different countries and cultures in this study. The present study highlighted the importance of screening university and college students for PIU."

The present meta-analysis was designed to evaluate association of MTHFR 677C > T and 1298A > C polymorphisms with risk of autism. A comprehensive literature search was done in PubMed, EMBASE, and CNKI databases to identify all eligible publications up to April 01, 2019. Finally, 25 case-control studies including 18 studies on MTHFR 677C > T and 7 studies on MTHFR 1298A > C polymorphism were selected. Overall, a significant association was found between MTHFR 677C > T and an increased risk of autism under all five genetic models (T vs. C: OR = 1.483, 95% CI 1.188–1.850, p ≤ 0.001; TT vs. CC: OR = 1.834, 95% CI 1.155–2.913, p = 0.010; TC vs. CC: OR = 1.512, 95% CI 1.101–2.078, p = 0.011; TT + TC vs. CC: OR = 1.632, 95% CI 1.261–2.113, p ≤ 0.001; and TT vs. TC + CC: OR = 1.427, 95% CI 1.002–2.032, p = 0.049). However, no significant association was found between MTHFR 1298A > C and autism risk. Stratified analyses showed that MTHFR 677C > T and 1298A > C polymorphisms are involved in genetic susceptibility of autism by ethnicity. Results of this meta-analysis indicated that MTHFR 677C > T polymorphism may be associated with increased risk of autism in overall and by ethnicity, while MTHFR 1298A > C was reported to be significantly associated with the risk of autism only in Caucasians. MTHFR polymorphisms could be used as a diagnostic marker for autism with respect to ethnicity background."

This cross-sectional study was conducted during a 5 month period (2014) in four teaching hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. Convenience sampling was done to recruit pregnant women availing obstetrics and gynecology services for routine prenatal or perinatal care in the respective departments of the four institutes. Trained interviewers interviewed the consenting participants using a pre-tested scale. All data were analyzed using SPSS v.20. Factor structure of the HADS was explored using Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) method. Goodness of fit of the factor structure was assessed using the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Cronbach’s alpha value for whole scale was good (α = 0.81). Sensitivity analysis involving assessment of Cronbach’s alpha value after removal of each item, did not reveal any major deviations in overall internal consistency of the HADS. Parallel analysis suggested one factor solution to be viable. When one factor was extracted as a uni-dimensional measure of anxiety and depression: item 11 (I feel restless as I have to be on the move) and 14 (I can enjoy a good book or radio or TV program) were deemed problematic for having low communalities and factor loading values."

Regular surveys are important to monitor the use of psychotropic medications in clinical practice. This study examined the psychotropic prescription patterns in adult Asian schizophrenia patients based on the data of the Research on Asian Psychotropic Prescription (REAP) 2016 survey.
Methods
: This cross-sectional survey across 15 Asian countries/territories collected socio-demographic and clinical data with standardized procedures between March and May 2016. The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded with a standardized questionnaire.
Results
Altogether 3,537 adult patients with schizophrenia were consecutively screened and enrolled in the survey. The mean age was 38.66 ± 11.55 years and 59.7% of the sample were male. The mean dose of antipsychotics in chlorpromazine equivalents (CPZeq) was 424 ± 376 mg/day; 31.3% and 80.8% received first- and second- generation antipsychotics, respectively and 42.6% had antipsychotic polypharmacy, 11.7% had antidepressants, 13.7% had mood stabilizers, 27.8% had benzodiazepines, and 45.6% had anticholinergics.
Conclusions
Psychotropic prescription patterns in Asian adult patients with schizophrenia varied across countries. Regular surveys on psychotropic medications for schizophrenia are important to monitor pharmacotherapy practice in Asia."

There was no significant relationship between the serum PGE2, 15d-PGJ and PPARγ levels and CRP levels.In this study, the evidence of systemic inflammatory conditions in patients with schizophrenia was found. The duration of the disease has been found to be the only variable that independently affects all three biomarker levels in the patients with schizophrenia."

Digital technology offers opportunities to train community health workers to deliver psychological treatments towards closing the gap in existing mental health services in low-resource settings. This study explored the acceptability and feasibility of using digital technology for training community health workers to deliver evidence-based brief psychological treatment for depression in rural India.
Methods
This study consisted of two sequential evaluations of digital training prototypes using focus group discussions to explore community health worker perspectives about the digital training platform and the program content. Through an iterative design process, feedback was collected about the first prototype to inform modifications to the second prototype. Qualitative data was analyzed using a framework analysis approach.
Results
Thirty-two community health workers participated in three separate focus group discussions. Five overarching themes related to acceptability and feasibility of digital training revealed that training on detection and treatment of depression was considered important by study participants for addressing ‘stress’ and ‘tension’ within their communities, while the digital platform was viewed as useful and convenient despite limited familiarity with using digital technology. Moreover, participants suggested simple language for the program and use of interactive content and images to increase interest and improve engagement.
Discussion
Digital technology appears acceptable and feasible for supporting training of community health workers to deliver evidence-based depression care in rural India. These findings can inform use of technology as a tool for developing the clinical skills of community health workers for treating depression in low-resource settings."

Self-report measures of sensation seeking though commonly used in research have not undergone factor structure or psychometric validation in Indian adolescents. The Brief Sensation Seeking Scale - Chinese (BSSS-C; Chen et al., 2013) is a less culture specific tool with excellent psychometric properties and presents a suitable option for use with Indian adolescents.
Aim
The present study aims to validate the factor structure, evaluate the psychometric properties, and examine the gender invariance of the BSSS-C in Indian adolescents.
Methods
A community sample of adolescent, n = 2079, with mean age 17 years (SD = 1.71) completed the BSSS-C, the BIS/BAS, and the Adolescent Risky Behaviour scales.
Results
The four factor structure of the BSSS-C exhibited good to excellent model fit, acceptable internal consistency reliability (α = 0.77) and, adequate construct as well as concurrent validity in Indian adolescents. Invariance testing revealed that the factor configuration and factor loadings of the BSSS-C were equivalent across the gender. Three of the four BSSS-C latent factors were amenable for mean comparisons across the gender.
Conclusion
BSSS-C is a reliable measure of the four dimensional model of sensation seeking in Indian adolescents. The gender differences in the BSSS-C factors are attributable to real differences in sensation seeking construct between male and female adolescents."

The epidemiology of suicide within the elderly is unique to each cultural setting. In most countries, despite the higher rate of suicide attempts among adolescents and young people, the rate of suicide deaths in the elderly is higher than other age groups. The purpose of this study was to investigate the suicide rates among persons 65 years and above in Fars, Iran.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, we investigated suicide cases (65 years and older) during 2011–2016 in Fars, Iran. The data were collected from the Mental Health and Suicide Surveillance Systems of Fars province, using filled forms that included suicide and demographic information. After eliminating duplications, suicidal rates were calculated.
Results
Of 299 suicide attempts, 64.9% were men, and 69.6% were urban residents. The rate of suicide attempts and deaths were 21.47 and 4.52 per 100,000 population, respectively; and the case fatality rate (CFR) of suicide was 21.07% during the study period. The rate of suicide attempts and deaths in this population showed an increase during the study years.
Conclusions
Considering the increasing trend of suicide rates in the elderly in Fars, Iran, measures should be taken to facilitate the access of this group to the mental health care system and psychological counseling."

A secondary analysis of cross-sectional data among geriatric outpatients at psychiatric clinics in Thailand with respect to whether patients had depressive disorders according to DSM-IV by using Mini-Neuropsychiatric Interviews (MINI). MINI-Module C was used to assess suicidality. Other measures included the experience of close relationship questionnaire and a brief cognitive assessment, Mental Status Examination T10. One-hundred and ninety-one elderly people were included, 50.8% females and 119 (62.3%) had depressive disorder. Anxiety attachment predicted suicidality, determined with questions related to the following areas; “want to hurt myself”, “suicidal ideation”, “suicidal planning”, and “suicidal attempted in lifetime”. Anxiety attachment style was significantly increased the level of suicide risk. We concluded that high anxious attachment, such as preoccupied attachment style, was associated with suicidality in elderly people. Further investigation focusing on variables associated with attachment and suicidality, particularly depression or anxiety, is warranted."

A crucial difference between them lies in the self-processing of the phantom signals, which is intact in TN patients but lost in SCZ-AH. Our study sets out to investigate the potential neural mechanisms for this crucial psychotic symptom of SCZ-AH under the framework of self. We gathered resting-state fMRI data from three participant groups: SCZ-AH, TN and healthy controls. Focusing on predefined self-related regions-of-interest, we found that SCZ-AH had reduced degree centrality in the right anterior insula (rAI) compared to both TN and healthy controls. Further functional connectivity analysis showed a reduced connectivity between the rAI and right superior temporal gyrus. Our finding indicates that compromised self-processing in SCZ-AH could be due to aberrant connectivity in rAI, which interacted with the decreased connectivity between rAI and auditory cortex, and jointly contributed to the misattribution of the source of the phantom sound. Our findings provided preliminary evidence for the neural mechanism of self-disorder underlying SCZ-AH, and could provide implications for investigating other modalities of hallucinations in schizophrenia."

Opioid substitution therapy is an evidence-based treatment for opioid dependence syndrome. Retention in treatment is a crucial mediator of treatment success. Our study aims to examine factors associated with early treatment non-compliance among patients who are initiated on office-based Buprenorphine Maintenance Treatment (BMT).
Method
This is a prospective observational study conducted among 89 subjects who were initiated on BMT and were followed up to 6 weeks. At baseline, we evaluated subjects using: Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus, Addiction Severity Index-Lite, Multi-Dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Heroin Craving Questionnaire, and urine toxicological analysis. Treatment adherence for six weeks was noted.
Results
Among Eighty-nine subjects, 57 per cent of the sample reported addiction to pharmaceutical opioids. The mean dose of Buprenorphine was 6.7 mg (SD = 4.1). During follow up 67 per cent (n = 62) patients were adherent to treatment while 33 per cent (n = 27) non-adherent to treatment. The mean dose of buprenorphine in the non-adherent group was significantly lower than the adherent group (4.3 mg and 7.7 mg, respectively, t [87] = 3.8, p < 0.001). A comparison of groups based on the dose of Buprenorphine (6 mg or higher vs lower than 6 mg) revealed that odds of treatment non-adherence were three times higher in patients receiving 6 mg or lesser dose (Odds Ratio = 3.15 [95% CI = 2.0–8.6],χ2 [1] = 4.75, p = 0.035).
Conclusion
Dose of Buprenorphine prescribed by the treating clinician influences early treatment compliance significantly."

abstract = "Background
Prescription drug suicide merits study to guide the development of strategies to reduce suicide risk. We examined prescription drug suicide specifically in non-abusers of prescription drugs; this is a relatively unexplored subject.
Methods
Six-year data on prescription drug suicide in non-abusers were extracted from the records of the Department of Forensic Medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. These records contained information obtained from the scene of the suicide, from interviews with relatives of the deceased, and from forensic toxicological analyses at two laboratories.
Results
There were 27 (8%) cases of prescription drug suicide in non-abusers out of 338 cases of suicidal poisoning. The mean age of this sample was 26 years. The sample was 74% male. Nearly half of the cases (44%) were students. A combination of dextropropoxyphene with dicyclomine, with or without paracetamol, was used by 41% of cases. Overdose was achieved through the ingestion of 10–40 (median, 30) tablets or by the injection of 2–3 (median, 2) vials of medication. In 52% of cases, it appeared that the drugs had been procured over the counter.
Conclusions
It is reassuring that the absolute number of prescription drug suicides in non-abusers was small; the findings, however, are important because they could serve as a baseline for assessing time trends in future studies. For the present, we suggest that prescription drugs of potential abuse, especially those containing opioids and antispasmodics, should be prescribed and dispensed judiciously, especially to youth."

The Nepali ARQ was self-administered in 512 adolescent students with 46.7% boys between the age of 13 and 19 years (M = 16.07 years, SD = 1.49) enrolled in six secondary schools in Lalitpur, Nepal. Test-retest reliability was assessed among 52 adolescent students within an interval of two weeks.
Results
: Findings confirmed 12 scales and 5 domain factor structure of adolescents’ resilience. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (α) for the scales and domains ranged between 0.64-0.86 and 0.71-0.86. The values of Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed that test-retest reliability of the scales and domains ranged between good and excellent with an overall ICC 0.95 (95% CI 0.92–0.97).
Conclusion
: The Nepali version of the ARQ can be used to measure resilience among adolescents in Lalitpur, Nepal. Further studies are recommended to assess adolescents’ resilience using the ARQ in diverse settings including communities of various provinces and regions of Nepal."

abstract = "Background
Despite the well-established efficacy of the long acting depot injectable (LAIs) antipsychotics, these are significantly underused and underutilized by the mental health professionals, with a belief that patients will not accept the same.
Aims & objectives
To explore the acceptability and perception of patients towards various psychiatric treatments, with specific focus on LAIs. Additionally the study aimed to compare the acceptability of various types of treatments including LAIs between patients with severe mental disorders (Psychotic disorders and Bipolar disorder) and those with Common mental disorders (Anxiety, neurotic and depressive disorders).
Methodology
A self-designed semi-structured questionnaire was used to evaluate the preferred treatment options of all the new patients attending the psychiatry outpatient clinic of a tertiary care hospital. Depending on the response, they were further probed for the reasons for accepting or rejecting the LAIs.
Results
2659 patients were interviewed who were divided into two groups (Group I - 321 subjects with psychotic disorders and 120 subjects with bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) and Group II – 2218 subjects with neurotic, stress-related and unipolar depressive disorders). More than three-fourth (78.8%) of the participants in the whole study sample opted for tablets only as their first preferred choice and injectables were opted by about 5% of the participants only, with no significant difference between the 2 groups. After being explained about LAIs, one fourth of the participants (24.9%) reported that they may consider LAIs, without any significant difference between the 2 groups. Among those who refused to take LAIs even after explanation, the commonly reported reasons were difficulty in visiting hospital frequently for the injectables (41.69%), injectables being painful (19.41%), fear of injections (13.96%), no need to take LAIs (12.45%) and preference to take some other types of medicines (8.52%).
Conclusions
Considering the fact that LAIs are highly underused in patients with severe mental disorders and there is lack of awareness about LAIs among patients with severe mental disorders, the present study findings suggest that there is reasonable level of acceptance of LAIs among patients with severe mental disorders when explained about the same."

Ninety-eight outpatients undergoing psychotherapy were evaluated using a semistructured diagnostic interview for DSM-IV Personality disorders. Correlational analysis and Rasch analysis were used to identify the best-fitted items for the shorter scale. Rasch analysis identified three underfitted items. The best five items were selected for the Short-Bord using two analyses, resulting in two sets of Short-Bord which included item 1 (becoming frantic when someone left), item 2 (up- and- down relationships), item 3 (sudden change of sense of self), item 8 (self-harm or suicide), item 9 (self-mutilation), item 10 (sudden mood change) and item 11 (feeling empty inside). Each set of the five-item Short-Bord were tested against the original 15-item BPD scale. Results showed that both sets of the Short-Bord yielded minimally lower in area under curve (AUC = 0.95 and 0.96, respectively) compared with the total score of 15 items (AUC = 0.97), but none significantly differed (chi-square = 0.89-2.87, df 1, p >.05). Internal consistency for the set from Rasch analysis was slightly higher than correlation methods (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.80, and 0.78, respectively). The Short-Bord presents promising tool to screen for borderline personality disorder. Its diagnostic validity was comparable to the total 15 items despite completing in a shorter time. The Short-Bord derived from Rasch analysis was, however, preferable as all items were shown to have unidimensional construct with good fit statistics and good internal consistency."

Psychological and sociological factors like loneliness have a noteworthy influence on the aging. Very less is known about loneliness amongst the elderly populations living with various Non-communicable diseases.
Aim
The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and correlates of loneliness among elderly patients with Non-communicable diseases.
Methodology
296 patients attending the chronic disease clinic of two Community Health Centres were evaluated on University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale (UCLA LS), Geriatric Depression Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7 scale) and Vulnerability to Abuse Screening Scale.
Results
More than half (55.4%) of the participants experienced loneliness as per the three item UCLA LS. When the total scores of UCLA scale were used to evaluate the severity of loneliness, half of the study participants had either moderate (N = 39; 13.2%), moderately high (N = 52; 17.6%) and high (N = 55; 18.6%) level of loneliness. Higher proportion of patients experiencing loneliness had anxiety and reported abuse. Significant predictors of loneliness included presence of diabetes mellitus or hypertension, generalized anxiety disorder and abuse.
Conclusion
Older adults living with non-communicable diseases are at a higher risk for loneliness. Mutual help groups kind of models can be developed to help in "re-peopling" elderly. Primary health centres should help in improving the overall health and morale amongst the elderly by stamping down their apprehensions and anxieties."

This new Law marks a major shift in the way mental healthcare is delivered, as it aims to protect and promote the rights of people during the delivery of mental healthcare. Within this Act, a capacitous individual cannot be coerced into receiving treatment for mental illness and inpatient admissions can be ‘independent’ or ‘supported’. ‘Supported admission’ replaces involuntary admission from the previous legislation. State mental health authorities and mental health review boards will play a major role in the implementation of the new Act. The Mental Healthcare Act 2017 is aimed at bringing about radical transformation to mental healthcare in India."

Previous studies have shown that some SNPs within the adenylate cyclase gene could affect the therapeutic response to mood stabilizers and antidepressants. Moreover, in 2014, one whole-genome study suggested that the ADCY-2 gene may be associated with BPD (Mühleisen et al., 2014).

The measures included sociodemographic questions, internet and health-related variables, the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The prevalence of PIU was 32.6% among the respondents (cut-off score of ≥50 on the IAT). The prevalence of PIU was higher in males in comparison to females, although the difference was not statistically significant. Internet-related variables and psychiatric comorbidities were positively associated with PIU. From the unadjusted model, more frequent use of the internet and more time spent on the internet were identified as strong predictors of PIU, whereas the adjusted model showed depressive symptoms and stress only as strong predictors of PIU. It is hoped this preliminary study will facilitate further study on PIU along with other psychiatric disorders in Bangladesh."

: The study aimed to assess and compare fractional anisotropy (FA) in bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi (SLF) and arcuate fasciculi (AF) across schizophrenia with auditory hallucinations(AH), without AH, and healthy controls using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography.
Methodology
: Right-handed adult (18–50 years) individuals with DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia with AH (group-I; n=30) were compared to those without lifetime AH (group-II; n=32) and healthy controls (group-III; n=30). Severity of psychosis in groups-I and II was assessed using SAPS, SANS, and CGI-SCH, and psychopathology was assessed using PSYRATS. The FA was calculated for all images on DTI studio-version 3.0 using tractography technique.
Results
: All three groups were comparable for age, gender, education and illness-severity. Schizophrenia subjects with AH had significantly lower FA values in bilateral SLF and AF compared to those without AH and healthy controls. No difference was observed in corresponding FA values between schizophrenia without AH and healthy controls.
Conclusion
: White matter disruptions in bilateral SLF and AF appear to be specific to schizophrenia with AH and must be explored further as potential marker of AH, pending replication in other studies."

On neurocognitive domains (after adjusting for co-variates) significant differences were noted between the two groups in terms of processing speed (TMT-A; I > II; p-value -0.009), verbal fluency (COWA;I < II;p-value-0.001) and cognitive flexibility (TMT-B; I > II; p -0.031). Compared to patients with adult onset schizophrenia, patients with childhood & adolescent onset schizophrenia had significantly higher PANSS negative score, higher disability in all domains of IDEAS, poorer socio-occupational functioning, low global functioning and reported more stigma in the domains of alienation and discrimination.In patients with childhood & adolescent onset schizophrenia, higher deficits in the processing speed and verbal fluency were associated with significantly lower socio-occupational functioning and higher disability; higher executive dysfunction was associated with higher internalized stigma. Among patients with adult onset schizophrenia, higher disability was related to executive dysfunction only and higher stigma was associated with poor cognitive processing, selective attention and poor executive functioning.
Conclusions
The present study suggests that compared to adult onset schizophrenia, patients with childhood & adolescent onset schizophrenia have more deficits in neurocognition, have higher level of disability, poorer socio-occupational functioning and have higher level of self-stigma."

To determine the prevalence of alcohol use disorders in people charged with homicide in Singapore. We also sought to determine which historical risk factors were associated with the use of alcohol 24 h prior to the homicide and with the presence of a severe mental illness at the material time of the offence.
Methods
We extracted data from administrative records of all people charged with homicide in Singapore between 2007 and 2014. We used regression models to adjust for known confounding variables and explore the relationship between alcohol use and homicide.
Results
Of 253 homicide offenders, 141 individuals (56%) meeting criteria for alcohol use disorders at the time of the offence. 121 offenders (48%) consumed alcohol within the 24 h preceding the homicide. Of the 149 that met criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis, 35 had a severe mental illness.
Conclusion
Alcohol use disorders are by far the most common disorder diagnosed in people charged with homicide in Singapore. Alcohol use is less common in homicide offenders with SMI."

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) usually emerges during adolescence and is associated with severe morbidity. Individuals with BPD are also vulnerable to develop eating disorders as well as mood disorders.
Objective
To study the prevalence of borderline personality and its association with binge-eating and bipolar spectrum disorder in college students.
Methods
A questionnaire based survey was conducted on a convenience sample of 500 college students (>18 years of age) in medical and engineering campus. Participants were screened on self-report measures including McLean Screening Instrument for BPD (MSI-BPD), Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and Binge-Eating Disorder Screener (BEDS-7) for BPD, bipolar spectrum disorder (BSD) and binge-eating disorder (BED), respectively.
Results
The prevalence of BPD was 76 (15.2%, 95% CI 12.3–18.6), BSD was 43 (8.6%, 95% CI 6.4–11.5) and BED was 48 (9.6%, 95% CI 7.2–12.6). There was a significantly higher proportion of BSD (OR 23.6, 95% CI 11.3–49.3) and BED (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.8–6.5) among those with BPD than those without.
Conclusions
BPD was found in 15% of adolescents and they have higher proportion of BED and BSD. Early identification may help in planning early intervention strategies to reduce associated morbidity."

This study sought to assess prevalence rate, comorbidity and predictors of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety among adolescents affected by the 2016 Aceh Earthquake.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted six months after the earthquake. The multi-stage random sampling method was applied to a selection of respondents from district schools. A total of 321 students participated in the study. In addition to generating demographic data, a brief PTSD inventory, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire and the Disaster Impact Questionnaire (DIQ) were administered.
Results
Approximately 58.3%, 16.8% and 32.1% of adolescents reported the clinical symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety, respectively. The associations and comorbidity between PTSD, depression, and anxiety were statistically significant (p = 0.001). Gender, depression, having directly seen someone injured or trapped, the injury or hospitalization of a member of the nuclear family and being afraid to stay inside a building since the earthquake were demonstrated to be the significant predictors for PTSD. The injury and hospitalization of a member of the nuclear family and feeling stressed after the earthquake were significant predictors for depression. Having been injured, having one’s house destroyed; being afraid to stay inside a building and gender were significant predictors for generalized anxiety disorder.
Conclusions
The prevalence of PTSD in the current study population is relatively high and the fact that a significant number of adolescents were afraid to stay inside a building following the earthquake calls for further investigation and treatments."

DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure—Adult (APA, 2013) is a self-reported instrument to measure comorbidity of psychiatric symptomology. Translation and validation of this instrument contribute to the literature, both in terms of its availability in native language Urdu and its usefulness in the prison settings of Pakistan.
Aim
The purpose of the present study is to translate DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure—Adult (APA, 2013) and to measure comorbid psychiatric symptomology among convicted criminals of Central Jail Bahawalpur (CJB) and Central Jail Sahiwal (CJS).
Materials and Method
Cross-sectional design was used and guideline proposed by Mapi Institute (Acquadro et al., 2012) was used for the translation and adaptation process. Data were collected from 362 imprisoned convicts.
Statistical analysis
For construct validity, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was done by taking domains as continuous variables. The analysis was conducted using AMOS. Cross-tabulation analysis was conducted to see the association of comorbid psychiatric symptomology with respect to crime-related variables by using SPSS.
Results and Conclusion
Goodness of fit showed that the translated version of the instrument has a satisfactory to good construct validity. For domains with more than one items, Guttmann and Alpha reliability analysis showed satisfactory reliability of domains (.52–.71) and Alpha reliability of .89 for the overall instrument. Sleep disturbance and anger related symptoms showed a high prevalence in the current sample. Current and previous crime-related variables do associate significantly with comorbid psychiatric symptomology."

Aim
To describe impact of Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) on OOP expenditure incurred by families of persons with severe mental illness (PSMI).
Methods
The sample comprised 95 PSMI who switched from treatment from other mental health facilities to CBR at Jagaluru, India.
Results
The PSMI were predominantly male (52%) with mean age 41 years and diagnosed with psychosis (75%). Most of them (84%) were earlier taking treatment from private sector and spent on an average Rs. 15,074 (US $ 215) per PSMI per annum in availing treatment. After availing CBR, the annual expenditure reduced to Rs 492 (US $ 7) on an average per PSMI. OOP expenditure on medicines (largest head of expenditure) and psychiatrist consultation fee dropped to zero.
Discussion
After excluding costs incurred to run the CBR, the net savings for the system for 95 PSMI included in study alone was Rs 3,83,755 (US $ 5,482) per annum. The amount would be much higher on including savings for PSMI initiated on treatment for the first time and PMI on regular follow-up in CBR.
Conclusions
Provision of CBR in partnership with public health system and NGO’s leads to dramatic fall in OOP health expenditure of families of PSMI. It is also cost-effective to the system."

Objective
This study aimed at systematically evaluating a representative sample of research conducted using NIBS interventions in neuro-psychiatric conditions, and assessing the power these studies achieved, given their sample sizes.
Methods
A database search was conducted with defined keyword combinations. Using reported summary effects of the meta-analyses as estimate of the true effects, we calculated achieved power of each individual study to detect the effect indicated by the corresponding meta-analysis.
Results
Findings suggest that mean and median powers in the field of NIBS were 0.50, with a mode at 0.83 (range 0.05–1.00). When analysed separately, the median powers were 0.27 for tDCS, 0.70 for TMS and 0.97 for ECT. These studies had a mean total sample size of 22.2 ± 24.9 subjects and the median reported effect size across all studies was 0.61.
Conclusion
According to our findings, studies conducted in NIBS miss around 50% of true positive results. Further, it appears that most of the researchers in this field chase statistical significance with small sample sizes, thus compromising the quality of their conclusions."

abstract = "Background
The Preschool version of the Dimensions of Mastery Questionnaire (DMQ-18) is a popular instrument to assess children’s ability to master the environment through action or activity to explore, influence, or control the physical atmosphere. Although this instrument was originally developed in English, it has now been translated and validated in five other languages: Hungarian, Turkish, Chinese, Spanish, and Persian. As we notice a growing interest in research on the mastery motivation among Bangladeshi preschoolers, we have taken this effort to translate and validate the DMQ-18 and explore the factor structure of the Bangla version of this questionnaire.
Method
After translating all 39 items of the questionnaire into Bangla, it was administered on 206 children, aged 3 to 6 years, recruited randomly from ten preschools in Dhaka. The schools were selected randomly from the official list of preschools prepared by the Dhaka City Corporation. Class teachers of the respective children completed the questionnaire with the assistant of research assistants.
Results
The Bangla version of the questionnaire retained all 39 items, with seven factors as they were in the English version. The Bangla version shows sufficient reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.87; test-retest reliability = 0.89 for whole questionnaire and .79–.89 for sub-scales; inter-rater reliability = 0.88 for whole questionnaire and .79–.88 for sub-scales), and validity (correlated positively with the English version; r = 0.85).
Conclusion
Due to its robust psychometric properties, the Bangla DMQ-18 is suggested to be used for Bangladeshi preschool children to assess their mastery motivation."

18F-FDG-PET is a potential sensitive biomarker indicating neuronal damage. 18F-FDG-PET has proven to be useful in subtyping dementia. Utility of simultaneous 18F-FDG-PET and MRI-brain was investigated in the evaluation of dementia in this facility.
Method
All case notes of patients who underwent 18 F-FDG-PET/MRI brain attending the Geriatric Clinic for 18 month period between January 2017 and June 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Their socio-demographic details, MRI-brain finding, 18F- FDG-PET findings and comorbid illnesses were studied.
Results
A total of 21 patients underwent 18F-FDG-PET/MRI brain during study period. The mean age was 61.23, SD-8.6 years (range: 36–75 years). Among them 5 (23.8%) had Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 16 (76.2%) had dementia. Majority of patients had early onset cognitive decline (76.2%). Based on the pattern of hypometabolism, the MCI group had one patient each indicative of AD, Semantic-Frontotemporal dementia (Semantic-FTD), mixed Alzheimer’s dementia (AD + FTD) and two patients had patterns suggestive of Behaviour Variant of FTD (Bv-FTD). In Dementia group the pattern of hypometabolism was indicative of Bv-FTD in seven, AD in four, Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) in one, Semantic-FTD in one, Mixed AD-Diffuse Lewy Body Dementia (DLBD) in one and no specific pattern in two patients. MRI and 18 F-FDG-PET brain had concordance in 9 (56.26%) patients.
Discussion
18F-FDG-PET/MRI helped in overall clinical diagnosis and management in 19 (90.5%) patients especially with early onset dementia. In MCI group it indicated underlying aetiology and in dementia group it helped in subtyping.
Conclusion
The study supports the role of 18F-FDG-PET/MRI as an emerging diagnostic tool to assist in dementia evaluation in India."

Disorders of mother-infant bonding have been described since early 20th Century. Previous studies have looked at the prevalence of bonding disorders among mothers with postpartum psychiatric disorders. However, its frequency among healthy postpartum mothers is less studied.
Methods
Two hundred and fifty mother-infant dyads were studied using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), the Stafford Interview, Bangalore Maternal Behaviour Scale (BMBS) and Tamil versions of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ). The mothers were interviewed between 4 weeks to six months postpartum. In addition, thirty one mothers with a lifetime history of psychiatric disorders were interviewed using the above scales.
Results
The frequency of bonding disorders was found to be 24% among healthy postpartum mothers as against 45.2% in mothers with psychiatric disorder. However, the frequency of mild disorders of bonding was relatively lower at 5.6% among healthy mothers and 6.5% among mothers with psychiatric disorders. We found that mothers in India had a clinging / over-involved subtype of anxiety that prevented them from leaving their baby under care of another competent adult. While infant-related anxiety was seen in 10% of healthy mothers, about 20% of mothers with psychiatric diagnoses had anxiety. The presence of bonding disorders was not correlated with any maternal or infant related factors except difficulty in breastfeeding.
Conclusions
Disorders of mother infant bonding are seen in healthy postpartum mothers. The frequency of mild disorders of bonding appears to be similar across countries and this condition warrants further attention."

The prevalence of catatonia varies with the setting and type of rating scale used to measure catatonia. Catatonia, initially subsumed under schizophrenia, now is increasingly recognized in association with affective disorders.
Aim
We aimed to examine the prevalence of catatonia in an acute psychiatric inpatient unit in a tertiary center in India.
Methods
Study subjects (n = 300) were randomly selected from amongst the inpatients over one year and evaluated within 24 h of admission using BFCRS and NCS, besides a sociodemographic and clinical proforma. During the inpatient stay MINI PLUS 5.0 was applied.
Results
Among 300 inpatients recruited, 88 (29.3%) demonstrated at least one catatonic sign in either of the rating scales. As per the diagnostic cut-offs defined by BFCRS and NCS, the prevalence of catatonia syndrome was 49 (16.3%) and 32 (10.6%) respectively. The prevalence rates as per ICD-10 criteria and DSM-5 criteria were 19% and 5.3% respectively. The two most frequently noted signs - staring and withdrawal, were not listed as signs in either the ICD-10 or DSM V. The prevalence of catatonic symptoms was different in psychotic disorders in contrast to affective disorders. Severity of catatonia was associated with younger age, lesser duration of primary illness and prior episodes of catatonia.
Conclusions
The prevalence of catatonia varies from 5.3% to 19% based on the criteria used. Identification warrants use of structured instruments. Catatonia is more severe in the initial years of illness, those with prior episodes of catatonia and in the younger age group."

Measures included the Geriatric Depression Scale-15, socio-demographic variables, psychosocial factors, physical health-related factors, lifestyle factors, and dietary factors. Results showed the GD prevalence rate was 36.9% (n = 62). Risk factors for GD included living in a rural area, having no history of chronic disease, having a history of previous personal and/or family depression, not engaging in daily life activities, not exercising regularly, having no hobbies, having a poor diet, and not engaging in religious practices regularly. The GD prevalence rate was generally higher compared to previous studies in other countries. This may have been due to the inclusion criterion of selecting self-reported healthy elderly individuals. It is recommended that a nationally representative study is carried out to assess the actual figure of GD in Bangladesh. The findings are helpful for depression-reducing intervention programs."

In contrast to these overt attributes, there is a different presentation of pathological narcissism which is underrecognized, as one’s preoccupation with hypervigilant, self-effacement and proneness to shame in the context of covert grandiose fantasies. This report illustrates a patient who had this subtype of vulnerable narcissism, and how his defence had been activated to preserve own self agency during a session with the doctor by revealing his paraphilic fantasy."

abstract = "Bipolar disorder is a chronic psychiatric condition characterized by episodes of elevated/irritable and depressed moods resulting in the loss of more disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) than other major conditions. The neurocognitive impairments in these patients interfere with sustained goal-directed performance and achievement even during the euthymic phase of the illness.
Methodology
The study aimed to explore the neurocognitive profile of patients in their euthymic phase. We matched 30 patients diagnosed with Bipolar Affective Disorder (BD) in the age range of 20–40 years with 30 healthy controls (with no axis I or II diagnosis, assessed on MINI) matched on age, gender, and education. The neurocognitive profile was assessed using NIMHANS Neuropsychology Battery.
Results
Euthymic phase patients with bipolar disorder had statistically significant low scores on the speed of processing information as compared to healthy controls. Although impaired in BD group, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups on executive functions and memory.
Conclusion
The findings of the study suggest that cognitive retraining aimed at ameliorating these deficits can be a used as an essential intervention in rehabilitation programs to successfully reintegrate patients with the bipolar affective disorder into the society. The research also indicates that despite the symptomatic recovery between the episodes, impairments in the speed of processing information continue to disrupt performance in patients with Bipolar Disorder."

In this study, we aimed to estimate the inter-rater reliability of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and PHQ-2, administered by ANMs, with mental health professionals, that is, Clinical Psychologists(CP). The prospective, blind, observational study was conducted in an antenatal clinic of tertiary care rural hospital of India. PHQ-2 and PHQ-9(Marathi) valid and translated versions were administered to consecutive antenatal women (n = 108) aged 18–45 years by two raters (CP, ANM) independently. Raters and data analyst were blinded to each other’s scores. Kappa Coefficient, weighted kappa, Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to assess Inter-rater reliability. The mean age of the study participants was 25.91 ± 4.39 years. Inter-rater reliability for PHQ-2 (Screen -Positive or Negative for depression) and PHQ-9 (Severity of depression) was (k = 0.675) and (kw = 0.732) respectively, which suggested the ‘substantial’ agreement between ANMs and CP. Among raters, the ICC (95 % confidence interval) was 0.90 (0.85, 0.93) for the PHQ-9 score and for the PHQ-2 was 0.873 (0.819−0.911), which was suggestive of excellent and good reliability respectively. The ‘substantial’ agreement and ‘good to excellent’ inter-rater reliability among ANM and CP suggest that these two scales can be used to screen and assess the severity of AD by either qualified or minimally trained, community health workers."

In Turkey, a shift from inpatient psychiatric mental health care towards a community-based, low-threshold system highlights the importance of understanding public attitudes towards the mentally ill. This study aims to underpin developments in mental health care through culturally sensitive research. Public stigma towards schizophrenia and depression is examined for the first time simultaneously in a community sample. Unlabeled case vignettes of either schizophrenia or depression as well as an assessment of mental illness attribution and the desire for social distance (SDS) were presented to an urban Turkish sample (N = 295). Analysis of variance revealed that attribution to mental illness determines significant levels of stigma for schizophrenia, however not for depression. Furthermore, desire for social distance (SDS) was significantly higher for the schizophrenia condition compared to depression. Depression and schizophrenia evoke different reactions within the Turkish population, specifically the attribution to mental illness increases stigma. This finding is discussed in light of the contact hypothesis, and furthermore contextualized within literature on familiarity with depression symptoms on the one hand, and perceived dangerousness and symptom severity of schizophrenia on the other hand. Implementation of timely and culturally sensitive adapted interventions within the ongoing reform of the Turkish mental health care system is recommended."

abstract = "Background
In current clinical practice, regardless of the clinical guidelines, BZDs and Z drugs are used beyond the period of indication, resulting in undesirable effects. This study aimed to assess feasibility of deprescribing amongst patients utilizing BZDs and Z drugs inappropriately for longer duration than the prescribed period. The study also analysed the Quality of Sleep (QoS) and Cost Savings incurred amongst deprescribed patients.
Methods
It was a prospective interventional study conducted in IP and OP settings of Psychiatry Department, Bangalore, India. Based on inclusion criteria, 109 patients were recruited for the study for a period of 7 months. Deprescribing was advised to inappropriate BZD and Z-drug users by clinical pharmacist after discussing with the prescribing psychiatrist. The patients were followed-up twice in a month after deprescribing. QoS was assessed by using Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scale. The total medications cost incurred per patient/month before and after the intervention among both the groups was measured.
Results
Post-intervention, 40(30.69%) BZD users were deprescribed i.e, either dose tapered 6(5.5%), completely ceased 27(24.8%) or on si opus sit (SOS) BZDs prescription 7(6.4%). A majority of 44(40.36%) patients continued BZDs according to the algorithm. Clonazepam 35(87.5%) was the most deprescribed BZD. Deprescribing of BZDs showed an association with QoS of patients, p-value (<0.05). A statistically significant cost reduction was observed after deprescribing BZDs, (Z = 5.465, p=<0.001).
Discussion
Deprescribing BZDs was associated with decline in its usage; implementing deprescribing practice amongst the inappropriate BZD users is feasible, provides an improved QoS and an economic benefit."

In this case, the patient hoarded many things, which resulted in severe domestic squalor. It was difficult to intervene because she refused help and lost motivation. Fortunately, the patient was attending our hospital, and she gradually received treatment through a multidisciplinary team approach. Since her cognitive function and activities of daily living gradually declined, her syndrome might have been related to mild behavioral impairment. Long-term and persistent intervention by a multidisciplinary team is very important to help patients with these kinds of problems."

Mindfulness interventions have been increasingly incorporated into clinical settings. Evidence supporting mindfulness practices are predominantly established in Western populations. Neurophysiological evidence has not been established to support the effectiveness of mindfulness practice in Asian populations. Greater understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying mindfulness would enable hemodynamics as measured by fNIRS to be used to monitor mindfulness practice as an adjunct to psychotherapy with Asian clients.
Method
Research relating to fNIRS and hemodynamics for mindfulness in Asians was reviewed. The inclusion criteria for this review were recent publications in peer-reviewed journals from 2008 to 2018, with the search terms ‘fNIRS’, ‘hemodynamics’ and ‘mindfulness’, for studies in Asia.
Findings
Databases included Medline, PubMed, PSYCINFO, Google Scholar and SCOPUS. Initial searches yielded 86 results. Five duplicated articles were removed, and remaining abstracts were screened; and assessed for eligibility against the structured performa. Three full text papers which fit the inclusion criteria were included in the current review.
Conclusion
This review highlighted the paucity of rigorous empirically validated research for hemodynamics as measured with fNIRS for mindfulness practice in Asia."

The Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) and tsunami of March 11, 2011 left behind many survivors, including children. This study aimed to assess changes in traumatic symptoms with time among kindergarteners who experienced GEJE as infants and to discuss the relationship between these symptoms and the disaster experience.
Methods
The 15-item Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms for Children (PTSSC-15) questionnaire were distributed to the parents of kindergarteners (children aged 4–5 years) at 8, 20, 30, and 42 months after GEJE. Questionnaires regarding environmental damage conditions affecting the children were distributed to teachers 8 months after the tsunami.
Results
The number of kindergarteners was 262, 255, 236, and 202 at 8, 20, 30, and 42 months after the disaster. The PTSSC-15 total score was not different between kindergartners with and without environmental damage conditions. After 8 and 20 months, the PTSSC-15 total score of children who usually ate breakfast was significantly higher than that of children who did not. Moreover, after 30 and 42 months, the PTSSC-15 total score of kindergarteners who usually ate breakfast was not significantly higher than that of kindergarteners who did not.
Conclusions
The traumatic symptoms of kindergarteners were not related to disaster experiences."

Discordance has been seen between objective and subjective parameters of sleep among children and adolescents. There has been a trend towards worsening of sleep hygiene among adolescents, which may predispose to psychiatric disorders like depression. So, we compared the subjective sleep quality and sleep hygiene among depressed and normal adolescents. A sample of 31 depressed adolescents and 32 healthy controls were compared on sleep parameters using Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale (ASWS), Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale (ASHS) and School Sleep Habits Survey. Depressed adolescents were found to have significantly worse sleep quality [ASWS score 3.72 ± 0.952 vs 4.79 ± 0.552, p < 0.001], longer sleep onset latency [68.23 ± 62.98 vs 19.53 ± 19.48 minutes, p < 0.001], and shorter sleep duration [414.19 ± 110.78 vs 498.28 ± 56.86 minutes, p < 0.001]. Sleep quality significantly correlated with depression severity (measured on Children’s Depression Rating Scale- revised), i.e., higher the severity of depression, poorer was the sleep quality (r = -0.605, p < 0.01). But sleep hygiene was statistically similar between the two groups [ASHS score 3.21 ± 0.60 vs 3.36 ± 0.51, p = 0.293], and was inadequate (< 3.8) among all adolescents irrespective of depression. Hence, despite the lack of evidence from objective sleep measures, there seem to be subjective sleep impairments among adolescents having depression. Future research needs to address the underlying etiological factors and causal directions for depression and sleep impairments among adolescents. Sleep hygiene education must be a part of broader primary prevention strategies for psychiatric disorders."

To compare the symptom profile of catatonia among patients with affective, psychotic and organic disorders.
Methodology
A 46 item catatonia rating scale prepared by combining items from 3 catatonia rating scales, i.e., Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale(BFCRS), North off catatonia rating scale and Catatonia rating scale was used.
Results
Study included 53, 45 and 42 patients with psychotic disorders, affective disorders and organic catatonia respectively. No significant difference was seen in the prevalence and severity of various catatonic symptoms between patients with psychotic and affective disorders. Compared to participants in the organicity group, participants in the psychotic group had significantly higher prevalence and severity of posturing. There was no difference in the affective and organicity group in terms of frequency and severity of catatonic symptoms.
Conclusions
Patients with organic catatonia do not differ from those with catatonia due to affective and psychotic disorders in terms of prevalence and severity of signs and symptoms of catatonia except for posturing. The present study suggests that catatonic symptoms in patients with various disorders are not just limited to BFCRS and extend beyond the same."

Kratom is a traditional medicinal herb widely used in Malaysia and Thailand. Despite its widespread use and statements by regulatory agencies on the potential for kratom-associated psychosis, there is little data regarding the prevalence of psychotic symptoms among kratom users. This study investigated the prevalence of psychosis among kratom users, described psychotic symptomatology and severity, while examining associations between kratom use characteristics and the occurrence of psychotic symptoms.
Methods
This cross-sectional clinical survey recruited 150 regular kratom users. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-V) diagnostic criteria were used to evaluate psychotic symptomatology among kratom users, and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) was used to assess the severity of psychiatric symptoms. Chi-square tests with Yate’s correction were performed to determine the association between kratom use characteristics and the occurrence of psychotic symptoms among kratom users in this study.
Results
Six out of 150 kratom users (4%) presented with any psychotic symptoms. The psychotic symptoms reported were positive symptoms and thought alienation, with a mean BPRS score of 33 (i.e., mild severity). Variables related to kratom use (such as intake of kratom with diphenhydramine, duration of kratom use, and quantity and frequency of daily kratom use) were not associated with the occurrence of psychotic symptoms among kratom users.
Conclusion
Although psychotic symptoms could occur among regular kratom users, they were rare and not significantly associated with kratom use characteristics. We found no evidence of elevated psychosis among regular users."

In this paper, I report the case of a media worker in Bangladesh who committed suicide after sharing series of Facebook posts mentioning her intensions to commit suicide. Thousands of her Facebook friends and followers noticed the posts; few of them shared the posts and made critical comments. This case documented the use of Facebook to disclose the intention of committing suicide in Bangladesh. Though Facebook is gaining attention as a potential source to predict and provide timely intervention to prevent suicide, this case raised the question about the effective participation of Facebook users in such programs. We need to emphasis and focus on ensuring active participation of most of Facebook users in any social media based suicide prevention program. This report may inspire future researchers to find out more user friendly and participatory social media focused suicide prevention programs."

The spread of novel corona virus (COVID-19) across the globe and the associated morbidity and mortality challenged the nations by several means. One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic.
Materials and methods
This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review.
Results
Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW.
Conclusion
Regular screening of medical personnel involved in treating, diagnosing patients with COVID-19 should be done for evaluating stress, depression and anxiety by using multidisciplinary Psychiatry teams."

However, the overall pattern of the relationship remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the network structure between SP traits and other subclinical features (symptoms or traits) and test the replicability of these relationships. A total of 2204 college students completed measurements for SP traits, autistic traits, obsessive-compulsive traits, depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, and a validated subsample of 814 completed the same questionnaires again three months later. Using network analysis, we constructed the network structure of subclinical features and then tested its replicability. We found that interpersonal features were the bridge node connecting SP traits and autistic traits (social skill: r = 0.50; attention switching: r = 0.14; communication: r = 0.12), while cognitive-perceptual (obsessing: r = 0.05; neutralizing: r = 0.06) and disorganization (obsessing: r = 0.11) features were the SP traits associated with obsessive-compulsive traits. In addition to interpersonal features (r = 0.10), disorganization (r = 0.12) and cognitive-perceptual (r = 0.05) features were also the overlap between depressive symptoms and SP traits. Anxiety symptoms only connected with interpersonal (r = 0.05) but not cognitive-perceptual features of SP traits. The network showed high predictability (43%) and interpersonal features of SP traits had the highest expected influence (1.67) among all nodes, which may be a potential target for intervention. High similarities were found on network structure (r = 0.86) and expected influence (r = 0.96), and no significant difference on global connectivity was found between these two networks (difference value = 0.45, p = 0.135), suggesting the replicability of the network structure."

However, cognitive remediation is a resource consuming intervention and in lower and middle-income countries (LAMIC) such interventions are often neglected due to the resource constraints of the mental health services set-ups. Therefore, it is imperative to develop cognitive remediation programs that are less resource consuming for the mental health service delivery system. Keeping this in view, in the present pilot study, we tested the feasibility of a caregiver assisted home-based cognitive remediation program and compared its efficacy with a clinic-based cognitive remediation program. Findings show that it is feasible to conduct cognitive remediation program with the help of caregivers in patients’ home settings and that the home-based cognitive remediation is as effective as the clinic-based cognitive remediation. The results of the study have been further discussed in the light of the practical implications, limitations and future research."

Emerging evidence suggests a possible role for immune system dysregulation in the pathogenesis of postpartum psychosis (PP) but the evidence is limited. The current study sought to determine the serum cytokines/ chemokine changes associated with first-onset PP.
Methods
Women with first onset PP were recruited as cases and the cytokines/ chemokine changes were compared against healthy postpartum (HP) and healthy non-postpartum (HNP) women.There were 20 subjects in each of the three groups. Levels of serum cytokines and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) were estimated with a cytometric beadarray assay.
Results
HP group showed significantly elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-6 as compared to HNP group. Whereas, the first onset PP group showed significantly elevated levels of both IL-6 and IL-8 as compared to HNP group.
Conclusion
Postpartum period appears to be a state of altered immune functioning considering the elevated level of IL-6 in both HP and PP group. Additionally, IL-8 appears to play a role in the manifestation of PP. Our study highlights the immune alterations associated with first-onset PP."

Substance use among adolescents is on the rise across the globe along with a diminution of gender gap observed earlier posing a huge public health burden. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of literature on adolescent substance use. The literature is even sparse about substance use among adolescent girls. The current study aims to provide a glimpse of the profile and pattern of substance use among Indian adolescent girls seeking treatment for substance use problems in a specialty addiction treatment centre in India.
Materials and methods
This study is retrospective in design. Information regarding socio-demographics and substance use were extracted from the medical records of adolescent girls (≤ 19 years) who sought treatment for substance use problems during 2004–2018, at the adolescent clinic of a tertiary addiction treatment centre located in north India was retrieved carried out. The data was statistically analysed using SPSS.
Results
A total of 28 girls sought treatment during this period. The mean age of the girls was 15.89 ± 2.72 years. Most of the girls were students (6/28) or had never started working (12/28). Majority of them were coming from an urban background (89.3%) and were educated up to 10th class (85.5%). A total of 17 (60.7%) girls sought treatment for opioids use of which 11 were using illicit opioids like heroin and five (29.9%) of them reported taking opioids by injecting route primarily. History of past abstinence attempts, and treatment attempt were present in very few of them (10.7% and 14.3%).
Conclusion
Our study suggests a distinct substance use profile of adolescent girls. There is a need for further systematic studies to assess their clinical needs."

abstract = "Introduction
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a broad heterogeneous diagnostic construct. Previous studies have shown that it can be resolved into several symptom-clusters which are proposed to be associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the serotonergic pathway (5-HTTLPR, 5HTR1A, 5-HTR2A).
Methods and material
In a cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary level mental health care set-up in north India, 80 out-patients with MDD were evaluated with Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and then genotyping was done. The different clinical and genetic variables were compared across the factor structures of MADRS. Also, the comparison of the genetic data of cases was done with the pre-existing database of the non-blood related healthy ethnically-matched controls.
Results
There was no significant association between age, gender, other clinical variables, SNPs like 5-HTTLPR SS/SL, rs6295 CC/CG/GG, rs6311GG/GA/AA, rs6313 CC/CT/TT and different factor-structures like ‘detachment’ consisting of items like concentration difficulty, lassitude, inability to feel; ‘psychic anxiety’ consisting of suicidal thoughts and inner tension; ‘mood-pessimism’ consisting of symptoms like apparent sadness, reported sadness, pessimistic thoughts and ‘vegetative symptoms’ like decreased sleep, poor appetite. Neither there was any association between genotype of the cases compared with the controls.
Conclusions
No significant association was obtained between the four-factor structures of depression in MADRS and serotonin transporter and receptor SNPs in a study with a small sample size. This study evaluates whether depression symptom-clusters have distinct genotypic determinants and necessitates more comprehensive studies for unravelling the genetic determinants of depression."

abstract = "Objective
Alcoholism could be a core problem of self-regulatory failure. Several neurocognitive theories have hypothesized hypo-functioning or dysfunction of reflective (executive) system and heightened functioning of reactive (impulsive) system in self-regulatory failure implicated in drug addiction. Similarly, stress and affect dysregulation may breakdown self-regulation. The present study aimed to develop an Integrated Intervention Program for Alcoholism (IIPA) to enhance self-regulation and to test its effectiveness in the treatment of alcoholism.
Method
Individuals with early onset alcoholism (n = 50) were recruited after getting written informed consent. The study used randomized case control design. The participants were matched on age (+/−1 year) and education (+/−1 year). The TAU group received usual treatment for alcoholism which included pharmacotherapy, 6 sessions/week yoga and 3 sessions/week group therapy on relapse prevention. The intervention group received IIPA for 18 days along with usual treatment (except yoga sessions). The IIPA included several cognitive remediation tasks and mind-body exercise (Qigong and Tai Chi Chuan). Both groups were assessed on executive function tests and affect regulation scale at pre and post-intervention. The subjects were also followed up for 6 months to compare the abstinence between groups.
Results
Both groups were comparable at baseline. At post-intervention, the IIPA group showed a significant improvement compared to the TAU group on executive functioning and affect regulation. Follow-up results showed lower relapses in six months in the IIPA group.
Conclusion
Preliminary evidence showed that IIPA is effective in facilitating self-regulation. Further study may examine its utility and feasibility in other clinical conditions."

Screening for non-communicable disease (NCD) risk factors can help in prevention or reduction in the ill-effects of NCDs. Data on NCD risk factors in community-dwelling patients with common mental disorders (CMD) is lacking. This study was designed to screen for selected NCD risk factors in patients attending a community psychiatry service (CPS) in the states of Punjab and Haryana in North India.
Methods
Following ethical clearance, the study was conducted in 4 satellite clinics of the CPS of a tertiary hospital from North India. Consecutive adult patients were approached and 719 patients were assessed. A one-time cross-sectional assessment was carried out which included socio-demographic data, clinical details, history of tobacco and alcohol use, personal history of hypertension and diabetes, family history of diabetes, prevalence of hypertension, obesity (central and generalised) and levels of physical activity.
Results
302 males and 417 females were assessed. Most patients were diagnosed with CMD. The prevalence of hypertension was 42.7% in males and 34.1% in females. The prevalence of central and generalised obesity in males and females was 41.4%, 71.2% and 34.8%, 45.6% respectively. 32.5% of males and 40.2% females were assessed to be inadequately physically active.
Conclusions
The results of the study suggest that there is high prevalence of NCD risk factors in patients with CMD. Hypertension is more common in males while obesity and inadequate physical activity is more common in females. NCD risk factor screening and management, health education should be integrated in CPS."

abstract = "Background
There is a significant evidence gap on gambling in India, where gambling is viewed predominantly through the legal lens. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence, patterns, and correlates of gambling.
Methods
Cross-sectional data from the follow-up assessment in a cohort (n = 1514 men) from India. The following data were collected using a structured questionnaire: socio-demographic information, gambling, interpersonal violence, tobacco use, alcohol use disorders (AUD), common mental disorders, and suicidality. Logistic regression models were used to examine the correlates of gambling.
Results
658 participants (45.4%) reported gambling in the past year, and lottery was the most frequent form of gambling (67.8%). Current gambling was correlated with rural residence (OR 1.42, CI 1.05–1.93, p = 0.02), work-related problems (OR 1.42, CI 1.03–1.96, p = 0.03), interpersonal violence (OR 3.45, CI 1.22–9.75, p = 0.02), tobacco use (OR 1.59, CI 1.16–2.19, p = 0.004), and AUD (OR 2.14, CI 1.35–3.41, p = 0.001). 724 (49.9%) participants reported gambling at least once in their lifetime. Lifetime gambling was correlated with work-related problems (OR 1.57, CI 1.14–2.17, p = 0.006), interpersonal violence (OR 4.03, CI 1.32–12.30 p = 0.02), tobacco use (OR 1.60, CI 1.16–2.20, p = 0.004), and AUD (OR 2.12, CI 1.33–3.40, p = 0.002). Age was significantly associated with playing lottery more frequently (OR 3.24, CI 1.34–7.84, p = 0.009) and tobacco use was significantly associated with playing matka more frequently (OR 1.69, CI 1.08–2.64, p = 0.02).
Discussion
The high prevalence of gambling and its association with social problems and risk factors for non-communicable diseases warrants further epidemiological research."

The present study is an attempt to identify a potential biomarker in pediatric OCD using eye tracking. The present study measured pro-saccade and anti-saccade parameters in 36 cases of pediatric OCD and 31 healthy controls. There was no significant difference between cases and controls in the error rate, peak velocity, position gain and latency measures in both pro-saccade and anti-saccade eye tracking tasks. With age, anti-saccades become slower in velocity, faster in response and more accurate irrespective of disorder status of the child. Pro-saccades also show a similar effect that is less prominent than anti-saccades. Gain measures more significantly vary with age in children with OCD than the controls, whereas latency measures positively correlated with age in children with OCD as opposed to being negatively correlated in the controls. Findings of this study do not support any of the eye tracking measures as putative diagnostic bio-markers in OCD. However, latency and gain parameters across different age groups in anti-saccade tasks need to be explored in future studies."

Aims: To estimate current prevalence and its correlates of socio-clinical factors in SD at a quaternary mental health centre (QMHC). Methods: Total of 422 adult subjects were selected through systematic random sampling at first contact psychiatry outpatient clinic. Subjects were interviewed with Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus version 5.0.0, Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale and Sheehan Disability Scale. Results: Current prevalence of SD was 5%. Significant correlates are observed with median age of 40.5 years, female, married, <5 years of education, monthly income of <₹ 10,357(85.5%) and lower socioeconomic status (75%). Discussion: There is high prevalence of SD even at QMHC. The higher prevalence among adult population in this setup reflect the impairment of working population which invariably impact on national economy. Conclusion: Poverty continues to be a major contributing factor to SD causing double impact on the economy by affecting the working population the most."

Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a tropical tree found in southern Thailand and northern states of the Malay Peninsula. Kratom is commercially available and used as an alternative to treat opioid withdrawal. Mitragynine is the major indole alkaloid found in kratom leaves. This review aimed to summarize available pharmacokinetic information about mitragynine.
Methods
PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were systematically searched from their inceptions to June 2018. All types of pharmacokinetic studies of mitragynine were included for further systematic review.
Results
Seventeen articles were reviewed. Mitragynine is a lipophilic weak base passively transported across the intestinal wall and blood brain barrier. 85–95% is bound to plasma protein and extensively metabolized by phase I and particularly phase II enzymes. Actions on CYP enzymes are unlikely to impact drug metabolism at concentrations likely to exist in kratom-consuming humans. In rats and humans, mitragynine is rapidly absorbed after orally administration (Tmax˜1.5 h, Cmax˜0.3−1.8 μM). Vd was 37–90 L/kg; t1/2 was 3–9 hr; mostly excreted as metabolites in urine. Bioavailability was estimated as 21%. It also rapidly penetrated and redistributed in brain. A quality assessment tool tailored for pharmacokinetic studies was also created which rated some studies of lower value.
Conclusion
Rudimentary pharmacokinetics of mitragynine was described in this systematic review. However, the discovered studies provided scant information on the role of metabolism and redistribution into tissues nor the rate of excretion."

People with psychotic disorders have increased premature mortality in comparison with the general population, with high rates of cigarette use a contributing factor. We aimed to describe the prevalence of cigarette use and nicotine dependence (ND) in first episode psychosis (FEP), and established psychosis; and to investigate associations between clinical symptoms and ND.
Methodology
Smoking and clinical data were collected from two cohorts: 181 people with FEP recruited as part of the Physical Health and Substance Use Measures in First Onset Psychosis (PUMP) study and from 432 people with established psychosis recruited as part of the Improving physical health and reducing substance use in psychosis randomised controlled trial (IMPaCT RCT).
Results
The prevalence of cigarette smoking was 78% in FEP and 62% in established psychosis. Forty nine percent (n = 60) of smokers in the FEP cohort and 69% (n = 183) of smokers with established psychosis were highly nicotine dependent. Being a highly nicotine dependent smoker was significantly associated with higher PANSS positive symptom scores (F = 5.480 p = 0.004), and with decreased scores on the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (F = 3.261, p = 0.039) in established psychosis. There was no diagnostic specificity identified in relation to smoking or ND in both groups.
Conclusion
High rates of cigarette usage and nicotine dependence are problems from the early stages of psychosis. ND is higher in people with established psychosis. Smoking cessation strategies as part of comprehensive management of psychotic disorders at every stage require further development and evaluation."

There are limited number of studies which have evaluated social cognitive deficits among the siblings of patients with schizophrenia.
Aim
This study aimed to evaluate the social cognitive deficits and its correlates among siblings of patients with schizophrenia.
Methodology
Patients of schizophrenia (N = 34), their siblings (N = 34) and healthy control subjects (N = 31) matched for age, gender, education and intelligence quotient were evaluated on social cognition rating tools in Indian setting (SOCRATIS). Patients were additionally evaluated on Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). Siblings were assessed on Comprehensive Assessment for at risk mental state (CAARMS) scale and Short Wisconsin Schizotypy scale. Neurocognitive test battery was applied to all the groups.
Results
Patients with schizophrenia performed the worst and the healthy controls performed the best, with siblings falling intermediate on all the subtests of social cognition (except for externalizing bias and personalized bias) and neurocognition. There were negative correlation between some of the domains of social cognition and various domains of CAARMS. Higher level of schizotypy was associated with higher level of social cognitive deficits.
Conclusion
Social cognitive deficits can act as an important endophenotype for estimating the risk of schizophrenia in at risk siblings. Further, social cognitive deficits must be considered as important target for intervention among the at risk siblings to improve their outcome."

abstract = "The identification of biological markers for psychosis has an impact on its diagnosis, prognosis, and likelihood of treatment response. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is involved in important functions such as synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation and neurogenesis. Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) is the most important inhibitor of tPA. Preliminary studies have shown that schizophrenia patients have lower tPA and higher PAI-1 levels than the general population. The association of tPA and PAI-1 abnormalities with psychotic spectrum disorders, however, remains elusive. Our primary objective was to assess the plasma levels of tPA and PAI-1 in patients experiencing acute psychotic episodes as compared to those in healthy controls. In this prospective case-control study, we collected peripheral blood samples from psychiatric inpatients and healthy age, gender and race-matched subjects and determined plasma levels of tPA and PAI-1 by enzyme-linked immune-absorbent assays. Plasma levels of PAI-1 in patients with schizoaffective disorder were significantly lower as compared to those in control subjects (P = 0.03). tPA was lower in cases as compared to controls although it did not reach statistical significance. Asian patients and controls had lower PAI-1 levels. Further, Asian patients with schizoaffective disorder had significantly lower PAI-1 level compared to Asian patients with schizophrenia. Our results indicate that patients with schizoaffective disorder have lower PAI-1 levels than those with schizophrenia, affective psychosis, and healthy controls. Further studies are warranted to explore the potential of PAI-1 as a biomarker for diagnosing schizoaffective disorder."

The aim of the study is to examine associations between video/online gaming and its implication on the biopsychosocial domains of the user. Online databases were studied on gaming and its effect on behaviour, general and mental health from 1997–2017. The PICO guidelines, PRISMA flow diagram and the Rayyan software was used in identifying relevant studies. Cross referencing was done with the co-authors. A total of 41 studies were included in the final analysis. The choice of the video game is influenced by age, gender, parental mediation, as well as the players’ and the game’s characteristics. Excessive gaming affects both the individual himself and their interpersonal relationships, with ‘internet addiction’ being added as a diagnosis under DSM V. Despite its several negative consequences, over the past decade, researchers have now started to acknowledge the benefits of gamification in social, educational and even in the health sector, irrespective of the individual’s age. There is a need to develop cross cultural database to understand the impact of addictive and/or promotive use of games on the biopsychosocial factors of the gamer."

Design of the study was cross sectional and involving 150 mother-infant dyads recruited from Growth and Developmental Clinic dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital-Jakarta and Beji Volunteer-Staffed Integrated Health Service (Posyandu)-Depok/West Java. Infant was categorized as children from 0–36 months old. Mother with at least junior high-school background fulfilled MIBS-Indonesian version and also demographic data. SPSS version 21 for Mac and Lisrel 8.8 program for Windows was applied to analyze the data. Results of the study demonstrated that the content validity was good with I-CVI=0.9875 and S-CVI=0.99; and EFA results of 3 components total variance was 57.90% and CFA results showed three factors structure out of eight items and it fullfiled an adequate goodness of fit with each factor CR >0.7; factor 1:‘desire to love and denial’, factor 2: ‘hate and being closed’, and factor 3: ‘rejection feeling’. Cronbach’s alpha for the eight items of MIBS-I was 0.535. To be concluded, MIBS-I was a multidimentional scale with three-factor model and it was confirmed valid and reliable to be implemented in Indonesian children from 0–36 months old."

Although numerous articles are published every year, few of them present important conceptual advances in that particular field and are found to be influential in the evolution of the field. The number of citations a publication receives can be used as a proxy marker of its impact on the field. Hence we aimed to analyze the top cited articles (n = 100) on obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) as of July 2018. Google scholar database was searched using a freely available software, Publish or Perish. Information related to number of citations, publication title, publication year, name of the journal, country of origin, author details, institution of origin, article type, and article design. The original research articles were further classified into descriptive/epidemiology, mechanism, management, scale/measurement, imaging and medical psychiatry. The citation classics suggest that clinical trials/management, epidemiology and neuroimaging were the most researched areas in the OCD research. These citation classics provide an important insight into the historical developments, like the role of serotonin and caudate in OCD. This approach of citation analysis provides an opportunity to retrieve the classic articles on OCD, and describes the trends in OCD research."

Our sample included 195 patients of all age groups. The most common diagnosis was depression (75 patients) followed by anxiety (61 patients). 107 patients (54.8%) required admission for adequate treatment; however only 72 (67.3%) of those were actually admitted, and the rest (32.7%) left the hospital against medical advice. Increased hospital admission was associated with being a female (OR = 3.042), having family history of psychiatric disease (OR = 2.040) and having suicidal ideations (OR = 12.949). In a country that has inadequate health coverage, financial coverage can also be a determining factor in whether or not patients get the admission they need."

Advanced non-invasive brain stimulation techniques like high definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) may target the symptoms of OCD while preventing a probable manic switch in a vulnerable population. In this case series, we targeted OC symptoms in three patients by giving 2 mA of anodal HD-tDCS at their pre-SMA (localized using 10/10 EEG system) with 4 surrounding return electrodes of opposite polarity for 20 min of two sessions having an intersession gap of 20 min receiving a maximum of 20 sessions. We found that the patients showed significant improvement (more than 25%) in their OC symptoms while having no affective side effects and this effect was replicated in one of the two patients in repeating the treatment for relapse. This case series highlights the efficacy and durability of the effect of HD-tDCS as an add-on treatment modality in three patients who were treated for OC symptoms in the context of a comorbid bipolar disorder, two of them receiving repeat courses on relapse."

There is scarce data available on community based prevalence of Anxiety Disorders (ADs) amongst adolescents in north Indian settings.
Objective
To determine the prevalence of anxiety disorders, and associated factors amongst adolescents in a rural community of Ballabgarh block, district Faridabad, Haryana.
Methods
Participants (10–19 years) were enrolled through simple random sequence from a sampling frame of adolescents residing in 28 villages of Ballabgarh block using household survey technique. They were screened using Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) tool and then subjected to confirmatory diagnosis using Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children/Adolescent (MINI KID). All adolescents with ADs were assessed for co-psychiatric morbidities using MINI-KID and functional impairment using Children Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). Prevalence and 95% Confidence intervals are reported. Additionally, socio-demographic factors were elicited using a semi-structured interview schedule and associations were determined using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
Results
A total of 678 adolescents participated in this study with mean age (SD) as 14.2 (2.5) years. The age adjusted prevalence of anxiety disorders was found to be 16.6% (95% CI: 16.0–17.2). The most prevalent anxiety disorder among participants was social anxiety disorders followed by specific phobias. Female sex and low socio-economic status were associated with anxiety disorders. Two third of adolescents with ADs had no functional impairment and almost one third were found to have one or more co-existing psychiatric co-morbidity.
Conclusion
We found a high prevalence of ADs in rural north Indian community settings warranting adequate health system response at primary care level."

Though neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in patients with brain tumors, they often can be the only manifestation in cases of meningioma. Meningiomas might present with mood symptoms, psychosis, memory disturbances, personality changes, anxiety, or anorexia nervosa. The diagnosis of meningioma could be delayed where only psychiatric symptoms are seen. A comprehensive review of the literature and individual patient data analysis was conducted, which included all case reports, and case series on meningioma and psychiatric symptoms till September 2018 with the search terms “meningioma” and “psychiatric symptoms/ depression/ bipolar disorder/mania/ psychosis/ obsessive-compulsive disorder”. Search engines used included PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane database and Google Scholar. Studies reported varied psychiatric symptoms in cases with meningioma of differing tumor site, size and lateralization. Factors which led to a neuroimaging work-up included the occurrence of sudden new or atypical psychiatric symptoms, a lack of response to typical line of treatment and the presence of neurological signs or symptoms such as headache, seizures, diplopia, urinary incontinence etc. This review emphasizes on the need of neurological examination and neuroimaging in the patients presenting to psychiatry especially with atypical symptoms."

Employment is a significant stepping stone towards recovery for persons with severe mental illness. In the last two decades there has been increasing focus on obtaining professional courses and degrees for employment in India.
Aim
To understand the challenges faced by persons with severe mental illness with professional degrees in obtaining and maintaining employment.
Methods
We interviewed 31 individuals with severe mental illness, who had professional degrees, using qualitative interviews. These interviews explored factors that facilitated as well as those that hindered the process of obtaining and sustaining jobs.
Results
Factors that were identified as facilitators for obtaining and maintaining employment included personal strengths, social support, accommodative work environment, disclosure, support from mental health professionals and services. Factors that were identified as hindering for obtaining and maintaining employment included symptoms of the illness, side effects of medications, stigma, poor social support, academic underachievement, disjointed work history, poor workplace environment and specific cultural, gender issues.
Conclusion
Factors such as workplace accommodations, creating an environment that is permissive of disclosure, using family support and support from mental health professionals will facilitate employment. Addressing factors that hinder such as stigma, academic under-achievement, improving workplace environments, social support will also be important in vocational recovery."

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is safe and efficacious in the elderly population. However, clinicians are still weary to use it among the old-old population, citing safety concerns. Our case report highlights the use of ECT in a 91 year old lady with late onset Bipolar Mania.
Case report
A 91 year old lady presented with an acute manic relapse for the past 2 weeks. She was previously on oral Sodium Valproate, and during this current admission was augmented with oral Quetiapine IR 100 mg bd. She remained unwell and was planned for right unilateral ECT with age-based dosing stimuli. After only 4 sessions, she showed complete resolution of her manic symptoms.
Result
In our case study, the patient showed rapid response to right unilateral ECT. Even though the Post Suppression Index (PSI) was not significant, there is some evidence that in elderly patients, burst suppression (not measured in this case) may be more accurate measure of ECT efficacy. The transient treatment emergent delirium was short lived and ECT was very tolerated in this patient.
Conclusion
Clinicians should not delay ECT in old-old patients who do not respond to pharmacologic treatment, as early switch to ECT results in rapid response with good safety profile."

abstract = "Background
Gauging the probability that medical students will select psychiatry as a career is a challenge, especially in Saudi Arabia, where the profession of psychiatry has still to gain ground. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate the attitudes of Saudi medical students towards psychiatry.
Method
A total of 317 medical students were recruited in a cross-sectional study. An ATP-30 questionnaire was used. In addition to the suggested cut-off point of 90 in previous studies, the data were also categorized using the visual binning procedure. To enhance the number of significant predictors and obtain more realistic results, an Ordinal Logistic Regression model was applied.
Result
The attitudes of medical students towards the three outcomes (dependent) variables; “Overall attitudes towards psychiatry, I want to be a psychiatrist, and Attitudes towards psychiatric treatment” varied across the five explanatory (predictor) variables, when assessed using Ordinal Logistic Regression. Age and gender proved significant with the three outcome variables, whereas Exposure to Psychiatric Clerkship identified “Overall attitudes towards psychiatry” and “Attitudes towards psychiatric treatment”. Significant effects from a “Psychiatrist Relative” was found in “Overall attitudes towards psychiatry”and “I want to be a psychiatrist”. The predictor variable; “Having a relative who is a psychiatric patient” was found to be significant only with, “I want to be a psychiatrist”.
Conclusion
The attitudes of medical students towards psychiatry can be predicted in the presence of specific factors. This is discussed in more detail in the relevant part of the study."

But small groups among these patients have a potentially treatable cause of illness and therefore every patient with dementia needs to be considered treatable unless proved otherwise. This group can be identified only by high degree of suspicion based on clinical clues. We have evaluated the validity of some simple clinical clues which we noticed in our patients with immune mediated dementias. The Panic score, Epsworth sleepiness score, catatonic symptoms and history of seizures were compared between 23 and 11 patients with serologically confirmed anti-NMDA antibody and anti-VGKC antibody associated encephalitis respectively. They were compared with 20 patients with probable behavioral variant of Frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and 20 patients with probable Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Chi-square test was used to compare across the groups and there was significant difference (P < 0.05) across the 4 groups comprising anti NMDA encephalitis, anti VGKC encephalitis, FTD and AD among the four variables (Panic scores, Catatonic symptoms, Epsworth sleepiness score and seizures) studied. Our study revealed that panic and sleepiness is highly significant when tested across all groups and catatonia showed a trend towards NMDA and when compared with degenerative dementia versus immune mediated syndromes all the 4 parameters were highly significant This simple bedside TRIAD of panic, sleepiness with either of catatonia or seizures if found in patients it is appropriate to order antibody assessment before anything else is planned. This needs to be evaluated in a larger sample."

Methods
It was a quasi-experimental study, conducted in February-December 2017, in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Subjectwere people with schizophrenia, 18–56 years old, with their caregiver. CBRintervention using psychoeducation module and social skill module during 12 weeks. It was conducted by local health workers, sub district social welfare workers, community health workers (called Kader in Indonesia) and supervised by a psychiatrist. The QoL was assessed using a validated measuring instrument at the baseline and at the week 16. Hypothesis test using Wilcoxon test
Results
There were 100 people with schizophrenia involved in the study. They were divided into intervention group and control group. Every group consists of 50 subjects. Both groups had similar characteristics at the baseline. The intervention group received CBR, whereas the control group didn’t. Thirty-four people (68%) of intervention group increased their QoL, whereas in the control group there were twenty-three people (46%) increased their QoL. The QoL decrease occurred in one subject (4%) from the control group. Other subjects had constant QoL. Improvement of QoL in the intervention group is higher than the control group (p < 0.05).
Conclusions
CBR is effective for improving the QoL of people with schizophrenia in the community. CBR is conducted by the health worker and sub-district social welfare worker."

Aim
Assessment of psychometric properties of Tamil version of Body weight image self-esteem questionnaire (BWISE) in our population.
Methodology
In a cross sectional, validation study conducted at Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF), 203 consenting outpatients with DSM IV diagnosis of Schizophrenia and related psychotic disorder fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria were administered BWISE.
Results
The mean age of the sample was 38.21 ± 10.32 years. BWISE ratings showed that patients (54%) reported weight gain with current medications and were aware of increase in weight. Only three percent reported to have severe psychosocial adjustment to the weight gain while remaining reported moderate (55%) and mild (42%) psychosocial adjustment. Validation of Tamil version of BWISE was found to be of moderate range (internal consistency 0.55–0.72). Principal Component analysis of BWISE identified 3 components with a 50.36% variance.
Conclusions
BWISE could be used as a useful screening instrument to assess the psychosocial consequences of weight gain in patients."

Results
Conduct disorder (85.5%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (61.8%), depression (50%), substance abuse (40.8%), post-traumatic stress disorder (19.7%), and psychotic disorder (3.9%) were more frequent among adolescent prisoners than the control group. The educational levels of parents of adolescent prisoners and their socioeconomic statuses were significantly lower, and the nonsuicidal self-injury (73.7%) and tattooing frequency (65.8%) were significantly higher among adolescent prisoners than the control group. Only 51.3% had both parents living together.
Conclusion
Psychiatric disorders, low socioeconomic status, family disorganization, nonsuicidal self-injury, tattoos, and interruption of education were frequent in adolescent prisoners in this study. Our findings emphasize the importance of early psychiatric treatment and family-based interventions to help prevent adolescents from committing crimes. In addition, nonsuicidal self-injury and tattoos may be associated with criminal behavior in adolescents."

abstract = "Background
Most people who inject drugs (PWID) start their drug use careers by using non-injecting opioid drugs. A variety of interconnected factors may influence the risk of transition from non-injecting to injecting drug use (IDU). However, such factors have not been studied well in India. As almost all non-injecting opioid users (NIOU) are at potential risk of switching to IDU in future, it is important to understand the phenomenon of transition.
Method
In this multi-site, cross-sectional observational study, we compared injecting and non-injecting opioid users on the pattern of progression of drug use and their knowledge, attitude and belief about IDU/HIV. Data were collected from people who use drugs coming in contact with Non-Governmental Organizations providing drug treatment or HIV prevention services, in ten cities of six states located in North/North-West India. Following informed consent, a total of 1987 male participants (n = 1234 PWID and n = 753 NIOU) were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Factors associated with risk of transition were analyzed using logistic regression analysis.
Result
The age of onset of heroin and other opiates as well as other substances was not different between two groups. Among PWID, a majority (n = 713; 57.77%) reported using opioids through non-injecting route before switching to injecting route. The mean duration between first use of non-injecting opioid and first use of injecting opioid was 1.80 ± 3.32 years (range 0–26 years). Awareness and exposure to the act of injecting were amongst factors associated with perceived risk of transition to injecting (p < 0.01). On a univariate logistic regression analysis, less education was associated with increased likelihood while being employed was associated with less likelihood of being offered injection (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
Though, NIOU are almost indistinguishable from PWID in many respects, there may be certain factors putting them at risk of transition to injecting route. As the majority of PWID start their injecting career by non-injecting route, interventions targeted atrisk NIOU (as suggested by our study) could interrupt the HIV transmission."

abstract = "Objectives
To estimate the average cost of an integrated alcohol intervention program at community hospitals of Thailand and identify patient predictors and sources of variation of the program cost.
Methods
Activity-based costing was conducted under a societal perspective among 113 outpatient alcohol users (29 low-risk, 43 high-risk and 41 dependent drinkers), aged 15 years and older, at four community hospitals in southern Thailand. Multivariate regression models were performed to identify individual-level determinants of cost components.
Results
The average cost per low-risk, high-risk, and dependent drinkers were 516 (16 USD), 2,961 (94 USD), and 5,325 baht (168 USD), respectively, of which labor and patient costs were the major components. Regardless of drinking risk level, past-year functional disturbance lasting more than 20 days (β = 0.215, p = 0.035) and increasing number of previous treatment episodes (β = 0.035, p = 0.046) independently increased overall program cost. Variation in the program cost was mainly caused by length of hospital stay followed by staff time for screening and delivering interventions.
Conclusion
The study underlines the important role of pretreatment alcohol-related problems and human resources in alcohol intervention programs. Efforts should be focused on adequacy of treatment for the very first episode of alcohol problems to reduce the high healthcare costs."

Adiponectin is a hormone secreted by adipose tissues that is thought to influence lipid and glucose metabolism, and the development of metabolic derangements, including metabolic syndrome (MetS), in schizophrenia. We aim to determine the serum adiponectin levels in Chinese patients with schizophrenia, and explore the relationship between adiponectin levels and metabolic parameters, including MetS and its components. We hypothesized that serum adiponectin levels are similar in schizophrenia patients and controls, but decreased amongst patients on atypical antipsychotics.
Methods
81 patients and 81 controls were recruited. Anthropometric parameters and fasted blood samples for metabolic measurements were obtained. Serum adiponectin levels were measured using Bioplex assays.
Results
There was no difference in median adiponectin levels between schizophrenia patients and controls. Those taking typical antipsychotics alone had lower median adiponectin levels than those on mixed typical and atypical antipsychotics. Serum adiponectin level, controlled for age, gender and body mass index, was positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and negatively correlated with diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in schizophrenia patients. Patients with MetS had lower median adiponectin levels than those without MetS, and serum adiponectin levels decreased as the number of MetS components increased. After adjusting for variables thought to influence MetS, our logistic regression model did not reveal any significant association between adiponectin levels and MetS in schizophrenia patients.
Conclusion
Our findings highlight the need for more studies focusing on serum adiponectin level and its relationship with MetS in schizophrenia, particularly in those taking typical antipsychotics."

Mood disorders in adolescents also put them at risk for other conditions that may persist long after the initial episodes of depression are resolved. In our study we have assessed the mood state spectrum of a person over the time and validated the same by correlating with salivary cortisol, psychologist assessment results.
Methods and materials
Images from the training dataset are classified according to one among the nine emotions. The Images that are classified accordingly are taken as training set and a suitable convolutional neural network is trained/retrained for this data. The mean values predicted moods are considered as input for another model that predicts higher the stress level.
Results
With the inception v3 trained for 1,00,000 times with the data set that’s close to 12,000 images classified accordingly to the nine emotion classes as specified by psychologist the model was able to obtain 78.4% of testing accuracy while with the near perfect training accuracy.
Conclusion
The mood analysis was conclusively helpful in the estimation of the negative emotion parameter as close to the values that are obtained by with Depression, Anxiety and stress scale (DASS21) the mood analysis. The salivary cortisol as unbiased variable correlating with DASS 21 score could have a potential uses in early detection of mood disorder and correction.

With the growing burden of mental disorders, pharmacists are ideally positioned to play an important role in supporting people with a mental illness. However, the value of clinical pharmacists within mental health remains unrecognized by other healthcare professionals.
Aims
The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions and expectations of mental health professionals on the provision of clinical pharmacy services (CPS) at a psychiatric hospital.
Methods
A cross-sectional, self-administered, online survey was administered to physicians and nurses working at a psychiatric hospital. Five-point likert scales were used to measure participant’s perceptions and expectations about the CPS provided. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis were undertaken.
Results
Both physicians and nurses reported positive perceptions regarding the CPS provided at the hospital, although physicians agreement with positive statements was higher than those reported by nurses (mean likert scale score 4.76 and 4.45, respectively). There was a statistically significant positive association between participants’ years of experience and agreeing that clinical pharmacy services are essential for achieving hospital accreditation (χ2 = 13.11, φ = 0.41, p = 0.04). A statistically significant positive association was noted between the physicians’ current position and agreeing that pharmacists assist physicians in selecting more cost effective medication regimens (χ2 = 16.55, φ = 0.62, p = 0.04).
Conclusion
Physicians and nurses have mostly positive perceptions and expectations from clinical pharmacists at the psychiatric hospital. However, traditional clinical pharmacy services were more favorably viewed than those associated with advanced clinical roles such as prescribing and pharmacist-led medication management clinics."

abstract = "Background
Drug addiction is linked with micro-structural changes in the fronto-striatal white matter (WM) tracts. However, little is known regarding causality (risk factor for subsequent drug use vs. effect of chronic drug use) and reversibility of such changes.
Methods
In this study, 30-direction diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to examine WM integrity of selected fronto-striatal circuitries: the orbito-frontal circuit (OFC), anterior cingulate (AC), inferior frontal circuit (IFC), and genu of corpus callosum (CC-G). Fractional anisotropy (FA) as a measure of WM integrity was compared between actively opioid dependent subjects [OD, N = 30], their non-substance-dependent siblings [SG, N = 30], opioid dependent subjects currently abstinent [AG, N = 15] and non-substance-dependent controls [CG, N = 15] who were gender and handedness-matched. Trait impulsivity and executive functions were also compared.
Results
Compared to CG, OD group had significantly lower FA in the bilateral IFC and right OFC. Reduced FA in left IFC was also present in SG, when compared to CG, whereas SG had higher FA in the left anterior cingulum than OD. AG had significantly low FA in left IFC and CCG than CG. Trait impulsivity was highest in OD, followed by SG and CG. Non-planning impulsiveness score was significantly correlated with FA of left IFC. OD had impairment in executive functions compared to CG. WM changes in opioid dependence involve fronto-striatal circuits implicated in poor decisional balance and impulsivity.
Conclusion
Changes in Left IFC appear to predate the onset of addiction, conferring vulnerability, and persist during abstinence. Behavioral and neuro-psychological assessments concur with the imaging results."

abstract = "Background
Hoarding is a disorder characterized by excessive acquisition and persistent difficulty in discarding possessions. The behaviour has adverse emotional, physical, social, financial, and legal outcomes for the person with the disorder and family members, and might pose a significant public health problem. Hoarding has been included as a distinct disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth edition (DSM-5). The prevalence of hoarding disorder is approximately 2–6% globally. The current state of the evidence does not offer clear understanding of the causes of hoarding behaviours. A systematic review of the extant literature was carried out to determine the possible causal factors of hoarding behaviours.
Methods
This review is conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines. The following electronic databases: Medline through Ovid, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched for relevant articles published between January 2000 and November 2018. Only articles published in English language were included. Two reviewers independently scrutinized the studies and included them in this review.
Results
Our search strategy returned a total of 396 references. Preliminary findings suggest that individuals with hoarding behaviours may have a genetic susceptibility; abnormal neural activity in the fronto-temporal, para-hippocampal gyrus and insular parts of the brain has also been identified. Traumatic life experiences have also been posited to predispose individuals to hoard.
Conclusion
Although the understanding of hoarding disorder hasgrown in recent years, greater efforts are still needed to clarify the etiology and mechanisms of hoarding disorder as these may help in planning of more holistic interventions to treat the problem."

Opium users seem to constitute a distinct sub-population among opioid users, who have minimal complications, better functioning and socio-cultural acceptance. Prominent levels of stigma have been reported against people who use opioid drugs, but the same cannot be extrapolated to opium users. There is a vast number of opium users in India, and it is prudent to understand the stigma faced by them to better address their problems. Hence, in the current study we aimed to assess the internalized stigma and its correlates among opium users who seek treatment at a tertiary care drug treatment centre in North India. 117 adult male participants having opioid dependence (opium being the most common opioid in last 3 months) were assessed using Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale – Hindi version. The stigma scores were in the mild to moderate range, which was less than that found in previous studies among heroin and alcohol users in similar setting. Moreover, higher stigma scores were associated with lower educational status and higher proportions of income spent on substances. This is the first study to document stigma among opium users. Further research needs to be conducted to understand the determinants of stigma in this population."

The effectiveness of antipsychotic treatments in the acute phase of schizophrenia in actual clinical practice remains somewhat unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the present naturalistic, multi-center study conducted from 1 year starting in September 2017 was to examine the response rate to an initial or second antipsychotic in newly admitted patients with acute-phase schizophrenia, as well as the response rate and quality of augmentation with two antipsychotics in patients who failed to respond to both the initial and second antipsychotics.
Results
In total, there were 660 (42.8%) and 243 (15.7%) responders to an initial and a second antipsychotic, respectively; thus, 58.5% of all patients were responders to an initial or second antipsychotic. Among 581 nonresponders (37.7%), the initial antipsychotic or a third antipsychotic was added to the second antipsychotic. Among these patients, 89.8% showed a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score ≤3 (from ‘minimally improved’ to ‘very much improved’). The rates of adverse events such as hyperglycemia, hyper-low-density lipoprotein cholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperprolactinemia, QTc prolongation, and extrapyramidal symptoms were not high in patients receiving augmentation with two antipsychotics compared with all patients, and no serious adverse events were reported.

To assess the prevalence of smoking and drug use among adolescent boys, and to examine adolescents’ psychosocial factors, and suicidal behaviors associated with adolescents’ substance use.
Methods
The Kuwait Global School-Based Student Health Survey employed a two-stage cluster sample design targeting a representative sample of adolescents. This study focused on the participated 1310 boys. Statistical analysis included Chi-square test, student t-test, and multivariate analysis.
Results
The mean age was 14.5 ± 0.03 years. The reported prevalence of: smoking, ever drug use, and both smoking and drug use were 26.6% (95% CI:24.2–29.1%) and 7.4% (95% CI:6.1–9.0%) and 5.5% (95% CI:4.4–6.9%) respectively. Logistic regression model analysis revealed that adolescents whose parents smoke, suffered from insomnia, were victims of bullying, and had negative social school environment, were more likely than others to be smokers, drug users or both. Addendum, suicidal ideation, and its combination with suicidal planning and/or suicidal attempt were significantly associated with smoking. The odds of these life-threatening behaviors increased when drug use was reported and augmented when both smoking and drug use were experienced.
Conclusions
Prevalence of smoking and illicit drug use were high among adolescent boys. This study confirmed the association between adolescents’ smoking and substance use with psychosocial context, and suicidal behaviors. Addressing these predictors would be crucial in the development of effective strategies targeting the prevention of smoking and substance use, which might consequently reduce suicidal behaviors among adolescents."

The Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire was developed in English for the purpose of screening for bonding disorders among postpartum mothers. There was a felt need for a Tamil translation of the self-rated instrument.
Methods
The Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire was translated into Tamil (PBQ-T). Two hundred and fifty mother-infant dyads were administered the PBQ-T along with the Stafford Interview. The Stafford Interview was studied by two independent psychiatrists to arrive at a diagnosis of bonding disorders in the mothers. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Bangalore Maternal Behaviour Scale (BMBS) were used for rating depressive symptoms and caregiver reported behaviour of the mother towards the infant. We also did a factor analysis to find the factor structure of the PBQ-T.
Results
A 19-item PBQ-T that has five factors grouped into three subscales. The five factors are General Bonding (F1A), Frustration (F1B), Anxiety (F2), Feeling trapped (F3A) and Aggression/ Rejection dimensions (F3B) loading onto three subscales 1, 2 and 3. Total PBQ-T scores were best used to detect ‘any disorder of bonding’ (cut-off 5/6). Subscale 1 (cut-off 2/3) was useful in detection of mild disorders of bonding, subscale 2 (cut-off 2/3) for infant-focused anxiety and subscale 3 (cut-off 0/1) for Anger/ Rejection. Mothers with bonding disorders had greater psychological distress. Caregiver report of mother’s behaviour (BMBS) could detect anxiety and anger/ rejection but not the lack of emotional bond.
Conclusion
A 19-item Tamil version of the PBQ is useful in screening for disorders of mother-infant bonding among healthy postpartum mothers."

To assess the level and causes of perceived stress, and the barriers to seeking help from mental health professionals among Resident doctors at a tertiary care centre in North India.
Materials and methods
A 17 item questionnaire, requiring about 5–6 minutes for completion was used to carry out the survey.
Results
Out of the 1300 Residents currently working in the institute, 442 (32%) Residents participated in the survey. Most of the participants were post-graduate trainees. In terms of level of stress related to the work/workplace, moderate and severe stress was perceived by 42.8% and 39.1% of respondents. The stress was attributed mainly to long working hours (66.2%), lack of off-days (52.3%), poor work environment (35.4%) and academic pressure (41.3%). Nearly three-fourths of the respondents considered that the stress was taking a toll on their physical as well as mental health. However, only about 13% had sought help from mental health professionals within or outside the institute. The main barriers reported for not seeking help from mental health professionals included stigma of being labeled as mentally ill (54.6%), being labeled as weak amongst their peers (58.1%) and lack of time to seek consultation among others (43.1%).
Conclusions
Trainee doctors face significant levels of stress during their training program. However, few seek help. There is an unsaid need to address various issues pertaining to training, work environment and attitudes towards seeking help."

Suicide is a major, however under attended public health problem in Bangladesh. There is dearth of research regarding how newspapers communicate it to the mass population.
Objectives
We assessed the quality of online newspapers reporting of suicidal behaviors in Bangladesh against World Health Organization suicide reporting guidelines.
Methods
We searched and scrutinized published contents of 8 Bangla online news portals against the World Health Organization suicide reporting guidelines retrospectively.
Results
About 85% of the reports were connected to suicide, 93% reported single suicide, single person was involved in 82.50% of reports, and associated homicide was found in 7.50% of reports. About 96% of reports mentioned the name of the victims, 97% mentioned occupation, 96% mentioned method of suicide, 69% mentioned life events, and 64% reported certain mono-causality. Suicide in headline was found in about 94% of reports, 19% mentioned method in headline and 32% reported life events in headline. About 14% reports posted images of victims and no article provided any potentially helpful reporting practices.
Conclusion
Media reports of suicidal behavior in Bangladesh in online portal were found to be poor quality when assessed against WHO suicide reporting guidelines. Details of victims, methods, life events and mono-causal explanations were being mentioned regularly. Substantial lacking has been noticed in approaches of educating the population and introducing preventive measures in the reports."

Twin and family studies have indicated a genetic component, while genome-wide studies have implicated a number of susceptibility genes, most of which have direct or indirect roles in neuronal migration. Reelin (RELN) has important biological functions facilitating migration of neurons. Polymorphisms in RELN have been implicated in related disorders like autism and schizophrenia but have not been examined in dyslexia. We hypothesized that not only RELN, but its interactors in the neuronal migration pathway may play roles in the etiology of dyslexia. Twenty two functional variants across six RELN signalling genes (RELN, VLDLR, APOER2, DAB1, LIS1 and NDEL1) and two dyslexia candidate genes (DCDC2 and ROBO1) were analyzed for association in twenty six nuclear and three extended families with individuals affected with dyslexia. Univariate association analysis was suggestive of association (puncorrected = 0.01) with rs362746 in RELN which however did not withstand Bonferroni corrections (pcorrected = 0.21). Multimarker tests indicated significant association (p = 0.037), based on which we tested for haplotype associations. Although there were no significant haplotypic associations, we found that a three marker unit with rs3808039 and rs2072403 flanking and independently in linkage disequilibrium with rs362746 was significantly overtransmitted (risk allelic combination – TAT) to dyslexia affected individuals in the sample (p = 0.002). Our results suggest preliminary evidence for a new potential risk variant in the RELN locus for dyslexia."

OM chanting is associated with an experience of relaxation, changes in autonomic balance and deactivation of limbic brain regions. While functional localization is important, how brain regions interact with each other has been shown to underlie various brain functions. Therefore, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that there is reduced communication between deactivated regions during OM chanting. In order to do so, we employed multivariate autoregressive model (MVAR) based Granger causality to obtain directional connectivity between deactivated regions. fMRI scans of 12 right handed healthy volunteers (9 Men) from a previously published study was used in which participants performed OM chanting and a control condition in a block design. We found that outputs from insula, anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices were significantly reduced in OM condition. Of interest is the reduction of outputs from these regions to limbic area amygdala. Modulation of brain regions involved in emotion processing and implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD) raises a potential possibility of OM chanting in the treatment of MDD."

Since miRNAs regulate targetgenes by binding to 3'UTRs of target mRNAs, the functional variants located in 3′UTR of TCF4 are highly suggested to affect the gene expressions in schizophrenia. To test the hypothesis regarding the effects of the variants located in 3’UTR of TCF4, we conducted an in silico analysis to identify the functional variants and their predicted functions. In this study, we sequenced the 3’UTR of TCF4 in 13 multiplex schizophrenia families and 14 control families. We found two functional variants carried by three unrelated patients. We determined that the C allele of rs1272363 and the TC insert of rs373174214 might suppress post- transcriptional expression. Secondly, we cloned the region that flanked these two variants into a dual luciferase reporter system and compared the luciferase activities between the pmirGLO-TCF4 (control), pmirGLO-TCF4-rs373174214 and pmirGLO-TCF4-rs1273263. Both pmirGLO-TCF4-rs373174214 and pmirGLO-TCF4-rs1273263 caused lower reporter gene activities, as compared to the control. However, only the C allele of rs1272363 reduced the luciferase activity significantly (p = 0.0231). Our results suggested that rs1273263 is a potential regulator of TCF4 expression, and might be associated with schizophrenia."

Qualitative methodology was employed to explore mental health professionals’ experience with clozapine prescribing practices. Semi-structured, individual in-depth interviews were conducted. All interviews were analyzed using a thematic approach. A total of 13 interviews were conducted with participants from six AG countries. Four major themes emerged from the analysis in relation to clozapine prescribing and monitoring practices, clozapine use guidelines, and barriers to the use of clozapine. Thematic analysis revealed a tendency to under prescribe clozapine in the AG region, which appears to be predominantly influenced by prescriber-related barriers and less likely due to the lack of a nation-wide hematological monitoring program. Future studies should explore strategies for overcoming the barriers identified."

Patients attempted suicide by psychotropic drug overdose and require medical care have increased, becoming a serious problem in Japan. This study investigated the characteristics of patients who attempted suicide by overdose and required emergency care, with a focus on quantity of drugs taken.
Methods
We conducted a clinical survey of 98 patients examined at the emergency centre of the psychiatric department of Jichi Medical University Hospital and hospitalized for attempted suicide by drug overdose from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014. Data were collected by chart review and subjected to statistical analysis.
Results
Diagnoses were mainly mood disorder and neurosis in both genders. Also, 23.5% of the cases had multiple hospitalizations at the centre, and past overdose was significantly higher in these patients. The average total number of pills/sachets ingested was 84.4 ± 95.5, but no significant difference was noted in dosage according to psychiatric clinic visit history (P = 0.63). Of these patients, 45.1% returned to their previous hospital, and 12.2% were hospitalized in the psychiatric ward.
Conclusion
These results are consistent with reports in the literature. Psychiatric outpatient history does not seem to be a risk factor for attempted suicide by ingesting higher drug doses."

Obsessive compulsive symptoms are often present in persons with schizophrenia. Adequately powered studies to evaluate the effect of such symptoms in the course of the disorder, are few.
Aim
We aimed to estimate the prevalence and type of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in persons with schizophrenia.
Methods
We evaluated 200 outpatients with schizophrenia (DSM-V) on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). Participants with or without obsessive compulsive symptoms were matched on age, gender and age of onset of schizophrenia. Appropriate analysis by comparisons and correlations were performed.
Results
Prevalence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms was 18.5% (n = 37/200). Most common obsession was contamination and compulsion was cleaning/washing with a prevalence of 51.35% and 63.33% respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups on age, gender, marital status, residence, age of onset or total duration of illness of schizophrenia. The OC symptoms group had significantly higher general psychopathology and PANSS total scores. There was significant positive correlation between YBOCS total obsession scores (To) and total PANSS scores (r = 0.358) (p = 0.030), as well as PANSS general psychopathology subscale scores (Gt) (r = 0.395) (p = 0.016) and finally between total YBOCS scores (To + Tc) and PANSS positive subscale scores (Pt)(r = 0.344) (p = 0.037).
Conclusion
There was a significant subgroup of schizophrenia patients (almost one fifth) who complained of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. This group reported significantly higher general psychopathology and could thus be said to be more seriously ill, in an adequately powered cross sectional study."

The current study was performed on 54 patients meeting DSM-5 criteria for OCD and 54 healthy subjects who matched with patients in gender, age, marital and educational status. The cognitive functions were assessed by The Stroop test, Wisconsin Cart Sorting Test (WCST), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) and the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). The performance of the OCD group was significantly worse than the healthy group in comparison with the all subscales of the Stroop and WSCT tests. Also, functions in information processing among two groups were statistically significant for 3- and 2-second PASAT. The results demonstrated that OCD patients have deficits in several aspects of cognitive functions. Hence, the treatment of these patients can be contributed by paying more attention to these deficits."

Results
Compared to patients with depressive disorder, patients with schizophrenia reported poor marital adjustment (in the consensus and satisfaction domains of DAS) and poor quality of marriage. Compared to patients with depressive disorder, patients with schizophrenia reported significantly lower sexual satisfaction. There was no difference in the prevalence of sexual dysfunction between the groups. Poor marital adjustment in patients with schizophrenia was associated with lower sexual satisfaction but not with sexual dysfunction.

Our purpose was to explore perceptions of Indian parents regarding causation and diagnosis of problematic childhood behaviors diagnosed as ADHD or hyperkinetic disorder, and to understand the process of decision making and help seeking using a qualitative study design.
Method
In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 52 parents (33 mothers and 19 fathers), focusing on initial emotional reactions and cognitive appraisals, decision making, parental causal explanations and perceptions regarding diagnosis and symptom labeling.
Results
Mothers were decision makers for seeking professional help either singly or jointly in 76.1% of cases. Initial reactions ranged from those with negative valence (negative emotional reactions and cognitive appraisals) to ambi-valence (recognition of problems, but at the same time not accepting completely) and positive valence (sense of relief and hopefulness). Psycho-social explanations (63.46%) were more common than biological explanations (51.82%), with 19.23% reporting both explanations. Biological explanations included illness model (e.g. brain problem, obstetric complications), hereditary and intellectual disability. Psycho-social explanations included psychological (e.g. lack of motivation) and social (e.g. problems with disciplining at home) causations. Irrespective of initial reactions and causal explanations, a significant majority of parents were aware of the diagnosis and labeled problems as symptoms attributable to ADHD.
Conclusion
Our findings provide insights for development of culturally sensitive psycho-social interventions; from understanding of causal attributions, process of decision making and help seeking."

abstract = "Background
Psychiatric co-morbidity is a common condition, partly due to the overlap of symptoms in the categorical diagnosis of mental disorders. The co-occurrence of schizophrenia (SZ) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common and challenging co-morbid condition. Also, the relationship between SZ and OCD remains unclear.
Aim
The aim of this study was to describe the co-morbidity of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) among schizophrenia (SZ) patients and compare clinical characteristics of schizophrenia patients with versus without comorbid OCD.
Subjects and Methods
A cohort-study was carried out on 396 patients enrolled between November 2011 to June 2014 at the Department of Psychiatry, Rumeilah Hospital in Qatar. We employed the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI), and Structured clinical interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) for diagnoses, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist for scoring OCD. Patients were grouped in SZ patients with and without comorbid OCD (SZ-OCD vs SZ).
Results
396 subjects were interviewed. Age of SZ-OCD patients was 42.69 ± 14.33 (years old) whereas SZ patients without OCD ranged 41.59 ± 13.59 years old. There were statistically significant differences in clinical characteristics between SZ with and without OCD : age (p = 0.010), BMI (body mass index; p = 0.011), education (p = 0.033), employment (p = 0.019), cigarette smoking (p = 0.039), sheesha smoking (p = 0.008), and prevalence of consanguinity (p = 0.043). In particular, the rate of consanguinity in the current generation was 31.8% [95% CI = 29.1–34.7]. Also, there were statistically significant differences at Hamilton Depression score, General Health Score, Clinical Global Impression- Score, duration of illnesses, and Global Assessment of Functioning (p < 0.001). The results show that anxious, mood and psychotic dimensions rated higher among SZ - OCD ones than SZ only patients.
Conclusion
This study confirms that SZ-OCD is a common co-morbidity and prevalence of SZ OCD is higher among patients reporting a degree of consanguinity. Even if this condition is under-recognized in clinical practice, it may significantly change SZ presentation and outcome since psychopathological dimensions report higher scores in the co-morbidity sample."

We have examined whether cell cycle dysregulation in AD can be detected using patient and control derived B-lymphocytes. Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry demonstrated that cell cycle dysregulation occurs in AD lymphocytes, with a significant difference in the distribution of cells in G0/G1, S and G2/M phases of cell cycle as compared to control lymphocytes. Using global gene expression analysis by RNA sequencing and cell cycle analysis, we examined the role of Retinoic Acid (RA), a candidate molecule predicted to be of therapeutic potential in cell cycle dysregulation associated with AD. CCND1, CCNE2, E2F transcription factors which are known to be dysregulated in AD were among the 32 genes that showed differential expression in response to RA treatment thus suggesting a protective role of RA. However, the cell cycle analysis demonstrated that RA did not reverse the cellular phenotype in AD lymphocytes. This suggests that though RA might have a protective role by influencing the expression of cell cycle genes, it might not be able to arrest abnormal re-entry into cell cycle."

Objectives
We aimed to adapt and validate the DOCS in Bangla.
Methods
This validation study was conducted from January 2016 to July 2017 using purposive sampling technique. A total of 100 OCD patients were recruited from OCD clinic of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University after considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We applied Bangla version of DOCS to collect data and assessed different forms of validity and reliability.
Results
Cronbach’s alpha of DOCS Bangla was 0.93 which signifies a good internal consistency. Cronbach’s alpha of contamination domain was 0.92; responsibility domain 0.94, thought domain 0.91 and symmetry domain was found 0.93. Four factors were extracted from exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation. Pearson correlation was 0.73 between the DOCS Bangla total global score and the Y-BOCS total score which signifies good criterion validity.
Conclusion
DOCS Bangla is a psychometrically reliable and valid tool for use in clinical settings, research and primary care setting to diagnose and manage OCD for Bangla speaking population."

abstract = "Background
We used two different yet complementary methods to capture the ‘hidden population’ of illicit substance users in the state of Punjab, India: Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) and Punjab Drug Use Monitoring Survey (P-DUMS).
Methodology
For the RAS component, following a pilot study, Respondent Driven Sampling was used to recruit 6600 community-dwelling substance dependent persons aged 11–60 years from all the 22 districts of Punjab. Size was estimated using benchmark-multiplier method, and prevalence was calculated by projecting these data to the source population. For the P-DUMS component, data were collected on 7421 inpatients from 75 government de-addiction centres from 19 districts of Punjab.
Results
Subjects In both RAS and P-DUMS were primarily opioid dependent (88% in RAS and 83% in P-DUMS). Heroin (inhaled/injected) emerged as the commonest opioid in both RAS (46%) and P-DUMS (52%), though 30.5% of the RAS sample also used the prescription opioid tramadol. Using the benchmark-multiplier method, 0.27 million (2.5% of the source population) were estimated to be opioid dependent, of which nearly 78,000 (0.7% of the source population) were injecting opioid users (IDUs), predominantly heroin (62%) but also buprenorphine (32.5%). High-risk behaviour was reported by nearly 60% of IDUs. Only 14% of the RAS sample had ever visited any de-addiction centre, and only 2.8% individuals had been admitted to a de-addiction centre in the past year.
Conclusion
There is a substantive problem of opioid dependence in this difficult-to-reach population of Punjab, with low treatment access. Misuse of prescription opioids along with IDU also raises concern."

BMAS was required to fill in a second time after two weeks for the study of test-retest reliability. Results of BMAS were matched with those of other scales and blood level of prescribed mood stabilizers to test for construct validity. Data analysis was performed for 84 patients. Median BMAS scores recorded at both times were identical at 89/100, and a cutoff score of 70 was considered medication adherent with a sensitivity of 98.61% (CI 92.50%–99.96%). BMAS was positively and significantly correlated with the established Medication Adherence Rating Scale -Taiwanese (Spearman’s ρ = 0.56, p < 0.05) and with variation in serum mood stabilizer level (Pearson's r = 0.55, p < 0.05). On the other hand, correlations with scales measuring mental condition and medication side effects were weak. Principal component analysis found two components (i.e. medication taking behaviors and attitudes) for the 10-question BMAS. Test-retest BMAS total scores were significantly correlated (intraclass correlation alpha = 0.87, p < 0.05), and Cronbach’s alpha measuring internal consistency was 0.68.

Adolescent cyberbullying and high-risk behaviour outcomes has been a major concern in the last few years. Gender discrepancy is an important component that predicts the outcomes. This study aimed to elaborate and identify the association between cyberbullying experience and high-risk behaviour outcomes based on gender differences among adolescents in Indonesia. Method: A cross sectional study that involved junior and senior high schools in Jakarta. There were 2917 adolescents who took part in this study. The cyberbullying questionnaire was used to identify the cyberbullying experienced. High-risk behaviour included in this study was tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and self-harm behaviour. Chi-Square test and odds ratio analysis were applied through SPSS for Mac. Results: The highest proportion in this study was composed of adolescents of both genders who acted as victim/perpetrator (52.25%). Adolescent males who indulged in cyberbullying showed an increased risk for cigarette smoking (OR = 2.97); male adolescents who were victims and victim/perpetrator of cyberbullying had a higher risk to consume alcohol (OR = 2.96 & OR = 6.93). Meanwhile, the risk of self-hurting behaviour increased for both female and male with cyberbullying victimization (OR = 3.68 & OR = 2.97). Female adolescents who acted as victim/perpetrator had a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and attempting suicide (OR = 1.90 & OR = 2.11); and they were also at risk of consuming alcohol (OR = 2.84). Conclusion: Cyberbullying returned negative impacts on both genders of adolescents. Boys showed a greater tendency to externalize while girls showed a greater tendency to internalize. Mental health promotion that is designed specifically for both genders might address the adolescents’ needs."

Various approaches have tried to explain the intricacies in depression and suicide, as a consequence of faulty psychological adjustment of the individual. Several therapeutic approaches have been developed to strengthen one’s coping process, among which cognitive behaviour therapy has shown promising results. Also, mindfulness-based approaches to cognitive behavioural therapy have further accelerated the well-being of such individuals. This study was conducted with an aim to see the effect of mindfulness-based cognitive behaviour therapy on life satisfaction and life orientation in adolescents with depression and suicidal behaviour. A sample of 30 adolescents who scored high on scales of depression and suicidal tendencies were administered pre-test measures on life satisfaction and life orientation. After that they were exposed to an eight weeks programme on mindfulness-based cognitive behaviour therapy, followed by a post-assessment on the same measures. The analysis of pre and post test revealed a significant enhancement in life satisfaction, life orientation, and family functioning as well as a reduction in depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. It is concluded that mindfulness-based cognitive behaviour therapy serves as an effective medium to enhance the psychological functioning of depressive and suicidal adolescents."

Penetration of mobile technology is rapidly rising. Excessive use leads to Technology addiction, which often start early in adolescence. The purpose of the present study was to assess Technology addiction and its correlates among school students in rural India.
Methods
This cross sectional study was conducted among 885 school students in north India. Four schools were selected and participants aged 13–18 years, were enrolled randomly. A self-designed 45 item questionnaire was used to evaluate dependence syndrome (intense desire, impaired control, tolerance, withdrawal, persistence despite harm, neglect of alternate pleasure) as used for substance dependence in ICD-10. Screening for depression and anxiety was done by using patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) respectively. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were done.
Results
The mean age of the study participants was 15.1 years. Among the participants, 30.3% (95% Confidence Interval = 27.2%–33.3%) met the dependence criteria. One-third (33%) of the students stated that their grades had gone down due to gadget use. Technology addiction was more among male students (odds ratio = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.43, 5.59), those having a personal mobile phone (2.98, (1.52–5.83), use smart phone (2.77, 1.46–5.26), use one additional gadget (2.12, 1.14–3.94) and those who were depressed (3.64, 2.04–6.49).
Conclusion
Increased mobile phone access in rural India is leading to technology addiction among school students. Certain demographic and gadget specific factors predict addiction. The technology addiction possibly contributes to poor academic performance and depression. This warrants studies on a larger scale, with interventions for judicious use of gadgets."

Psychosis is a mental disorder resulting in high disability impacts. Many studies show that early detection of prodromal symptoms may improve prognosis. Psychotic prodromal symptoms may mimic other mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety or learning difficulties. The aim of this study was to analyze validity, reliability, sensitivity and specificity of the Prodromal Questionnaire Brief Version (PQ-B) Indonesian version to detect psychotic prodromal symptoms.
Method
The PQ-B was translated into Indonesian then back-translated into English. Subjects included in this study were 50 children and adolescent psychiatric patients from Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital, aged 10–18 years old. Validity measurement was performed by comparing the total score and distress score of PQ-B with the categorical scale of Structured Interview for Prodromal Symptoms (SIPS) as the gold standard using Spearman correlation. Total scale and subscale reliability were examined using the Cronbach’s Alpha.
Results
Analysis with Spearman correlation showed significant results of both PQ-B total score with diagnosis of SIPS (r = 0.374 and p = 0.007); and PQ-B distress score with diagnosis of SIPS (r = 0.400 and p = 0.004). Cronbach Alpha coefficient was equal to 0.853 for all scales. The sensitivity of the PQ-B in the Indonesian language is 70%, and the specificity is 72%, whereas, in the original language (English), the sensitivity and specificity is 88% and 68%.
Conclusion
This study provides evidence of good validity, reliability, sensitivity, and specificity of PQ-B Indonesian language to detect prodromal symptoms of those who seek help in the psychiatric outpatient clinic."

Studies have shown the adverse impact of exposure to community violence on adolescent health. However, most of the studies were conducted in high-income countries. This study aimed at assessing the community violence exposure and the determinants of mental health problems among adolescents in Ambon, a post-conflict area in Indonesia.
Material and methods
We conducted a cross-sectional, school-based study involving 511 of 10th-graders from six randomly selected high schools in Kotamadya Ambon. Our participants were assessed using a set of questionnaires including the Strength Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to measure mental health problems, and the child version of the Screen for Adolescent Violence Exposure (KID-SAVE) to measure community violence exposure. The hierarchical regression analyses were used to explore the determinants of mental health problems.
Results
In this study, boys reported more exposure to community violence (both in frequency and severity) than girls. Meanwhile, the girls reported higher emotional problems than boys. The hierarchical regression analyses revealed that in the total sample and among boys, the community violence exposure was associated with mental health problems. However, it was the perceived impact of community violence exposure which showed an association with mental health problems among girls.
Conclusions
This study revealed the high community violence exposure among adolescents living in a post-conflict setting in Indonesia. The study also found gender differences in the determinants of mental health problems among adolescents who were exposed to CVE."

Cognitive impairment is one of the most important culprit influencing the long-term neurological outcome commonlyobserved in TBI survivors.
Aims
To examine the performance of patients with Mild and Moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) using as a screening tool.
Results
Total 228 (127 Mild TBI & 101 Moderate TBI) patients were recruited in this study. Results showed that patients with moderate TBI had lower score on the MoCA as compared to patients with mild TBI (p Value = 0.031). This difference was observed statistically significant among mild and moderate TBI for the cube copy (p = 0.039) and clock (p = 0.017) i.e. visuospatial/executive function, Digit span test (p value = 0.040) i.e. concentration and recall memory (p = 0.04). MoCA Score were higher for patients with higher GCS score at admission. Education status was also correlated with MoCA scores; those patients with higher level of education had significant association with higher MoCA scores (p value = 0.012). This study showed that age and gender were insignificant variables to determine cognitive function.
Conclusion
Assessment of cognitive impairment should be considered as a mandatory protocol while evaluating post TBI patients, even in cases of mild TBI. Visuospatial/Executive function, memory and attention are the most commonly impaired cognitive functions in patients of TBI, and these are the main domain of cognition which differentiates mild impairment from moderate impairment. This information enables us and provides insight to our experience to predict the burdens of problem and plan to develop post TBI dedicated rehabilitating programme."

We sought to examine the endophenotype pattern of neuro-hemodynamic substrates of emotion counting Stroop (ecStroop) paradigm in patients with OCD, their unaffected siblings [first degree relatives-FDR] and healthy controls (HC).
Methods
OCD patients (medication naïve)[N = 16], their unaffected siblings(FDR)[N = 16] and HC [N = 24] were compared using an established ecStroop paradigm in a 3-Tesla fMRI. The relative BOLD signals corresponding to the three types of conditions (neural words-N, words with negative emotional salience-E and words with salience for OCD-O) were examined in the apriori hypothesized brain regions.
Results
Both in O minus N contrast and O minus E contrast, the groups demonstrated significant differential activation of right insula (BA 13). The post-hoc analyses showed in patients and FDRs relative to HC the following: significant hyperactivation of insula in O minus E contrast; significant hyperactivation of right insula and right DLPFC (BA 9) in O minus N contrast.
Conclusions
The neuro-hemodynamic responses corresponding to the obsessive words in insula and DLPFC could be potential endophenotypes. “Threat relatedness” might thus have a vulnerability meaning in the pathogenesis and neurobiological basis of OCD."

Therapeutic alternatives include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation which may be an effective choice for treatment-resistant depression but requires prolonged treatments for at least four to six weeks. Shorter exposure to this technique might be more advantageous for certain cases. The purpose of this review is to describe and discuss studies that have evaluated the safety and efficacy of accelerated transcranial magnetic stimulation (aTMS) in the acute treatment of depression. Methods: The electronic literature (NCBI Pubmed; Science Direct) on aTMS for the treatment of depression was reviewed. In the last years, a limited number of controlled and open-label studies have been published on the subject. The majority of these studies have shown promising results with aTMS, this protocol probably being at least as safe and as efficacious as conventional rTMS (five sessions per week) in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) with a trend for faster response rates when more intensive protocols are used (15 sessions over two days). Future well-designed sham-controlled studies with larger samples are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of aTMS in the treatment of depression."

In this study we investigated the effectiveness of the interpretation modification training on modifying interpretation bias in depression and its association with symptoms reduction. In a double-blind, randomized controlled design, twenty-two depressed individuals (mean age = 19.86, SD = 1.16) were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. They completed 10 sessions of cognitive training with the Ambiguous Hallmark Program (AHP) over 5 weeks. Participants’ interpretation bias and their depressive scores were assessed and compared before and after the intervention. Results showed that the AHP significantly decreased negative interpretation in the experimental group. Additionally, a significant decrease in the depressive scores was also observed in the intervention group compared to the control group. We also observed the transfer of learning from the AHP training to another interpretation bias task. The AHP can significantly modify negative interpretations and symptoms in depression providing preliminary supporting evidence for its clinical application especially in mild-to-moderate depression. Improved cognitive control over emotional information and unbiased attention to them could explain effects of the Interpretation modification paradigm. Further studies need to examine the efficacy of the AHP as a potential cognitive intervention in depression."

To examine the differences in whole brain topology and connectivity in 17 children of the ages 3–8 years across severity of ASD, we performed resting state fMRI using a 3T MRI scanner and graph theoretical analysis of networks.
Method
Patients were partitioned into two cohorts based on the severity of ASD, determined using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) scores (Mild, 30–36; Severe, 37+). Standard preprocessing pipeline was used, followed by independent component analysis (ICA) to identify regions of interest (ROIs) to construct subject-specific Z-correlation matrices representing the whole brain network. Following which, graph theory measures were calculated in the range of sparsity 6%–35% and statistically analyzed, and corrected for significance (FDR corrected, p < 0.05). Regional clustering coefficient that revealed significant between-group (mild vs. severe) differences were correlated against clinical scores (CARS).
Results
Children with severe ASD revealed significantly increased clustering coefficient and small-worldness compared to those with mild or moderate ASD. Region of interest analysis revealed altered clustering in the Heschl’s gyrus that significantly correlated with CARS scores.
Conclusion
The findings from the current study provide early stage evidence of aberrant brain connectivity appearing in severe ASD, prior to the effect of environmental bias and pruning mechanisms. The clustering of the Heschl’s gyrus correlated to the severity of ASD symptoms and agrees with current literature on ASD-associated cortical changes, reflecting early changes to language processing regions."

Methods: The parents of adolescents in the age group of 10 to 18 (N = 81) were recruited from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore, Karnataka, India. Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (Parent version), Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire (Parent version) and, the Parent Interview Schedule (PIS) were used to assess the parental practices, emotional and behavioral problems and abnormal psychosocial environment of the adolescents. The data were analyzed with stepwise multiple linear and Quantile regression to find out significant predictors of emotional and behavioral problems among adolescents. Results: Adolescent’s age, parental involvement, and paternal age are the significant predictors of emotional problems. Parental mental disorder or deviance, gender, and inconsistent discipline are the significant predictors for conduct problems. Poor monitoring and supervision, paternal and maternal age are statistically significant predictors of prosocial skills among the adolescents. Inadequate or distorted intrafamilial communication and parental mental disorder are the significant predictors of total difficulties among the adolescents. Conclusion: The study validates the role of abnormal psychosocial environments and negative parenting practices as risk factors for emotional and behavioral problems among the adolescents. A comprehensive analysis which covers all possible variables related to adolescent mental health is mandatory for the health professionals before planning the intervention."

The Indian National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) of 2015–2016 has estimated 13.7% lifetime and 10.6% point prevalence for mental illnesses. It has identified that the treatment gap for mental illnesses ranges between 70% and 92%. Tele-Psychiatric consultations could be an alternative and innovative approach to bridge this gap in low resource settings.
Aims
To study the sociodemographic and clinical profiles of patients who have received collaborative Tele-Psychiatric consultations across district hospitals in Karnataka, India.
Methodology
We performed a retrospective review of case files of patients who have received collaborative Tele-Psychiatric consultations from January 2013 to June 2017 through video-conferencing. A total of 139 consultations were provided to patients in the state of Karnataka.
Results
The mean age of the sample is 31 (±15.5) years. 61.8% were male and 79.8% were aged more than 18 years. In total, 25.9% of them had schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, 14.4% had mental retardation, 13.7% had a mood disorder and 14.4% had a substance use disorder. 67.6% of patients had been advised pharmacotherapy, 7.9% had been advised rehabilitation along with pharmacotherapy and 24.4% were advised further evaluation of illness and inpatient care at a higher centre.
Conclusion
Collaborative tele-psychiatric consultations to district hospitals from an academic tertiary care hospital can be feasible and are likely to benefit patients from rural areas. There is a need for more studies to elucidate their acceptability by patients, caregivers and professionals."

Perinatal depression has been associated with infant low birth weight and with multiple health indicators affecting childhood morbidity and mortality. The condition is twice as prevalent in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) compared to high-income countries but poorly studied.
Aim
To conduct a review of published literature on interventions for perinatal depression in LMICs.
Methods
A search of the literature was performed for articles published up to October 2017. The key inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed studies focusing on interventions for perinatal depression during pregnancy and/or up to one-year postpartum.
Results
1088 citations were retrieved, of which 18 studies with representation from countries in Africa, Asia, North America (Mexico) and South America were included. The majority of interventions were conducted in lower-income settings. Most were psychosocial in nature and often provided by lay health workers and in the community. Interventions integrated as part of general health programs and employing psychotherapeutic approaches were more effective and were also preferred. Only one study incorporated the use of psychiatric medications.
Conclusion
Despite the limited publications, there is reasonable evidence for the benefit of psychological interventions in perinatal depression in LMICs. More research is needed to verify and extend these results and, in particular, to evaluate the benefit of adjunctive medications when treating moderate to severe depression and whether interventions can increase social supports."

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe chronic mental disorder and tends to be refractory to pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy. For treatment-refractory patients, neurosurgical interventions are options. 64 % of OCD patients who undergo neurosurgery still have greater than 16 in the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) after a long-term follow-up. Here, we reported a patient living with long-term OCD (20 years) who was refractory to pharmacotherapy, mindfulness-based psychotherapy, and neurosurgery that injured his bilateral anterior cingulates (AC) and caudate nucleus.
Methods
The patient accepted a novel psychotherapy named cognitive-coping therapy (CCT) and completed Y-BOCS, Hamilton depression rating scale, the Hamilton anxiety rating scale, social and occupational function assessment, and resting-state function magnetic resonance imaging scans (rs-fMRI) before and after 4-week CCT.
Results
His Y-BOCS score was reduced from 25 to 4. His depression score and anxiety score were reduced from 19 to 3 and from 12 to 3, respectively. The global assessment of functioning score increased from 32 to 88.
Conclusions
The remission of the patient suggested that CCT could be an alternative intervention for treatment-refractory OCD and those with severe OCD could be cured in short-term."

The objective of the study is to discuss psychological morbidity in persons following retirement in Indian context. Previous studies indicate possible cross-cultural differences with conflicting findings of positive and negative impact on mental health following retirement in the developed countries. Few available Indian studies on this topic suggest lower self-esteem, low mood, physical health and financial insecurity as mental health consequences following retirement. There is need for prospective studies from India to evaluate the impact of retirement on psychological morbidity as well as the role of related social factors, as the effects on mental health post retirement is more likely to be culture specific."

We studied the prevalence of emotional psychopathology and examined the mediating role of environmental factors (family support, community support and participation in religious rituals) in relation to psychopathology. College students (N = 1555), aged 18–24 years, from urban and rural domicile were screened on Children of Alcoholics Screening Test (CAST) and those who were positive were assessed for emotional psychopathology on Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Young-adult children of alcoholics with emotional psychopathology were compared with those without emotional psychopathology on demographic characteristics, quality of life, and a questionnaire which measured the role of socio-cultural factors. 33% (N = 512) of 1555 participants screened were found to be Young-adult children of alcoholics. Among them, 35% (N = 181) reported experiencing emotional psychopathology. Participants with high emotional psychopathology reported receiving less support from the family (8.44 ± 1.19 vs 9.57 ± 1.26, p = 0.003), community (6.97 ± 1.08 vs 8.88 ± 1.19, p = 0.001); they participated less in religious rituals (5 ± 0.18 vs 6.56 ± 0.41, p = 0.008) compared to those without psychopathology.

To determine the prevalence of falls and to assess its relationship with cognitive deficits, depression, visual impairment and self-reported hearing impairment among the elderly.
Methods
This was a community-based, cross-sectional study conducted in 52 villages in the Naraingarh and Barara block of Ambala district which involved 468 participants. A pretested predesigned questionnaire was used to collect data regarding demographic profile, falls, and physical morbidities. Geriatric Depression Scale-Hindi, Hindi-mini-mental state examination, Snellen chart, Katz- Activity of Daily Living were used to collect data for depression, cognitive decline, vision and activity of daily living respectively.
Results
The prevalence of falls was found to be 28.7%. An association was found between falls and slippery floors in the houses, hearing loss, vertigo, hypertension, use of multiple medications, depression and functional disability in univariate analysis. On multivariate regression analysis, slippery floors (OR = 2.28), use of multiple medications (OR = 1.71), hearing loss(OR = 1.83) and presence of depression (OR = 1.62) were found to be independent risk factors with falls.
Conclusion
There is high prevalence of falls among the elderly and these are commonly related to preventable factors. Appropriate environmental modifications and exercise programs can help reduce the rate of falls as well as injuries related to falls among the elderly."

In the present study, the effect of transient inactivation of the shell subregion of the nucleus accumbens (NAC shell) by lidocaine on the acquisition and retrieval stages of passive avoidance learning (PAL) and memory and morphine state-dependent learning (SDL) in male wistar rats was investigated.
Methodology
Adult male wistar rats weighing (220–250 g) were used. Lidocaine hydrochloride was bilaterally injected into the shell area of the nucleus accumbens 5 min before of subcutaneous morphine administration.
Results
pre-training and pre-test infusion of lidocaine into the NAC shell significantly impaired PAL and memory. Furthermore, Pre-training administration of morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.) in a step-through passive avoidance task induced state-dependent learning with impaired memory retrieval on the test day. The impairment of memory was restored after pre-test administration of the same dose of morphine. This phenomenon has been named as morphine state dependent learning (SDL). Moreover, Pre-training and pre-test inactivation of the NAC shell impaired morphine SDL.
Conclusions
The results suggest the role of NAC shell as a common structure in the PAL and morphine SDL. It is suggested that NAC shell as a common area plays a critical role in the acquisition and retrieval stages of PAL and also morphine SDL."

abstract = "Background
Impulsivity is widely assessed with a 30 item self-report measure known as the Barrratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). Further development involved creation of an abbreviated version, called Barratt Impulsiveness Scale- short form (BIS-15; Spinella, 2007) from the original BIS-11. Unlike the original BIS-11, BIS-15 has not undergone sufficient cross cultural validation especially among the adolescent population.
Aim
To evaluate the factor structure and psychometric properties of BIS-15 among school and college attending Indian adolescents.
Method
A total of 1806 adolescents (females = 48%, mean age = 17.14 years) completed BIS-15 questionnaire, strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) and a risk taking questionnaire that assessed adolescents level of involvement in two protypical risky behaviours- substance use and unsafe sexual behaviours.
Results
The results of the principal component analysis of BIS-15 items revealed a three factor structure: attentional, motor and non-planning impulsivity. The internal consistency of BIS-15 was 0.79. The total score on BIS-15 was significantly associated with the externalizing, internalizing and total difficulty score on SDQ. Significant associations were observed between BIS-15 total impulsivity score and the level of risk taking among adolescents. Further, the results also revealed gender variance in impulsivity scores where male adolescents scored higher on attentional and non-planning impulsivity as compared to female adolescents.
Conclusion
BIS-15 is a reliable measure of impulsivity that can be used with Indian adolescent population. It would be particularly more suitable for use in settings that require comprehensive assessment of trait impulsivity in shorter time duration and without burdening the participants."

Southeast Asia suffers from various forms of natural disasters and interpersonal violence. This creates a large trauma population, while at the same time mental health services in this area are limited. The humanitarian organisation Trauma Aid Germany established trauma capacity building by training 37 local therapists in psycho-traumatology, including trauma stabilisation, in Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand. This analysis examines the impact of trauma stabilisation as a sole treatment for traumatized clients.
Method
Clients were screened for PTSD using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire pre- and post-treatment. Analysis only included clients who had received trauma stabilisation, including psychoeducation, but no confrontation with the traumatic event.
Results
Trauma stabilisation was highly effective in reducing PTSD symptoms, with high remission from PTSD post-treatment. Trauma stabilisation affected all subscales of PTSD and was effective in clinical as well as subclinical traumatized clients.
Conclusion
The research supports the notion that trauma stabilisation is a treatment effect for PTSD. It was highly effective in its own in reducing PTSD symptoms. Based on the analysis, trauma stabilisation was a safe, language independent treatment for PTSD sufficiently flexible to be sensitive to the client’s context. Therapists can adapt the techniques to the individual client and his cultural, spiritual, developmental, cognitive and situational background. Trauma stabilisation is suitable for implementation in crisis areas. The research has also implications to the potential utilisation of para-professionals."

This study aims to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among married patients with gynecological malignancies in China and then explores factors related to anxiety and depression.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2016 to July 2017 in Jilin Province. A total of 394 married patients with gynecological malignancies completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate the association between influencing factors of anxiety and depression. Back propagation neural networks (BP neural networks) were used to examine the ranking of these influencing factors.
Results
The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 79.95% and 94.16% in married patients with gynecological malignancies. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that patients’ anxiety showed significant relationships with low income, frequency of chemotherapy, diagnostic results and low sleep quality(P < 0.05), and patients’ depression showed significant relationships with low quality sleep and frequency of chemotherapy (P < 0.05). Using BP neural networks, the order of importance of these factors in influencing anxiety, from high to low, was determined to be sleep quality, frequency of chemotherapy, monthly income, diagnostic results, age and fertility demand.
Conclusions
It is important to reduce anxiety and depression in these patients by improving sleep quality and clinical treatment."

To examine the Korean public’s recognition of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), its sociodemographic correlates, and its implications for lay beliefs and social attitudes.
Methods
Six hundred seventy-three Korean adults were recruited for an online survey. Participants completed questionnaires on sociodemographic characteristics and their familiarity with ADHD. Participants were then provided with a vignette describing a person with ADHD symptoms, and subsequently were asked to answer whether the person had any sort of problem. Among the 673 participants who were initially recruited, those who recognized any problem responded to subsequent questions concerning the exact identification of the disorder, their beliefs about its etiology and treatment, and their preferences for social distance.
Results
It was found that 30.8% of participants perceived no problem and that 23.9% of those who did recognize a problem correctly identified ADHD as the diagnosis. Female gender, younger age, higher family income, higher education level, and having had any acquaintance with ADHD were associated with the correct identification of ADHD. The correct identification of ADHD was positively associated with behavioral/discipline beliefs and decreased social distance toward persons with ADHD, whereas it was negatively associated with beliefs concerning diet and personal characteristics.
Discussion
The present study highlights the importance of the accurate recognition of ADHD in relation to appropriate beliefs about its etiology, treatment strategies, and better social attitudes toward persons with ADHD."

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and sociodemographic correlates in children and adolescents ages 6–18 years in semnan province.
Method
Participants were 1037 children and adolescents ages 6 to 18 years in Semnan. This study was a survey study and its data have been taken from the National survey of Iranian Children and Adolescents' Psychiatric Disorders in 2017. A sample of children and adolescents from Semnan was selected by multistage cluster sampling method. Participants completed the K- SADS- PL interview.
Results
Findings showed the general prevalence of psychiatric disorders in Semnan was 24.8 (CI95%: 22.2–27.5) with a proportion of female to male 1.1:1. As the age increased, the prevalence rate of psychiatric disorders decreased. In mothers with undergraduate education, the rate of prevalence of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents was significantly lower than that of illiterate mothers (OR adjust = 0.309, p = .01). Among anxiety disorders, the highest rate of prevalence was related to Separation Anxiety Disorder (6.4%; CI95%: 5.03–8.01). Oppositional Defiant Disorder (4%; CI95%: 2.9–5.3) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (3.4%; CI95%: 2.4–4.7) had the highest rate of prevalence among behavioral disorders. Sex, Locus of life, socioeconomic status had no effect on the prevalence rate.

To estimate the prevalence and distribution of psychiatric morbidity, and study pattern of help-seeking in a community representative sample from the state of Uttar Pradesh in northern India.
Method
A multi-stage, stratified, random cluster sampling was used. The survey was conducted on 3508 adults during 2015–16 using M.I.N.I 6.0.0, modified Fagerström Nicotine Dependence Scale for all forms of tobacco, questionnaires for epilepsy and intellectual disability. The WHO Pathway Interview Schedule was used to study pattern of help-seeking behaviour. Focused group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) were also carried out.
Result
Current and lifetime prevalence of ‘any mental morbidity’ (excluding tobacco use disorders) was 6.08% and 7.97%, respectively. The prevalence of substance use disorders, was 16.36%, of which tobacco use disorders alone contributed 16.06%. Neurotic and depressive disorders were the next most common morbidity. Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders had a current prevalence of 0.09%. High-risk for suicide was reported to be 0.93%. Treatment gap varied between 75 and 100% for different disorders. FGDs and KIIs reflected a higher burden of substance use, including prescription drug abuse, substantial prevalence of cultural mental morbidity, deep rooted stigma, low help-seeking behaviour, and issues surrounding homeless mentally ill persons in the community.
Conclusion
The survey revealed high mental morbidity and alarming treatment gap. FGDs and KIIs also highlight the burden of morbidity that probably goes un-noticed, due to socio-cultural systems and stigma. Findings from this survey are intended to be the groundwork for the (re)planning of mental healthcare infrastructure in the state."

In the past century, elder abuse has become an important health issue and a stressful event that negatively affects the physical and mental health of the elders.
Aims
Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of elder abuse in Iran through systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods
All articles about elderly abuse in Iran since 2005–2017 were searched using the Google Scholar search engine, four Iranian databases (Magiran, IranMedex, SID) and six international English language databases(Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus, Pubmed, Science Direct-Embase) with keywords of Elder Abuse, Elder Mistreatment, Elder Neglect, Abuse and a combination of these keywords. After examining the entry and exit criteria and qualitative evaluation of the articles, Data was analyzed by comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) software.
Findings
In a systematic review, 15 articles on elders in Iran were included in the study. The overall prevalence of elder abuse was 48.3% (with 95% confidence interval: 28.6–68.6) and the highest prevalence of elder abuse was related to the care neglect dimensionat the prevalence rate of 38.4% (with 95% confidence interval: 21.7–51.6) and the lowest prevalence rate of elder abuse was related to the rejection atthe prevalence rate of 11% (with 95% confidence interval: 6.9–17.1).
Conclusion
The prevalence of elder abuse among elders was high in Iran. Considering the growing elderly population in Iran, preventive measures should be considered in this regard. For this reason, community health nurses are required to provide the elderly, family and community with necessary preventive interventions in this regard."

Methods
This study was conducted at a tertiary care de-addiction facility with recruitment of patients with substance use disorders (alcohol and opioid use). Perceived stigma was assessed using Perceived Stigma of Substance Abuse Scale (PSAS).
Results
The study included 201 participants, majority of whom were males (99.5%), educated up to 10th std. (65.7%), with mean duration of substance use of 11.4 years. Opiates were the primary substance of abuse in the majority (83.6%) with ever-injecting drug use present in a considerable proportion (29.4%). The mean perceived stigma scale score was 21.23 ± 3.03. The perceived stigma was higher in patients from rural background, but was not associated with age, educational status, current living situation, duration of substance use and injecting drug use.

There is a discrepancy in literature regarding level of prolactin in drug free/ drug naïve patients with non-affective psychosis. Few earlier studies have found low levels of prolactin whereas recent studies have found high levels of prolactin when compared to controls. Most of these studies have not considered the possible confounding factors. Also ours is the first study that evaluated the correlation between psychopathology & prolactin levels after considering the confounding agents.
Method
It was a cross sectional, hospital based case control study. Purposive sampling was done to identify the cases of schizophrenia. 59 cases and 59 controls fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria were taken for the study after taking consent. Socio-demographic and other relevant clinical data were collected. Scores of PANSS AND BPRS were collected on the day of admission. Blood samples were collected from 8 to 10 am in the morning. Samples were centrifuged and the serum was stored in sterile vials at minus 80° centigrade. Serum Prolactin, free T3, freeT4, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone & Cortisol levels were evaluated for both cases and controls and correlation between them and with psychopathology of cases was seen.
Results
Our study showed that prolactin level was increased in drug free/naïve cases of schizophrenia. Significant difference was found between T4 levels of cases and controls. No correlation was found between prolactin and psychopathology.

Common Mental Disorders (CMDs) are frequent among adolescents and early adults. National Mental Health Survey of India 2015–2016 shows alarming results, especially for depression. This study explored the prevalence of psychological distress among college students. Additionally, the relationship between gender, living arrangement with psychological distress in various educational streams were explored.
Materials and Methods
Through a cross-sectional community-based survey a total of 4839 college going students of various educational streams in Mangalore, Karnataka were assessed for psychological distress with Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20).
Results
Participants had median age of 19 (range = 9) years and the majority (59.5%) were females. The median SRQ score was 4 (range 20) and about 28.5% of students were found to be psychologically stressed. The suicidal ideation was reported by 13.6% of the students. Engineering and Arts/science/commerce students had significantly higher psychological distress scores as compared to health and allied sciences (k = 47.7; p < 0.001) and those who were staying with families (U = 2,687,648.5; p = 0.004) reported higher levels of psychological distress in comparison to those who were staying away from their families.
Conclusion
Prevalence of psychological distress was high among students, especially non-medical students, students who were staying with their families, and those who were younger in age. A significant proportion of students had suicidal ideation, which needs early mental health interventions at the college level."

The concept of autism has changed since its inception, from childhood schizophrenia to neuro-variation. These changes in concept have been accompanied by changes in the diagnostic threshold through which the ‘case’ of autism is identified. The occurrence of multiple changes in its diagnostic criteria over last 80 odd years opens up the possibility of challenges being posed to the existence of the disorder as it is today, with a possibility of newer conceptualization of autism coming up in the future. The potential consequences of the changes in its nosology and concept, such as those on the management and on prevalence estimation are some of the essential issues which need attention. In the current paper, we evaluate the evolution of the concept and nosology of autism with an overview of the accompanying impact of these changes."

Depression and anxiety are common psychiatric sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, there is lack of data on comorbid depression and anxiety, and depression and anxiety in TBI patients were often evaluated using non-validated diagnostic tools. This study aims to determine the rates, their comorbidity, and factors associated with depressive and anxiety disorders in TBI patients.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, 101 TBI patients were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders to assess the rates of depressive and anxiety disorders after TBI. The association of socio-demographic and clinical factors with depressive and anxiety disorders were determined using Pearson’s Chi-Square test.
Results
A total of 25% of TBI patients (n = 25/101) were diagnosed with depressive disorders, of which 15% had major depressive disorder (n = 15/101) and 10% had minor depression (n = 10/101). Fourteen percent of TBI patients had anxiety disorders (n = 14/101), of which post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was the commonest anxiety disorder (9%, n = 9/101). Seven percent of TBI patients (n = 7/101) had comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders. The only factor associated with depressive disorder was the duration of TBI (≥ 1 year) while the only factor associated with anxiety disorder was the mechanism of trauma (assault).
Conclusion
Major depressive disorder, minor depression and PTSD are common psychiatric complications of TBI. Clinicians should screen for depressive and anxiety disorders in TBI patients, particularly those with ≥1 year of injury and had sustained TBI from assault."

Difficulties in parenting and Facial Emotion Recognition deficits (FERD) in persons with schizophrenia have been demonstrated independently. However, the relationship between parenting deficits and FERD in mothers with schizophrenia is yet to be explored.
Aims and objectives
The aims of the study were to assess parenting in mothers with schizophrenia, to examine the clinical correlates of parenting and to examine if facial emotion recognition deficits had an association with parenting.
Methods
Fifty mothers with schizophrenia and 50 age matched healthy mothers were assessed for parenting and FERD. Parenting was assessed using Arnold’s parenting scale and Parent Interview Schedule. Kiddie TRENDS, a modified Tool for Recognition of Emotions in Neuropsychiatric Disorders (TRENDS) was administered to assess facial emotion recognition.
Results
Among mothers with schizophrenia, FERD were noted in emotions of sadness, disgust, anger and surprise. Laxness in parenting was associated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia and also facial emotion recognition deficits.
Conclusion
Parenting difficulties are commonly noticed in mothers with schizophrenia. Laxness style of parenting was found more often in mothers with schizophrenia, especially in mothers with blunt affect. Mothers with schizophrenia had difficulties in recognizing emotions of sadness, anger, disgust and surprise and this was associated with laxness style of parenting."

Persons with schizophrenia experience high rates of cardio metabolic disorders and have a 20–25% shorter life expectancy than the general population. Health professionals led life style modification behavior programs have shown improvements, in managing aspects of metabolic problems. This study sought to identify the life style modification by exploring (1) facilitators that help persons with schizophrenia to adopt the lifestyle modification behaviors and (2) factors that help to adhere to life style modification behaviors.
Methods
A qualitative study utilizing face to face interviews was conducted for five persons (n = 5) diagnosed as schizophrenia (ICD 10) and their caregivers (n = 13) receiving inpatient mental health services in a tertiary level psychiatry centre, in South India. Qualitative data was collected, organized and analyzed with thematic analysis using ATLAS.ti software.
Results
The study results identified four major themes as facilitators. (1) Factors of increased self- confidence, and personal development. (2) The need for social support and conducive environment; (3) level of self motivation (4) encouragement from health professional and availability of health services. Participants believed that engaging with programs of physical activity, dietary modification, and illness support from family would motivate them to live more healthily.
Conclusion
Individuals with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia encounter physical health related problems, facilitators of lifestyle change behavior help them to adhere to change in their routine life. Lifestyle change interventions also motivate individuals to eat healthy diet and exercise regularly to prevent premature mortality."

Evidence for the effectiveness of individual cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is promising but evidence for presenting CBTp in a group setting and in the Asian context is limited. The present study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of Group CBTp in clinical practice.
Method
Forty-eight out-patients and day-patients with the schizophrenia spectrum disorders were recruited and randomly assigned to the group CBTp plus treatment as usual (TAU), or psychoeducation group (PsyEdI) plus TAU. Both interventions consisted of 7 consecutive weekly sessions with a booster session 4 weeks after the last session. Patients were assessed on outcome measures such as the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a Chinese version of the Beliefs About Voice Questionnaire-Revised version (BAVQ-R), at baseline and after treatment.
Results
Patients received group CBTp (n = 25) showed significantly greater improvement in their delusion compared with those receiving PsyEdI (n = 23). Nearly 61% of patients in the group CBTp showed at least 50% reduction on their score of delusion in the PSYRATS. Group CBTp was also found to be effective in reducing patients’ dysfunctional beliefs towards voices, especially in the subscale of benevolence and omnipotence, their conviction on delusion, as well as their distress from positive psychotic symptoms.
Conclusion
Group CBTp can be an effective adjunctive psychological intervention in improving positive psychotic experiences among people with persistent psychotic symptoms, and can be applied in routine clinical practice."

Fortunately, early intervention has proved to be of significant benefit in the lives of children with ASD. However, timely access to health services and support requires equitable access, which is often a challenge for immigrant families. Barriers to equal access and support for immigrant families of children with ASD include cultural beliefs about child development and ASD, delayed diagnosis, access to services, and negative perceptions of services. There is a shortage of studies that explore how to increase understanding and collaboration among the immigrant population and health care practitioners to address these barriers. The barriers can indeed be appropriately addressed with structured programs and cultural models. The objectives of this article are to shed light on how barriers impact outcomes of immigrant children with ASD and to describe a culturally sensitive program model to address the barriers and provide awareness, education, and interventions for these immigrant families. The South Asian Autism Awareness Center in Toronto, Canada is presented as an example of such a model."

Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging studies of individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis have shown subtle but widespread reductions in baseline gray matter volume (GMV) in the frontal, temporal, and limbic regions compared with healthy controls (HC). These regions coincide with regions of reduced GMV in patients with established psychosis and have led to the consideration of structural changes in UHR as a potential biomarker for future transition to psychosis. However, most studies have been from Europe, North America, and Australia, with few reports from other regions, and two recent studies from Asian countries have failed to detect regional GMV reduction in UHR, suggesting the need for further analysis of an Asian sample. In this study, we investigated GMV reduction in Japanese UHR subjects. Results: The study used voxel-based morphometry to compare magnetic resonance imaging brain scans between 45 UHR individuals recruited by a specialist and 33 HCs. This showed no significant GMV reduction in the UHR group compared with the healthy control group. This negative result may be attributable to characteristics of Asian samples, such as a low prevalence of illicit drug use, or to the heterogeneous nature of UHR subjects."

A total of 7 gene polymorphisms from DRD2 (rs1800497, rs1079597, rs1800498, rs1801028) and 5-HT2 A (rs6313, rs6311, rs6305) were genotyped for their association with schizophrenia. No significant difference was found in frequency of various genotypes and alleles of the studied markers for DRD2 and 5-HT2 A genes between the cases and their genetic controls. However, significant differences were noted for rs1079597 genotype (Taq1B; p = 0.039) and its allele frequencies (p = 0.029) in persons with schizophrenia and the unrelated healthy controls. The DRD2 (Taq1 A-B-D) and 5-HT2 A (rs6311-rs6313-rs6305) haplotype frequencies differed significantly for A2B1D2 [p = 0.038; OR = 0.685 (95%CI = 0.479–0.981)] and ACC [p = 0.001; OR = 0.621 (95%CI = 0.461-0.838)] for the cases vs genetically related healthy controls. Similarly, significant difference was observed for the frequencies of GCC [p = 0.006; OR = 0.692 (95%CI = 0.532–0.900)] and ACC [p < 0.001; OR = 3.622 (95%CI = 1.73–7.585)] in the cases and unrelated healthy controls. Unlike previous research from India as well as abroad, the predominance of B1 allele of rs1079597 in patients with schizophrenia and absence of Cys311 in all study participants is a salient difference. Concluding, the B2 allele of rs1079597 may increase the risk of schizophrenia while the A2B1D2 haplotype may be protective in North Indian population."

Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) assesses decision making in uncertain conditions. Several studies have reported impaired performance on IGT in various clinical population compared to healthy normal. However, some researchers have reported incongruent findings from the basic assumptions of IGT in healthy normal. Our aim was to examine the possible decision making processes on IGT.
Methods
The IGT was administered on two groups: Healthy normal (n = 34) and offspring at high risk for alcoholism (n = 34). Subjects were matched on age (+/–1 year), education (+/–1 year) and gender. Other tools used were: Mini-international Neuropsychiatric Interview, Family Interview for Genetic Studies, Socio-demographic Data Sheet, Annett’s Handedness Questionnaire.
Results
Results showed a significant difference between two groups on selections made from disadvantageous deck A but no significant difference on disadvantageous deck B, advantageous/safe decks C and D. Also, there was no significant difference between two groups on IGT Net score [selections from decks (C + D) – decks (A + B)]. Further analysis showed that varying nature of reward and penalty schedules play an important role in selecting the cards from four decks of IGT. Subjects may prefer infrequent penalty decks without consideration of delayed loss/gain.
Conclusion
Frequency and magnitude of reward/penalty in IGT may adversely impact decision making. Deck B can induce myopia for delayed loss in the healthy normal too because of having a high frequency of gains with high magnitude of reward. Hence, IGT related studies should consider these factors while making an inference about decision making ability."

A cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescents aged 13, 14 and 16 years old from thirteen secondary schools in Kuala Lumpur using validated questionnaires. A total of 567 adolescents participated in this study.
Results
The prevalence of abnormal mental health status in this study was 4.4%. In multivariable analysis, female (OR = 1.79, 95%CI: 1.11–2.89), having divorced parents (OR = 3.53, 95%CI: 1.96–6.36), high educational stress (OR = 8.18, 95%CI: 4.25–15.75), medium educational stress (OR = 2.99, 95%CI: 1.53–5.83), whose house has been broken in before (OR = 2.02, 95%CI: 1.11–3.68) and living in a neighbourhood with low socioeconomic status (OR = 2.09, 95%CI: 1.23–3.56) were more likely to have abnormal mental health status.
Conclusions
Neighbourhood factors were found to be significant in determining adolescents’ mental health status. The findings emphasize the importance of those in the public health sector to highlight these significant neighbourhood factors to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. Swift action needs to be taken by the Ministry to provide solutions related to the neighbourhood factors and this can contribute to improvement in the adolescents’ mental health."

To determine association between household income and amount of alcohol consumed, type of beverage consumed, and expenditure on alcohol in Indian households across different income-groups for rural and urban areas.
Method
Secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the Consumption Expenditure Survey by National Sample Survey Organization for 2011-12 in a nationally representative sample of over 65,000 households. We used estimates of average household Monthly Per Capita Consumer Expenditure (MPCE) including distribution of households and persons over the MPCE range, break-up of average MPCE by commodity group.
Results and Conclusion
Households in India, on average, consumed 0.18 L of all alcoholic beverages per month (0.22 L in rural areas; 0.10 L in urban areas). The absolute quantity of alcohol consumed was higher among higher income-groups in both rural and urban areas. Country liquor was used by a majority across India; was used seven times more than toddy and beer, and 3.5 times more than Indian Made Foreign Liquor. Households’ expenditure on alcohol was Rs.16.46 (US$0.26) per month, which was 0.98% of average total household MPCE. Fraction of average total household MPCE on alcohol in rural areas (1.14%) was almost double that of urban areas (0.62%). It increased steadily from lowest (0.5%) to highest (1.7%) income group in rural areas whereas in urban areas, it varied a little (0.5-0.8%) across income groups."

abstract = "Background
Problematic Internet use/ Internet addiction (IA) has gained the attention of mental health professionals recently and studies have found that medical professionals are not immune to IA with prevalence rate ranging from 2.8 to 8%. Few studies from India have also reported high rates of IA among medical students. The term ‘Problematic internet use’ is being increasing used nowadays in place of IA as it signifies a better terminology than the word ‘addiction’ per se. However, there is lack of information among resident doctors.
Aim
To evaluate the prevalence of problematic Internet use and its association with depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and health care outcomes among resident doctors working in a government funded tertiary care Institute.
Materials & methods
An online e-mail survey was carried out among medical professionals (a total of 1721 doctors) in a tertiary care hospital located in Chandigarh, India out of whom 376 responded. The residents doctors were the postgraduate trainees (MBBS) and those residents who have complete post-graduation and working as senior residents/registrar (MBBS, MD/MS). They were in the age group ranging from 24 to 39 years. The survey included Young’s Internet addiction test (IAT), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale, Maslach Burnout Inventory and a self designed questionnaire to assess the health care related outcomes.
Results
On IAT, 142 residents (37.8%) scored <20 i.e., normal users and 203 residents (54%) had mild addiction. Only 31 residents (8.24%) had moderate addiction category, none of the residents had severe IA (score>80). Those with IA reported higher level of depressive symptoms, perceived stress and burnout. There was positive association between ever use of alcohol and watching pornography (as a part of recreational activities) with IA. Significantly higher proportion of those with IA, reported having faced physical abuse and verbal abuse in the hands of the patients/caregivers.
Conclusions
The present study suggests that about 8.24% of resident doctors have Problematic internet use/IA. Problematic internet use/IA is associated with presence of higher level of depressive symptoms, perceived stress and burn out. Further, Problematic internet use/IA is also associated with higher likelihood of facing violence in the hands of patients and their caregivers."

The study investigated the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders and suicide risk in geriatric outpatients in tertiary care hospitals.
Materials and methods
An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted with 803 participants aged 60 and above attending geriatric outpatient clinics in tertiary care hospitals in Thailand. Participants were assessed using DSM-IV-TR criteria to calculate the prevalence of deressive and anxiety disorders, and their suicide risk. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Core Symptom Index (CSI), 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), Neuroticism Inventory (NI) and the Revised Experience of Close Relationships Questionnaire (ECR-R) were administered. Quality of life was assessed using the EuroQoL (EQ-5D).
Results
The prevalence rate for depressive disorders was 23.7%, anxiety disorders was 6.4%, and current suicide risk was 20.4%. PSS, MSPSS, GDS, CSI, and NI scores were significantly higher in all clinical disorders and a suicide group compared with nonclinical subjects. MoCA and ECR-R did not differentiate between clinical disorder and nonclinical samples. Comparing all four outcomes, the EQ-5D differed most in the mixed depressive-anxiety disorder and nonclinical groups (t = 12.20, p < .001).
Conclusion
The present findings revealed a high prevalence of depression, anxiety and suicidality among elderly patients attending tertiary care hospitals. Perceived stress, perceived social support, and neuroticism scores were significantly higher in this group. Role of sociodemographic, clinical and psychosocial variables as risk factors for these clinical disorders should be further examined."

Our objective was to explore the utility of age at first suicide attempt in identifying subgroups of suicide attempters.
Methods
In a retrospective study design, we collected information from the clinical charts of 895 patients assessed over a seven-year period. Admixture analysis was used to determine the best fitting theoretical model for distribution of age at first attempt that divided the sample. Subsequently, multivariate analysis was performed to identify variables that distinguished the subgroups identified.
Results
The theoretical solution that best explained the observed distribution of age at first suicide attempt was a mixture of two Gaussian distributions with a cut-off of 31 years for the two subgroups. In logistic regression analysis, male gender (Odds ratios [OR] 3.047, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.818–5.106), fewer years of formal schooling (OR 3.384, 95% CI 1.701–6.734) and being married (OR 23.36, 95% CI 10.753–50.000), were more commonly associated with the late onset subgroup (age at first attempt >31 years). Further, the late onset subgroup had poorer global functioning (OR 0.980, 95% CI 0.962 to 0.998).
Conclusion
Age at onset of first suicide attempt is a useful candidate marker to delineate an early and late onset subgroup among suicide attempters. These results are likely to inform customization of suicide prevention strategies."

The contribution of genetic factors such as the presence of ApoE allele e4 and its association with psychological consequences post stroke remains unknown within Middle-Eastern regions. This study examined the association of ApoE genotype with cognitive impairment and mood in stroke patients and compare with healthy older adults in Bahrain.
Method
A prospective sample of n = 62 stroke patients (case group) and n = 53 healthy ageing individuals (control group) were eligible to participate in the study. A neuropsychological battery of cognitive assessments were conducted on all participants, and then stratified by cognitive function: no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment and moderate to severe cognitive impairment. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
Results
Most frequent ApoE genotype was e2/e3 in case (44%) and control groups (63%). ApoE allele e3 had the highest frequency for both groups with all stroke patients presenting with this allele and 86% for the control group (χ2  = 12.14, p < .0001). Stroke patients’ non-carriers for ApoE allele e4 performed better on all cognitive measures but differences were not statistically significant (ns). Carriers of ApoE allele e2 in both groups had less mood symptoms compared to non-carriers.
Discussion
ApoE genotype e3/e4 and e4/e4 was low in this Bahraini cohort explaining why there may been no significant associations found for this genotype variant with cognitive impairment. Further investigation of cognitive impairment and mood dysregulation with the different variants of the ApoE gene in general ageing and stroke populations is required from different ethno-cultural groups and geographical regions globally."

The literature on co-morbid psychiatric illnesses in adults with high-functioning autism (HFA) spectrum disorder is sparse.
Purpose
To examine the nature of psychiatric comorbidity and treatment response in adults with HFA spectrum disorder.
Materials and Methods
Case records of subjects (age ≥17 years) who presented over a period of 16 years with primary psychiatric symptoms and further detected to have an HFA spectrum disorder, were analyzed. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) along with near normal to normal verbal communication and general intelligence were considered as HFA spectrum disorders.
Results
33 subjects met the study criteria. Nine subjects (27%) were diagnosed to have an underlying Asperger’s syndrome and the rest 24 (73%) had pervasive developmental disorders unspecified (PDD NOS). None of the subjects were diagnosed to be suffering from ASD prior to the visit to our hospital. Mean age at the time of psychiatric consultation was 22.7 (s.d=4.8) years and mean age at the onset of psychiatric comorbidity was 16.48 (s.d=4.4) years. Nearly half of the sample had more than one type of psychiatric illness. Most common lifetime psychiatric diagnosis was obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (n=16, 48.4%). Bipolar disorder (BD) was the second most common type of psychiatric manifestation (n=13, 39.3%) followed by psychotic spectrum disorders (n=9, 27.2%). Overall response to treatment was minimal.
Conclusions
Individuals with HFA spectrum disorders suffer from multiple psychiatric comorbidities. OCD is the most common type of psychiatric comorbidity followed by BD and psychotic spectrum disorders. Comorbid psychiatric illnesses in individuals with HFA show poor response to treatment."

Methods
Data were obtained using a vignette survey conducted as a part of the Stigma in Global Context - Mental Health Study and contained a nationally representative sample (n = 994). The survey was conducted using a multi-mode approach (face-to-face interviews, the drop-off-and-pick-up, postal collection) from September to December 2006, with a multi-stage probability sample of Japanese residents aged 18–64 years. Respondents were randomly assigned one of four vignette conditions that described psychiatric disorders meeting the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (one vignette for each gender exhibiting each diagnosis). We compared respondents’ stigma-related attitudes and perceptions toward mental illness between vignettes.
Results
Over 80% of Japanese participants believed that depressive disorder or schizophrenia could be cured via treatment. However, Japanese people still had relatively strong vigilance and denial of competency toward schizophrenia.
Conclusions
Participants expressed the belief that mental illnesses are curable, but stigma toward people with schizophrenia was still relatively strong."

Methods
The data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Social Phobia Inventory Questionnaire and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire were used.
Results
The mean age of the 450 student participants was 20.6 ± 1.6 years. Majority [312(69.3%)] were males and majority [305(67.8%)] were native of urban areas. Of the total, 169(37.6%) were found to have social phobia. Among them, 114(67.5%) had mild, 47(27.8%) had moderate and 8(4.7%) had severe social phobia. Family history of anxiety disorders (P = 0.006), embarrassment with own socio-economic status (P = 0.001) and past history of failure in academic examinations (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with the presence of social phobia among the participants. Preference of interaction using social media instead of face to face communication with people (P = 0.013), and by texting rather than calling the person (P = 0.002) were seen significantly more among those with social phobia. The mean quality of life scores was found to be deteriorating significantly with increasing intensity of social phobia among students (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
Social phobia was seen among more than one-third of the participants. Counselling centers are therefore required to address this problem at universities. This will also help to improve the quality of life and the socializing skills of those affected."

Despite its political sensitivity, little scientifically valid evidence on the prevalence, pattern and treatment need of substance use in the northern border state of Punjab, India is available till date.
Methodology
The ‘universe’ for the survey was the entire house-dwelling population of Punjab, of both genders, aged 11–60 years. Stratified multistage sampling technique was used. Following a pilot study, data were collected by trained research workers by face-to-face interview using pre-tested survey instruments.
Results
From 6398 households, 13,925 respondents were interviewed. Prevalence of lifetime and current (12 month) dependence on any substance were 15.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.1–16.4%) and 14.7% (95% CI 14.1–15.3%) respectively. Of the specific substances, current dependence was the highest on alcohol (10.9%; 95% CI 10.3–11.4%), followed by tobacco (8.1%; 95% CI 7.7–8.6%). Regarding opioids, lifetime use was 1.9% (95% CI 1.6–2.1%) and current dependence 0.8% (95%CI 0.7–1.0%). Use of and dependence on natural opioids was the highest. After projecting these figures to the entire source population of the state, number of currently dependent alcohol, tobacco and opioid users were 2.2, 1.6, and 0.17 million, respectively. Overall, substance use was predominant in men and significantly more common in rural areas. Majority (81%) of the tobacco users, and 51% each of alcohol and opioid users needed intervention. However, merely one in six subjects sought any professional help.
Conclusion
Punjab has a substantive problem related to substance use. Though alcohol and tobacco are by far the major substances of use and dependence, the large number of opioid users also raises concern. Treatment services need scaling-up."

abstract = "Introduction
In recent years, the early detection and treatment of the first episode of schizophrenia (FES) has attracted worldwide attention. In Japan, psychiatric care has changed to an open and accessible framework over the past decade. Therefore, the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is thought to have been shortened. The purposes of this study were to investigate whether recent DUP periods are shorter than they were 10 years ago and whether the DUP at present differs among psychiatric facilities. We investigated the recent DUP at a psychiatric hospital and its satellite clinic.
Material and methods
We examined the differences in DUP, age, sex, referral pathway, living companions, social participation, and schooling history among 3 groups of FES patients: (i) a psychiatric hospital during 1999–2001 and (ii) during 2009–2011, and (iii) a psychiatric clinic during 2009–2011.
Results
The average DUP was 14.3 (SD = 17.5) months for the psychiatric hospital during 1999–2001, 16.0 (SD = 18.7) months for the psychiatric hospital during 2009–2011, and 24.4 (SD = 30.0) months for the psychiatric clinic during 2009–2011. No significant differences were found in the DUP for each facility and during this decade. Also, the differences in the DUP could not be attributed to factors such as living companions or social participation.
Discussion
Increases in the numbers of patients and psychiatric clinics have not led to the early detection of FES. To shorten the DUP in the future, closer cooperation among the medical field, the educational field, and the health and welfare will be needed."

abstract = "Background
Dyslexia is one of the common problems seen in children worldwide. There is high co-morbidity of dyslexia with attentional and behaviour problems which could have familial pattern. This study aims to compare the attentional and behavioural problems in children with dyslexia and their first-degree relatives with controls.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional comparative study with single interview method in an out-patient setting. Formally diagnosed (ICD-10) cases of 30 children with specific reading disorder and 30 healthy matched controls and their first-degree relatives were assessed using scales in a single setting after application of inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Results
The children with dyslexia had significantly more problems in the domains of selective attention and behavioural problems as compared to controls and the siblings of the cases had significant problems in selective attention but not in behavioural problems. Also, no difference was seen in ADHD symptoms of parents in cases and controls.
Conclusion
The results from our study are keeping with most of the published literature. We expect that this study will help in laying a good foundation for further studies with stronger methodologies incorporating molecular genetics."

The aim of this study was to investigate depressive symptoms and their association with sociodemographic factors, stressors and support, including childhood adversity, health status risk and behaviour in Indonesia.
Method
In a cross-sectional national population survey in 2014–15 in Indonesia, 31442 adults (mean age 37.3 years, SD = 14.9, age range 15–101 years) responded to the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) and various other measures.
Results
Overall, 15.0% of participants reported moderate and 6.9% severe depressive symptoms, or 21.8% moderate or severe depressive symptoms (21.4% among men and 22.3% among women). In multivariable logistic regression among both men and women, sociodemographic factors (younger age, poor subjective economic background, being unemployed, residing in Java and main island groups), stressors (childhood hunger and poor or fair self-rated health status and having experienced disasters), lack of social trust and religiosity, having one or more chronic conditions, tobacco use and soft drink consumption were positively and obesity negatively associated with moderate or severe depressive symptoms.
Conclusion
High rates (21.8%) of depressive symptoms were found. Several risk factors including sociodemographic factors such as younger age, stressors, lack of social support, health risk status and behaviour variables were identified which can be utilized in guiding interventions."

abstract = "Background
Globally, depression is prevalent during pregnancy and several factors have been associated with antenatal depressive symptoms (ADS). However, ADS have rarely been investigated in Thailand. This study aimed at exploring the prevalence of ADS and factors associated with these symptoms among Thai women in late pregnancy.
Methods
A cross-sectional study including 449 women in late pregnancy was carried out. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to detect depressive symptoms with a score of 10 points or higher. Socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial risks were measured in association with ADS. Percentage and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the prevalence of ADS. Odds ratio (OR) and 95%CI were used to determine ADS-related risk factors among women.
Results
The prevalence of ADS was 46.8% (95%CI 42.3–51.4). Pregnant women aged less than 20 years (OR 2.58, 95%CI 1.14–5.84) and those not having enough money (OR 2.71, 95%CI 1.22–6.05) had an increased risk of ADS. Psychosocial risks related to ADS for women were low psychological well-being (OR 3.12, 95%CI 1.75–5.58), low self-esteem (OR 2.08, 95%CI 1.24–3.49), and low sense of coherence (OR 1.82, 95%CI 1.12–2.95).
Conclusions
The prevalence of ADS among Thai women in their late pregnancy is high. Socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial factors are independently associated with ADS. Healthcare providers in Thailand should consider EPDS as a standardised screening tool for ADS and use it at antenatal care clinics. Implementing programs focusing on both pregnant women and their family might increase the prevention of perinatal depression."

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder commonly associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the prevalence ranging from 14–70%. The current study attempted to assess the impact of comorbid ADHD in children with ASD, in terms of challenges in diagnosis, treatment, intervention outcomes and parental stress and coping through a naturalistic design.
Methods
Fifty children aged 2-6 years with ASD were recruited, assessed and followed up for six months. Twenty children were found to have comorbid ADHD. Severity of ASD and ADHD was assessed by Childhood Autism rating scale and Connor’s abbreviated rating scale respectively. Parental stress and coping was assessed by Family Interview for stress and coping.
Results
The diagnosis of ASD was apparently obscured by ADHD symptoms in about 22% of cases, as only diagnosis of ADHD was made at the time of referral to our centre. ADHD was the most common comorbidity followed by intellectual disability and seizure disorder. About 66% of children received combination of pharmacological and behavioral interventions. Clonidine was the most common medication to be used and was well tolerated. The improvement in ADHD symptomatology showed positive correlation with improvement with ASD-specific interventions as reflected by change in severity scores. Severity of ADHD significantly also predicted parental stress and coping, and thereby engagement in ASD-specific interventions.
Conclusion
The current study highlights the need for screening and early diagnosis of comorbid ADHD in children with ASD and vice versa considering the management challenges. In case of multiple comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders, early interventions for one disorder can improve the outcome of the other."

Social cognition deficits have been implicated in the affect regulation and interpersonal difficulties seen in borderline personality disorder (BPD). The study examined patterns of social cognition abilities, using self-report and task-based measures, among individuals diagnosed with BPD.
Methods
The sample included a clinical group of 20 patients diagnosed with BPD and 20 age and gender-matched control group participants from the community with no psychiatric diagnosis. The measures included the Mentalization Questionnaire, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Social Cognition Rating Tool in Indian Setting.
Results
Results indicated that the clinical group had lower self-reported mentalizing ability. Facial emotion recognition ability was significantly lower for the clinical group, particularly for photographs of the eye region with positive and neutral valences. The clinical group had significantly higher personalizing bias, and greater difficulties in social perception. The two groups did not differ on first and second order theory of mind, recognition of faux pas and externalizing bias.
Conclusions
The results point to the links between social cognition deficits and interpersonal difficulties among persons with BPD. Implications include the need for pre-therapy assessment of the magnitude and patterns of social cognition difficulties in BPD, the development of culturally and ecologically valid assessments and the evaluation of interventions for social cognition vulnerabilities among individuals with BPD."

Youth suicide rates are rising worldwide, including Sri Lanka, where 46.5/100,000 among 15–19yrs was reported in 1986. Identifying high risk adolescents is vital. Dearth of trained professionals, demands an instrument utilizable by non-psychiatrists. Such was not available in Sinhalese. Adolescent Suicide Assessment Protocol (ASAP-20) and its’ manual was translated and validated to Sri Lankan adolescents.
Method
A validation study. Forward/back translations followed by cultural adaptation. Face validity, operational equivalence were assessed. Panel of Psychiatrists assessed semantics, conceptual, content/construct validity using external criticism. Final Sinhalese version was applied to 100 Sinhalese speaking 10–19yr olds referred to Psychiatry units of two Teaching Hospitals following a suicide attempt or with suicidal ideation (cases) excluding psychotic disorder, acute emergencies or special needs and compared with same aged adolescents on treatment for respiratory problems as controls. Discriminant ability was calculated using area under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC). Reliability was calculated using Cronbach’s alpha.
Results
Sinhalese version showed satisfactory face/contents/construct validity and operational equivalence. Median suicide risk score was 18 and mean 17.99 (SD = 7.56) for cases, median = 4 and mean = 4.86 (SD = 2.41) for controls. AUC was 0.969 (SE = 0.11), indicating a high ability to discriminate moderate/high from low suicidal risk. Cut off value, 8.5 was lower than original tool at a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 91%. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.811 indicating high reliability and consistency.
Conclusion
Sinhalese version of ASAP-20 is a successful screening instrument to detect high suicide risk among adolescents in clinical and non clinical settings."

Offspring with family history of alcoholism are considered to be at high risk for alcoholism. The present study sought to expand our understanding of cognitive and behavioural dispositions associated with executive control and self-regulation in alcohol naïve offspring with and without family history of alcoholism.
Methods
Sample comprised of alcohol naive offspring in two groups: (i) at high risk (n = 34) and (ii) at low risk for alcoholism (n = 34). Both groups were matched on age (+/-1 year), education (+/−1 year) and gender. Measures used were: Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Family Interview for Genetic Studies, Socio-demographic Data Sheet, Annett’s Handedness Questionnaire, Barratt’s Impulsiveness Scale-version 11, Digit Span Test, Spatial Span Test, Tower of London, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and Game of Dice Task (GDT).
Results
Results showed that alcohol naive offspring at high risk for alcoholism reported significantly high impulsivity and demonstrated significant differences on executive functions and decision making tasks. Correlation analysis revealed that high impulsivity was significantly associated with poor performance on explicit decision making task (GDT) and executive function task (WCST). There was no significant correlation between two decision making tasks (IGT and GDT) in both groups and performance on IGT was not significantly associated with impulsivity and executive functions.
Conclusions
The present study indicates cognitive and behavioural dispositions in alcohol naive offspring at high risk for alcoholism and support the sub-optimal balance between reflective and impulsive system responsible for addiction. Furthermore, present study supports separability between two different types of decision making tasks."

To assess the effectiveness of a cognitive training program on global cognition among people with mild cognitive impairment.
Methods
In this experimental study, using purposive sampling, 60 participants age 50 years and over who complained of subjective memory impairment were screened in their communities by public health volunteers with the Abbreviated Mental Test. Those with dementia were excluded as well as those with depression, which were screened out by the Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS-15). Mild cognitive impairment was diagnosed and confirmed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and joint agreement between a psychiatrist and a neurologist. The participants were alternately assigned to receive a cognitive training program (intervention group) while the other half received their normal usual therapy (control group). The program involved training of 4 aspects of cognition through 6 sessions; 2 sessions per month for 3 months. The MoCA and TGDS-15 scales were given at baseline and again at week 13, and at months 6 and 9. Independent t-tests were used to compare changes in global cognition among the two groups.
Results
MoCA scores at 9 months were significantly higher than at baseline in both groups. However, the mean difference in intervention group was significantly higher than control group. TGDS-15 scores at 6 months was significantly lower than at baseline among the intervention group but not the control group.
Conclusion
This cognitive training program helped to improve global cognition and reduce depressive symptoms."

abstract = "Background
Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a chronic and disabling psychiatric illness with waxing and waning course. Lithium is the mainstay of treatment for Bipolar disorder (BD). There is limited literature on the clinical markers of Lithium treatment response from south Asia.
Methods
Two hundred and ten individuals with BD I and a history of at least 6 months of treatment with Lithium were recruited from the outpatient services of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) after obtaining informed consent. A diagnosis of BD I was made according to the DSM-IV criteria. The characterization of response to lithium prophylaxis was done using NIMH Retrospective Life Chart and “Retrospective Criteria of Long Term Treatment Response in Research Subjects with Bipolar Disorder” scale.
Results
There were 132 (62.86%) good responders and 78 (37.14%) non-responders. Good responders were noted to have less number of hospitalizations and more onset episode of depression than non-responders. Using continuous phenotype, Lithium response was inversely correlated with total number of episodes, number of episodes of mania/ depression, number of hospitalisations and presence of suicide attempt. Multivariate analysis only revealed number of episodes and hospitalization to be associated with Lithium response.
Conclusion
Our Lithium response rates were higher than what have been reported in the few previous studies. Illness severity was the only factor associated with Lithium response. There is a need to examine this question in larger prospective samples and to focus on biological/ molecular markers of treatment response."

We describe the operations and the successes of eJCIndia, to our knowledge the first eJC in India in the field of mental health. eJCIndia was started for capacity building in teaching and research competence in the field.
Results
eJC India, with >400 members comprising academic psychiatrists and postgraduate students, is now 3 years old. eJCIndia conducts about a hundred activities a year; there is active participation from the membership. Activities include posting of educational materials of interest to the group; seeking and receiving guidance on academic and practical matters of interest to the group; providing and receiving training on how to review research manuscripts submitted to journals for consideration for publication; learning how to critically review published journal articles for strengths, limitations, and applications; and learning how to design studies, analyze data, and prepare manuscripts for publication. The activities of eJCIndia have resulted in the publication of about 20 articles and in the development of several research collaborations, including one multicenter study.

The present study sought to examine the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders comparing Asian American (AA) and non-Hispanic Whites (WNH) drawn from a population accessing a large general hospital for any reason. Socio-demographic predictors of diagnosis and treatment were also explored.
Methods
Data were obtained from de-identified medical records in the Partner Health Care System’s Research Patient Data Registry.
Results
The final sample included 345,070 self-identified WNH and 16,418 self-identified AA’s between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009. WNH patients were more likely than AA patients to carry a diagnosis of a mental disorder (18.1% vs. 8.6%, p < 0.0001) and were more likely to receive psychotropic medication treatment (15.0% vs 8.5%, p < 0.0001). Logistic regression analyses of the AA cohort identified several risk factors (i.e. language, religion, gender, age) predicting the diagnosis of a mental disorder or use of psychotropic medication.
Conclusions
Our findings on the racial disparity in mental disorder diagnosis and treatment between AA and WNH patients suggest that mental disorders are under-recognized and mental health services are under-utilized in the AA community. There remains a need for health care providers to improve screening services and to gain a better understanding of the cultural barriers that hinder mental health care among AA patients."

Module 1 included the completion of NIH online certification course for research ethics training. Module 2 was a one-hour interactive group discussion on ethical principles in research. Module 3 was a two-hour session consisting of case-based group discussion of nine selected research vignettes. Module 4 involved preparation of an informed consent form. Module 5 was a mock ethics committee role-played by seven students while the larger group observed using a Fish Bowl technique and provided feedback. Assessments were done during the third and final modules.
Results
During the third module, understanding regarding certain areas – autonomy, benefits and justice was found to be inadequate. In the final step, all ethical aspects were covered by the students.
Discussion
This five-tier approach seems like a superior tool for research ethics training in academic institutions, especially in Southeast Asia, where the student-teacher ratios are generally very high."

abstract = "Background
Chinese patients with depression have limited access to mental health specialty care because of myriad barriers at different levels. Recently, there has been increased interest in targeting primary care settings for managing depression, because most depressed individuals visit their primary care physicians (PCPs) during the course of their depressive episodes. The present study examined PCPs’ perceived barriers on the management of depression.
Methods
A total of 295 PCPs completed a 36-item survey by mail. The survey questions included demographics, years in primary care, mental health training experience, and perceived barriers regarding the management of depression in their clinical and current practices. Chi-square and t-test analyses were used to compare the difference of demographic variables between the two districts. For the correlates of PCPs’ clinical practices and their perceived barriers, logistic regression models were used.
Results
At the practice level, lack of access to mental health specialists (37.8%) was the most commonly reported barrier and at patients’ level, reluctance toward diagnosis of depression (34.6%) was the high barrier. Results have indicated that most PCPs (69.2%) felt comfortable discussing psychological issues with patients. Mental health training is significantly related to PCPs’ clinical practice. When PCPs perceived moderate to high-level practice level barriers, prescription and referral were mostly preferred.
Conclusion
PCPs in China perceived some barriers in the management of depression, but they were open to modifications and enhancement of their skills related to managing depression."

In low and middle income countries where mental health resources are limited, community based depression intervention models, which can be implemented through the existing health system, are extremely relevant.
Objective
To test the effectiveness of Community based Depression Intervention Programme (ComDIP), newly developed by us, to reduce severity of depression in women, compared to the treatment as usual (TAU).
Methods
An RCT (Trial registration Number: CTRI/2011/08/001978, Clinical Trials Registry -India) was conducted in a primary care setting in Trivandrum, Kerala, South India. Health workers screened 422 women, aged 18–60 years, using PHQ-9. Sixty women with HAM-D (Hamilton Depression Rating scale) score above 19 were randomized to receive either ComDIP or TAU. Primary care physicians and health workers together implemented ComDIP which had psycho-social intervention and drug treatment. Those in TAU arm were referred to available mental health services. Primary outcome was measured at 8 weeks, by HAM-D.
Results
At baseline and 8 weeks, mean (SD) HAM-D scores were 29.2 (5.8) and 12.2 (9.3) respectively among women in ComDIP; and 28.6 (5.1) and 21.7 (12.4) respectively among those in TAU (p = 0.02, effect size = 0.82).
Conclusions
ComDIP, implemented through existing health system is an effective public health programme to manage women with depression in primary care."

Dhat syndrome is regarded by many as a culture bound syndrome of the Indian sub-continent. However the nosological status, conceptual understanding of the condition as well as the diagnostic guidelines are all mired in controversy.
Aims
The current study aims to study the psychopathology of Dhat syndrome in men by using a qualitative approach and to arrive at an operational definition for diagnosing Dhat syndrome.
Method
The qualitative approach consisted of five Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and five Key Individual Interviews (KII) with participants, consisting of patients as well as doctors – both allopathic as well as traditional.
Results
Detailed analysis revealed valuable data regarding the symptoms, causes, treatment measures, socio-cultural context, psychiatric co-morbidity, nature of the disorder and various other phenomenological dimensions. Ideas for future nosological positioning were also specifically looked for. Operational definition and diagnostic guidelines were also arrived at based on the analysis as well as on previous literature.
Conclusion
Although lot of agreement existed among various stakeholders about symptoms and presentation, they varied significantly in their opinion on nature of the condition and treatment. Suggestions for ICD 11 have been made."

abstract = "Background
Cognitive deficits, self-reported or found following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and their correlates are diverse. Despite the characteristics of people receiving ECT in Asia differ widely from the west, pertinent research from Asia remains sparse.
Methods
We investigated the correlates of self-reported, mini-mental status examination (MMSE) defined, and autobiographical memory deficits in a cohort that received ECT in a south Indian tertiary-care setting. 76 consecutive consenting people were recruited within seven days of completing their ECT course. Memory was assessed by a subjective Likert scale, MMSE, and an autobiographical memory scale (AMS). Psychopathology was assessed by brief psychiatric rating scale, and serum cortisol levels were estimated by chemi-luminescence immunoassays. Relevant sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from the participants, and their medical records. The correlates were analysed using generalised linear models after adjusting for the effects of potential confounders.
Results
Self-reported, MMSE-defined, and autobiographical memory deficits were present in 27.6% (95%CI 17.6–37.7%), 42.1% (95%CI 31.0–53.2%), and 36.8% (95%CI 26.0–47.7%) of participants, respectively. Agreement between the memory deficits was poor. Age, less education, duration of illness, hypothyroidism, and past history of another ECT course were significantly associated with MMSE-defined deficits. Age, anaemia, past ECT course, and pre-ECT blood pressure were significantly associated with autobiographical memory deficits, while residual psychopathology and cortisol levels were significantly associated with self-reported memory deficits.
Conclusion
Self-reported, MMSE-defined, and autobiographical memory deficits are common at the completion of ECT course, and their correlates differ. All service users receiving ECT need periodic cognitive assessments evaluating multiple cognitive domains."

The purpose of this study is to describe perceptions of mental illness and mental health services among college students in Vietnam, and to compare them with those in the United States (US). The cross-sectional data were collected using a self-administered survey from January to March in 2018 at a national university in Vietnam, and a state university in the US. The study revealed differences in perceptions of causes of mental health between Vietnamese and US participants. Vietnamese participants tended to believe that individuals with mental illness were dangerous and need to be kept out from the community, while US participants perceived that mental illnesses are the same as other illnesses. An important indicator of Vietnamese perceptions of mental health was the low likelihood of seeking formal help because of preference for seeking help from family or friends for mental illness. Interventions, such as mental health awareness campaigns or training courses should be provided for college students in Vietnam. Some strategies to improve mental health among college students used in the US may help to reduce stigma toward mental illness in Vietnam."

Depression is twice more prevalent among women but remains unidentified in primary care.
Objective
We aimed to estimate the reliability and validity of PHQ-9, when administered by health workers, a cadre of public health staff, posted in primary health centres. We translated PHQ-9 to Malayalam, a language spoken by 30 million people in Kerala, India. Health workers administered PHQ-9 to women (n = 238) aged 18–60 years in a high prevalent primary care setting. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was administered by the psychiatrist on the same day to diagnose depressive disorder. Two health workers administered PHQ-9, independently, in a subset of 21 women.
Results
The internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha 0.89) and inter-rater reliability (intra class correlation coefficient, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.86–0.95) were high. On ROC analysis, area under curve was 0.92 (95% CI 0.88–0.96). For a cut-off score of ≥9, PHQ-9 had a sensitivity of 82.5%, (95% CI, 72.4–92.6), specificity of 90.1% (95% CI, 84.5–95.6%), positive predictive value of 73.4% (95% CI, 62.4–84.4%) and negative predictive value of 93.9% (95% CI, 90.2–97.6%). The accuracy was 88.2% (84.0–92.4%) and positive likelihood ratio was 8.3. Factor analysis supported a single factor, with eigen value above 1, with high loading for all items (0.73–0.79), except item related to appetite (0.58). This explained 62% of variance in the data. Prevalence of MINI diagnosed depressive disorders was 25%.
Conclusion
When administered by health workers, PHQ-9 has good reliability and at cut off score ≥9, it has good validity to identify depression in primary care."

We conducted a survey of ramelteon and BZ-dependence in patients with insomnia. Study subjects were patients with insomnia (42 cases), who were divided into a ramelteon group (22 cases; administered 8 mg/day of ramelteon before sleep in addition to BZ) and a control group (20 cases; continually administered only BZs), with a mean disease duration of 11.3 ± 9.6 years. All data were analyzed using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. A significant improvement in scores at Week 16 over those of Week 0 was observed in the ramelteon group when a questionnaire concerning BZ-dependence and withdrawal symptoms was used. A significant improvement in scores at Week 16 from those at Week 0 was also observed in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index excerpt and in the Global Assessment of Functioning in the ramelteon group. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed that the number of concomitantly used BZ hypnotics decreased significantly in the ramelteon group after Week 16, while no such change was observed in the control group. Thus, by adding ramelteon to therapy for patients with long-term insomnia, we were able to reduce the number of benzodiazepine hypnotics that were used concomitantly."

To evaluate the relationship between neurocognitive deficits and insight (clinical & cognitive) among patients with schizophrenia in clinical remission.
Methodology
60 patients with schizophrenia (diagnosed as per the DSM-IV criteria) in clinical remission were assessed on Beck Cognitive Insight scale (BCIS), Positive and Negative symptom scale (PANSS) and neurocognitive battery (Trail A and B, Stroop Test, Controlled Oral Words Association (COWA) and Tower of London (TOL).
Results
Lower processing speed, low cognitive flexibility and poor executive functions as assessed by Trail A, Trail B and TOL respectively and higher verbal fluency (COWA) were associated with poor cognitive insight in the self-certainty domain. Poor executive functioning (3 moves problem of TOL) was associated with lower cognitive insight in the domain of self-reflectiveness. Clinical insight as assessed by item number 12 of general psychopathology subscale of PANSS did not have any association with any of the neurocognitive domains except for few subsets of executive functions as assessed by TOL. There was no correlation between clinical insight and cognitive insight. However, many of these correlations were weak and could be due to Type-1 error as significance of correlation was fixed at two tailed 0.05 level. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated cognitive flexibility as assessed by Trail B test and executive functions (3 moves and 5 moves problems of TOL) to be the significant predictors of self-certainty and self- reflectiveness domains of the cognitive insight.
Conclusions
The present study suggests that poor cognitive flexibility and executive dysfunction are associated with poor cognitive insight but the impact of poor neurocognitions on the clinical insight is not very significant."

Common mental disorders (CMDs) including depressive and anxiety disorders during antenatal period is reported to affect both mother and child health outcomes. There is scarce evidence about burden of CMDs during pregnancy from Lower and Middle Income Countries.
Objective
To review the evidence about the burden of common mental disorders among pregnant women
Methods
Major databases were searched systematically for English language studies on prevalence of CMDs. Quality assessment of studies was done with the modified version of Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for non-analytical studies.
Results
Twenty three studies were included in the review. The prevalence of CMDs among pregnant women ranged from 1%–37%. Depression was more commonly studied (ranged from 1%–30%). Prevalence of GAD ranged from 1%–26%. Factors commonly associated with CMDs were lower SES, intimate partner violence, history of previous episode of CMDs, history of mental illness in family and unmarried status. Effect of CMDs on child health outcome was also detected.
Conclusion
CMDs are common during pregnancy with varying prevalence depending on various settings and scales used."

A total of 6291 students participated in first phase. Around 19% of study participants reported problematic internet use and 37% used internet for mood regulation. Male gender, older age, studying in senior grades, and owning a personal device were associated with higher rates of problematic internet use. Use of internet for accessing social media, online gaming, and recreational surfing is associated with problematic internet use, while use of internet for educational activities was associated with lesser problems. There is a need to cover all students under cyber awareness program in order to facilitate safe and healthy use of internet."

Although knowledge is still limited about the connections between climate change and psychological health, the evidence is indicating that impacts can be felt at both the individual and community levels, with psychological health outcomes ranging from psychological distress, depression, and anxiety, to increased addictions and suicide rates. Drawing from 125 in-depth interviews conducted between January 2015 and October 2016 with community members and local and regional health professionals, participants reported that climate change was negatively impacting psychological health and well-being. The results stated that climate change enhanced the possibility of an increased drug, family stress, alcohol use, amplified previous traumas, psychological health stressors, and were implicated in increased potential for suicide ideation of the Hill-Tracts region in Bangladesh. These exploratory findings indicate that climate change is becoming an additional psychological health stressor for Hill-Tracks’ dwellers in Bangladesh."

The aim of the present study was to adapt and evaluate the psychometric properties and factor structure of the Indonesian version of the Quality in Psychiatric Care – Inpatient (QPC-IP) instrument.
Methods
The QPC-IP is based on a definition of quality of care from the patient’s perspective; it consists of 30 items covering six factors. A sample of 150 inpatients at general psychiatric wards in Indonesia completed the QPC-IP questionnaire.
Results
Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the factor structure of the Indonesian version was equivalent to that of the original Swedish QPC-IP, with the exception of the secluded environment factor. The results thus demonstrate that the concept of quality of care expressed in the QPC-IP is to a large extent equivalent among inpatients in fundamentally different health care systems and cultural contexts. Internal consistency for the full QPC-IP was adequate, but poor for the separate factors.
Conclusion
The Indonesian QPC-IP is a useful instrument for evaluating psychiatric inpatient care, and thus contributes to health care improvement in the field of psychiatry."

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of comorbid attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder (ADHD) on Bipolar disorder (BD).
Methods
Patients aged 13–40 years with diagnosis of BD with ADHD (N = 30) were compared to those with BD without ADHD (N = 69) for clinical course, functional outcome and quality of life.
Results
Those with BD + ADHD had significantly lower age of onset of BD (p < 0.001), a significantly higher number of total lifetime episodes (p = 0.002), higher number of lifetime manic episodes (p = 0.008), higher number of hospitalizations (p = 0.004) and higher prevalence of family history of BD as compared to those with BD without ADHD (p = 0.043). BD + ADHD group had poor response to conventional mood stabilizers and significantly higher prescriptions of atypical antipsychotics (p = 0.001) and higher rates of antidepressant-induced switch. Also, BD + ADHD group had significantly lower level of functioning in personal, occupational and social domains and reduced quality of life. In the BD + ADHD group, 40% patients had persistence of ADHD into adulthood. Comorbid current ADHD had more negative impact on the course and outcome of BD, when compared with those with ADHD in the past.
Conclusions
Comorbid ADHD has negative impact on the course and outcome of BD."

abstract = "Objective
Spatial normalization of brain MR images is highly dependent on the choice of target brain template. Morphological differences caused by factors like genetic and environmental exposures, generates a necessity to construct population specific brain templates. Brain image analysis performed using brain templates from Caucasian population may not be appropriate for non-Caucasian population. In this study, our objective was to construct an Indian brain template from a large population (N = 157 subjects) and compare the morphometric parameters of this template with that of Chinese-56 and MNI-152 templates. In addition, using an independent MRI data of 15 Indian subjects, we also evaluated the potential registration accuracy differences using these three templates.
Methods
Indian brain template was constructed using iterative routines as per established procedures. We compared our Indian template with standard MNI-152 template and Chinese template by measuring global brain features. We also examined accuracy of registration by aligning 15 new Indian brains to Indian, Chinese and MNI templates. Furthermore, we supported our measurement protocol with inter-rater and intra-rater reliability analysis.
Results
Our results showed that there were significant differences in global brain features of Indian template in comparison with Chinese and MNI brain templates. The results of registration accuracy analysis revealed that fewer deformations are required when Indian brains are registered to Indian template as compared to Chinese and MNI templates.
Conclusion
This study concludes that population specific Indian template is likely to be more appropriate for structural and functional image analysis of Indian population."

Most studies of shame have focused on stigma as a form of social response and a socio-psychological consequence of mental illness. This study aims at exploring more complex Javanese meanings of shame in relation to psychotic illness.
Method
Six psychotic patients and their family members participated in this research. Ethnographic fieldwork was conducted in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.
Result
Thematic analysis of the data showed that participants used shame in three different ways. First, as a cultural index of illness and recovery. Family members identified their member as being ill when they had lost their sense of shame. If a patient exhibited behavior that indicated the reemergence of shame, the family saw this as an indication of recovery. Second, as an indication of relapse. Third, as a barrier toward recovery.
Conclusions
Shame is used as a cultural index of illness and recovery because it associated with the moral-behavioral control. Shame may also be regarded as a form of consciousness associated with the emergence of insight. Further study with a larger group of sample is needed to explore shame as a ‘socio-cultural marker’ for psychotic illness in Java."

There is an acute shortage of mental health professionals in India, and also there is inadequate exposure to psychiatry during the medical undergraduate training in India. Moreover, the perception towards psychiatry and psychiatrists is not favorable among medical fraternity and policy makers. This is reflected in the fact that in spite of clearly deficient undergraduate psychiatry curriculum, no steps have been taken towards improving it and recommendations are not being implemented in true spirit. This review tries to identify the gaps in undergraduate curriculum, present a SWOT analysis of current situation and recommend the possible ways to address the deficiencies particularly in India."

abstract = "Background
Studies have examined the effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on human cardiac electrophysiology. However, no study has so far examined whether these effects vary with the magnitude of the electrical dose used to elicit the seizure. Because the benefits and adverse effects of the ECT seizure are dose-dependent, we examined the effects of different electrical doses of electroconvulsive shocks (ECS) on cardiac electrophysiology in an animal model with a view to determine whether cardiac electrophysiology could be a useful proxy to evaluate the quality of the ECT seizure.
Methods
Adult female Wistar rats (n = 20/group) received sham, low dose (10 mC), moderate dose (18 mC), or high dose (25 mC) ECS. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded and was analyzed for time and frequency domain variables in 30 s epochs in preictal (30 s before ECS), early postictal (starting 15 s after stimulation) and late postictal (5 h after ECS) periods.
Results
ECS was associated with substantial changes in most time and frequency domain measures during the early postictal period; a strong parasympathetic effect was observed. However, the effects of different ECS doses did not differ for any variable. All changes returned to levels that were similar to those of the sham controls in the late postictal period.
Conclusions
The effect of ECS on time and frequency domain cardiac electrophysiological measures was not dose-dependent. This suggests that if higher electrical doses are associated with stronger central seizures, ECG-derived variables may not be useful proxies for the quality of the central seizure. The generalization of this conclusion from animal to clinical contexts requires study."

Over the period of 6 months i.e. 12 tele-ECHO clinics, 41 patients case summaries were discussed by the Counsellors with NIMHANS Hub Specialists. Half of the counsellors could join >80% clinics and overall there were no drop-outs. There was a significant increase in learning and self-confidence after six months. The participants liked “relevance of the courses to clinical practices”. “group based discussions” and “a reduction in professionals isolation”.

This study aimed to evaluate the symptom profile, including anxiety and somatic symptoms among elderly patients with depression using the Geriatric depression scale (GDS-30), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Generalized anxiety Disorder -7 Scale (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) scale. Additional aim was to carry out the factor analysis of symptoms reported on various scales.
Methodology
83 elderly patients (age ≥60 years) with depression were evaluated on GDS-30, BDI, GAD-7 and PHQ-15.
Results
60 subjects (72.28%) had GAD-7 score of ≥10, which is indicative of significant anxiety. On PHQ-15, 98.8% of patients had moderate to severe somatization. There was no correlation between severity of depressive symptoms (as assessed by GDS-30 and BDI) with anxiety and depressive symptoms except for significant correlation between BDI total score and GAD-7 total score (Pearson correlation coefficient-0.319;p = 0.003).Factor analysis of GDS-30 yielded a five factor solution and when the items of other 3 scales were added, the number of factors/symptoms clusters increased to 7.
Conclusion
The present study suggests that there is a higher prevalence of anxiety and somatic symptoms in elderly patients with depression and GDS-30 is unable to capture all the symptoms of depression among elderly in the Indian context. Hence, complete assessment of depression in elderly should include assessment of anxiety and somatic symptoms by using other scales like GAD-7,BDI-II and PHQ-15. There is a need to develop a new scale which will be helpful in capturing the entire symptom profile of depression among elderly."

abstract = "Bipolar disorder (BD) patients have increased serum Uric Acid (UA) levels as compared to their healthy counterparts. They also demonstrate higher impulsivity - while symptomatic, as well as when in remission. Impulsivity adds a risk of self-harming behavior to BD, and studies show that it increases with UA levels. Given this complex relationship, the current project aimed at comparing UA levels in first-episode mania patients with matched controls, and analyzes its relationship with impulsivity, symptom severity and disease prognosis. Thirty-one first-episode mania patients were assessed on BIS-11 and YMRS, serum uric acid levels were measured, and compared to matched controls. A follow up YMRS was rated after one month to evaluate the effects of treatment. We found significantly higher levels of UA in patients, which showed positive correlation with impulsivity and a negative correlation with symptom improvement at 1 month. The results of the study support a purinergic system dysfunction hypothesis in first-episode mania, and suggest its influence on impulsivity in this patient group. Further, the mentioned dysfunction appears to have a negative impact on treatment outcomes in such cases."

It has negative influences, such as leading to difficulty in establishing trust-based relationships and interfering with medical treatment. In order to reduce such stigma, it is necessary to clarify its extent and characteristics in healthcare professionals. Considering this, an Internet-based questionnaire survey was conducted, involving doctors (n = 186), nurses (n = 161), and pharmacists (n = 192) in comparison with the general public (n = 331), and using the Whatley Social Distance Scale (WSDS) and Index of Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill (IATM) as stigma-related indices. Median total WSDS scores and interquartile range were as follows: doctors: 15.5(12.0–18.0), nurses: 14.0(12.0–16.5), pharmacists: 15.0(13.0–17.0), and the general public: 16.0(13.0–18.0). Similarly, median IATM scores were as follows: doctors: 39.0(36.0–42.0), nurses: 39.0(37.0–43.0), pharmacists: 40.0(36.0–42.0), and the general public: 37.0(33.0–41.0). IATM scores were significantly higher in the professional groups than the general public group. Both healthcare professionals and the general public with prior exposure to mental illness were more favorable attitudes toward the mentally ill. Especially among healthcare professionals, they working in psychiatric departments were more favorable attitudes. These results suggest that the stigma of healthcare professionals toward the mentally ill was shown to have a smaller and relatively favorable attitude than that of the general public. In order to correct the stigma it was suggested that a good contact experience with the patient such as work and training in psychiatry is effective."

Insight and medication compliance were evaluated by senior psychiatrists. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, t-test, chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. Linear Mixed Models were used to show intervention effectiveness on scales. General Linear Mixed Models with multinomial logistic link function were used to assess the effectiveness on medication compliance and insight. We found a significant reduction on anticipated discrimination, BPRS and PANSS-N total scores, and an elevation on overcoming stigma and GAF in the intervention group after 9 months. These suggested the intervention may be effective in reducing anticipated discrimination, increasing skills overcoming stigma as well as improving clinical symptoms and social functioning in Chinese patients with schizophrenia."

Clinical and treatment implications of aggression in mental illness are predominantly studied in perspectives of mental health care professionals. Coping style of caregivers towards aggression of persons with mental illness is understudied. So we studied coping strategies used by caregivers of patients with severe mental illness towards aggressive behaviors of patients and relationship between aggressive behavior and coping strategies. We assessed two hundreds and seventy caregivers of patients with severe mental illness attending outpatient psychiatry department using Modified Overt Aggression Scale and the Ways of Coping Scale – revised. 95.6% of the caregivers perceived verbal aggression followed by aggression against property (67%), auto aggression (33.7%) and physical aggression (25.6%). The study revealed that adaptive coping strategies – planful problem solving and seeking social support were used by 40% each of caregivers to deal with aggressive behavior. Only 4.4% of caregivers resorted to escape avoidance which is maladaptive coping strategy. Though adaptive strategies were used by caregivers these were not used in appropriate situations. Physical aggression and aggression against property were not significantly associated with planful problem solving (r = 0.105; p = 0.08 and r = 0.110; p = 0.07 respectively). But verbal aggression, aggression against property and physical aggression were associated with escape avoidance (r = 0.152; p = 0.01 and r = 0.168; p = 0.01 and r = 0.23; p = <0.001 respectively). The study concluded that coping in caregivers of severe mental illness is maladaptive with respect to aggression. Coping skills training would play a major role to address this issue."

abstract = "Background
Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate difficulty differentiating internally-generated from externally-generated events. An excessive deployment of attention to external events as well as poor processing of self-generated events has been proposed to explain this misattribution. This study was done to understand the neurophysiological basis of source monitoring bias in schizophrenia.
Methods
Seventeen patients and fourteen healthy controls completed a two-stage source monitoring task involving solving a three-letter jumbled word either by the participant or a computer following which they had to identify the correct source of the word – solved by self (internal source monitoring, ISM) or by computer (external source monitoring, ESM) – while EEG was recorded. P300 amplitude and latency were computed separately for ISM and ESM conditions.
Results
P300 amplitude for ISM condition was lower in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls over right and left parietal regions. Additionally, P300 amplitude for ISM condition was lower compared to ESM condition in patients over right and left parietal regions. However, P300 amplitude for ESM condition did not differ significantly between the groups. In contrast to P300 amplitude, there was no significant difference in P300 latency in ISM or ESM condition within or between the groups.
Conclusion
P300 amplitude was lower for internally-generated but not externally-generated events in patients with schizophrenia. These findings suggest that patients allocate less attentional resources to internally generated events resulting in poorer processing and consequent misattribution of their source of origin. This study provides the first specific electrophysiological evidence of impaired source monitoring in schizophrenia."

Internet Addiction (IA) among medical students and its association with psychological distress can impact their academic progress and long term career goals. IA would also indirectly impact community of health care professionals and the society. Thus, there is a need to investigate the IA among medical students.
Objectives
This study was a first such attempt to explore internet use behavior’s, IA, among a large group of medical students across multiple centers and its association with psychological distress primarily depression.
Methods & Materials
1763 medical students aged 18 to 21 years, pursuing Bachelor of Medicine; Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) from three south Indian cities of Bangalore, Mangalore and Trissur participated in the study. The socio-educational and internet use behaviors data sheet was used to gather demographic information and patterns of internet use, IA Test (IAT) was utilized to assess IA and Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20) assessed psychological distress primarily depression.
Results
Among the total N = 1763, 27% of medical students met criterion for mild addictive internet use, 10.4% for moderate addictive internet use, and 0.8% for severe addiction to internet. IA was higher among medical students who were male, staying in rented accommodations, accessed internet several times a day, spent more than 3 h per day on internet and had psychological distress. Age, gender, duration of use, time spent per day, frequency of internet use and psychological distress (depression) predicted IA.
Conclusions
A substantial proportion of medical students have IA which can be detrimental for their medical education progress and long term career goals. Early identification and management of IA and psychological distress among medical students is crucial."

Individuals with major psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are at increased risk for developing metabolic syndrome due to lifestyle- and treatment-related factors. Numerous interventions have been tested in inpatient and outpatient mental health settings to decrease risk factors. Diet and exercise represent the mainstay of weight loss treatment. With this background the review aimed to evaluate the effects of psychoeducation, diet and physical activity interventions on reduction of metabolic syndrome risk factors such as BMI, Body weight, biochemical profiles in schizophrenia.
Methods
The authors conducted database searches of PsychINFO, MEDLINE, Pubmed, Proquest, EBSCO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and manual searches from 1968 to 2017. Search indentified 11 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was critically appraised by 2 reviewers using established criteria. The outcome measures were body mass index, body weight, waist circumference, lipid profile, fasting glucose.
Results
Interventions led to significant weight reduction (8 studies), reduced body mass index (5 studies), decreased waist circumference (4 studies) and lower blood glucose levels (5 studies). Dietician and nurse led interventions (6 studies). The studies showed non pharmacological interventions were effective in reducing risk factors.
Conclusion
This review was able to demonstrate effectiveness of peychoeducation, diet and physical activity interventions were helpful to decrease and manage antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Results showed lifestyle interventions are safer and effective for promoting decrease or maintenance of weight and it can be delivered at low cost, safe and improves quality of life."

Antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP) remains a common practice despite inconclusive empirical evidence of additional efficacy and potential exacerbation of side effects. Previous studies suggest APP rate is notably high in East Asia. This paper aims to investigate the prevalence and correlates of APP in Hong Kong.
Method
This was a cross-sectional study of 728 patients with psychosis. The demographics and clinical information, including age, gender, diagnosis, hospitalization history, and medication were collected. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to study correlates of APP.
Results
The APP rate for psychosis was 24.2% (n = 728) and that for schizophrenia was 26.0% (n = 611), both considerably lower than our previous local data and that from East Asian regions. The most widely used APP prescription fell within the atypical/atypical combination (i.e., Amisulpride/Clozapine and Paliperidone/Olanzapine), and Olanzapine was the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic. At least 75% of APP patients with psychosis took at least one type of atypical antipsychotics in their medical regimen. Typical/typical polypharmacy was associated with older age and use of antiparkinson drugs. Typical/atypical polypharmacy was associated with the use of antiparkinson drugs and anxiolytics, as well as inpatient status. Atypical/atypical polypharmacy was associated with younger age, inpatient status, and the use of mood stabilizers.
Conclusion
Overall, our study highlights a relatively low APP rate in Hong Kong when compared to other countries in East Asia. Age, inpatient status and use of antiparkinson drugs, anxiolytics and mood stabilizers were associated with use of APP."

Maternal depression has been shown to be associated with neurodevelopmental, emotional and behavioural disorders in offspring. We aimed to describe the proportion of psychological problems among children of mothers with depression in Sri Lanka and to describe the association with the characteristics of the mothers’ illness.
Methods
A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 100 children and adolescents between 4–16 years whose mother has a diagnosis of depression and currently in remission. Specifically designed instruments were used to extract socio-demographic details and data on mother’s illness. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to detect psychological problems in children.
Results
14 % of the children scored abnormally high in hyperactivity, 13 % in conduct problems, 12 % in emotional problems, 9 % in peer problems. Hyperactivity, internalizing problems, and total difficulties were significantly higher in where mothers’ had a history of a moderate depressive episode and recurrent depressive disorder. Children whose mothers had no attempts of self-harm scored significantly higher in both emotional problems and internalizing problems. Children whose mothers have comorbid illness scored significantly higher in hyperactivity, conduct problems, emotional problems, externalizing problems, internalizing problems and total difficulties.
Conclusions
Screening for psychological problems in children and developing a holistic management plan which include steps to ensure the well-being of the children is important in managing mothers with depression."

Adolescents (n = 120) across two schools comprised the intervention and control groups and were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 months no-contact follow-up. The intervention group adolescents received the 8-weekly Coping Skills program in same-gender groups of 4–8 adolescents each, and the control group adolescents received one interactive psycho-educatory session. The intervention group evidenced clinically significant reductions in depressive symptoms, negative cognitions, and academic stress, and increased social problem solving and coping skills, at both post-intervention and follow-up. With regard to moderators, initial levels of depressive symptoms and homework compliance were found to partially moderate the effect of intervention. No effects were found for parental depression, gender, and age. The present study calls for future development and implementation of programs to address subclinical psychopathology among adolescents in Indian schools."

abstract = "Background
Alcohol dependence (AD), characterized by profound disruptions in specific circuits of the brain is influenced by both environmental, which play a significant role in developing addiction and genetic factors, which make some individuals more susceptible to disruptions. Various polymorphisms in the neurotransmitter genes are reported to increase the risk of developing dependence. The present study aimed to identify association of serotonin and GABA polymorphisms with AD in Indian subjects.
Method
The study group comprised of 141 AD cases recruited as per DSM IV TR criteria from the outpatient Department of Psychiatry and 110 volunteers from the general population. Clinical and family history was noted and 5 ml blood drawn for genetic studies. Polymorphisms 5-HTTLPR and STin2 of serotonin and rs2279020 and rs3219151 of the GABA pathway were analyzed and results correlated with age at first use quantity consumed, duration of use, dependence and age at onset of dependence.
Results
The marker frequencies were similar between cases and controls except for rs3219151. 5-HTTLPR was significantly associated with high AUDIT scores and alcohol intake (p < 0.0001), GABAA rs2279020 and rs3219151 with age at first use (p < 0.0001); rs2279020 with higher AUDIT score (p = 0.002) and rs3219151 with quantity (p = 0.0001). High frequency of GABRA6 rs3219151 TT genotype in AD and its association with lower age at first use, higher intake/day, and higher duration of dependence appears to confer risk.
Conclusions
This preliminary study, though on a smaller sample size, suggests an association of 5-HTTLPR and GABAA receptor polymorphisms with AD in our population."

abstract = "Background
The Indian Mental Health Care Act 2017 (MHCA -2017) advocates the duty to provide treatment in the least coercive manner. Little data exists on how Indian patients perceive coercion in medical settings.
Aims
To study the prevalence of restraint in a Indian psychiatric inpatient unit, and to examine the level of perceived coercion correlating to various forms of restraint.
Methodology
This is a hospital based prospective observational study. Two hundred patients were recruited through computer generated random number sampling. In eligible subjects, demographic and clinical data, restraints used and assessments related to perceived coercion were completed within 3 days of admission. Perceived coercion was reassessed at the time or within 3 days before discharge.
Results
In 66.5% one or more restraint measures were used, physical restraints in 20%, chemical restraints in 58%, seclusion in 18%, and involuntary medication in 32%. ECT is associated with the lowest level of perceived coercion followed by isolation/seclusion, chemical restraint, involuntary medication and physical restraint. Male gender, being married, rural background, low socioeconomic status, having a mood disorder, and alcohol or drug dependence was associated with an increased risk of physical or chemical restraint. Having a mood disorder, being from a rural area and a lower socioeconomic status was associated with being subjected to more than one form of coercion.
Conclusion
Restraint measures are more prevalent in psychiatric hospital care in India than in Europe. Physical restraint is particularly associted with higher perceived coercion."

abstract = "Background
The DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure is a self- or informant-rated measure that assesses mental health domains which are important across psychiatric diagnoses. The absence of this self- or informant-administered instrument in Hindi, which is a major language in India, is an important limitation in using this scale.
Aim
To translate the English version of the DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure to Hindi and evaluate its psychometric properties.
Materials and Methods
The study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Delhi. The DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure was translated into Hindi using the World Health Organization’s translation methodology.
Statistical analysis
Mean and standard deviation were evaluated for continuous variables while for categorical variables frequency and percentages were calculated. The translated version was evaluated for cross-language equivalence, test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and split half reliability.
Results
Hindi version was found to have good cross-language equivalence and test-retest reliability at the level of items and domains. Twenty two of the 23 items and all the 23 items had a significant correlation (ρ < 0.001) in cross language concordance and test-retest reliability data, respectively. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.95, and the Spearman-Brown Sphericity value was 0.79 for the Hindi version.
Conclusion
The present study shows that cross-language concordance, internal consistency, split-half reliability, and test-retest reliability of the Hindi version of the measure are excellent. Thus, the Hindi version of DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure as translated in this study is a valid instrument."

Suicide is an under attended public health problem in Bangladesh as there is no central suicide database and no national suicide surveillance system in the country.
Objectives
We aimed to look into the suicide metrics in Bangladesh by analyzing the online news portals, retrospectively.
Methods
Eight Bangla online news portals were selected purposively to include in the study and news of suicides were searched retrospectively. Search was conducted by the word “suicide news” (Attohottar Khabor). Initially news portal were searched with the searching word retrospectively. Then links of all news were collected. After removal of the repetitions data were inputted into software.
Results
Since 2009 to April 2018, three hundred fifty-eight reports were scrutinized. Mean age was 23.84 (±11.42) years, ranging from 10–85 years. Seventy percent of the reported cases were less than 30 years of age, 60.1% were female, 37.7% were student, 48.6% from rural background, and about 51% were unmarried. Hanging was found as the commonest method (60.9%) and affair related issues remained as a noticeable risk factor (14.25%). About 8% of the respondents were found to have suicide notes and suicides were found higher in night & spring.
Conclusion
Early adult, female gender, unmarried, students were more vulnerable. Hanging was commonest method followed by poisoning. Affair related aspects, marital discord, familial disharmony drew attention as risk factors. Suicide happened higher in the night and spring season."

We examined the first- and second-line pharmacological treatment for delirium to determine which drugs were chosen, how and when second-line drugs were started, and the effectiveness and tolerability of those treatments.
Methods
A retrospective medical chart review was performed for delirium inpatients referred to the Department of Psychiatry, Hiroshima Citizens Hospital, from October 2011 to September 2012. Clinical diagnoses were based on ICD-10. We compared the baseline severity of delirium, duration needed for improvement, and rescue with antipsychotics between subjects given only first-line drugs and those switched to second-line drugs.
Results
We studied 194 consecutive patients including 127 men and 67 women whose average age was 76.5±9.8years. For first-line drugs, trazodone was most frequently prescribed (n=100, 51.5%), followed by quetiapine (n=57, 29.4%). Among patients treated with trazodone or quetiapine as first line treatment, 59 of 100 (59%) continued trazodone and 52 of 57 (91.2%) continued quetiapine. Duration needed for improvement did not differ significantly between patients treated with trazodone as a first line drug and those with quetiapine as same.
Conclusion
Trazodone can be a candidate drug as one of the first line drugs for delirium."

Signal detection is one of the most advanced and emerging field in pharmacovigilance. It is a modern method of detecting new reaction (which can be desired or undesired) of a drug. It facilitates early adverse drug reaction detection which enables health professionals to identify adverse events that may not have been identified in pre-marketing clinical trials. Vortioxetine, the first mixed serotonergic antidepressant was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) on September 30, 2013 for the treatment of adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). This study was to identify the signal strength for vortioxetine associated ADRs using data mining technique in USFDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database.
Methodology
Most commonly used three data mining algorithms, Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) and Information Component (IC) were selected for the study and they were applied retrospectively in USFDA AERS database from 2015Q1 to 2016Q3. A value of ROR-1.96SE >1, PRR≥2, IC- 2SD>0 were considered as the positive signal.
Result
A study population of 61,22,000 were reported all over the world. Among which 3481 reactions were associated with vortioxetine which comprised of 632 unique events encompassed with 27 clinically relevant reactions. ROR, PRR and IC showed positive signal for weight loss, agitation, anger, ketoacidosis, insomnia and abnormal dreams.
Conclusion
The present study suggests that vortioxetine may result in these adverse events. Further pharmacoepidemiologic studies are necessary to confirm this conclusion and to improve the precision of the prevalence and/or the risk factors of this ADRs."

Suicidal behavior accounts for at least 40,000 admissions per year to emergency departments in Japan; however, little is known about emergency admissions owing to suicidal behavior in metropolitan areas. Therefore, we examined the clinical characteristics of suicidal behavior using psychosocial assessments performed by experienced psychiatrists in an intensive care unit.
Methods
Participants were 971 patients admitted to a university hospital’s intensive care unit for suicidal behavior between July 2006 and June 2013. Physicians and psychiatrists regularly assessed the participants using a standard data extraction form while the participants were in the intensive care unit. As suicidal behavior involving drug overdose is generally less fatal than other methods, we predicted that clinical characteristics would differ between patients with and without overdose. We classified participants into drug overdose or other method groups (ns=732 and 239, respectively) to compare suicide methods.
Results
In the overdose group, participants’ median age was approximately 5 years lower, and the following proportions were larger: female participants (77%) and participants with borderline personality disorders (21% vs. 10%), no clear suicidal ideation (30% vs. 15%), impulsively attempted self-harm (86% vs. 62%), and interpersonal problems (26% vs. 16%).

Village doctors are primary care physicians at the grass root-level of rural medical and health institutions in China. Their depression can increase medical errors and affect quality of medical care services. This study aims to examine depressive symptoms and their correlates among Chinese village doctors.
Methods
A total of 616 village doctors were recruited from Zoucheng County of Shandong province. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Duke Social Support Index (DSSI) and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) were used to measure depressive symptoms in the last week, social support and coping styles, respectively. Logistic regression model was conducted to identify the associated factors of depressive symptoms among village doctors.
Results
The prevalence rate of depressive symptoms was 27.4% (28.54% for males, 24.69% for females). Logistic regression analysis found that body mass index (BMI), poor physical health, low educational level, and negative coping styles were associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms. Positive coping styles were associated with decreased risk of depressive symptoms in village doctors.
Conclusions
Depressive symptoms are prevalent among village doctors in China. They need to adopt more positive coping strategies to respond to negative emotions. More professional and medical trainings may be important to reduce risk of depressive symptoms and improve their quality of healthcare among village doctors in China."

209 patients diagnosed with any anxiety or depressive disorder and started on mirtazapine, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, escitalopram or fluoxetine were assessed at baseline, after 2 weeks, and after 6 weeks with psychopathology rating scales and for predefined categories of JS.
Results
The incidence of JS during the 6-week study was 27.7%, but only 6.7% in first 2 weeks. JS rates were similar in anxiety and depressive disorders. Mirtazapine was associated with the lowest rate of 14.3%, and other antidepressants with rates of 23–34%. High dose antidepressant treatment was significantly associated with JS (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.37–5.25). No other variable predicted JS. JS was associated with significantly higher objective ratings of psychopathology.
Discussion
We conclude that up to a quarter of patients may suffer JS during the first 6 weeks of antidepressant initiation; higher antidepressant dose is a risk factor."

No main or interaction effects of group and time were observed on burden. The findings suggest that brief need based psychoeducation may increase knowledge about the illness and reduce self-stigma. Further systematic studies are warranted to test this intervention for long-term effects."

Help seeking is delayed and usually sought at an advanced stage of illness and many are yet to receive a formal diagnosis. We interviewed 35 caregivers of persons with Dementia (as per ICD-10) using a semi-structured questionnaire, the Short Explanatory Model Interview (SEMI). We explored the pathways taken by caregivers of people with dementia en route to a tertiary care centre and the interactions they had with different health care providers. Qualitative data analysis was done using ATLAS.ti. We identified three major pathways: I) The Neuropsychiatric pathway II) The General Practitioner pathway and III) The Non-cohesive pathway. In general, the caregivers were poorly informed about the illness details such as diagnosis, course and outcome. Neurologists communicated the diagnosis of ‘Dementia’ more frequently. When information was made available, the caregivers were satisfied with proper information about illness and with at least, partial improvement of symptoms. There is a need for increasing the awareness of dementia in community at large. Health services and systems that address this important public health problem need strengthening. Sensitization and training of primary care physician and staff to identify dementia at an early stage are the need of the hour."

Schizophrenia is associated with diverse white matter (WM) brain abnormalities. In this study, we sought to examine the WM microstructural findings which underlie clinical psychopathology clusters in schizophrenia and hypothesized that these symptom clusters are associated with common and unique WM tracts.
Methods
Overall, 76 healthy controls (HC), and 148 patients with schizophrenia (SZ) were recruited and severity of symptomatology in schizophrenia was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. WM fractional anisotropy (FA) values were extracted from their diffusion tensor images. Psychopathology clusters were first determined using factor analysis and the relationship between these symptom factors and FA values were then assessed with structural equation modelling, which included covariates such as age, sex, duration of illness and medications prescribed.
Results
Patients with schizophrenia had reduced FA in the genu of corpus callosum (gCC) compared to HC. A three-factor model, namely Positive, Negative, Disorganised factors, was determined as the best fit for the data. All three psychopathology factors were associated with decreased FA in the gCC and bilateral cingulate gyrus. Higher Negative factor scores were uniquely associated with decreased FA in the right sagittal striatum and right superior longitudinal fasciculus.
Conclusions
This study found shared and specific WM changes and their associations with specific symptom clusters, which potentially allows for monitoring of such white matter findings associated with clinical presentations in schizophrenia over treatment and illness course."

With the rising incidence of CSA in India and absence of culturally competent tool to assess the impact of trauma, there is a dire need for development of a comprehensive scale to assess the impact of trauma on children. Thus, the present study aims to develop a multi-dimensional CSA tool for children aged between 7 and 13 years.
Method
Qualitative research method of FGD/Key Interviews with 4 group participants (Parents, counsellors, mental health and medical professionals) and in-depth interview with children having history of CSA was conducted along with item pooling from existing scales. Scale domain and sub-constructs were identified through thematic analysis of the qualitative data and statements extracted through item pooling. Face and content validity was obtained followed by the administration of the scale on pilot sample of 30 children meeting selection criteria of the study.
Results
6 domains of the multi-dimensional impact of trauma was identified (i.e. Behavioral, Emotional, Cognition, Biological, Psychopathology and Social Functioning) which was constructed in the form of 85 scale statements across 6 domains and 48 sub-constructs on a 3-point Likert scale of response in both Hindi as well as English language. The scale was found to be having high reliability and average inter-item and inter-domain correlation. Modification of scale items based on pilot study findings and expert feedback analysis done to obtain a final scale containing 78 items.

Advanced age is one of the risk factors for attempting suicide. Suicide attempts are one of the reasons for elderly patients to admit emergency services. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between suicidal behavior and sociodemographic factors and concurrent somatic diseases.
Methods
The medical records of patients aged 60 years and over who presented to the emergency department of our university hospital for attempted suicide between the dates of January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2015 were screened retrospectively. Individuals recorded as cases of suicide on the forensic case report form were identified, the data recorded at our hospital were obtained, and telephone interviews were conducted to acquire any missing data.
Results
A total of 63 patients with a mean age of 65.88 years were included in the study. A large proportion of the suicide attempts occurred in the years 2014 and 2015. Overall, 23.8% of the patients had a previous history of suicide attempt. Overdose was the method in 74.6% of the suicide attempts, and 70.2% were impulsive; 63.5% of the patients had a history of psychiatric disease. The most common psychopathology was major depressive disorder.
Conclusion
We found that suicide attempts were more common among older adults with a history of depression, that approximately one in four had previously attempted suicide, and that the majority of individuals attempting suicide chose to use their own medication."

Altered cholesterol levels in body fluids and brain tissues have been shown to be associated with suicidal behaviour, violence and aggression. But the biological underpinnings of this association in the pathophysiology of suicide are not clear. Cholesterol plays a crucial role in maintaining the cellular membrane fluidity and alterations in cellular membrane fluidity may impair serotonergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system.
Methods
We measured plasma esterified cholesterol and platelet membrane fluidity using fluorescence anisotropy and estimated flow activation energy which is a measure of order of membrane lipid bilayer in patients with recent suicidal attempt and compared with age and gender matched controls.
Results
The plasma esterified cholesterol, platelet membrane fluidity and flow activation energy was found to be significantly lower in patients with recent suicidal attempts compared to controls.
Conclusion
Altered levels of plasma esterified cholesterol which is in equilibrium with membrane cholesterol might have resulted in decreased membrane fluidity and an increase in the order of membrane lipid bilayer. This might impair the serotonergic neurotransmission, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of suicide."

This study examined the differences in 14-year outcomes of persons with schizophrenia with and without family history of psychosis in a rural community in China.
Methods
All participants with schizophrenia (n=510) aged 15 years and older were identified in a 1994 epidemiological investigation of 123,572 people and followed up in 2004 and 2008 in Xinjin County, Chengdu, China.
Results
Individuals with positive family history of schizophrenia had significantly younger age of first onset than those with negative family history of schizophrenia in 1994 and 2004. Compared with individuals with negative family history of schizophrenia, those with positive family history of schizophrenia had significantly higher rate of homelessness and lower rate of death due to other reasons in 10-year (2004) and 14-year follow-up (2008). There were no significantly differences of mean scores on PANSS, SDSS and GAF in 2008 between positive and negative family history groups.
Conclusions
The positive family history of schizophrenia is strongly related to younger age of onset, and may predict a poorer long-term outcome (e.g., higher rate of homelessness) in persons with schizophrenia in the rural community. The findings have implications for further studies on specific family-related mechanisms on clinical treatment and rehabilitation, as well as for planning and delivering of community-based mental health services."

Past history of 3 similar episodes. 1st episode preceded by fever and associated with cerebral edema. Subsequent episodes not preceded by fever and patient was treated with Risperidone and Olanzapine. After admission patient was started on Risperidone along with THP when he had fever, tremors, altered sensorium and rigidity at 3 mg dose. After stopping Risperidone fever and rigidity improved with worsening of psychotic symptoms. Following this Olanzapine was started and very gradually uptitrated to 7.5 mg when patient had recurrence of fever and disorientation without tremors and minimal rigidity. Both the instances blood investigations including CPK levels were normal except for thrombocytopenia and leucopenia. Provisional impression of NMS was made in both instances. After stopping Olanzapine fever subsided with improvement of blood counts. Following this patient had catatonic symptoms for which patient received 9 sessions of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In atypical presentations of NMS, hyperthermia and muscle rigidity may be absent, posing diagnostic dilemma. So there is a need for broadening the diagnostic criteria and NMS must be considered with a high index of suspicion."

Escitalopram has some unique features among selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The aim of this survey is to compare the efficacy of escitalopram with sertraline on obsessive and compulsive symptoms in patients with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).
Methods
In this 12-week double blind controlled randomized clinical trial, 57 patients with OCD were randomly allocated to receive escitalopram or sertraline. Yale Brown obsessive compulsive behavior scale (YBOCS) was used to assess the outcomes. Adverse effects were also recorded.
Results
41 patients (20 in the escitalopram group and 21 in the sertraline group) completed the trial. In the escitalopram group 15 (70%) patients and in the sertraline group 16 (76.19%) patients showed more than 34% decrease in mean YBOCS score at the end of the trial (P=0.531). The two groups revealed significant decrease in YBOCS scores without significant difference (P=0.861) at week 12. No serious adverse effects were reported.
Conclusions
Our results demonstrated that escitalopram is as effective as sertraline in treatment of obsessions and compulsions in patients with OCD. However, it needs to be noted that our study is preliminary and larger double blind controlled studies are needed to confirm the results."

Schizophrenia is associated with functional challenges for patients; relapses in schizophrenia may lead to increased treatment costs and poor quality of life.
Objective
This SUSTAIN-I study was conducted to establish psychiatrists’ perspective on impact of long-acting injectables (LAIs) antipsychotics on the socio-economic and functional burden of schizophrenia.
Methods
This cross-sectional, survey-based study was conducted in 5 cities in India. Psychiatrists (≥5years of experience) working in clinics, psychiatric, government hospitals and rehabilitation centers were included and administered a specially designed questionnaire to elicit information on their clinical practice and prescription patterns. Perceived treatment costs for LAI versus oral antipsychotic treatments (OATs) and relapse rates were assessed. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize results.
Results
Total 31 physicians completed this survey. In acute phase, OAT prescription was higher whereas chronic patients were treated with either OATs or LAIs. Treatment with LAIs was the preferred treatment in 9% of chronic cases. Reduced relapse rates were observed with LAI treatment: 12% patients on LAIs relapsed as compared with 60% patients on OATs. Monthly medication cost for oral medications was lower ($8–$17) than short-acting injectables ($22–$50). For chronic cases, atypical antipsychotics cost (oral: $11.7–25, LAI: $150–167) was higher than typical antipsychotics (oral: $4–5, LAI: $5–25). Of the total expenses incurred, cost for hospital admissions was the largest component (78%).
Conclusion
Despite enhanced treatment adherence and potential to lower risk of rehospitalizations from relapse, LAIs are not the preferred treatment choice for patients with schizophrenia in India, owing to their perceived high costs."

Semi-structured interviews were undertaken at four psychiatric hospitals in the Peshawar region in Pakistan with 55 participants (44 male and 11 female) diagnosed with schizophrenia, who had suffered a relapse of psychosis subsequent to treatment non-adherence. The five principal documented reasons for treatment non-adherence were: 1) alternative treatment pathway chosen with a traditional faith healers (n=53, 96.4%), 2) lack of insight (n=36, 65.5%), 3) poor economic status (n=33, 60.0%), 4) adverse effects of medications (n=33, 60.0%) and 5) utilising psycho-active substances as an alternative to psychotropic medications (n=27, 41.1%). A number of identified factors associated with a relapse of psychosis are potentially modifiable including the provision of a range of pharmacological options including second generation antipsychotic agents, long acting injectable antipsychotics and psycho-therapeutic interventions including psycho-education.

Religion exerts a significant effect on the lives of many individuals including people with mental illness. As evidences keep accumulating, role of religion in mental illness is gaining importance.
Objectives
The study was designed to study the effects of religiosity on religious delusions, its presentation, acute course and outcome in schizophrenia.
Method
The study was a naturalistic observational study. Subjects with schizophrenia were grouped into those with religious (RG) and with non-religious delusions (NG). Their premorbid religiosity was assessed with Brief Multi-dimensional measurement of Religiosity/spirituality (BMMRS) and were rated on Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Brown's Assessment of Belief Scale (BABS) and Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) at baseline and 4 weeks.
Results
Scores on private religious practices, baseline scores of SAPS, BABS & PANSS and duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) were significantly higher for RG in comparison to NG. On component analysis, higher scores were seen on private praying, watching religious programs on TV, reading religious books and prayers at meals. But no significant correlation was found between the private religious practices and the baseline scores of (DUP), SAPS, BABS, PANSS and outcome measure. Also no significant difference was noted in measures of improvement between groups.

Delirium Tremens (DT) is the most severe form of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, with a potential risk of mortality. Search for the predictors of DT led to study of candidate genes, with inconsistent and inconclusive results. This study aimed to explore the association of various candidate gene polymorphisms and DT in a case-control design.
Methods
This was a genetic association study with a case control design. Two hundred ten Alcohol dependent (AD) male subjects and 200 age matched controls were recruited. DT was diagnosed with the help of Semi-structured Assessment for Genetics of Alcoholism. SNP genotyping was done using TaqMan assay by real time PCR (q-PCR).
Results
T allele carrying status (GT and TT) [rs1824024] of muscarinic cholinergic receptor 2 (CHRM2) was found to be significantly associated with DT. When compared to the general population, this genetic polymorphism was not found to be more common in alcohol dependence per se, which excludes the possibility of spurious association between CHRM2 and DT. Withdrawal seizure was more common in the DT group and came out to be one of the important predictors of DT. However, the genetic association was found to be specific for DT, not related to withdrawal seizures.
Conclusion
The present research added a new cholinergic dimension in the genetic association and biological mechanism of DT."

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ECT among elderly patients receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).
Methods
During the study period of January 2008 to May 2017, 151 patients aged ≥60 years received ECT and they formed the study sample. Data on patients aged 19 to 59 years for the period of 3 years (2014–2016) was also extracted for comparison purposes.
Results
The mean age of the elderly subjects was 65.8 years. In contrast to the young patients, elderly patients who received ECT more often had diagnosis of affective disorder, especially unipolar depression. Compared to young patients, elderly patients had higher prevalence of physical comorbidity with one third having more than one physical illness. The most common reason for use of ECT among elderly was poor response to medications (62.3%), followed by requirement of early response (49.6%). Four-fifth (80.8%) of the elderly patients showed ≥50% reduction in the symptoms with ECT. In terms of side effects, acute blood pressure changes were seen in 40.3% of patients during the ECT procedure and about half of the patients reported cognitive disturbances.
Conclusion
Present study suggests that ECT can be safely used among elderly patients, especially those with depressive disorders, not responding to medications."

abstract = "Introduction
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with no clear etiopathogenesis. Owing to unique socio cultural milieu of India, it is worthwhile reviewing research on ADHD from India and comparing findings with global research. Thereby, we attempted to provide a comprehensive overview of research on ADHD from India.
Methods
A boolean search of articles published in English from September 1966 to January 2017 on electronic search engines Google Scholar, PubMed, IndMED, MedIND, using the search terms “ADHD”, “Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder”, “Hyperactivity” ,“Child psychiatry”, “Hyperkinetic disorder”, “Attention Deficit Disorder”, “India”was carried out and peer – reviewed studies conducted among human subjects in India were included for review. Case reports, animal studies, previous reviews were excluded from the current review.
Results
Results of 73 studies found eligible for the review were organized into broad themes such as epidemiology, etiology, course and follow up, clinical profile and comorbidity, assessment /biomarkers, intervention/treatment parameters, pathways to care and knowledge and attitude towards ADHD.
Discussion
There was a gap noted in research from India in the domains of biomarkers, course and follow up and non-pharmacological intervention. The prevalence of ADHD as well as comorbidity of Bipolar Disorder was comparatively lower compared to western studies. The studies found unique to India include comparing the effect of allopathic intervention with Ayurvedic intervention, yoga as a non pharmacological intervention. There is a need for studies from India on biomarkers, studies with prospective research design, larger sample size and with matched controls."

abstract = "Objectives
Homeless Mentally Ill (HMI) patients represent a unique global problem and pose a challenge in treatment, management and rehabilitation services. There is sparse data on HMI patients in India. The objective of this paper is to study the clinical outcome and rehabilitation of HMI patients.
Methods
We performed a retrospective chart review of ‘HMI’ patients from 1st January 2002 to 31st December 2015, who were admitted under Department of Psychiatry at National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, India. Clinical outcomes were analysed by descriptive statistics and predictors of family reintegration were analysed by logistic regression model.
Results
Seventy-eight HMI (unknown) patients were admitted in fourteen years period. 64(82%) were improved at discharge, 40(51.3%) were reintegrated to the family; 15(19.2%) were sent to state home for women, and 17(21.8%) were sent to Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)/Rehabilitation Centre and 6 (7.8%) required multispecialty care in general hospital or absconded from the hospital during inpatient care. The logistic regression model showed that mental retardation (B=−2.204, P=0.002) was negatively correlated with family reintegration and clinical improvement at discharge (B=2.373, P=<0.001) was positively correlated with family reintegration.
Conclusions
In our study majority of HMI patients improved at the time of discharge. Family reintegration was possible in about half of HMI patients after treatment. Mental retardation and clinical improvement are important predictors of family reintegration of HMI patients."

Methamphetamine dependence is a serious health problem among Iranian methadone patients.
Aim
The current study is the first research that reviewed the prevalence of methamphetamine dependence and the associated harms among Iranian methadone patients. The other aims were to review the history of receiving methamphetamine treatment among methadone patients and the evaluated psychosocial treatments for methamphetamine dependence and/or associated harms.
Methods
Searching included both peer-reviewed literature and grey literature in English and Persian. Reference lists of the relevant papers and reports were searched manually for more information. The time period between 1 January 2005 and 28 October 2017 was set for searching.
Findings
Available evidence indicated that methamphetamine dependence increased from 3.9% among the two genders in 2007 to 60.3% among men in 2014 and 89.5% among women in 2015–2016. The prevalence of methamphetamine dependence was higher among female methadone patients than their male counterparts. Methamphetamine dependence was associated with multiple health problems in the social and health contexts of the two genders especially women. However, receiving methamphetamine treatment was negligible. The review indicated that cognitive-behavioural therapy improved psychological well-being. The Matrix Model led to abstinence from methamphetamine and improved psychological well-being. Motivational interviewing increased attendance in treatment. Family therapy improved the quality of life and social support. However, more similar studies were needed.
Conclusion
Despite a serious increase in methamphetamine dependence, there were a few evaluated psychosocial treatments. There is an immediate need to evaluate efficacious psychosocial treatments especially for women. Methamphetamine treatment should be provided in methadone treatment services."

abstract = "Objectives
Mental health associated stigmatization remains problematic in low and middle-income countries, thus preventing patients from adequate access to psychiatric care. Public attitudes towards psychiatrists have not been examined in many countries, especially not in Vietnam where merely one psychiatrist per 300.000 population is available. The study aims to explore attitudes towards psychiatrists in the Hanoi municipality and to identify socio-demographical factors that influence these attitudes.
Methods
Between April and August 2013, a general population-based survey was carried out in the greater Hanoi area, Vietnam. The sample of 817 participants was stratified according to the latest Vietnamese census (2009) and micro-census (2013) with regards to socio-demographic factors. Multivariate analyses were conducted to determine the influence of these factors on attitudes towards psychiatrists.
Results
Gender and religious beliefs significantly influenced public attitudes towards psychiatrists. Male participants reported significantly more negative perception towards psychiatrists compared to female respondents. Participants following a religion reported significantly more negative attitudes toward psychiatrists than those without self-reported religious attainment.
Conclusions
Negative attitudes towards psychiatrists are associated with religious beliefs and gender affiliation in the greater Hanoi area. A strategy that involves religious institutions in raising awareness about mental health issues while considering public's socio-cultural attitudes may pave the way for greater potentialities of adequate psychiatric care, destigmatize the mental health system, and care provider."

abstract = "Background
Low and middle income countries (LMICs) not only have the majority of the world’s population but also the largest proportion of youth. Poverty, civil conflict and environmental stressors tend to be endemic in these countries and contribute to significant psychiatric morbidity, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, mental health data from LMICs is scarce, particularly data on youth. Evaluation of such information is crucial for planning services and reducing the burden of disability. This paper reviews the published data on the prevalence and randomized trials of interventions for depression, anxiety and PTSD in youth in LMICs.
Methods
PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for articles published in English up to January 2017, using the keywords: Low/middle income country, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, child, youth, adolescent, prevalence, treatment, intervention, and outcomes.
Results
The few prevalence studies in LMICs reported rates of up to 28% for significant symptoms of depression or anxiety among youth, and up to 87% for symptoms of PTSD among youth exposed to traumatic experienences, though these rates varied widely depending on several factors, including the assessments tools used. Most rigorous interventions employed some form or variation of CBT, with mixed results. Studies using other forms of psychosocial interventions appear to be heterogeneous and less rigorous.
Conclusions
The mental health burden due to depression and anxiety disorders in youth is substantial in LMICs, with high needs but inadequate services. Youth specific services for early detection and cost-effective interventions are needed."

Previous studies showed the association of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene. We aimed to explore the OXTR gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the ASD severity categories based on DSM-5.
Method
The whole encoding regions of the human OXTR gene were sequenced to identify the SNPs in 100 Turkish children with ASD. Genotypes of detected SNPs were also compared with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) scores.
Results
Disease severity of the patients carrying GA and AA genotypes (GA/AA) of rs237902 were found more severe compared to those carrying GG genotype (χ2 = 6.456, df = 2, p = .040). This finding was more powerful in boys (χ2 = 9.288, df = 2, p = .010). Similarly, GA/AA genotypes of rs237902 were found associated with higher CARS scores in boys (U = 650.5, r = 0.24, p = .021).

However, the response to treatment with risperidone is affected by many factors, genetic factors being one of them. So, we attempted to evaluate the association between dopamine D2 (DRD2) receptor, serotonergic (5HT2A) receptor and CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms and response to treatment with risperidone in persons with schizophrenia from North India. It was a multicentric 12-weeks prospective study, undertaken in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to International Classification of Diseases 10th revision, Diagnostic Criteria for Research module (ICD-10 DCR). Patients were treated with incremental dosages of risperidone. Nine gene polymorphisms from three genes viz. DRD2, 5-HT2A and CYP2D6 along with socio-demographical and clinical variables were analyzed to ascertain the association in response to risperidone treatment. The change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was used to measure the outcome. Significant differences in the frequencies of single nucleotide proteins (SNPs) rs180498 (Taq1D) and rs 6305 (C516T) polymorphisms were found amongst the groups defined according to percent decline in PANSS. The CYP2D6*4 polymorphism differed significantly when drop outs were excluded from analysis. Presence of DRD2 Taq 1 D2D2 and 5-HT2A C516T CT genotypes in patients were more likely to be associated with non-response to risperidone. Ser311Cys (rs1801028) mutation was absent in the North Indian patients suffering from schizophrenia."

University students that suffer from mental disorders seem to have difficulty graduating. Therefore, we investigated risk and protective factors of dropping out with the aim of improving such students’ academic outcomes.
Methods
First, we statistically compared the academic outcomes of 203 undergraduate students who received treatment in the Department of Psychiatry of the Tsukuba University Health Center to those of matched controls. Second, clinical factors of 370 mentally ill students were statistically compared between the dropout and graduate groups.
Results
Mentally ill students experienced significantly greater difficulties graduating. Furthermore, the ratio of females and the year of study at initial consultation were significantly lower in the dropout group. However, duration of illness, social withdrawal, temporary leaves of absence, percentage of diagnosis of F2, history of truancy, CGI-S/GI score, number of suicide attempts, visits to us, family consultations with us and grade repeating were longer or greater in the dropout group. Ultimately, the number of suicide attempts, CGI-S score, social withdrawal and leaves of absence were significantly associated with dropping out. Moreover, duration of social withdrawal and leaves of absence were significantly correlated with CGI-GI score.
Conclusion
We found that the number of suicide attempts, CGI-S score, social withdrawal and extended enrollment were risk factors for dropping out, while the therapeutic effect seemed to be a protective factor. As risk factors involved states of social maladjustment, it is necessary not only to treat mental disorders, but also to provide assistance such as educational and individual support for daily living."

The carriage of T-allele of genetic polymorphism MTHFR677C>T was significantly more common in patients than in healthy donors: 255/500 versus 219/499 (p=0,0287, χ2=4,79; OR=1,33, 95%CI [1037; 1707]). The number of patients with chronic type of schizophrenia onset was significantly more among T-allele carriers (n=77) than among normal CC-genotype carriers (n=73): р=0.038. The number of “incapacitated” persons in the group of patients with defective T-allele (n=77) was significantly higher than in patients with normal genotype (n=73, p=0.0439; OR=2.878, 95%CI=1.111–7.456). The results suggest that T-allele of genetic polymorphism MTHFR677C>T in the population of European Russia may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and its unfavorable prognosis, which requires further investigation."

Rates and age patterns of suicide have changed markedly since 1979. Graphs of these patterns largely remained either upward-sloping, bimodal or flat (uniform) over the 36 years, male commonly differing from female, and East Asian patterns more like each other than those of the Western countries. Japan’s male middle-aged suicide rate reached a peak in 1999-2003, which, like increased rates among working age males in Hong Kong and Taiwan, has been attributed largely to consequences of Asian financial crises. Male to female ratios of suicide rates have remained higher in the Western countries, but late life suicide rates have decreased to varying extents in all five jurisdictions. Identifying reasons for differences between jurisdictions in their suicide rates and patterns at particular times, and over time, is likely to point to factors (period, cohort, psychosocial or cultural) that protect against or foster suicidal ideation. This avenue of research may assist in identifying ways of preventing suicide."

The prevalence of areca use among schizophrenia patients was significantly higher when compared to the general population (39.0% vs 14.4%, p<0.001). There was no significant difference in positive symptoms, negative symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, antipsychotic and anticholinergic drug dosage between areca chewers and non-chewers.

The risk of suicide among persons with schizophrenia (SZ) is higher than in general population, with multiple contributory factors. We assessed the prevalence of risk of deliberate self-harm and suicide attempts, along with associated socio-demographic and clinical factors in a group of SZ outpatients (n=61) as part of a larger study on overall schizophrenia-associated risks.
Aims
To investigate factors associated with risk of deliberate self-harm and suicide among persons with schizophrenia.
Method
Out of 270 SZ participants evaluated for various risks using Ram Manohar Lohia Risk Assessment Interview (RML-RAI), 61 reported risk of self-harm including suicide attempt/s. The factors associated with this risk were further evaluated on clinical details and Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies.
Results
Risk of reported self-harm was 22.59%. Among them, 10% had attempted suicide at least once. Current age and past month Global Assessment of Functioning score from DIGS (GAF) were significantly correlated with suicide attempt. Attempters had significantly lower current GAF score, indicating poorer functioning. Among 27 attempters, 9 attempted at the onset of illness while 6 others attempted suicide within one year. Most common method of attempt was ingestion of insecticides or overdose of medication, followed by hanging or jumping from height.
Conclusion
In our hospital-based sample of suicide attempters, 10% had attempted suicide, among them over 55% within first year of illness. Attempters were significantly older than non-attempters and suffered from significantly more severe illness than non-attempters. Positive symptoms were significantly associated with attempt, irrespective of time at which suicide was attempted."

The prevalence of Major Depression among middle aged women was 26.09% using the PHQ-9 diagnostic criteria and 24.2% using a PHQ-9 cut off score ≥ 10. With increasing age, there was an increasing trend in the prevalence of Depression up to the age of 55years followed by a small decline. A higher prevalence of Depression was observed among widows (43.37%), women not in a marital relation (41.38%), a woman with a history of postpartum Depression (OR 3.471), with peri-menopausal symptoms (40.28%, OR 2.86).
Conclusions
One fourth of the women screened positive for Depression in Ambalappuzha North Panchayat (26.09%). This study highlights the need for understanding the high prevalence and myriad determinants of depression among women living in villages."

abstract = "Background
The evidence in favor of exercise as a treatment for depression is compelling, but what kind of exercise, how much, how often, and at what intensity is necessary to make a significant difference. There is serious dearth of such data from India, in particular. We examined the impact of low-moderate intensity aerobic exercises on mood and somatic symptoms among women with depressive disorders.
Methods
A pre test- post test control group design was adopted with a sample size of 40 (20 subjects randomized to both experimental and control group) women inpatients diagnosed with depressive disorder at a tertiary care centre, Bengaluru, India. After pre-test, experimental group received 10 sessions of add-on intervention (video assisted structured aerobic exercise module) and the control group received treatment as usual. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS) and Depression Somatic Symptom scale (DSSS) were used as clinical outcome measures.
Results
The estimated mean change within the group in HDRS was 4.30 (95% CI 3.15 to 5.44; p<0.001) in the experimental group as compared to 2.70 (95% CI 1.50 to 3.89; p<0.001) in control group. RMANOVA (F=4.08) revealed a significant reduction in mean mood score in HDRS in the experimental group as compared to the control group at p<0.05. There was no statistically significant reduction in mean somatic symptom score between the groups (p=0.142).
Conclusion
The study findings support that add-on aerobic exercise is associated with significantly greater improvements in mood symptoms of women with depressive disorders, when performed in a structured and supervised setting."

Women likely attempt suicide more than men and sex hormones or menstrual cycle may be associated with female suicide attempts. There are debates regarding the correlation of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and suicidal behaviors. The objective of this study was to examine if PMDD was associated with suicidal attempts as sex hormones are contributed in its pathogenesis.
Methods
As a case-control study 120 fertile woman with regular menstrual cycles attempting suicide and admitted to a general hospital were compared with a matched control group of 120 women selected among those accompanying other patients in other wards. Psychiatric interview based on DSM-5 criteria was conducted for diagnosing PMDD.
Results
There was a significantly higher frequency of PMDD in suicide attempters than in the controls (P = 0.001); while no remarkable difference was seen in frequency of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) between the two groups (P = 0.294) and attempting suicide was not related to the menstrual cycle (P = 0.52).
Conclusions
This study suggests that PMDD may be associated with suicidal attempts, however it is not related to menstrual cycle. No relationship was found between PMS and suicidal acts."

Medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) are commonly seen across health care settings. Earlier studies have focussed on prevalence, cost-utilization and burden. Data from India is scarce. Patients with persistent MUPS have more impairment and psychological distress. This study was designed to assess psychological morbidity, health anxiety (HA), somatic symptom load, disability, quality of life (QOL) in patients with persistent MUPS presenting to a general medical outpatient service and compare it with patients with medically explained physical symptoms (MEPS).
Methods
The study was conducted in the outpatient service of the Department of Internal Medicine in a tertiary hospital in North India. Persistent MUPS was defined as physical symptoms of at least 3 months duration leading to dysfunction and with no identifiable medical cause. 70 patients with persistent MUPS and MEPS each were recruited. Psychiatric morbidity was assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric interview, somatic symptom load with Patient Health Questionniare-15 (PHQ-15), HA with Whiteley Index, disability with WHODAS 2.0 and QOL with WHOQOL-Bref.
Results
Both the groups were comparable on socio-demography and length of symptoms. Prevalence of psychiatric disorders and HA was significantly greater in MUPS. Patients with persistent MUPS had significantly more health care utilization, number and burden of somatic symptoms, greater disability and worse QOL.
Conclusions
Patients with persistent MUPS have a different profile when compared to MEPS. There is a need to screen and identify patients with MUPS and manage them keeping in mind the psychological factors and chronic nature and number of symptoms."

Psychiatric comorbidities worsen the outcome and increase severity of suffering in psychotic disorders. Gender differences have also been found to impact the severity and outcome in psychoses. In this background, this study attempted to compare psychiatric comorbidity between genders.
Aims and objectives
The aim was to compare psychiatric co-morbidity between men and women with psychotic disorders.
Methodology
A descriptive cross sectional study design was used. Data was collected through clinical interviews using standardized tools as well as the current case records. We used the MINI neuropsychiatric interview 5.0 to generate an ICD 10 diagnosis for primary psychotic illness and psychiatric comorbidity. PANSS was used to assess severity. Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, Hamilton Anxiety rating scale, Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and Fagerstrom Nicotine Tolerance Questionnaire were used to study comorbidity.
Results
100 patients were included in the study. 61% of the population had a psychiatric comorbidity. 42% of the men had significantly more multiple psychiatric comorbidities as compared to 7% among women. Men had significantly more substance use than women. Age of onset of psychosis was not found to be different between men and women.
Conclusion
In this study men had more psychiatric comorbidity than women, owing to greater levels of substance use disorders and anxiety disorders. This could be one of the possible reasons for differing outcomes between men and women with psychotic disorders thus indicating need for systematic future researching in psychiatric comorbidities in psychoses."

Long term change in diagnosis of patients having Cannabis induced psychosis (CIP) at the index evaluation is well recognised. Some patients are known to achieve complete remission while others go on to develop independent schizophrenia or mood disorders.
Aims
To study the long-term course of CIP and factors influencing it.
Method
Patients diagnosed as CIP (ICD 10: F12.5), admitted at NIMHANS, a tertiary neuropsychiatry centre at Bangalore, over the past 10 years were identified from medical records. 200 case records were identified and screened in detail. 57 met inclusion criteria and 35 patients could be followed up. Mean follow up duration was 5.75 years.
Results
Patients who completely abstained from cannabis after the 1st episode had no relapse of psychiatric illness. They showed marked improvement in socio-occupational functioning as well. All those who relapsed to cannabis use had a recurrence of illness. Half the patients with predominantly non-affective psychosis progressed to an independent psychiatric disorder; while only 7.7% patients with predominantly affective psychosis developed an independent disorder (p=0.01). Besides this, early onset of cannabis use (≤18years), younger age at onset of 1st episode, positive family history of psychiatric illness, being unmarried and lower socio-economic status were associated with poor prognosis. Abstinence later in the course of illness did not improve outcome significantly.
Conclusion
Abstaining from cannabis early in the course of illness is critical for good recovery. The course of CIP is variable and categorising CIP into affective vs. non-affective psychosis can be useful in clinical practice."

Schizophrenia is a disabling psychiatric disorder. The role of Borna Disease Virus (BDV) in the etiology of schizophrenia has been suggested by several studies. However, the existence of such association remained controversial. The present meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate this association.
Method
This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA). Online databases including Scopus, PubMed, Science direct, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google scholar search engine were searched until January 15, 2017. The heterogeneity of the studies was evaluated using Cochran's Q test and I2 statistic. Finally, random effects model was used for combining the results using Stata software version 11.1.
Result
Overall, 30 studies containing 2533 cases and 4004 controls were included in the meta-analysis. The combined odds ratio (OR) for the relationship between BDV and schizophrenia was estimated to be 2.72 (95%CI: 1.75–4.20). This association based on RT-PCR, WB, IFA, EIA, RLA, ECLIA methods was estimated to be 3.83 (95%CI: 1.59–9.20), 4.99 (95%CI: 1.80–13.85), 1.27 (95%CI: 0.23–7.12), 2.26 (95%CI: 0.48–10.64), 1.67 (95%CI: 0.50–5.56) and 2.88 (95%CI: 1.38–6.01), respectively. Subgroup analysis according to WBC, serum and plasma samples was estimated to be 3.31 (95%CI: 1.19–9.25), 2.21 (95% CI: 1.17–4.17), 2.21 (95%CI: 1.03–4.73) and 7.89 (95%CI: 1.75–35.53), respectively.

Impairment in cognitive variables and alterations in circadian function have been documented among patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar I disorder (BP1), but it is not known whether joint analysis of these variables can define clinically relevant sub-groups in either disorder. Objectives: To evaluate the pattern and relationship of cognitive and circadian function in SZ and BP1 patients with respect to diagnosis and indices of clinical severity.
Methods
Among patients with SZ and BP1, cognitive function was evaluated using the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery and circadian function was assessed using the Composite Scale of Morningness/ Eveningness (CSM). Clinical severity was estimated using the Global Assessment of Function (GAF) scale, and age at onset of illness (AAO). The patients were compared with community based non-psychotic control individuals and non-psychotic first degree relatives of the SZ patients. The cluster distributions of cognitive function, circadian function and clinical severity were investigated and identified clusters compared across diagnostic groups.
Results
Across participants, the cognitive domains could be separated into two clusters. Cluster 1 included the majority of control individuals and non-psychotic relatives, while SZ patients predominated in Cluster 2. BP1 patients were distributed across both clusters. The clusters could be differentiated by GAF scores, but not AAO. CSM scores were not significantly correlated with individual cognitive domains or with the clusters.
Conclusions
Clusters based on levels of cognitive function can discriminate SZ patients from control individuals, but not BP1 patients. CSM scores do not contribute to such discrimination."

A random sample of 123 consenting psychiatry inpatients were provided the information and consent-form of a hypothetical clinical drug trial. They were interviewed regarding their decision, the decision maker and factors that led to the decision. Family members tended to be the decision makers when patients were females, had low-income, were from rural background or had severe illnesses. Anticipated side effects and not wanting to interfere with existing treatment were the common reasons for refusal to participate while hope of betterment of the patient and benefit to humanity were cited for consent. The educated, urban, affluent class had more awareness regarding unethical trials and tended to be mistrustful of the medical community leading to higher rates of non-participation. Those who were adherent with ongoing treatment were also unwilling to participate. The lesser educated, low-income patients and rural domicile patients on the other hand had lesser awareness regarding clinical trials, trusted doctors and were more likely to participate. A good doctor-patient relationship, detailed explanations and clarification regarding the study and its conduct, and building awareness regarding clinical trials among vulnerable groups is necessary to ensure a valid consent involving no coercion, removal of prejudices, and ethical conduct of trials."

Internet addiction is common among medical students, and the prevalence is higher than the general population. Identifying and creating solutions for this problem is important. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and associated factors, particularly loneliness and interpersonal problems among Chiang Mai medical students.
Materials and methods
Of 324 first to sixth year medical students, 56.8% comprised females with a mean age of 20.88 (SD 1.8). All completed questionnaires related to the objectives and activities of internet use, the Young Internet Addiction Test, the UCLA loneliness scale, and the Interpersonal Problems Inventory were employed to identify internet addiction.
Results
In all, 36.7% of the subjects exhibited internet addiction, mostly at mild level. Amount of time used daily, loneliness and interpersonal problems were strong predictors (beta = 0.441, p < 0.05, beta = 0.219, p < 0.001 and beta = 0.203 p < 0.001, respectively), whereas age and sex were not. All objectives of using internet contributed to the variance of internet addiction score. For internet activities, only non-academic or studying contributed. The final model accounted for 42.8% of total variance of the internet addiction score.
Conclusion
Even though most addiction was at a mild level, careful strategies should be applied to better understand the situation. Along with a screening for potential internet addiction among medical students, attention should be paid to identifying those who experience loneliness and interpersonal problems, because both are strong predictors that can be improved by a variety of appropriate intervention."

Physicians do not always confidently diagnose psychiatric disorders. The present study was conducted to identify the clinical characteristics of patients in whom a definitive diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) could not be established.
Methods
The participants were 199 consecutive outpatients with MDD, who were comprehensively diagnosed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The physician in charge of each patient quantified his/her sense of self-confidence in diagnosing the patient with MDD using the self-rating questionnaire in which the score ranged from 1 (not at all confident) to 5 (definitely MDD). Using multiple logistic regression, the demographic and clinical factors of the patients in the low diagnostic confidence group (score less than or equal to 3, n=79) were compared with those in the high diagnostic confidence group (more than 3, n=120).
Results
Comorbidity of anxiety disorders (odds ratio (OR), 4.7), absence of remission (OR, 3.6), and non-melancholic features (OR, 3.5) were identified as the most discriminative variables associated with the low diagnostic confidence of MDD.
Conclusion
The results show that physicians were unable to confidently diagnose MDD in 40% of the cases, and that comorbidity of anxiety disorders, absence of remission, and non-melancholic features independently predicted the diagnostic uncertainty of MDD."

Recent treatment guidelines support treatment of biological rhythm abnormalities as a part of treatment of bipolar disorder, but still, literature examining various domains (Sleep, Activity, Social, and Eating) of biological rhythm and its clinical predictors are less.
Objectives
The main aim of our study is to compare various domains of biological rhythm among remitted bipolar I subjects and healthy controls. We also explored for any association between clinical variables and biological rhythm among bipolar subjects.
Methods
40 subjects with Bipolar I disorder and 40 healthy controls who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited for the study. Diagnoses were ascertained by a qualified psychiatrist using MINI 5.0. Sociodemographic details, biological rhythm (BRIAN—Biological Rhythm Interview of assessment in Neuropsychiatry) and Sleep functioning (PSQI- Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were assessed in all subjects.
Results
Mean age of the Bipolar subjects and controls were 41.25±11.84years and 38.25±11.25 years respectively. Bipolar subjects experienced more biological rhythm disturbance when compared to healthy controls (total BRIAN score being 34.25±9.36 vs 28.2±6.53) (p=0.002). Subsyndromal depressive symptoms (HDRS) had significant positive correlation with BRIAN global scores(r=0.368, p=0.02). Linear regression analysis showed that number of episodes which required hospitalization (β=0.601, t=3.106, P=0.004), PSQI (β=0.394, t=2.609, p=0.014), HDRS (β=0.376, t=2.34, t=0.036) explained 31% of variance in BRIAN scores in remitted bipolar subjects.
Conclusion
Biological rhythm disturbances seem to persist even after clinical remission of bipolar illness. More studies to look into the impact of subsyndromal depressive symptoms on biological rhythm are needed."

To evaluate the experience of parents of adolescents who received ECT for severe mental illness.
Methodology
Using qualitative methods, 6 parents of 5 adolescents were interviewed by using a self-designed semi-structured interview after the completion of ECT course. The clinicians involved in the ECT procedure, i.e., seeking informed consent and administration of ECT were not aware about the study. All the interviews were recorded and the content was analysed and themes were generated.
Results
Parents of all the 5 adolescents expressed that their children were considered for ECT only after the patient had not responded to medication and were unmanageable. Prior to ECT the treating doctors did explain to them about the ECT procedure, they were given information booklet and they were not coerced to consent for ECT. Some of the parents reported that they had dilemma prior to giving consent and were scared prior to the first ECT. However, as the clinical condition of their children improved, they felt that ECT was a good treatment. Majority of the parents felt that ECT was delayed for their children. When asked about restriction in use of ECT in children and adolescents, the parents expressed that it is important for law makers to understand the distress of the parents,when their children are acutely ill. They expressed that decision of administration of ECT must be left to the family and the treating clinicians.
Conclusion
Parents of adolescents considered for ECT are generally satisfied with the treatment procedure."

Many risk factors interact together during the critical period of development and govern the future phenotype of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Furthermore, co-occurring abnormalities among individuals with ASD vary a lot so as their abilities.
Aim of work
To investigate possible risk factors and to determine the prevalence of coexisting abnormalities in a sample of Egyptian ASD children and their influence on the severity and their communication performance.
Methods
The diagnosis and severity of ASD for participants (N=80) was performed by DSM-5, ADIR and CARS. They were investigated regarding the possible risk factors and coexisting abnormalities. A detailed history taking, clinical examination, the Arabic preschool language scale, cognitive abilities assessment and other additional instrumental measures such as EEG were used.
Results
Caesarian section and neonatal jaundice were the most common risk factors. The severity of ASD was positively related to maternal and paternal ages. Developmental language disorder, intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorder and EEG changes were more frequently detected among studied cases. The CARS scores were significantly higher in ADHD and EEG changes groups. The most severely affected CARS items in the groups with these disorders were determined.
Conclusion
High parental ages has an impact on the severity of ASD. ADHD, sleep disorder, and EEG changes seem to have an impact on certain elements of the adaptive behavior especially the communicative performance of ASD individuals. We recommend to seriously investigate co-morbid abnormalities and consider them during the process of management of ASD for proper intervention plans."

Persistent sleep abnormalities during abstinence are a harbinger for relapse in patients with chronic alcohol dependence. The present study aimed to compare polysomnography (PSG) data between ‘recently detoxified’ patients with chronic alcohol dependence and healthy controls.
Methods
Both conventional sleep architectural and power spectral analyses were conducted. Twenty subjects in each of the groups were enrolled. A 2 nights’ sleep (first-habituation and second-experimental) PSG data was collected. Computer assisted scoring supplemented by manual method using the Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria were used for sleep staging. Twenty eight channels were used for the EEG recording. Spectral power across early NREM (Non-rapid-eye-movement), Slow Wave Sleep and REM was computed using the Welch's averaged periodogram method.
Results
Results on conventional sleep staging showed that patients had significantly lesser total sleep time, sleep efficiency and stage shifts and longer sleep onset latency; while duration of each NREM stages were significantly lower, and latency of stage 2 NREM was significantly longer in patients. After controlling for multiple comparisons, spectral power analysis revealed significant differences only during REM sleep and specifically in high frequency (beta and gamma) bands.
Conclusions
Stating the mutually complementary role of conventional and spectral analyses of polysomnography EEG data, we conclude that sleep abnormalities are fairly evident in recently detoxified alcohol dependent patients."

The complex intersections between non-suicidal self-injurious (NSSI) behaviours; like cutting, burning or self-hitting, and suicide attempts, are an important domain of enquiry among vulnerable adolescents and young adults. A cross-sectional survey in urban schools and colleges assessed the rates of self-injurious behaviour among Indian adolescents and young adults. Predictors of NSSI and of self-injurious behaviours with associated suicidal intent, were also examined.
Participants and methods
The sample comprised 1571 male and female students, from 19 private and government aided high schools, pre-university colleges and undergraduate colleges in an urban city in South India. Participants completed the Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation which assesses the methods, characteristics and functions of self-injurious acts in the past 12 months. The measures of psychopathology included the Youth Self-Report and the Young-Adult Self-Report.
Results and conclusion
The results indicated that rate of NSSI was 33.8%, with minor forms of self-injury reported more often (19.4%) than the moderate/severe forms (14.6%). A smaller proportion (6.8%) reported self-injurious acts with associated suicidal intent. Certain self-injury characteristics and levels of internalizing and externalizing problems differentiated self-injuring youth with and without suicidal intent. Logistic regression analyses identified predictors of any self-injurious behaviour and of self-injury associated with suicidal intent. The implications for assessment and intervention frameworks for self-injuring youth are discussed."

In this cross sectional study, 50 patients diagnosed with Depressive Disorder along with their spouses were recruited. Both groups were assessed separately for marital satisfaction and QOL along with demographic details followed by appropriate statistical analysis. A high level of marital distress found amongst both patients and their spouses whereas only patients reported poor QOL. Increasing DUI worsens both marital satisfaction and QOL in spouses with no effects on patients. Illness severity worsens QOL in both groups with no effect on marital satisfaction. Gender was not found to have any impact on either of the groups. Small sample size and cross sectional study design were main limitations. Early and faster intervention will be helpful in patient’s prognosis, and also the perception and QOL of spouses. A better treatment response may be expected if focus is at improvement in QOL rather than only symptom control. Further work will be needed with a larger population and in a longitudinal study design. Future research also needs to focus upon establishment of better norms for the DUI for depressive disorder."

Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) may develop several non-motor symptoms (NMS). Psychosis is one of the debilitating NMS of PD. The neurobiology of psychosis is not fully understood. This study aims to compare the frontal lobe functions of PD patients with and without psychosis using the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB).
Methodology
This study included 69 patients with PD; 34 with psychosis (PD-P) and 35 without psychosis (PD-NP). Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) was used to screen for cognitive impairment. Unified Parkinson’s disease Rating scale part-III (UPDRS-III) was used to measure the severity and Hoehn and Yahr score (H&Y) was used to measure the stage of PD. Frontal lobe functions were assessed by FAB.
Results
The PD-P and PD-NP groups were comparable for age (58.7±8.4 vs 55.7±8.2, p=0.14), age at onset of symptoms (51.4±8.1 vs 50.0±8.8, p=0.48), gender distribution (men: 88%vs 80%, p=0.51), MMSE (28.2±1.9 vs 28.7±1.2 p=0.12), levodopa equivalent dose/day (736.0±376.3 vs 625.2±332.2, p=0.19), UPDRS-III OFF-score (36.7±8.8 vs 35.4±13.2, p=0.64), UPDRS-III ON-score (13.2±5.4 vs 12.4±6.6, p=0.44) and H&Y stage (2.3±0.3 vs 2.3±0.3, p=0.07). PD-P group had lower total FAB score compared to PD-NP group (13.9±2.2 vs 16.5±1.8, p<0.01). On the FAB, PD-P group had lower scores compared to PD-NP in lexical fluency (FAB-2), programming (FAB-3), sensitivity to interference (FAB-4) and inhibitory control (FAB-5).
Conclusion
Patients with PD-P had significant frontal lobe dysfunction compared to PD-NP. FAB may be a simple and useful bedside tool to assess frontal dysfunction in patients with PD in a busy neurological set up."

Family accommodation (FA) is the phenomenon whereby caregivers assist or facilitate rituals or behaviours related to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). There is a need for a self-rated instrument to assess this construct in resource-strained clinical settings of India.
Aim
To explore the factor structure of Hindi version of Family Accommodation Scale-Self Rated version (FAS-SR) and compare its validity with the gold standard Family Accommodation Scale-Interviewer Rated (FAS-IR) scale.
Material & methods
The Hindi version of FAS-SR scale and FAS-IR scale was applied on 105 caregivers of patients with OCD.
Results
The initial factor analysis yielded three-factor models with an eigenvalue of >1 and the total variance explained by these factors was 72.017%. The internal consistency of the 19-item scale was 0.93 indicating good inter-item correlation. There was a significant positive correlation between FAS-IR scale total score and all the factors of the FAS-SR Scale. The average measure ICC was 0.889 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.783 to 0.981 (F (62,84)=37.547, p<001) indicating high degree of reliability between the Hindi version of FAS-SR and the FAS-IR scale.

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a broad heterogeneous construct resolving into several symptom-clusters by factor analysis. The aim was to find the factor structures of MDD as per Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and whether they predict escitalopram response.
Methods
In a longitudinal study at a tertiary institute in north India, 116 adult out-patients with non-psychotic unipolar MDD were assessed with MADRS before and after treatment with escitalopram (10–20mg) over 6–8 weeks for drug response.
Results
For total 116 patients pre-treatment four factor structures of MADRS extracted by principal component analysis with varimax rotation altogether explained a variance of 57%: first factor ‘detachment’ (concentration difficulty, lassitude, inability to feel); second factor ‘psychic anxiety’ (suicidal thoughts and inner tension); third ‘mood-pessimism’ (apparent sadness, reported sadness, pessimistic thoughts) and fourth ‘vegetative’ (decreased sleep, appetite). Eighty patients (68.9%) who completed the study had mean age 35.37±10.9 yrs, majority were male (57.5%), with mean pre-treatment MADRS score 28.77±5.18 and majority (65%) having moderate severity (MADRS <30). Among them 56 (70%) responded to escitalopram. At the end of the treatment there were significant changes in all the 4 factor structures (p<0.01). Vegetative function was an important predictor of response (p<0.01, odd's ratio: 1.3 [1.1–1.6] 95% CI). Melancholia significantly predicted non-response (p=0.04).
Conclusions
Non-psychotic unipolar major depression having moderate severity in north Indian patients as per MADRS resolved into four factor-structures all significantly improved with adequate escitalopram treatment. Understanding the factor structure is important as they can be important predictor of escitalopram response."

Older adults aged 60 years & above seeking help at NIMHANS outpatient & community services were screened for early cognitive deficits. Persons were diagnosed to have MCI according to Petersen’s criteria, after detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessments. Age, gender and education matched healthy controls were recruited for comparison. A total of 7469 older adults were screened during the study period (July 2012–December 2014). Less than 1% (n=56) were diagnosed with MCI. Majority were males, from urban background with an average of 13 years of education. They presented mainly with memory disturbances, more than 75% (n=43) were found to have amnestic type of MCI (aMCI). Of the aMCI subjects, majority (80%) had deficits in more than one cognitive domain. They performed significantly worse (p<0.001) on tests of episodic memory, logical memory, attention and executive functions. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were prevalent in 55% of MCI group and influenced their cognitive scores. The findings suggest that persons with MCI perform worse not only on memory tasks but also on some of the attention and executive functions tasks. As observed in earlier studies, amnestic multiple-domain MCI was the most common type of MCI in this study population. Indigenous assessment tools were of significant value in distinguishing MCI from normal ageing."

Neuromodulatory interventions like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is emerging as a potential therapeutic strategy to promote cognitive function in healthy and pathological aging. There is need for more studies evaluating the utility and tolerability of tDCS in Mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Since MCI is considered as the prodromal stage of dementia, it has emerged as the most important target for intervention in dementia.
Objective and method
This study investigated the feasibility, tolerability and clinical utility of tDCS in patients with MCI. In this observational study that included 11 patients with MCI, tDCS with an intensity of 2mA and duration of 20minutes per day was administered for 5 consecutive days with anode over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cathode over right supra orbital region. Treatment outcome was measured using picture memory impairment test (PMIT) immediately and also 1 month after the 5th session of tDCS
Results
All the patients tolerated tDCS sessions without any significant adverse effects. Stimulation of left DLPFC with tDCS was noted to significantly improve the immediate and delayed recall performance of the patients in PMIT after five days of stimulation and most of the benefits were persistent at one month follow up.
Conclusion
This study findings suggests that tDCS is safe and potentially beneficial in combating cognitive deficits in patients with MCI and provides a framework for further studies with better methodology (randomized and sham controlled trial) to investigate the same."

To carryout factor analysis of symptom profile of patients with schizophrenia assessed by using positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), Calgary depression rating scale (CDSS), Young mania rating scale (YMRS) and YBOCS checklist.
Methodology
181 patients of schizophrenia were assessed on PANSS, CDSS, YMRS and YBOCS checklist.
Results
Factor analysis of PANSS yielded 3 factor structure (positive, negative, anxiety). When the items of CDSS were added to the PANSS items, total number of factors increased to 4 with depression emerging as a separate factor. Addition of YMRS to PANSS and CDSS led to emergence of 5 factor model. Further addition of YBOCS checklist led to emergence of a 7 factor model (positive, depressive, obsessive compulsive, negative, manic, anxiety and obsessive compulsive-2), which explained 49.85% variance of the data. Positive symptoms emerged as the factor-1. Depressive symptoms loaded on the factor-2, negative symptoms loaded on to factor-4, manic symptoms loaded onto factor-5 and anxiety symptoms loaded onto factor-6. OC symptoms loaded onto factor 3 and 7.
Conclusions
Present study suggests that when multiple scales are used for assessment of various symptoms of schizophrenia, the symptoms separate out into 7 factors. This finding suggests that clinical assessment of schizophrenia should not be limited to core psychotic symptoms only and structured instruments must be used to elicit other symptoms too while monitoring the clinical picture of patients with schizophrenia."

Patients with Bipolar Disorder (BD) may have higher risk of Tardive Dyskinesia (TD). Theories for TD include inflammatory or oxidative stress and altered iron metabolism. The current frequency and clinical and biochemical correlates of TD in BD needs exploration.
Objectives
To assess: (1) the frequency of TD in BD; (2) clinical correlates of TD in BD; (3) oxidative stress markers, inflammatory markers and hepcidin in TD in BD.
Materials & methods
In this cross-sectional study, 170 patients with BD were assessed for clinical characteristics using structured assessments. Inflammatory and oxidative markers like Interleukin-6 (IL-6), high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) and hepcidin were assessed by ELISA.
Results
Frequency of TD was 10.6% (95%C.I.=6.4%–16.2%). Compared to patients without TD, patients with TD were older (F=0.340;p=0.000), had more episodes of illness (U=962.5;p=0.044) higher rates of medical comorbidity (X2=6.924; p=0.009*), antipsychotic exposure (U=592.5;p=0.000), typical antipsychotic exposure (U=756.5;p=0.001) and cognitive deficits (F=1.129;p=0.001). The biomarkers levels did not differ between the groups. Hepcidin levels correlated with Abnormal involuntary Movements scale (AIMS) score (r=0.213;p=0.006). Patients treated with lithium were more likely to have TD, but also had greater exposure to antipsychotics than patients on valproate.
Conclusion
About one-tenth of patients with BD-I have TD. The presence of TD is associated several clinical characteristics such as age, exposure to typical antipsychotics and chronicity of illness. Hepcidin was associated with greater severity of dyskinetic movements and needs further exploration."

Genetic etiology of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) has been investigated extensively, with mixed results across candidate gene studies. The dimensional subtypes of OCD are shown to better correlate with brain imaging endophenotypes and thus could potentially enhance the power of genetic association. In this study, we perform a case control analysis of association of a single nucleotide polymorphism rs6265(Val66Met) in Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor gene, that has been previously implicated in a variety of psychiatric syndromes, and examine its association with symptom dimensions of OCD.
Methods
Individuals diagnosed to have OCD (n=377) and controls (n=449) of South Indian origin were genotyped for polymorphism rs6265 (196G/A, Val66Met). Detailed phenotypic assessment of the cases were carried out in the cases using structured instruments. The genotypic association was tested for clinical variables such as age of onset, gender, family history, co-morbidity, treatment response, and factor analyzed OCD symptom dimensions.
Results
The allele ‘A’ frequency was found to be significantly higher in the controls, as compared to cases suggesting a protective effect. The contamination/washing symptom dimension score was significantly lower in carriers of ‘A’ allele which remained significant even after testing for confounding effects on linear regression.
Conclusions
Our results support findings from previous studies on a possible protective effect of the ‘Met’ allele at the Val66Met locus in OCD. Its association with lower scores on the contamination/washing dimension is a novel finding of this study."

Disulfiram was the first medication approved to treat alcohol dependence and has been found to be safe and efficacious. This cross sectional, observational, qualitative study was conducted with the aim to assess the pattern of dispensation of disulfiram among patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD).
Material and methods
Data was collected using a customized questionnaire consisting of 32 questions regarding socio-demographic characteristics, psychiatric history, pattern of dispensation of disulfiram/disulfiram-like product (DLP) and related knowledge. Descriptive statistics and frequency distribution tables were used for analysing the data using Microsoft Excel 2013.
Results
Thirty seven percent (n=100) of the total patients with ADS (n=268) screened had a history of administration of disulfiram/DLP. Tablets were the commonest (60%) formulation of disulfiram/DLP advised by the dispenser, only 4% of whom were psychiatrists. Surreptitious administration was preferred by family members (76%). Majority of the patients (44%) received the medication only once or twice.
Limitations
The actual product – disulfiram and/or DLP – could not be chemically tested to confirm the identity. Considering the socio-economic and cultural background where the study was conducted, it would be difficult to generalize the findings.
Discussion
Disulfiram/DLP was prescribed by physicians and faith healers alike. They seem to promote surreptitious administration of disulfiram with full agreement of relatives, thereby potentially exposing the patient to life threatening complications. Hence it is recommended that disulfiram prescription should involve stricter guidelines and DLP like kudzu in traditional/herbal products should also be brought under the same purview as disulfiram."

There is moderate evidence that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) such as meditation, yoga, and stress reduction lower the perception of pain, increase mobility, improve functioning and well-being. By integrating MBIs and other therapeutic interventions in a multi-disciplinary pain management plan, clinicians can improve treatment outcomes and potentially decrease pain-related medication utilization."

500 patients were randomly selected using purposive sampling from patients attending a tertiary level mental health care facility were evaluated for the presence of any sleep disorder along with their sleep quality. In patients having insomnia, severity of the same was determined.
Results
83.4% of the population had some type of sleep disorder. Symptoms of insomnia were reported by 78.2% of the population and 29.2% had moderate to severe insomnia. 78.4% of the population had poor sleep quality. Significant difference was noted among the different psychiatric groups when insomnia severity index (ISI) was compared. In multinomial logistic regression, chance of severe insomnia is more if the diagnosis is depression, but less if mania or ocd, compared to psychosis.
Conclusion
This study was the first in India to assess the prevalence of sleep disorders in psychiatric outpatients. Our study underscores the importance of careful evaluation of sleep problems for proper management of the patients."

Vaccines are one of the newer therapeutic modalities being researched in psychiatric illnesses with limited role of pharmacological interventions. Preclinical studies on vaccines have shown favorable results in conditions like Substance use Disorders and Alzheimer’s Dementia. However, the utility of Mumps Measles Rubella vaccine has been overshadowed by controversy linked to causation of Autism. With this background, the current narrative review aimed to comprehensively and critically evaluate the current status of vaccines in Psychiatric illnesses.
Methods
Preliminary literature search using the electronic databases of MEDLINE and Google Scholar between May 1967 and May 2017 using the search terms “Vaccines” and “Psychiatry” was carried out and articles were found in the following areas of research: Substance use, Alzheimer Dementia, Autism, Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Human Papilloma Virus Further, the refined search was done using combinations of search terms “Vaccine”, “Nicotine”, “Cocaine”, “Opioid”, “Alzheimer Dementia”, “Autism”, and “Pervasive Developmental Disorders” and peer – reviewed original articles published in English conducted among human subjects and published in English language were included for review.
Results
A total of 31 articles found eligible were organized into appropriate sections synthesizing the literature on role of vaccines in specific disorders such as Substance Use Disorders, Alzheimer Dementia and Pervasive Developmental Disorders.
Discussion
The therapeutic potential of vaccines in Substance Use Disorders and Alzheimer Dementia was found to be limited in comparison to the results from animal studies. Safety profile of the immunogens and the adjuvants in humans is possibly the most important limitation. No causal association between Measles Mumps Rubella vaccine and Autism was found."

This pilot study examined the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of using an online computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for treating Chinese patients with depression.
Methods
Seventy-five Chinese patients with depression in outpatient clinics were randomized into a 5-week intervention. The intervention group received the Chinese translated version of MoodGYM in addition to usual treatment, and the control group continued with usual treatment. Participants completed the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) pre- and post-intervention.
Results
We conducted multivariate linear regression analyses to compare the change in CES-D scores for completers after the intervention. Seventy-eight percent (n=29) of participants in the intervention group and 84% (n=32) of patients in the control group completed the post-treatment assessments, and no serious adverse events were reported. Results indicated that while both groups significantly improved at post test, the intervention group improved significantly more than the control group (t(59)=2.37, p=0.02).
Conclusion
Computerized CBT can be a cost-effective adjunct to medication treatment, particularly in areas with limited access to mental health services. The use of online computerized CBT has been found to be effective in many studies in Western countries, but has not been studied among Chinese outpatients. This study suggests that online computerized CBT is acceptable, and that MoodGYM is a feasible and efficacious augmentative treatment, specifically when used within an outpatient clinic population. With this small sample size we were able to demonstrate that the addition of MoodGYM to usual care improved treatment outcomes for outpatients with depression in China."

Cue-induced craving is known to be associated with a higher risk of relapse, wherein drug-specific cues become conditioned stimuli, eliciting conditioned responses. Cue-reactivity paradigm are important tools to study psychological responses and functional neuroimaging changes. However, till date, there has been no specific study or a validated paradigm for inhalant cue-induced craving research. The study aimed to develop and validate visual cue stimulus for inhalant cue-associated craving.
Method
The first step (picture selection) involved screening and careful selection of 30 cue- and 30 neutral-pictures based on their relevance for naturalistic settings. In the second step (time optimization), a random selection of ten cue-pictures each was presented for 4s, 6s, and 8s to seven adolescent male inhalant users, and pre-post craving response was compared using a Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) for each of the picture and time. In the third step (validation), craving response for each of 30 cue- and 30 neutral-pictures were analysed among 20 adolescent inhalant users.
Results
Findings revealed a significant difference in before and after craving response for the cue-pictures, but not neutral-pictures. Using ROC-curve, pictures were arranged in order of craving intensity. Finally, 20 best cue- and 20 neutral-pictures were used for the development of a 480s visual cue paradigm.
Conclusion
This is the first study to systematically develop an inhalant cue picture paradigm which can be used as a tool to examine cue induced craving in neurobiological studies. Further research, including its further validation in larger study and diverse samples, is required."

Suicide and self harm behavior has become a major public health issue in recent years in Nepal. This small south Asian country was ranked 7th by suicide rate globally by the 2014 World Health Organization report with an estimated 6,840 suicides annually, or 24.9 suicides per 100,000 people. We decided to explore the epidemiology of suicidal behaviour and self harm, modes of attempt, associated risk factors and trends in specific population.
Methodology
Two researchers independently reviewed 47 studies published in the US National Library of Medicine's PubMed electronic Database and Google Scholar till December 2016. Finally, twenty articles meeting the objective were included. This article summarizes findings on epidemiology of suicidal behavior, associated patterns, risk factors and trend in specific population in Nepal.
Results
Most of the data available till date are hospital based and either cross-sectional or retrospective. Some of the studies have relied on mortality statistics whereas few have done community based screening. Some of the key findings include higher rate among women and younger age group, a rising trend among specific groups such as marginalized, migrant workers and disaster affected population. The studies also show role of mental illness, predominantly mood disorders and psycho-social factors such as interpersonal or marital conflicts and socio-economic issues in triggering suicide and self harm behavior.
Conclusion
Overall, the studies provide satisfactory information about the burden of suicide in Nepal. Some of the limitations include discrepancy in suicide reporting, lack of longitudinal follow up and qualitative studies and absence of studies on preventive aspects. Further, more research is warranted in this area not only at the assessment level but also at an intervention level. Several challenges such as poor distribution of mental health resources, social attitude towards mental illness and suicide in particular need to be addressed."

Fifteen short forms (SFs) and full-scale (FS) IQs were compared. The SFs included Dyads (SF1, SF2), Triads (SF3), Tetrads (SF4, SF5, SF6, SF7), Pentad (SF8), Six-subtest (SF9), Seven-subtests (SF10(a)(b), SF11(a)(b), SF12), and Nine-subtest (SF13). Correlations between SFIQs and FSIQ were all significant. Significant differences also were found in paired t-test between FSIQ and 5 SFIQs (SF2: t = −4.16, SF5: t = −7.06, SF7; t = 2.59, SF10(a): t = 2.56, SF12: t = −4.82; p < .05). On the point of clinical accuracy, two SFs led to an appropriate estimated IQ (SF11(a): 84.3%, SF13: 91.7%; within 95% confidence interval and 2 standard error of measurements of FSIQ). However, SF13 was considered to still have a long administration time. The present results suggest that SF11(a) could be the most useful to estimate IQ for Japanese speaking patients with mild neurocognitive disorder and dementia. SF11(a) consists of seven subtests of Similarities, Arithmetic, Digit Span, Information, Picture Completion, Digit Symbol-Coding, and Matrix Reasoning (Ryan & Ward, 1999), and the formula (Axelrod et al., 2001) should be adopted to convert scaled scores into estimated IQ scores."

The growing interest in community-based research on non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) reflects the high prevalence rates found among vulnerable adolescents and young adults. A significant concern in research with vulnerable populations, and on sensitive topics, is the development of an ethical framework that protects the needs and rights of the participants while responding to researchers’ goals and limitations and the broader clinical and public health concerns.
Aim
The aim of the present study was to review the ethical practices followed in community-based research on NSSI.
Method
A systematic review of literature was conducted, based on PRISMA guidelines, on community-based surveys in NSSI, published between 1995 and 2016. A total of 93 studies were included in the review.
Results
The results examine a range of ethical issues; the procedures for consent and assent for study participation, protection of confidentiality and the limits of confidentiality, assessment of imminent risk of suicide and subsequent processes, and debriefing measures. The interaction between the study characteristics and the reported ethical procedures has been examined, with a focus on participant age, study design (cross-sectional or longitudinal), survey modality (paper-based survey or online survey) and primary variable/s of interest (only NSSI or NSSI and suicidal ideation/behavior) under study. The review describes the typical ethical practices in community-based research on NSSI, identifies the gaps in the existing literature, and has implications for the formulation of best-practice guidelines."

The use of smokeless tobacco (SLT) is very common in India and leads to well established adverse health effects, particularly oral cancers.
Aim
To understand the perceptions of SLT users and health care providers regarding the prevalence of SLT in the community, awareness about its adverse effects and challenges for cessation
Methods
Key Informant (KI) interviews with SLT users; Focus group discussions (FGDs) with female and male tobacco users and health care providers
Results
KI perceptions among users and service providers were more or less similar regarding the extent of SLT use in the community. There was inadequate knowledge of the harm from SLT use, both among SLT users and health care providers. FGD’s revealed high positive expectancies from SLT use and low risk perception. Shift from one to the other form of tobacco and a very early age of initiation, particularly among women, was observed. There was a low demand for assistance to quit.
Conclusions
SLT cessation efforts in the country must take cognizance of user perspectives and focus on strategies for demand reduction in all populations, including adolescents. Health care providers need to be trained in SLT cessation."

keywords = "Depression, Suicide attempt, Prevalence, Primary care",
abstract = "Background
It is known that persons who die by suicide commonly visit a primary care physician (PCP) shortly before the fatal act.There is little information on history of suicide attempt in depressed patients who consult PCPs for non-mental health indications.This information is important because past history of suicide attempt is a known predictor of future suicide risk.
Objective
To estimate the prevalence of depression among outpatients in primary care and to determine the prevalence and determinants of past suicide attempt among them.
Method
This cross-sectional study was conducted in six primary care settings, both public and private, in Kerala, India. A psychiatrist evaluated adult outpatients (n=827), diagnosed depression using ICD-10 Diagnostic Criteria for Research, and elicited history of suicide attempt.
Results
Overall depression prevalence was 27.2% and was higher in women. Past suicide attempt was identified in 6.9% (95% CI, 5.17–8.63%) of all outpatients; higher in women (9.2%) than men (3.6%). Among the depressed, 21.3% had previously attempted suicide; while this figure was 1.5% in the non-depressed. The prevalence of current depression was 81% (severe depression, 61%) in patients reporting past suicide attempts. In univariate analyses, female gender, perceived financial stress, and being depressed were significantly associated with past suicide attempts. In multivariate analysis, current depression was the largest predictor of past suicide attempt (adjusted odds ratio, 14.3; 95% CI, 6.60–31.07).
Conclusion
Depression and suicide attempt are both common in primary care. Depression is the single most important predictor of suicide attempt."

To assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and examine the clinical correlates of MetS.
Methods
Sixty-seven patients with BD were evaluated for presence for MetS. The consensus definition was used to define MetS. The clinical variables were recorded on the basis of information provided by the patients, accompanying caregivers and review of treatment records. The symptoms severity of present depressive and manic episode was assessed by using Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) respectively.
Results
The prevalence of MetS was 53.7%. Patients with MetS were older than the patients with BD alone (P=0.001). Increased waist circumference was the most common abnormal parameter (74.6%) followed by low high density lipoprotein (HDL) (71.6%) and raised triglycerides (64.2%). High blood pressures were recorded in 35.8% with high fasting blood glucose levels were seen in 33.3%. MetS was associated with greater number of life time episodes (p=0.010), longer duration of illness (p=0.010), greater numbers of lifetime depressive episodes (p<0.001). Substance use (alcohol and nicotine) associated with significantly higher prevalence of high blood pressure among MetS patients (p<0.001) while abnormal triglyceride level shown associated with substance use (p=0.010). Age of the patients, number of lifetime depressive episodes and use of Olanzapine were found to predictive of the development of MetS.
Conclusions
Patients with BD have high prevalence of MetS and its presence correlates with clinical variables."

Resilience is the process by which adolescents are able to maintain or regain positive outcomes despite stress and negative emotional experiences. Assessing resilience is important to identify adolescentś strengths and vulnerabilities. There are currently no resilience instruments available for Iranian adolescents. This paper describes the translation and validation of Adolescent Resilience Questionnaire (ARQ) for use with Iranian adolescents.
Method
The ARQ was translated into Persian and back-translated. Proportional stratified sampling was used to recruit a representative sample of 523 adolescents aged 11–19 years from 38 public and private high schools in Tehran. Total scale and subscale reliability were examined using Cronbach alpha. Test-retest reliability was conducted with 38 adolescents who completed the ARQ twice with a two week interval in between and assessed using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC).
Findings
Cronbach alpha coefficients were equal to or greater than 0.70 for all scales, after the removal of one item in the Community scale. Test-retest reliability for the overall ARQ score was excellent (ICC=0.83, 95%CI, 0.76–0.93) and very good for individual subscales (ICC=0.70–0.79).
Conclusion
The present study provides evidence of good validity, reliability and test-retest reliability of the Persian ARQ for Iranian adolescents. Further testing, including construct validity, and testing across different contexts will strengthen the evidence. The instrument will have applications in resilience research, educational and clinic settings and could facilitate the development and evaluation of intervention programs to build resilience in Iranian adolescents."

There have not been many attempts to validate screening measures for common mental disorders (CMD) in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to examine the criterion validity of the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12) in a community-based study from Goa, India.
Method
Concurrent and convergent validity of the GHQ-12 were assessed against the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale (WHODAS) for CMD and functional status through the secondary analysis of a community cohort of men from Goa, India. Criterion validity of the GHQ-12 was determined using ROC analyses with the MINI case criterion as the gold standard. Concurrent validity was assessed against the gold standard of WHODAS functional disability and number of disability days.
Results
In a sample of men (n=773), the GHQ-12 showed high internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.82) and acceptable criterion validity (Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve being 0.71). It had adequate psychometric properties for the detection of CMD (sensitivity of 68.75%; specificity of 73.14%) with the optimal cut-off score for identification of CMD being 2.
Conclusion
In order to optimize the usefulness and validity of the GHQ-12, a low cut-off point for CMD may be beneficial in Goa, India. Further validation studies for the GHQ-12 should be conducted for continued validation of the test for use in the community."

The study was conducted from July 2013 to August 2015 at outpatient department of Psychiatry of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Bangladesh. Bangla MADRS scale development process started with the development of conceptional definition of each items of the original scale followed by forward, backward and committee translation. This translated Bangla MADRS was pretested and necessary correction was made for better understating and acceptance. Then its psychometric properties were assessed from consecutive randomly selected 111 depressed patients. The Bangla MADRS exhibited excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha=0.87), inter rater reliability and test retest reliability (Pearson coefficient r=0.77). To assess the concurrent validity the correlation between the findings of MADRS was evaluated with that of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) that revealed a significant correlation (r=0.73). Moreover, the Factor analysis showed 56% of the variance can be explained by apparent sadness and reported sadness. This Bangla MADRS can have a long and wide spread impact and implication in depression assessment, management and future research for Bangla speaking people."

There is a recent trend of increase in diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder in India. Till date, there are few retrospective and prospective Indian studies with limited sample sizes ranging from 16 to 94 children. With this background, we planned a retrospective chart review of all new cases of Autism Spectrum Disorder for a period of 1 year in our tertiary care child psychiatry centre.
Methodology
Objectives of this study were to compare the sociodemographic and clinical profile of children below and above 3 years of age and between those who were self-referred versus those referred by professionals.
Results
Out of a total of 1957 case records, 201 children (10.3%) were diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Male to female ratio was 4:1.2. Mean age of consultation was significantly higher in males. Seventy six percent had a comorbid disorder with Intellectual disability, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Epilepsy being the most common comorbidities. Most caregivers (92.5%) recognized symptoms by 3 years of age. Presenting complaint of poor social response was more prevalent in children <3 years and co-morbidities in children above 3 years. Presenting complaint of speech delay was more common in children who were referred by professionals when compared with those who were self-referred.
Discussion
There is a need to sensitize parents and professionals for early intervention and to standardize protocols for assessment and intervention."

Valid but efficient psychiatric assessment is essential for mental health development in Asian low and middle-income countries. This study’s objective was to assess the validity of Vietnamese versions of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in Vietnam.
Methods
Measures were completed by a community sample of 1314 parents of children 6–16 years old from 10 Vietnamese provinces, and by parents of 208 children recruited from 3 psychiatric facilities in Hanoi.
Results
Internal consistency was in the fair to excellent range for all CBCL scales (.76–.96) and for the SDQ Total Problems scale (.81); SDQ subscale internal consistency was in the poor to fair range (.31–.73). All CBCL and SDQ scales and most individual items significantly discriminated between referred and non-referred children, with referred children scoring in the more pathological direction; the CBCL had significantly larger referral effect sizes than the SDQ for all four pairs of comparable scales. At the item level, the largest referral status effect for the CBCL were #73 (Sexual Problems), #84 (Strange Behavior), and #91 (Talks about suicide), and for the SDQ they were #10 (Constantly fidgeting), #15 (Easily Distracted) and # 25 (Good Attention Span-reverse scored). Five CBCL (#2 Drinks alcohol; #99 Uses tobacco, #32 Has to be perfect; #53 Overeats; #56A Aches and pains) and one SDQ items (#23 Gets along better with adults than children) did not discriminate referral status, suggesting the influence of cultural values on clinical referrability (e.g., that Vietnamese parents may not see use of tobacco as an issue of concern, or related to health).
Conclusions
There is good support for the reliability and validity of the Vietnamese version of the CBCL, and for the SDQ Total Problems scale. Overall, the CBCL appears to be the stronger measure psychometrically, particularly if in-depth assessment is needed."

To evaluate the effectiveness of a structured teaching program (STP) on: a) improving knowledge of female hospital housekeeping personnel regarding harmful impact of tobacco chewing and how to quit, and b) fostering an unfavorable attitude toward tobacco chewing.
Methods
The STP focused on adverse health effects of tobacco chewing, myths and facts, and tobacco cessation. It was administered in regional language to female hospital housekeeping personnel (N=35) over three days. Post-assessments were conducted at 4 weeks following the last session of the STP.
Results
Current tobacco use was reported by 26% of the sample. Tobacco chewers (vs. non-chewers) were more likely to be significantly older, have elementary education, belong to nuclear family, have lesser knowledge regarding harmful effects, and have a more favorable attitude toward the practice of tobacco chewing. At the end of 4 weeks following the STP, participants significantly improved their knowledge regarding the harmful health impact of tobacco chewing and how to quit (p=0.001), and showed a significantly less favorable attitude toward tobacco chewing (p=0.001). Change in participants’ knowledge scores was found to be negatively correlated with change in attitude scores, implying that increase in knowledge was associated with less favorable attitude toward tobacco chewing (r=−0.427, p=0.011).
Conclusion
Findings provide preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of health education on harmful impact of tobacco chewing and how to quit, delivered through a STP, in improving knowledge and fostering an unfavorable attitude toward tobacco chewing, among female hospital housekeeping personnel."

Morningness–eveningness preference is commonly measured by questionnaires such as the Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM). The purpose of this study is to assess the Persian translation of the CSM and explore its psychometric properties.
Method
Participants consisted of 288 students at the University of Bojnord, Iran. Of the participants selected, 47.6% were female, 52.4% were male, and all were aged between 18 and 24 (20.09±1.32). Participants were selected using the stratified random sampling method. The scale was translated into Persian using the parallel translation method. SPSS-22 and AMOS-22 were used for analyses.
Results
Mean CSM scores were 31.43±6.32 in a range of 14–50. Internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach’s α, was 0.790, which fits well with previous studies undertaken in many countries. The factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure based on parallel analysis: one factor was labeled as “morning affect” and the other as “self-assessment/activity planning.” Also, the confirmatory factor analysis supported the two-factor model fit. Construct validity was also evaluated by the MEQ with the results showing that correlations were comparable to other studies (r=0.76). Results did not show any significant correlation between age (r=0.041; P=0.487) and the CSM scores. According to the results of the t-test, women and men were not significantly different in terms of the CSM scores (t=-0.264; P=0.792).
Conclusions
The Persian version of the CSM is freely available and can be adopted for behavioral research related to sleep and circadian function and also applied to other Persian-speaking populations."

The relationship of psychological recovery with perceived social support was also the focus of inquiry. The study utilized a cross sectional survey design with a sample of 90 participants diagnosed with severe and common mental illness who had been seeking outpatient psychiatric follow up services. The data was collected with the help of both clinician rated and self-rated measures. The study findings suggested that symptomatic, functional and psychological recovery are significantly correlated but not completely overlapping constructs. Nearly 40% of the sampled participants were at the lower stages of psychological recovery, despite the fact that a majority of them were rated by clinicians as having mild or lower severity of symptoms. With respect to socio-demographic variables, a significant association was found between higher levels of education and psychological recovery. The participants with common mental illness were significantly lower on self-reported improvement and higher on moratorium subscale of psychological recovery (as compared to those with severe mental illness), indicating their struggle in dealing with a sense of loss and despair. Findings also suggested that higher levels of overall perceived social support is likely to facilitate psychological recovery."

To study the prevalence, typology and specified demographic and clinical correlates of SD among female patients seeking treatment for alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS).
Materials and methods
40 women with ADS and 40 matched healthy controls (HC) were assessed for SD using a Sexual Dysfunction Checklist (SDC) and Arizona Sexual Experience Questionnaire (ASEX).
Results
In women with ADS, 55% had one or more SD as per ASEX, most common being low sexual desire (55%) followed by inability to reach orgasm (52.5%), and dissatisfaction with orgasm (50%). As per SDC, low sexual desire (55%), anorgasmia (52.5%) and dissatisfaction with own sexual function (45%) were the most common SD noted. In comparison with HC, the prevalence of SD in patients with ADS was significantly higher in all domains. Low educational qualification, initiation of alcohol at earlier age, longer duration of alcohol consumption and dependence and sever dependence appeared to be the most significant predictors of developing SD.
Conclusion
SD rates are higher among patients with ADS compared to HC and all domains of sexual functioning are affected. Clinicians need to routinely assess sexual functioning and plan for gender sensitive, multidimensional treatment."

However, there is as yet no validation of CAPE in non-Western languages. Here, we validated a Chinese translation of CAPE (“CAPE-C”) in a young Chinese community sample. Factor analyses were employed in a sample of 660 individuals (mean age=18.63) to identify a culturally-sensitive factor structure for CAPE-C (Study 1). Since confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) suggested that CAPE-C did not follow the original factor structure, exploratory factor analysis and follow-up CFA were employed to establish an alternative structure, resulting in a 15-item “CAPE-C15” which retained a three-factor structure tapping positive, negative and depressive symptoms. To demonstrate the specificity of CAPE-C15 as a measure of PP, we conducted regression analyses to examine associations between CAPE-C15 dimensions and other measures of psychotic and depressive symptoms (Study 2). Results confirmed that CAPE-C15 dimensions showed specific associations with relevant symptom dimensions of other measures, but not with irrelevant ones. Finally, to aid interpretation of CAPE-C15 scores, Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis was conducted to establish a cut-off score that could indicate test-takers’ need for clinical attention (Study 3). We found that a cut-off score of 8.18 on CAPE-C15 positive and negative symptom frequency and distress scores distinguished individuals whose PP was within normal ranges from those at psychometric high-risk (sensitivity: 78.6%; specificity: 77.7%). CAPE-C15 will likely prove relevant to researchers and healthcare providers who serve Chinese-speaking adolescents and young adults."

To examine the addiction severity, comorbid psychiatric disorder and their temporal relationship among women seeking treatment for Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs).
Materials and methods
The sample comprised of 35 women with AUDs, with or without psychiatric disorders, recruited from the outpatient and inpatient settings of a tertiary-care hospital. Their mean age was 38.51 years (S.D=7.42). Patients were assessed using Clinical Data Sheet (CDS), Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Personality disorders (SCIDII), Addiction Severity Index (ASI)-Alcohol subscale and Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND).
Results
Findings of the study indicated that on average patients initiated alcohol use in their early twenties and developed dependence by the age of 29.66 years (S.D=7.60). The average duration of alcohol dependence was less than a decade before seeking treatment. The mean composite score on ASI was 0.71 (S.D=0.18) and on FTND was 5.16 (S.D=2.59), indicating a high level of alcohol and moderate level of nicotine dependence respectively. On MINI, 57.14% of the patients met the criteria for co-occurring Axis I psychiatric disorders such as major depression disorder and dysthymia. In the majority of the cases, comorbid Axis I disorders were secondary to AUDs. On SCID-II, 17% met the criteria for borderline personality disorder.
Conclusion
Examining and understanding the substance use and clinical profile of patients with AUDs are crucial for planning intensity, settings and focus of treatment for women with AUDs."

Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is a frequent and distressing consequence of stroke, and can be both acute and long lasting. We aimed to investigate multidimensional aspects of acute PSF and to determine the clinical factors relevant to acute PSF.
Methods
We collected data of 101 patients admitted to the hospital for acute stroke. PSF was assessed using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory within 2 weeks of stroke. Measures included Mini-Mental State Examination, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Functional Independence Measure. Stroke character, lesion location, and clinical variables that potentially influence PSF were also collected.
Results
The prevalence of pathological fatigue is 56.4% within 2 weeks of stroke. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that anxiety was the only predictor for presence of PSF (OR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.13–1.53, P<0.001). Multivariate stepwise regression analysis showed anxiety, right lesion side, thalamus, and/or brainstem were independently associated with general fatigue, right lesion side, depression, diabetes mellitus, and anxiety with physical fatigue, depression with reduced activity, depression, and BMI with reduced motivation, depression, and diabetes mellitus with mental fatigue.
Conclusions
PSF was highly prevalent in the acute phase, and specific factors including lesion location (right side lesion, thalamic and brainstem lesion), anxiety, and depression were independently associated with multidimensional aspects of PSF. Further study is needed to elucidate how specific structural lesions and anxiety symptoms relate to the development of early fatigue following stroke."

Methods
A total of 247 women with symptoms of depression in Karachi, Pakistan were assigned randomly to either LTP Plus or routine care (Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT00835016). Symptoms of maternal depression were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 3 and 6 months after baseline.
Results
At 3 months, there was a significant reduction in the EPDS scores in the intervention group compared to the routine group (adjusted mean difference [AMD] −3.65, 95% CI −6.14 to −1.15, p <0.004). This effect was sustained at 6 months (AMD −2.62, 95% CI −4.43 to −0.81, p<0.005). These women also reported less parental distress and disability. There was also a significant improvement in maternal knowledge about child development at 6 months.

Caregiver burden in dementia is an important area of research. Providing care for a relative can be a potent source of chronic stress and can have deleterious consequences for both the physical and emotional health of caregivers. This study aims to evaluate the burden of care in caregivers of patients with Alzheimer-type dementia and compare it with elderly psychosis; and to also study the factors that influence burden of care in Alzheimer’s dementia.
Methods
Thirty-two caregiver-patient dyads of Alzheimer-type dementia were compared with thirty-two caregiver-patient dyads of psychosis. Cognitive assessment, abilities to perform activities of daily living and severity of dementia was assessed in the patients. Zarit Burden Interview was used to study the caregiver burden in both groups.
Results
The mean burden score in dementia caregivers was high at 47.7, whereas the mean burden score for elderly psychosis caregivers was lesser at 33.6, and this difference in mean burden scores was found to be statistically significant. Spouses had the highest mean burden scores of 53.48. Caregiver burden in dementia was positively correlated with cognitive impairment and inability to carry out ADLs. Presence of psychological distress in caregivers was also an indicator for greater caregiver burden in dementia.
Conclusion
The study revealed that dementia carries a greater caregiver burden when compared with elderly patients with psychosis. Innovative interventions are needed to remove burden from caregiving, making it a meaningful practice integral to the Indian society."

A battery of self-report questionnaires was administered for tapping IU, worry, depression and anxiety symptoms. Results from indirect effects analyses revealed that even though IU, worry, depression, and anxiety symptoms correlated moderately with each other, worry carried a substantial proportion of variance in predicting symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, the relative effect was more pronounced for anxiety compared to depression symptoms. The results from hierarchical analyses supported the moderator role of worry. More specifically, a high level of worry enhanced the association between IU and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Given the potential for worry as a mechanism, and/or moderator between IU and symptoms of depression and anxiety, adults with a tendency to use this negative repetitive thought process (e.g. worry) may be at higher risk to develop psychological symptoms."

Present study aimed at determining lipid profiles in acutely symptomatic drug-naïve/drug-free patients of schizophrenia, comparing them with healthy controls and exploring relationships between various lipid fractions, aggression, suicidality and impulsivity in this population.
Materials and methods
This was a cross-sectional hospital-based study, comparing patients with schizophrenia (M=46, F=14; mean age 32.40±6.6 years; 48 drug-free for 10.50±9.2 weeks) with 60 age-sex matched healthy controls. Upon recruitment, fasting venous blood samples of all subjects were analysed for total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL and TG levels, and patients were rated on PANSS for symptom severity, Modified Overt Aggression Scale for aggression, Impulsivity Rating Scale for impulsivity and Scale for Suicide Ideation for suicidality.
Results
The socio-demographic characteristics of the patients were comparable to controls. In patients, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL levels were found to be significantly lower (p<0.01) than the control group. When explored further in patients, lower total cholesterol and LDL levels showed significant negative correlations with scores on impulsivity (p<0.01) and suicidality (p<0.05); and TG level showed a negative correlation with impulsivity (p<0.05).
Conclusions
This study adds to a growing literature on a complex relationship between lipid fractions and impulsivity, suicidality and aggression in schizophrenia; providing interesting insights into the biochemical basis of human behaviour and confirming these in a developing-world population. The implications are many, including a need to review judiciously the promotion of weight loss and cholesterol reduction programmes in constitutionally vulnerable population, at least during their acutely-symptomatic states."

Five different clustering algorithms (FCM, K-means, Ward, Ward+K-means and Complete) applied on YBOCS symptoms of 216 patients with OCD. Data studied as four different sets including item-level raw data, item-based factor scores, category-level raw data and category-based factor scores and clustering results for 2 to 6 cluster solutions evaluated by four clustering indices (Davies-Bouldin, Calinski-Harabasz, Silhouettes and Dunn indices). Two-cluster solution was detected as the most appropriate model for item and category-based clustering analyses of YBOCS checklist symptoms. Patients in each cluster were characterized based on their clinical and demographic properties and results showed that they had similar patterns of symptoms but in different severities. Heterogenity of OCD based on the YBOCS-symptoms has been challenged as OCD patients were classified based on their symptom severity not their symptom patterns. More investigations need to find appropriate measures explaining OCD heterogeneity with clinical importance."

The Cohen Perceived Stress Scale is being used widely in various countries. The present study evaluated the validity and reliability of the Cohen 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) in assessing tension headache, migraine, and stress-related diseases in Iran.
Methods
This study is a methodological and cross-sectional descriptive investigation of 100 patients with chronic headache admitted to the pain clinic of Baqiyatallah Educational and Therapeutic Center. Convenience sampling was used for subject selection. PSS psychometric properties were evaluated in two stages. First, the standard scale was translated. Then, the face validity, content, and construct of the translated version were determined.
Results
The average age of participants was 38 years with a standard deviation (SD) of 13.2. As for stress levels, 12% were within the normal range, 36% had an intermediate level, and 52% had a high level of stress. The face validity and scale content were remarkable, and the KMO coefficient was 0.82. Bartlett’s test yielded 0.327 which was statistically significant (p<0.0001) representing the quality of the sample. In factor analysis of the scale, the two elements of “coping” and “distress” were determined. A Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient of 0.72 was obtained. This confirmed the remarkable internal consistency and stability of the scale through repeated measure tests (0.93).
Conclusion
The Persian PSS-10 has good internal consistency and reliability. The availability of a validated Persian PSS-10 would indicate a link between stress and chronic headache."

abstract = "Purpose
A systematic review and meta-analysis of all relevant randomized controlled trials was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vilazodone in the acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
Methods
The literature was searched through all relevant databases in order to identify clinical trials on the use of vilazodone in the treatment of GAD. Once the trials were identified, data was extracted and analyzed using Revman5.3 and open meta-analyst. Assessment of continuous outcomes relied upon standardized mean difference, while binary outcomes were evaluated via relative risk, absolute risk reduction and NNT/NNH.
Results
A total of 3 well-designed randomized controlled trials with a duration of 10 weeks were conducted, with a total of 844 (intent to treat population) randomized to vilazodone (20–40mg, mean dose=31.42mg) and 618 to placebo. The study drug was significantly superior (p<0.001) to placebo in continuous primary outcome measures (HAMA reduction at week 8, CGI-S reduction at week 8 and CGI-I score at week 8). Binary outcome measures however are not as promising, probably reflecting a small effect size [NNT=10 (6.67, 21.28) for induction of response according to the HAMA scale and NNT=12 (7.58, 34.48) for the CGI-I scale], although statistical significance (p<0.01) was attained for both. The study drug was significantly (p<0.001) more likely than placebo to induce adverse effects and to be discontinued due to adverse effects NNH=14 (10.31, 22.22), most common of which were nausea and diarrhea.
Discussion
Vilazodone was superior to placebo in the short term treatment of GAD. However, due to the small effect size and high incidence of adverse events, the utility of vilazodone in the treatment of GAD remains unclear. Likelihood to be helped (HAMA response) or harmed (discontinuation due to adverse events) was inconclusive [1.4 (0.48, 3.33)], demonstrating a need for further trials and direct comparisons of vilazodone to the standard treatments for the disorder. Thus vilazodone cannot be recommended yet as a first line agent.
Conclusion and limitations
Vilazodone is an effective treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, though further trials are required for a more adequate comparison with established treatments, as well as long term maintenance studies to determine the validity of claims regarding the absence of sexual side effects."

This cross-sectional study was conducted on 291 students (121 male and 170 female) in the 14–17year old age group, grades IX and XI. The students were recruited from private, public, co-ed and single sex schools. Along with a Structured Questionnaire, the Mental Health Inventory was administered. We sought to investigate as to whether there would be differences in mental health status of adolescents based on age, class, gender and other demographic variables. There were significant age differences with respect to global mental health, psychological distress, anxiety and loss of behavioural/emotional control. Family type-wise significant differences in global mental health, life satisfaction and loss of behavioural/emotional control were also found. Significant differences were observed with respect to global mental health, psychological well-being, positive effects, psychological distress and depression across socio-economic groups. Number of siblings also accounted for differences in anxiety and emotional ties. However, no significant gender differences were observed across mental health sub-scales. Results suggest the need for promotion of mental health awareness and intervention programs for adolescents, their parents and teachers. There is also a need for advocacy in children and adolescent rights regarding welfare, well-being and protection from violence. The objective is to enhance psychological well-being and reduce psychological distress in students across different social strata."

The objective of this study was to examine whether mHealth approaches that leverage mobile phones for remote mental health treatment may be viable alternatives. We surveyed 272 Palestinian adults in urban, rural, and refugee camp settings. Most participants (93.4%) reported owning mobile phones. The penetration of mobile devices was high across all study sites. Males and females did not differ in their access to this resource. Among mobile phone owners, 79.9% had smartphones, 32.2% had basic mobile phones, and 12.2% owned both. Respondents reported having reliable access to electricity (99.6%) and Wi-Fi (80.9%). Almost all mobile phone owners (99.6%) reported using social media such as Facebook, WhatsApp, or Twitter. When asked to estimate the prevalence of mental health problems in the region, 61.4% of participants reported that over half of the people in their communities struggled with depression, posttraumatic stress, or auditory hallucinations. Most participants indicated that they would personally be interested in mHealth for Mental Health options such as bi-directional texting with clinicians (68.8%), smartphone applications (66.5%), unidirectional support texts (64.7%), or web-based interventions (64.0%). Given the Palestinian populations’ broad access to technology and technological infrastructure, need for care, and openness to engage in mobile interventions, mHealth should be considered a promising strategy for mental health services in the West Bank."

This study aimed to compare the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) among inpatients with depressive disorders and matched healthy controls.
Method
One hundred fifty eight patients with depressive disorders and 52 age and gender matched healthy controls were assessed for the prevalence of MS using Common Criteria for MS.
Results
Prevalence of Metabolic syndrome among inpatients with depressive disorders was 44.3%, which was significantly higher than the healthy control group (17.3%). Increased waist circumference was the most common abnormality in both the groups. Prevalence of MS among patients with recurrent depression disorder (60.3%) was almost double that seen among those with first episode depression (32.6%). Compared to healthy controls, significantly greater proportion of patients with depressive disorders had increased blood pressure, abnormal fasting blood sugar, and HDL levels. Besides the prevalence of MS in 44.3% of patients with depressive disorders, another 46% of patients fulfilled one or two criteria of MS. Significant predictors of MS were being married, obese, greater age, higher weight, higher body mass index, and multiple episodes of depression.
Conclusions
Nearly two-fifth of depressed patients have MS and another two-fifth of patients had one or two abnormalities in the MS criteria. The prevalence of MS among patients with depressive disorders is significantly higher than the healthy controls. Hence, patients with depressive disorders should be regularly evaluated for the presence of MS and other cardiovascular risk factors and appropriate management strategies must be instituted at the earliest."

The present study was conducted to examine the hypothesis based on our previous studies, that the multiple diagnoses of comorbid anxiety disorders (ADs) and higher interpersonal sensitivity predict treatment-resistant depression (TRD).
Methods
The participants were 199 consecutive outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD), who were comprehensively diagnosed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). TRD was defined as the failure to achieve remission with two or more adequate antidepressant trials. Using multiple logistic regression, the clinical features including the number of comorbid ADs and the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure (IPSM) score of the TRD group (N=31) were compared with those of the remission group (N=123).
Results
Comorbid ADs (odds ratio (OR), 4.5), higher IPSM score (OR, 4.1), suicidal risk (OR, 3.9), and non-melancholic features (OR, 3.3) were identified as the most discriminative variables associated with TRD. All the participants with two or more comorbid ADs (N=12) belonged to the TRD group.
Conclusion
The results showed that the multiple diagnoses of comorbid ADs and higher interpersonal sensitivity were associated with TRD, suggesting that considering the concept of MDD with “anxious distress,” which appears in DSM-5, may be useful for managing TRD."

Using the search term ‘depression’, 278 apps were identified in the first step and these spanned a wide range of categories. Information on coping with depression and stand alone screening tools formed the two largest types of free apps. Features of interactive self-care apps (N = 33) were reviewed further and this exercise showed that less than 10% of the apps incorporated explicit delineation of their scope or initial screening for suitability. Guidance regarding managing suicidal crisis were incorporated in only about 12% of the interactive apps. Slightly more than one third of these apps included content aimed at encouraging professional help seeking when needed or an explicit mention of their theoretical or empirical basis. Monitoring moods, thoughts and behaviors were the commonest therapeutic strategies incorporated in these apps, in addition, to a wide range of other strategies such as behavioral activation, identifying and correcting cognitive errors, mindfulness exercises, cultivation of gratitude, and medication management. The challenges for a potential user of these apps are discussed and ways to address the same are highlighted."

Compulsory admissions are against the patient’s will and are presumably due to diverse reasons. There has been a rise in compulsory admissions world over. The objective of the study was to determine the risk factors for compulsory admissions in a state psychiatric hospital.
Methods
A case control study was conducted at the state psychiatric hospital, Trivandrum, Kerala. Cases were involuntary non-legal admissions while controls were voluntary admissions. Putative risk factors studied included social support, severity of psychopathology etc., in addition to the socio-demographic variables.
Results
Risk factors for compulsory admissions were higher age, 30–49 years, OR=1.98, 95% CI [1.03–3.81]; >50years, OR=2.2, 95% CI [1.03–4.72], being from an urban locale,OR=1.99, 95% CI [1.13–3.52], living in joint & extended families OR=2.12, 95% CI [1.3–3.4], homelessness OR=2.24, 95% CI [1.32–3.79] and poor social support, OR=4.45 [2.53–7.81]. The type of illness, its duration, diagnosis, or symptom severity were not significantly related to compulsory admissions, but past compulsory admissions OR=5.36, 95% CI [2.09–13.75], poor functioning OR=2.54, 95% CI [1.31–4.91] and poor compliance to medication OR=1.78, 95% CI [1.05–3.01] were associated with compulsory admission. Poor social support, past involuntary admissions and poor functional status retained their association after multivariate analysis.
Conclusions
By addressing the modifiable factors like poor social support, poor functional status, and poor compliance to medication, compulsory admissions could be prevented. Since it is found that compulsory admissions are likely to repeat, such patients form a high risk group requiring specific interventions."

The advantages of fNIRS have made it to be frequently used as a research tool by medical community in different settings. In fNIRS the property of haemoglobin to absorb near infrared light is used to measure brain activity. It provides the indirect measurement of the neuronal activity in the areas of interest. The advantage of fNIRS being less restrictive has made it to be used more commonly in the research of psychiatric disorders in general, schizophrenia in particular. The fNIRS studies on patients with schizophrenia have shown haemodynamic hypo activation primarily in the prefrontal cortex during various cognitive tasks. In this review, initially we have briefly explained the basic principles of fNIRS followed by detailed review of fNIRS findings in patients with schizophrenia."

Consideration of psychiatric and psychosocial factors is important for the management and prevention of dermatologic disorders. Dermatology patients suffer commonly from psychiatric comorbidity.
Aim
To study pattern and prevalence of psychiatric disorders among patient attending dermatology OPD.
Methods
The study was carried out in Psychiatry department of NIMS Medical College, Jaipur, Rajasthan, a north State of India. The sample was taken from Dermatology department of Medical College. All the participants were diagnosed/confirmed cases of skin diseases. Socio-demographic data was collected. Patients scoring more than 12 on GHQ were examined for presence of psychiatric illness. Clinical interview & Mental Status Examination (MSE) of these patients was carried out to ascertain diagnosis according to ICD-10.
Findings
As per ICD-10 diagnosis 34.2% of total sample were diagnosed with definite Psychiatric comorbidity. Maximum number of cases were of Depression 36.32% (N=146) followed by Anxiety disorder 18.41% (74) and 7.96% (N=32) with Somatoform disorder. Obsessive compulsive disorder was diagnosed in 6.47% (N=26) followed by Adjustment disorder 4.98% (N=20) and Alcohol dependence syndrome 4.98% (N=20). Minimum number of cases belonged to Schizophrenia 2.99% (N=12) and Bipolar Affective Disorder 2.99% (N=12). No diagnosis was found in 14.93% (N=60).
Conclusion
Significant psychiatric comorbidity exists in patients of dermatology. Biopsychosocial approach to patients with skin disease should be sought by liaison between psychiatrist and dermatologist."

The mental health burden from fear of future terrorism has not been given much research attention compared to the immediate mental distress such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Such neglected ongoing mental health morbidity associated with threats of terrorism had been described as pre-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSS).
Objective
The study highlighted this phenomenon (PTSS) in Nigeria by examining the catastrophic burden of the fear of future terrorism and associated psychiatric burden among adult population in Kaduna city.
Method
Participants were students and staff of Kaduna State University (KASU), Kaduna Polytechnic, and students awaiting admission into Kaduna State University. They responded to the following instruments after obtaining their informed consents: a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Terrorism Catastrophising Scale (TCS), and the depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) portion of Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).
Results
The TCS showed that 78.8% of the participants had from moderate to severe clinical distress on fear of terrorism. The TCS has a Cronbach's alpha of 0.721 and also had significant moderate correlation with depression (r=0.278; p<0.01) and GAD (r=0.201; p<0.01) scales of MINI.
Conclusion
The study illustrated that the mental health burden from the fear of terrorism was high and this was relatively related to depression and GAD. This highlighted the need for ongoing monitoring and called for their effective prevention from the identified underlying cognitive mechanisms."

The present study classified patients with Alzheimer’s disease into groups with mild and moderate dementia to examine the gender differences in BPSD in each group. We divided a total of 125 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease according to the criteria of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) into groups with mild and moderate dementia. Then we examined whether the groups showed differences in memory functions, activities of daily living, and BPSD depending on gender. Our results showed a significant gender difference in Depression/Dysphoria symptoms (BPSD) among the patients in the mild dementia group (t=−2.344, p<0.05), but there was no significant gender difference among the patients in the moderate dementia group. For both the mild and moderate dementia groups, there were no significant gender differences in memory functions and activities of daily living. The results of this study indicated that female patients with mild dementia are more vulnerable to depression than male patients. Future studies should more continuously examine a variety of factors that affect BPSD depending on the severity of Alzheimer’s disease."

Current treatment strategies for depressive disorders have limited efficacy, leaving many patients unimproved or with significant residual symptoms. The development of additional treatments represent a significant unmet need for providers. Several lines of evidence suggest that the opioid system may be involved in regulation of mood and incentives salience. Intervention based on modifying central opioid receptors may represent a novel approach to treatment of depressive disorders among those unresponsive to accepted treatments.
Data sources
We searched the English language literature using keywords: Buprenorphine AND Major Depression; Buprenorphine AND Bipolar Depression; Buprenorphine AND Affective Disorders.
Results
Use of low dose buprenorphine as augmentation of pharmacotherapy for depression has shown promise in several reported studies. Effect size of available randomized controlled studies is comparable if not greater than most accepted augmentation strategies.
Conclusion
Review of available literature on the use of buprenorphine in individuals with treatment resistant depression demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of depressive disorders. Further prospective randomized controlled trials should be undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of buprenorphine as an adjunct for depression refractory to current pharmacotherapies."

This article focuses on a summary of these findings in relation to key stakeholders in the care of the elderly including mental health professionals, family caregivers, and public health officials. We broadly conclude that there exists a general shallow level of understanding of what constitutes pathological aging (i.e. dementia) across all stakeholders, and this creates a cascade of effects including delays in treatment seeking and barriers in conducting and having accurate demographic studies. Moreover, addressing this knowledge gap can help enhance communication between these three stakeholders in the hopes of the following: (a) increased education and awareness, (b) faster seeking of care, and (c) earlier diagnoses leading to better opportunities to collect accurate demographics of those suffering from dementia-related disorders."

The SCoRS has shown good reliability, validity, and sensitivity to cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, with the advantage of brief administration and scoring time. The present study aimed to test the concurrent validity of the Persian version of the SCoRS. A group of 35 patients with schizophrenia and a group of 35 healthy controls received the Persian-SCoRS in the first session, and a standardized performance-based cognitive battery, the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), in the second session.Our results indicated that the Persian version of the SCoRS was sensitive to cognitive impairment in the patients. The Persian SCoRS global rating was significantly associated with the composite score generated from the Persian version of the BACS and predicted functional outcomes as measured by Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHO QOL). A Persian version of the SCoRS, an interview based measure of cognition that included informants, is related to cognitive performance and global functioning."

We focused on the diagnostic distinction between primary psychosis with concomitant drug abuse and drug induced psychosis, to observe whether the diagnoses are stable over time and whether the clinical course significantly differs. The study examined 25 primary psychotic disorder with comorbid drug abuse and 23 drug-induced psychotic disorder patients. Diagnostic and psychopathological assessments were made at baseline and at follow-up. Mean follow-up period was 4.96 years. Patients with comorbid Drug Abuse exhibited higher scores in the item Unusual Content of Thought at baseline than drug-induced psychotic disorder patients: 5.48 vs 4.39 while the two patients groups did not differ in any of the BPRS items evaluated at follow-up. The primary psychosis with comorbid drug abuse and the substance induced psychosis groups were similar regarding diagnostic stability, and a diagnosis of schizophrenia at follow-up occurred similarly. There was no evidence that Drug Induced psychotic patients’ symptoms tend to improve more after cessation of drug abuse. An earlier age of onset was found in primary psychotic patients, particularly for patients diagnosed as affected by schizophrenia at follow up. These results might reflect the uncertainty of the distinction between Primary and Drug Induced Psychosis and the difficulties in applying the DSM IV-TR criteria for diagnosing comorbid drug use disorders and psychotic disorders."

Several studies showed that DAT1 polymorphism closed related with ADHD although the results were not consistently found. Studies in China, South Korea, Japan revealed that 10-repeat allele gave a risk for ADHD. Based on that understanding, this study tried to identify whether the similar polymorphism of DAT1 was also apparent in Indonesian children with ADHD.
Method
This was a case – control study. Case was 50 Indonesian origin children with ADHD and without any other mental disorders and metal retardation. Control is Indonesian origin children without ADHD, other mental disorders and mental retardation. ADHD diagnosis was taken after doing the psychiatric interview and observation based on the DSM-IV TR diagnostic criteria for ADHD at the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Out-patient Clinic, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital – Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia. DNA isolation, DNA purity and concentration were measured. PCR was done by using a primer based on Homo sapiens solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter), member 3 (SLC6A3), RefSeq Gene on chromosome 5 with accession number NG_015885.1. To identify the serial of repeated allele, we used the sequencing technique.
Results
There were 47 children with ADHD and 48 children without ADHD that involved in the final analysis. The mean of age amongst ADHD group was 9.18 (2.42) and 8.10 (2.46) years old in non-ADHD group. The 10-repeated allele of DAT1 was the highest proportion in both.
Conclusion
This finding was apparently similar with other studies on DAT1 polymorphism across Asian."

A reliable plasma biomarker in differentiating between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Vascular dementia (VaD) is the need of the hour, in most memory clinics. Even though there is no disease modifying treatment, it is important to know the type of dementia for both symptomatic treatment and prognostication.
Methods
Neuropsychological assessment, MRI brain, FDG-PET brain and CSF biomarkers of AD (Aβ42 and total tau) were used for establishing the diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), AD or VaD.
Results
68 diagnosed patients of AD/MCI/VaD were included. FDG PET brain, plasma fibrinogen, d dimer, IL6 and CRP were done in all 68 patients while 48 patients underwent CSF biomarker analysis. Sixteen patients had MCI, of which 11 were MCI-AD and 5 were MCI-VaSC. There were 41 patients with AD (Mild AD-9, Mod AD-23, Severe AD-9) and 11 patients with VaD. Alzheimer group (MCI-AD and AD) and Vascular group (MCI VaSC & VaD) consisted of 52 and 16 patients respectively. Alzheimer and Vascular groups did not exhibit significant difference in IL6 and CRP levels. Plasma fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in VaD and vascular group as compared to Alzheimer group. But MCI-VaSC was not significantly different from MCI-AD. Plasma d dimer levels were significantly higher in all vascular subgroups compared to Alzheimer subgroups except between MCI-VaSC and MCI-AD.
Conclusion
Hemostatic biomarkers were higher in Vascular group compared to Alzheimer group whereas there was no difference in inflammatory biomarkers. But the sensitivity and specificity of fibrinogen and d-dimer were not high enough for routine clinical use. Further studies in a larger sample are required to confirm these results."

To study the association of apolipoprotein E (APOE), Clusterin (CLU) and phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) polymorphisms in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) subjects compared to cognitively normal control subjects in an Indian population.
Methods
The study subjects included persons with AD (N=243) and age group matched healthy controls (N=164). All the AD subjects were evaluated using a standard protocol. DNA was isolated from whole blood. APOE (rs7412, rs429358), CLU (rs11136000) and PICALM (rs3851179) were genotyped. General linear model was used to test the association between the individual risk genotypes and AD.
Results
The presence of APOE ε4 was associated with AD after adjusting for age and gender (p<0.0001). There was no association observed with AD at both rs11136000 CLU (p=0.25) and rs3851179 PICALM (p=0.54).
Conclusion
Our results confirmed a significant association of APOE ε4 carrier status with AD. No association was observed for CLU and PICALM with AD. This might be due to a different genetic background. There are no previous reports of these polymorphisms in an Indian cohort. Future Indian AD studies should investigate additional SNPs in a larger sample size in these genes."

Negative symptoms impair outcomes on occupational functioning, social interaction and interpersonal relationships in patients with schizophrenia. Past researchers have reported reduced alpha and increased theta and delta spectral powers on quantitative EEG recordings in those with prominent negative symptoms.
Aim
Present analysis aimed at exploring the relationships between lower-frequency EEG powers and negative symptoms, in schizophrenia, over a period of naturalistic antipsychotic treatment.
Method
Fifteen right-handed drug-free/drug-naïve schizophrenia patients (N=15;M=12,F=3) were recruited and assessed on PANSS. Spontaneous 192-channel resting-state EEG was recorded at baseline, and PANSS rating was repeated at 4 weeks. Baseline EEGs of patients were compared to 15 age-sex-handedness matched controls.
Results
Non-significant differences emerged between patient and controls in terms of socio-demographic characteristics. Over left frontal and left temporal regions, baseline ratio of alpha/theta power (bATR) was significantly lower (p<0.001) in patients, correlated negatively with baseline PANSS negative score (PNS) (p<0.05); and over 4-weeks of antipsychotic treatment, left temporal bATR correlated positively with relative improvements in PNS.
Conclusion
Reduced alpha power over frontal regions might imply altered arousal and/or impaired attentional process, while abnormal theta range oscillations may relate to impairments in working memory via their influences on theta-gamma coupling. Our findings suggest left-predominant deficiencies in these processes might mediate negative symptoms. Further, since ATR might reflect integrity of certain cognitive processes, those with a higher bATR might possess better cognitive resource at baseline and therefore experience greater improvement in negative symptoms with antipsychotic treatments, at least during the first 4 weeks."

Each participant filled in a well-structured pre-coded questionnaire regarding demographic data, including a sleep questionnaire; cognitive function was assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Battery (CANTAB). The cognitive function outcome variables were response times in the attention-switching task (AST) and the percentage of correct answers in the pattern recognition memory (PRM) task.
Results
There were significant differences in measures of AST-latency (p=0.005), AST-congruent (p=0.012), and AST-incongruent (p=0.009), while no significant difference was found in the PRM task score (p=0.336) within gender groups. There was a significant correlation between sleep and AST switching cost (0.277, p=0.006) and sleep and AST latency (0.188, p=0.063) across the group.

Observations suggest that rather than overestimating its frequency, we are more likely to underestimate it (Pope et al., 1986). It is a rare but potentially fatal disorder characterized by four principal symptoms. These are mental status changes, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and autonomic dysfunction. The diagnosis of NMS often presents a challenge because several medical conditions generate similar symptoms. Although less common now than in the past, thanks to greater awareness, it remains a risk in susceptible patients receiving conventional or atypical neuroleptics. Reducing the risk factors, early recognition of suspected cases, and prompt management can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality of this dangerous condition.

The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is a 10-item screening questionnaire used to detect alcohol use disorders. The AUDIT has been validated in only two studies in India and although it has been previously used in Goa, India, it has yet to be validated in that setting. In this paper, we aim to report data on the validity of the AUDIT for the screening of AUDs among men in Goa, India.
Methods
Concurrent and convergent validity of the AUDIT were assessed against the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Scale (WHODAS) for alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, and functional status respectively through the secondary analysis of data from a community cohort of men from Goa, India.
Results
The AUDIT showed high internal reliability and acceptable criterion validity with adequate psychometric properties for the detection of alcohol abuse and dependence. However, all of the optimal cut-off points from ROC analyses were lower than the WHO recommended for identification of risk of all AUDs, with a score of 6–12 detecting alcohol abuse and 13 and higher alcohol dependence.
Conclusions
In order to optimize the utility of the AUDIT, a lowered cut-off point for alcohol abuse and dependence is recommended for Goa, India. Further validation studies for the AUDIT should be conducted for continued validation of the tool in other parts of India."

Results
About one fourth (28.18%) of the patients fulfilled the diagnosis of current OCD and 29.83% of patients fulfilled the lifetime diagnosis of OCD. Factor analysis of YBOCS checklist yielded 5 factor structures. Factor analysis of YBOCS severity scale yielded a 2 factor model. The five factors of YBOCS checklist were named as: Hoarding (included hoarding obsessions and compulsions), contamination (included contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions), symmetry & ordering (obsessions of symmetry and ordering compulsions), Blasphemous, religious & repetition (sexual and religious obsessions, repeating and counting compulsions) and Aggression and checking (aggressive and somatic obsessions, checking compulsions). In the two factor model of YBOCS severity scale, Factor-1 included 6 items related to time spent, interference and distress related to obsessions and compulsions; whereas factor-2 included items of resistance to and control over obsessions and compulsions.
Conclusions
Present study suggests that YBOCS checklist yielded 5 factor structures and factor analysis of YBOCS severity scale results in a 2 factor model among patients with schizophrenia. The five factor model is comparable with what has been reported for patients with pure OCD."

Epidemiological studies analysing the course of Bipolar Disorder (BD) are relatively rare in the Asian context, contributing to the uncertainty regarding the prevalent course patterns and factors influencing such patterns. The current review identifies the regional characteristics of BD course patterns and the associated factors.
Methods
A review of the existing literature was done using ‘PubMed’ and ‘Cochrane’ databases which yielded 145 studies including those from all 48 Asian countries. Relevant discussions from the Western literature were incorporated.
Results
Regional and cross-national studies reveal a mania-predominant course in BD in Asian countries. Prolonged depressive episodes and comorbid anxiety disorders worsen the course of BD-II. Certain risk factors such as the young age of onset and greater episode frequency are useful predictors of bipolar diatheses. Substance use disorder comorbidity is more prevalent in males whereas depression and suicidal behaviours are more frequent in females with BD. Comorbid anxiety and personality disorders also encumber the illness course. Logistic reasons and ignorance of side-effects were specifically associated with poor adherence. An ‘eveningness’ chronotype and poor sleep quality were associated with frequent recurrences. Seasonal patterns vary among men and women, especially for depressive episodes.
Limitations
The effects of treatment and childhood BD course features were not discussed.
Conclusions
There are region-specific characteristics in bipolar illness course and factors influencing such course patterns compared to the rest of the World. Future research from Asia shall attempt to study the neurobiological underpinnings of such characteristics and plan appropriate strategies to address the same."

Mean (SD) age was 33.1 (±11.5) years, 47.8% (n=32) were males and 32.8% (n=22) were married. 92.5% (n=62) had absent insight at admission. Mean CGI Severity score at admission was 6.27 (±0.53). Mean (SD) score on MacArthur Perceived Coercion Scale at admission was 4.04 (±1.61). This reduced to 2.43(±1.91) [p<0.001]. This reduction correlated significantly with improvements in global functioning (r=−0.40, p <0.001), insight level(r=0.26, p<0.001) and as well as symptom severity(r=0.36, p<0.001). At discharge, 70% (n=47) patients reported that their involuntary admission was justified.
Conclusion
Perceived coercion in schizophrenia though common clinical phenomena, it is a dynamic state which reduces over course of treatment. At Discharge, majority reported that their admission was justified, even though they were admitted involuntarily. The study underlines the need for a standardized rule of conduct based coercive practice in psychiatry."

In comparison to other states and countries whether these children are unique in terms of care and rehabilitation from adult caregivers was the focus of our study. The study assessed level of parental stress, social support, coping mechanisms used by family and resilience in meeting the challenges as caregivers. Parents were selected by simple random sampling from a multi-specialty center dedicated to CWA. They were assessed with the help of structured tools like the Parental Stress Scale, the social support appraisals scale, the coping self-efficacy scale, and the Family Resilience Assessment Scale. Results were analyzed with descriptive statistics and findings suggest definite stress among the parents of CWA. Personal time constraint was noticed in majority of parents, which had adversely affected their professional lives. Despite wide array of stress factors, family members had satisfactory coping skills to work in harmony in adverse circumstances. Regarding secondary social support in terms of family, friends, and neighbors, responses were mixed; religious and spirituality were often resorted avenues. Social desirability, fatigue and the sample being restricted to only one center were though the limitations but, this study throws light on pertinent issues related to families with CWA from a region where specialty centers are a rarity. The future implication could focus on CWA’s future, rehabilitation, care and parental concerns which are grossly neglected in North East India."

Stigma compounds the burden experienced by family members of those with a mental illness. This study aimed to examine burden experienced by carers of people with schizophrenia or affective disorders and to explore the relationship between carer burden and stigma.
Method
A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted with patient-carer dyads involving 67 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 51 diagnosed with affective disorder. Carers completed the Zarit Burden Interview (short version) and stigma was measured using the Stigma Scale and the Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness Scale.
Results
Carer burden was significantly higher for schizophrenia than affective disorders. Female carers experienced significantly higher burden than male carers. Diagnosis, gender of carer and stigma predicted 22% of the variance in carer burden, with gender identified as a significant predictor.
Conclusions
Reducing stigma related to disclosure of mental illness in carers has the potential to reduce carer burden."

Body image perceptions, and attitudes toward obesity were examined and compared between psychotic and non-psychotic patients with a mood disorder.
Methods
80 psychotic patients and 36 non-psychotic patients with a mood disorder admitted to an acute inpatient psychiatric unit participated in the study. On admission, each patient completed a visual silhouettes scale of actual self and ideal self, as well as the Attitudes Toward Obese Persons (ATOP) scale.
Results
Analogous to the general population, psychotic and non-psychotic patients had similar body image perceptions, and experienced discrepancy between actual and ideal body image. Female patients with serious mental illness (SMI) picked a heavier actual self body image, and experienced greater discrepancy between actual and ideal body image compared to male patients with SMI. Psychotic and non-psychotic patients experienced similar mostly neutral attitudes toward obese persons, however there was a trend for depressed patients to have more negative attitudes toward obese persons compared to non-depressed patients.
Discussion
The presence of an acute psychotic episode did not affect body perceptions, or obesity attitudes; however depressed patients had more negative obesity attitudes. Similar to the general population, females with SMI overassessed their body size, and experienced more body dissatisfaction compared to males with SMI."

Dropout from an outpatient clinic is the loss of patient to the scheduled follow-up. Noncompliance in the form of treatment dropouts is a major problem across outpatient mental health settings and can range from 15% to 60%. Follow-up studies provide valuable insights into improving the quality of existing mental health facilities. Quality Rights Gujarat (QRG) is a step toward improving mental health facilities across various centers.
Methods
This retrospective observational study aims to explore follow-up pattern, predictors and any change after QRG implementation. Pre intervention Group (A) attended psychiatry OPD for 6 months before implementation of QRG project and Post intervention Group (B) attended psychiatry OPD for 3 months after implementation of QRG project.
Results
Total 1632 Patients consulted in group A and 926 patients consulted Psychiatry OPD in group B. The most common Psychiatric disorder were Depression (A-19.55%, B-28.62%), Schizophrenia and related disorders (A-14.15%, B-15.01%), Neuropsychiatric disorders like headache and epilepsy (A-14.52%, B-18.68%), substance use disorder (A-15.26%, B-13.71%) and Bipolar disorder (A-11.76%, B-13.17%). 59.56% patients dropped out after the first visit in pre intervention group as compared to 51.94% patients in post intervention group. Significant reduction of about 8% in loss to follow up and 16% increase in follow-ups of initial visits after implementation of Quality Rights Gujarat project.
Conclusions
Much can be done to improve attendance in most services. The initiative like QRG significantly has positive results on patient's follow-up."

The aim of this study is to examine the role of different bio-psycho-social risk factors for the onset of depression among patients with Hepatitis C (HCV) treated with Interferon alpha (IFN).
Material and methods
Patients with HCV were recruited and assessed prospectively at baseline and after 4, 8, and 24 weeks since the start of IFN treatment. Assessments included the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scales (HAM-D and HAM-A), Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego, 110 item version (TEMPS-A), Young Mania Rating Scale and other assessment tools. Sociodemographic and clinical factors were entered as predictors in logistic regression models, with early-onset depression (4 weeks) or persistent depression (24 weeks) as the outcomes.
Results
Early-onset depression was predicted by preexisting depressive symptoms’ severity (baseline HAM-D scores: OR=1.24; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.50; p=0.03) and by the presence of additional physical comorbidities (OR=3.74; 95% CI: 1.12, 12.5; p=0.03). Persistent depression was predicted by additional physical comorbidities (OR=7.75; 95% CI: 1.33, 45.0, p=0.02), depressive temperament (OR=8.95; 95% CI: 1.32, 60.6; p=0.03) and, at trend-level, by unknown mode of HCV contagion (OR=5.21; 95% CI: 0.89, 30.4; p=0.07).
Conclusions
The incidence of IFN-related depression is associated with factors related to patients’ physical and temperamental characteristics. Further research should include comprehensive biopsychosocial assessments to improve the early detection and treatment of vulnerable patients in the real clinical world."

Studies on treatment outcome in mania had been many. A few studies from the west address the issue of outcome in mood congruent and mood incongruent manias. None could be found from India.
Aim
To compare the treatment response in three groups of patients with mania– Nonpsychotic, psychotic with mood congruent and psychotic with mood incongruent features.
Materials and methods
All consecutive manic patients admitted during 2013 to 2014, meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were taken up. 28 patients with nonpsychotic Mania, 10 with mood congruent psychotic symptoms (MIC-) & 12 with mood incongruent psychotic features (MIC+). Diagnosis was confirmed using SCID. Mood stabilizers and Olanzapine or equivalent doses of antipsychotics were administered. Semi structured proforma was used for Socio Demographic & clinical details. YMRS, HDRS, Semi structured proforma to assess response (ISBD recommendations), CGI −BP & SAPS were used. Last 5 tools to assess the response to treatment at every 2 weeks, for 8 weeks.
Statistical analysis
Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 17.0 was used.
Results
These three groups did not show statistically significant difference in the socio-demographic variables. Severity of Mania was higher in Psychotic Mania. Psychotic Manias (group 2 and 3 combined) showed longer response time. However, mood incongruent psychotic manias when compared against the other 2 groups clubbed together did not differ significantly.
Limitations
All patients were from a tertiary referral centre and were hospitalized. Majority of them had a past history. The sample sizes were small. Treatment could not be fully matched.
Conclusion
Our findings support the view that psychotic manias on the whole take significantly longer time than mania without psychotic symptoms to respond, and also scored higher on indices of severity. Mood Incongruent Psychotic Manias and Mood Congruent Psychotic Manias did not differ in severity & response time."

Skin picking behavior involves an individual picking or biting their skin repeatedly. Although this behavior commonly occurs at a young age, little research has addressed its harmful effects among the Korean population. Therefore, we examined the characteristics of South Korean adolescents who reported skin picking behavior.
Method
South Korean students aged 12–16 years participated (N=410, females=52.2%). They completed questionnaires that addressed skin picking behavior, academic stress, impulsivity, and anxiety. The survey was conducted in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do from February–March 2016.
Results
Among participants, 66.8% reported that they had picked their skin and 15.4% did so currently. Skin picking was positively correlated with academic stress, impulsivity, and anxiety. Students who picked their skin more often displayed more anxiety, academic stress, and impulsivity.
Conclusions
Future studies should address skin picking adolescents’ characteristics, especially regarding anxiety and academic stress. Educational programs should be implemented to help adolescents decrease their anxiety and academic stress and prevent the worsening of skin picking behavior."

Resilience has provided a useful framework that elucidates the effects of protective factors to overcome psychological adversities but studies that address the potential contingencies of resilience to protect against direct and indirect negative effects are lacking. These obvious gaps have also resulted in oversimplification of complex processes that can be clarified by moderated mediation associations. This study examines a conditional process modelling of the protective effects of resilience against indirect effects.
Method
Two separate samples were recruited in a cross-sectional survey from Australia and Norway to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire −9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Stressful Negative Life Events Questionnaire and the Resilience Scale for Adults. The final sample sizes were 206 (females=114; males=91; other=1) and 210 (females=155; males=55) for Australia and Norway respectively. Moderated mediation analyses were conducted across the samples.
Results
Anxiety symptoms mediated the relationship between exposure to stressful negative life events and depressive symptoms in both samples. Conditional indirect effects of exposure to stressful negative life events on depressive symptoms mediated by anxiety symptoms showed that high subgroup of resilience was associated with less effect of exposure to stressful negative life events through anxiety symptoms on depressive symptoms than the low subgroup of resilience.
Limitations
As a cross-sectional survey, the present study does not answer questions about causal processes despite the use of a conditional process modelling.
Conclusions
These findings support that, resilience protective resources can protect against both direct and indirect – through other channels – psychological adversities."

They were treated by standard treatment protocol and followed up for next 3 months. Data was collected on clinical course and treatment outcome by a pretested semi-structured proforma, specially developed for this study.
Results
A typical subject was a young single male, educated up to primary standard, agricultural worker by occupation and belonged to Hindu rural joint family. Among the whole sample 23% were female. Majority were referred from either private doctors or hospitals or government hospitals and reported first at non-psychiatric OPD. Dropout and recovery rates were 28% (male 33%, female 13%) and 89% (male 89%, female 92%) respectively. 20%, 75%, 9%, 31%, 19% of patients needed indoor admission, oral anxiolytics, injectable tranquilizers, specific pharmacological and psychosocial treatment, supportive medical treatment respectively.

The aim of the present study was to translate the measure into Bangla and validate in Bangladeshi culture. A total of 200 adolescents participated in the study. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the data from 191 participants (who provided complete responses) identified a two-factor (Care and Overprotection) structure of the PBI with 17 items. The two factors together explained 44.18% of the total variance. The factors showed moderate to very high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α=0.863 for Care; 0.622 for Overprotection), and very strong convergent and discriminant validity as evident by their correlations with the measures of cognitive distortions and antisocial behaviors. In line with the original tool we defined four types of parenting style, such as Affectionate constraint, Affectionless control, Optimal parenting, and Neglectful parenting.

To study the symptom profile of catatonia in children and adolescents.
Methodology
Treatment records of all the inpatients aged (≤19 years) were reviewed for the period January 2005 to January 2017. Patients with catatonia (diagnosed as having at least two symptoms as per the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating scale) were included.
Results
During the study period, data was available for 52 children and adolescent. The mean age of the sample was 16.8 years (SD=2.0; range 9–19). Males (N=28; 53.8%) outnumbered females. The most common primary psychiatric diagnostic category was that of psychotic disorders (N=26; 78.8%). One-sixth (N=8; 15.4%) were diagnosed with organic illnesses like epilepsy and systemic lupus erythematosus. Affective disorders accounted for only one-tenth (N=5; 9.6%) of cases, with mania being more common presentation than depression. Very few patients were diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder (N=2). The common signs and symptoms noted were mutism (90.4%) followed by immobility/stupor (75%), staring (71.2%), negativism (57.7%), rigidity (55.8%) and posturing (53.8%). The mean BFCRS score was 13.73 (SD – 7.6; range 3–20). Overall there was no significant difference in the prevalence of various signs and symptoms of catatonia between those with psychotic disorders, affective disorders and those with catatonia due to organic causes. In only half of the patients catatonia responded to lorazepam and other half required electroconvulsive therapy.
Conclusion
The most common symptoms of catatonia in children and adolescent are mutism, immobility/stupor, staring, posturing, negativism and rigidity. The most common underlying psychiatric diagnosis is that of schizophrenia."

Outpatients attending a clozapine clinic and possessing a diagnosis of schizophrenia were invited to complete an anonymous survey using the YFAS. Ninety three surveys were used to calculate the diagnostic YFAS criteria for FA. The prevalence of FA found in this sample was 26.9%. Among individuals who did not meet “diagnostic” criteria FA, 77.4% endorsed 3 or more symptoms but did not report distress or impairment. The most common food addiction symptom was a persistent desire or repeated unsuccessful attempts to cut down consumption (97.9%).

Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), in the General Survey version, was handed out to interested physicians of a Canadian general hospital in a Grand Rounds lecture on “well-being of physicians.” They were to complete the MBI on an anonymous basis. Fifty-five adequately completed questionnaires were received.
Results
Our physicians obtained significantly higher (p<0.01) average score on Emotional Exhaustion subscale of MBI (14.0, SD=7.5) and on the Cynicism subscale of the MBI than average scores from combined 9 occupational samples listed in Maslach’s manual: our physicians reported more intense emotional depletion and endorsed more items suggestive of cynicism. However, their average Professional Efficacy score (27.6, SD=6.3) did not significantly differ from Maslach’s combined average for this subscale. The physicians’ Professional Efficacy scores were not significantly related to those of Emotional Exhaustion and of Cynicism (Pearson coefficients, p>0.05).
Conclusions
This suggests that improving professional medical skills (and thus a sense of efficiency) alone cannot prevent physicians from burnout. An implementation of other preventive strategies such as those based on mindfulness or on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is necessary."

abstract = "Objective
To investigate the depression severity and quality of life of qualified and unqualified patients with a mood disorder for a research study based on anhedonia severity.
Methods
Diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BPD) was ascertained with the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The severity of depression was measured with the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-16-SR), and Item 5, “feeling sad (sadness),” QIDS-16-SR Item 13, “change in general interest,” was used to measure the severity of anhedonia. The quality of life was measured with the Quality of Life, Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q).
Results
Of 96 patients with MDD and 147 with bipolar I or II disorder, the severity rating on sadness and anhedonia was similar. The severities of anhedonia and sadness were highly correlated with R2 of ≥0.91. Without considering depressive severity, 55% of patients would be eligible for a study if≥mild anhedonia was used as a severity criterion, but only 26% of patients eligible for a study if≥moderate anhedonia was used without considering substance use and medical comorbidities. If patients with ≥ moderate overall depressive symptoms were considered, 88.1% of patients would be eligible if≥mild anhedonia was required for a study, and 45.2% of patients would be eligible for a study if≥moderate anhedonia was required. For those who were unqualified for the study based on≥moderate anhedonia, about 1/3 had≥moderate overall depressive symptoms and less than 40% of maximum possible scores of Q-LES-Q. If only patients in remission based on overall depressive symptom severity were considered for a study of anhedonia, no patient would be eligible for the study.
Conclusion
Depressive mood and anhedonia are highly correlated. Screening patients with a mood disorder and an overall moderate depressive severity is a cost-effective approach for a study targeting anhedonia, especially for a study requiring≥moderate severity of anhedonia. However, 1/3 of the unqualified patients will have≥moderate overall depressive symptoms and poor quality of life."

This study aims at assessing the prevalence and risk factors of Adjustment disorder (AD), the AD subtypes, and the common causing stressors.
Patients and methods
A cross sectional study was conducted at outpatient psychiatric clinic in Duhok City from July 2008 to July 2009. 637 patients equal and above 18 of both genders were selected randomly. SCID-I/P (Version 2.0) was adopted to diagnose patients with AD. SPSS (version 21), was used for data analysis.
Results
The study showed that the prevalence of AD was 11.5%. It was more common among youngest age group (15–25 years) with a rate 69.9% (p=0.001) while lowest educational level (illiterate and primary) 53.5% (p=0.040), single 54.8% (p<0.001), students 39.7 (p<0.001) and from urban areas 71.2% (p=0.012) with statistically significant association. Although AD was more common among females (61.6%), no significant association was found between AD and gender (p=0.380). The most common subtype of AD was AD with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (34.2%) and was the commonest among females (19.2%) followed by AD with Anxiety subtype 30.1% which was the commonest among males (13.7%). The commonest psychosocial stressor was the illnesses (28.8%) followed by love affairs (26%) and domestic problems (16.4%).
Conclusions
The prevalence of AD was found to be high. The risk factors included young, low educational level, single, students, and those from urban areas. The most common subtype was AD with mixed anxiety and depressed mood and the commonest psychosocial stressor was the illnesses followed by love affairs and domestic problems."

Mobile phone abuse can cause pathologic stress that may lead to addictive behavior such as Phantom Vibration Syndrome (PVS) and Phantom Ringing Syndrome (PRS). The current study aimed to determine the PVS and PRS due to mobile phone use in students of Qom University of medical Sciences in Iran.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Participants
The participants were 380 students selected by proportional stratified random sampling method in each stratum.
Measurements
Data were collected by a self-administered questionnaire and analyzed by descriptive and analytic statistical methods including t-test, chi square and analysis of variance.
Findings
The prevalence of PVS and PRS due to mobile phones in students of medical sciences was estimated to be 54.3% and 49.3%, respectively. PVS was higher in female students than in males while the PRS was higher in male students. There was a significant relationship between PVS and using social networks such as Viber, WhatsApp, and Line. In addition, a significant association was observed between PVS and friend-finding, chatting and entertainment.
Conclusion
Studies should be done in the future to assess the long-term complication of overusing mobile phones. In the current study, the prevalence of PVS and PRS in half of students is considerable."

Many researchers have found that the inflammatory process in the body and the brain may result in psychiatric disorders. Meta-analyses of cross-sectional studies have reported increase in inflammatory markers in depression. However, the direction of the association remains unclear.
Aims
To compare the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in depressed and healthy controls. To study the associations of these biomarkers with severity and number of depressive episodes.
Methods
A total of 72 subjects with major depression and 60 healthy controls were studied. CRP and IL-6 were measured in all subjects.
Results
No significant differences were noted between depressed patients and healthy controls with regard to CRP (p=0.29) and IL-6 (p=0.50). Those who were suffering from severe depression based on Beck’s Depressive Inventory (BDI), were positively correlated with raised CRP (p=0.011) in comparison to patients with mild to moderate depression. Single and recurrent depressive disorder (RDD) were not associated with significant rise in CRP (p=0.866) and IL-6 (p=0.531).
Conclusions
Severity of depression is correlated with elevated CRP but not with IL-6. No association found between number of depressive episodes and levels of CRP and IL-6. It is possible that immune dysregulation is not generally present in depression, but might be restricted to particular subgroups of depressed patients. Several factors that could influence the depression and inflammation relationship need further investigation."

Hoarding disorder (HD) affects at least 1.5% of the population and is considered to be hard to treat. The current study aimed to systematically review the treatments designed to improve HD symptoms and family impact.
Method
Searches of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were undertaken. Studies were included if: (i) the study evaluated an intervention for hoarding problems; (ii) outcome measures were reported; and (iii) study results were published in an indexed journal or were a published abstract from a professional/research conference. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Clinical Trials Assessment Measure (CTAM).
Results
Twenty studies, comprising 492 participants with clinically significant hoarding symptoms or HD and 21 relatives of individuals with HD, met inclusion criteria. Treatments reviewed included cognitive-behavior therapy, medication, cognitive remediation, and multi-component interventions for relatives. Most studies yielded statistically significant improvements in hoarding symptoms, although reductions were generally modest and many participants remained in the clinical range after treatment. According to the CTAM, most studies were judged to be of low methodological quality.
Conclusions
HD is a chronic and highly burdensome condition for which efficacious treatments are needed. The current evidence base is somewhat limited and of low quality. Further research is needed to improve treatments, identify mechanisms of change, and increase the availability of evidence-based interventions for this group."

Suicide is a major contribution to mortality among university students in developed countries. There is no reliable and validated self-report suicide assessment scale with adequate sensitivity and specificity for the identification of Nigerian university students who are at risk of future suicidal behaviors.
Objective
The objective of this study was to examine the psychometric characteristics of the 4 item Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) as a screening tool for suicide risk assessment among university undergraduate students in South-western Nigeria.
Method
This is a cross-sectional descriptive study involving 536 undergraduate Nigerian students. The students completed the SBQ-R, in addition to a sociodemographic and academic related questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the 12 item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Suicidal risk categories among the students were determined by interviewing them with the items of the suicidality module section of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).
Results
Cronbach’s alpha for the SBQ-R items was 0.80. Construct validity was supported through significant positive correlations with the HADS-Anxiety and Depression subscales, and the GHQ-12. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve evaluation suggests that the best cut-off total score with the optimal sensitivity (0.882), specificity (0.875) and highest accuracy (0.879) was 8 in terms of identifying the students at high risk of suicide (Area Under the Curve=0.928; 95% Confidence Interval=0.890–0.966; Standard Error=0.019).
Conclusions
The use of the SBQ-R may be an important and vital step in the prevention of suicidal attempts among Nigerian university students."

Methods
Thirty children with DSM-IV TR diagnosis of ADHD were assessed using semi structured proforma, Conners’ Parent Rating Scale revised short (CPRS – R: S) , Mini international neuropsychiatric interview for children and adolescents and Childrens' Global Assessment Scale as well as serum levels of total Triiodothyronine (T3) ,total Thyroxine (T4) , Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and Cortisol using chemiluminescent immunometric assay and compared with 30 age- and gender -matched controls.
Results
The typical profile of cases of ADHD was of a male with mean age of 9.47 years (S.D=2.43) belonging to Hyperactive subtype of ADHD. Serum T4 was significantly lower in cases compared to controls. No significant difference was found in serum T3, TSH and Cortisol levels. No significant correlation between the CPRS : R-S scores and the hormonal biomarkers.
Conclusions
There is need for exploration of Serum T4 as putative biomarker for ADHD with replication in future studies. It may also be important to report the negative finding of Cortisol as a biomarker of ADHD in the context of effective utilization of resources for research with special relevance to resource deficit developing countries."

Presence of both these comorbid diseases results in various short term and long term complications and increases the mortality as compared to those with depression or diabetes alone.
Objectives
Systematic review of the epidemiological data, risk factors and relationship between depression and glycaemic control among the Indian studies.
Methods
We searched Pubmed, Pubmed Central, Google Scholar and Directory of Open Access Journal (DOAJ) databases to identify relevant Indian studies.
Results
Substantial variation in the prevalence of depression in people with diabetes was found across the 41 selected studies; according to this review the range is 2% to 84% (T1DM – 2–7%; T2DM – 8%–84%). Correlates of depression in diabetic patients are advancing age, female gender, low literacy rate, burden of being from a lower socioeconomic status, rural domicile, marriage and duration of diabetes of >2years, diabetes related complications and poor glycaemic control. Sedentary life without adequate physical activities, lack of self-care are often the factors that precipitates depression in a T2DM patient and vice versa.
Conclusion
According to this review, among Indian population there is a significant association between depression and diabetes."

Internet addiction has been a major behavioral disorder over the past decade. Prior meta-analytic review has demonstrated the association between Internet addiction and psychiatric disorders, as well as sleep related disorders.
Aims and objectives
There remains a paucity of literature about Internet addiction and sleep related disorders in low and middle income countries like Vietnam. It is the aim of this exploratory study to determine the association.
Methodology
An online cross-sectional study was conducted between August through to October 2015. Respondent drive sampling technique was utilized in the recruitment of participants. The short form version of the Young’s Internet addiction test was administered and sleep related disorders was ascertained by means of a self-report questionnaire. Chi-squared, t-test and ANOVA were used to determine whether there were any significant differences amongst the variables considered. Multivariate logistic regressions were also used in the analysis, in order to identify factors associated with Internet addiction.
Results
21.2% Of the participants were diagnosed with Internet addiction. 26.7% of those with Internet addiction also reported that they have had sleep related difficulties. 77.2% of these participants were receptive towards seeking medical treatment. Our current study also highlighted that being single and those who were using tobacco products were not at heightened risk of developing associated sleep related issues.
Conclusions
Our current study is largely a cross-sectional exploratory study that has shown that there is a significant prevalence of both Internet addiction and sleep related disorders amongst Vietnamese youth."

Acquired dietary habits and lifestyle behaviors of patients with schizophrenia may affect their life expectancy, disease complications and prognosis. The objectives of the current study were to assess the dietary habits and other lifestyle behaviors for Bahraini patients with schizophrenia, and to determine their associations with different medical comorbidities.
Method
A case–control study was conducted during the period of March to December 2016. A sample of 120 cases were recruited from the Psychiatric Hospital, Bahrain and age–sex-matched with 120 controls. Controls were recruited from primary health centres, and were free from serious mental illness. Dietary habits and lifestyle behaviors including smoking, alcohol intake and physical activity were assessed using a questionnaire. All medical records were reviewed retrospectively. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify dietary and lifestyle risk factors that are associated with one or more disease comorbidities.
Results
Cases had higher prevalence of smoking and alcohol intake, excessive dietary intake, and decreased physical activity (all P<0.05) compared with controls. Cases appeared to be at higher risk for developing chronic medical conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal disorders. Cases were three times more likely to have up to three or more medical comorbidities compared with controls. Excessive dietary intake and decreased physical activity were identified as the main risk factors.
Conclusion
Excessive caloric intake and decreased physical activity represent the main dietary and lifestyle risk factors associated with comorbidities among patients with schizophrenia in Bahrain."

This paper aims to summarize the major neurobiological underpinnings of depression, synthesizing the findings into a comprehensive integrated view. A literature review was conducted using Pubmed. Search terms included “depression” or “MDD” AND “biology”, “neurobiology”, “inflammation”, “neurogenesis”, “monoamine”, and “stress”. Articles from 1995 to 2016 were reviewed with a focus on the connection between different biological and psychological models. Some possible pathophysiological mechanisms of depression include altered neurotransmission, HPA axis abnormalities involved in chronic stress, inflammation, reduced neuroplasticity, and network dysfunction. All of these proposed mechanisms are integrally related and interact bidirectionally. In addition, psychological factors have been shown to have a direct effect on neurodevelopment, causing a biological predisposition to depression, while biological factors can lead to psychological pathology as well. The authors suggest that while it is possible that there are several different endophenotypes of depression with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms, it may be helpful to think of depression as one united syndrome, in which these mechanisms interact as nodes in a matrix. Depressive disorders are considered in the context of the RDoC paradigm, identifying the pathological mechanisms at every translational level, with a focus on how these mechanisms interact. Finally, future directions of research are identified."

The overall prevalence of ever suicidal ideation and ever suicide attempt among students in this study was 11.7% and 2.4%, respectively. Different rates of these suicidal behaviors were observed across the countries. In multivariable logistic regression models, suicidal ideation was significantly associated with psychosocial factors including childhood sexual abuse, depressive symptoms, involvement in physical fights, and poor academic performance as well as socio-environmental factors including living with parents or guardians and low involvement in organized religious activity. Suicide attempt was significantly associated with childhood sexual abuse, depressive symptoms, low involvement in organized religious activity and being underweight or overweight. Our findings suggest that individual-level strategies for suicide prevention should be targeted toward students with poor academic performance, mental health problems and a history of adverse childhood experiences. Particular attention should be paid to the role of families that could be a potential stressor in the lives of university students."

abstract = "Background
Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is a globally prevalent, chronic, debilitating psychiatric disorder affecting youth. With comorbidities including major depression, substance abuse, lower educational and work attainment, and increased suicide risk, it has a significant public health burden. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of SAD in urban Indian undergraduate students and to study their Facebook (FB) usage patterns.
Methods
In this exploratory cross-sectional study, 316 undergraduate students were screened for social anxiety using validated instruments, Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and Social Phobia Scale (SPS), and divided into two groups based on scores obtained. The groups were then compared with regards to behaviors and attitudes toward Facebook, obtained from a self-report questionnaire.
Results
SAD was estimated to be a significant, prevalent (7.8%) disorder in otherwise productive youth, and showed female preponderance. Higher specific social phobia scores were associated with the inability to reduce Facebook use, urges toward increasing use, spending more time thinking about Facebook, negative reactions to restricting use, and using it to forget one's problems.
Conclusions
SAD was estimated to have a prevalence of 7.8% in our study, and was associated with stronger FB usage attitudes and patterns. We recommend that the relationship between social anxiety and Internet use be explored further, to study the possibility of Internet-based screening and intervention strategies having wider reach and appeal in socially anxious individuals."

Treatment methods for reducing self-stigma have been investigated in recent years, especially those examining the relationship between negative cognitive schemata and self-stigma. This study examined the relationship of self-stigma with cognitive schemata, depression, and self-esteem in depressive patients. Furthermore, structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to evaluate three hypothetical models. Study participants were 110 patients with depression (54 men, 56 women; mean age=45.65years, SD=12.68; 83 diagnosed with mood disorders; 22 with neurotic, stress-related, or somatoform disorders; and 5 with other disorders) attending a psychiatric service. Outcomes were measured using the Japanese versions of the Devaluation-Discrimination Scale, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Rosenberg’s Self Esteem Scale. The analysis indicated a better fit of the model that assumed self-stigma as mediator, suggesting that cognitive schemata influence self-stigma, while self-stigma affects depression and self-esteem. The tested models using SEM indicated that (1) self-stigma has the potential to mediate the relationship between cognitive schemata and depression, and (2) depression and self-stigma have a similar influence on self-esteem. Although low self-esteem is considered one of the symptoms of depression, when we aim to recover self-esteem, we do not only observe improvement in depressive symptoms; thus, approaches that focus on the reduction of self-stigma are probably valid."

abstract = "Background
Schizophrenia (SZ) has an estimated heritability of 64–88%, with the higher values based on twin studies. Conventionally, family history of psychosis is the best individual-level predictor of risk, but reliable risk estimates are unavailable for Indian populations. Genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors are equally important and should be considered when predicting risk in ‘at risk’ individuals.
Objective
To estimate risk based on an Indian schizophrenia participant’s family history combined with selected demographic factors.
Methods
To incorporate variables in addition to family history, and to stratify risk, we constructed a regression equation that included demographic variables in addition to family history. The equation was tested in two independent Indian samples: (i) an initial sample of SZ participants (N=128) with one sibling or offspring; (ii) a second, independent sample consisting of multiply affected families (N=138 families, with two or more sibs/offspring affected with SZ).
Results
The overall estimated risk was 4.31±0.27 (mean±standard deviation). There were 19 (14.8%) individuals in the high risk group, 75 (58.6%) in the moderate risk and 34 (26.6%) in the above average risk (in Sample A). In the validation sample, risks were distributed as: high (45%), moderate (38%) and above average (17%). Consistent risk estimates were obtained from both samples using the regression equation.
Conclusions
Familial risk can be combined with demographic factors to estimate risk for SZ in India. If replicated, the proposed stratification of risk may be easier and more realistic for family members."

Six papers investigated the clinical effect of CRT or CCRT utilizing a randomized controlled study design. The other two papers explored brain function or structural change after CRT or CCRT treatment. All eight papers reported some beneficial effects of CRT and CCRT on cognitive functions, with three of them showing benefits on social functions. One functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study showed some change of neural activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex after CRT therapy. In addition to reviewing the published literature, we also discuss the current state of clinical practice of CRT and CCRT in China."

Anxiety disorders are common mental health disorders with significant impact on the individual as well as burden on the country as a whole.
Methods
A systematic review of databases, reference lists, internet sources, and input from content experts revealed 42 studies that documented the prevalence of anxiety symptoms or disorders. 12 of these studies specifically evaluated anxiety disorders.
Results
4 studies looked at the prevalence of anxiety disorders in the general population, whilst the remainder focused on selected population groups: university students (4 studies); substance abuse (3 studies); and victims of abuse (1 study). Studies in the general population showed that the prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder was 0.4–5.6%, mixed anxiety and depression were 3–5%, panic without agoraphobia 0.4%, phobia unspecified 0.5–%, and anxiety not-otherwise-specified 0.3–6.5%. We found significant variability in anxiety disorders in the studies in selected population groups. The variability could also have been affected by methodological factors within each study.
Conclusion
This study provides a broad overview of the prevalence of anxiety disorders in Malaysia. More research is required to develop diagnostic instruments that are validated for local use and comparable with international standards. Reliable prevalence estimates are lacking within certain groups, e.g. those in rural, indigenous, migrant population groups and those exposed to natural disasters."

Serum copper, hs-CRP and lipid profile were estimated in all the subjects. Disease severity was assessed using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Copper, hs-CRP, total cholesterol and LDL-Cholesterol were significantly increased and HDL-Cholesterol was significantly reduced in schizophrenia cases when compared with controls. Copper was positively correlated with hs-CRP (r=0.338, p=0.003). Total cholesterol was significantly correlated with PANSS total (r=0.452, p=0.003) and negative symptom scores (r=0.337, p=0.033). Triacylglycerol was positively correlated with general psychopathology symptom score (r=0.416, p=0.008). Copper and hs-CRP were increased and correlated well with each other in schizophrenia cases. Though total cholesterol and triacylglycerol showed positive association with severity of the psychopathology, copper and hs-CRP were not associated with the disease severity."

Case control analysis of 299 subjects was done to determine the predictors of PTSD. The odds of having PTSD were 6.35 times higher in women than men. Higher odds for PTSD was seen among women who were married, aged over 40, belonged to low socioeconomic status and resided in heavily damaged areas. Protective odds for PTSD was found among women who had received more than three times of counseling services whereas men were not at risk if they were free from fear of recurrence of tsunami, when adjusted for other variables. Women were vulnerable to PTSD because of their socially constructed roles. It is important to consider gender based vulnerabilities while designing interventions to combat mental health problems among disaster affected communities."

Methods
A total of 1196 Chinese adults who suffered from a deadly 2008 Wenchuan earthquake participated in this study. PTSD symptoms were measured with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). A custom-by-design 2×48-Plex SNPscan™Kit were used to genotype the RORA rs8042149 SNP.
Results
Our results showed that the interaction of rs8042149 genotype x trauma exposure was associated with total PTSD symptoms in males. Moreover, the rs8042149 genotype x trauma exposure interaction was only associated with severity of the negative affect, anhedonia and dysphoric arousal symptoms in males.
Limitations
A moderate sample exposed to a specific event was assessed with a self-reported PTSD measure.
Conclusions
This study provides preliminary evidence supporting the functional role of RORA in PTSD, and adds to the knowledge for understanding the genetic underpinnings of PTSD. Moreover, this study carries implications for understanding the comorbidity of PTSD and the sex-specific expression of PTSD’s symptoms."

This study aimed to evaluate the factor structure and psychometric properties of the NMDS in a group of Iranian inpatients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). At first, the scale was translated into Persian and used as part of a battery consisting of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Oxford Happiness Inventory (OHI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). The battery was administered to 271 inpatients with MDD (90 men and 181 women) aged from 18 to 60 who had been referred to psychiatric hospitals in Tehran, Iran. Confirmatory factor analysis of the Persian version of the NMDS upheld its original four-factor structure. Moreover, the results showed its good internal consistency (Cronbach‘s alpha coefficient ranging from 0.70 for the emotional subscale to 0.83 for the interpersonal subscale). In addition, the NMDS scores were correlated with other constructs in empirically and theoretically expected ways, which provides evidence for the convergent (positive significant relationships with anxiety and cognitive and somatic-affective symptoms of depression) and divergent (negative significant relationships with happiness and mental health and physical health) validity of the scale. These findings supported the Persian version of the NMDS as a reliable and valid measure for the assessment of depression symptoms in patients with MDD."

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, with lifetime prevalence of 2%–3% and is known to lie on a spectrum continuous with Schizophrenia and other affective psychosis. Neurological Soft Signs (NSS) have been reported to be higher in both Schizophrenia and affective psychosis, like bipolar disorder, and their first degree relatives but in OCD, the results have been inconsistent. It remains unclear if NSS occur at even higher rates in individuals who have a co-morbidity for OCD and either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, as it might be expected if a broader neurodevelopmental hit underlies the pathophysiology of both OCD and these disorders.
Aims and objectives
To assess and compare NSS in patients of OCD, OCD with Psychotic spectrum disorders (OCD-PSD), first degree relatives of OCD (FDR of OCD) and healthy controls.
Methodology
90 subjects each were recruited in four groups- OCD, OCD-PSD, FDR of OCD and healthy controls, as per the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria for each group. Diagnosis was made as per ICD-10 criteria and Cambridge Neurological Inventory, Part-2 was applied.
Results and conclusion
This study found statistically significant difference between the severity of NSS among these groups. There was also a significant difference in presence of NSS in OCD with PSD group and OCD group. A greater abnormality of NSS in FDR of OCD compared to healthy controls was found. This difference in proportions and severity of NSS between groups points towards an underlying common neurobiological and etiopathological underpinning between OCD with and without comorbid PSDs and their first degree relatives."

Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) was used to assess the prevalence of alexithymia. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between the vitiligo, alopecia areata, psoriasis patients and the control group in terms of alexithymia score (p≤0.05), but did not find any significant difference between acne patients and control group (p=0.06). This study has demonstrated high score of alexithymia in patients with psoriasis, alopecia areata and vitiligo compared with control group; however, such association was not found in individuals with acne vulgaris. Hence it is proposed that the evaluation and management of alexithymia would better the treatment of skin disorders and improve the quality of life in patients."

Participants were 143 school-aged children with MHP and their mothers. They completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, Social Competence Questionnaire, Brief Family Relationship Scale, Parental Stress Scale, Parent’s Report Questionnaire, and Indonesian Version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Mainly, children were rated to have emotional symptoms by their mothers (37.8%). Factors such as academic competence, family relationships, and maternal parenting stress are related to MHP. Given the high prevalence of school-aged children that have emotional symptoms, child psychiatric mental health nurses should give special attention to assist them during their school years. Moreover, nurses should aim to improve family relationships and reduce maternal parenting stress."

This has a significant impact on how we address treatment at substance abuse facilities and also has implications for personal and occupational functioning. A lack of evidence to support the superiority of any one intervention over the other has created difficulties for both clinicians and parents. A recent review highlights long-term and short-term outcomes (Craig et al., 2015). This article reviews the benefits and pitfalls of both pharmacological interventions and behavioral therapies in the treatment of ADHD. Key articles were reviewed on the benefits and side effects of stimulants, the methods and benefits of behavioral interventions, and the effects of combination therapy. Google Scholar, PsychINFO, Medline, Cochrane, and CINAHL were searched with the following search words: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, ADHD, Stimulant Medication, Behavioral Interventions, Combination Therapy, Cognitive Therapy, Functioning and Growth. It was found that stimulants are very effective during the period in which they are taken. While short term benefits are clear, longer term ones are not. Behavioral interventions play a key role for long-term improvement of executive functioning and organizational skills. There is a paucity of long-term randomized placebo controlled studies and current literature is inconclusive on what is the preferred intervention."

Prolidase (Pro), an intracellular enzyme necessary for collagen turnover, matrix remodelling and cell growth has been shown to be related to Oxidative Stress (OS). To our knowledge, serum Pro activity in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has not been documented yet. In this study, we aimed to evaluate OS and its relation with Pro activity in patients diagnosed with GAD.
Method
Thirty untreated GAD patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. Blood samples were collected from all subjects to quantify total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS) and Pro activity. Oxidative stress index (OSI), the ratio of TOS to TAS, is calculated to evaluate the balance between antioxidants and oxidants. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) was used to determine the anxiety levels of all subjects.
Results
GAD group demonstrated statistically significantly higher TOS, OSI and Pro levels, when compared with the control group (t=2.947, p=0.005; t=2.874, p=0.006; and t=9.396, p<0.001 respectively). HARS scores were found to be positively correlated with TOS, OSI and Pro levels (p=0.008, r=0.338; p=0.008, r=0.339; and p<0.001, r=0.751 respectively).
Conclusion
The degree of severity of OS is correlated with the levels of Pro. Thus, Pro might be the target enzyme, promising to be a marker for the follow-up of GAD patients. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report a significant relation between Pro activity and GAD."

Evidence suggests that there is considerable variation in how caregivers of children with disabilities adapt to their caregiving demands and stressors. The different adaptations to the children with disabilities may cause different impacts on the health and well-being of caregivers. This paper provides a brief overview of the literature on the impact of caring for children with disabilities on the health and quality of life of caregivers and the factors related to the health outcomes and quality of life. A literature search was conducted by using various electronic databases, including PsychINFO, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, and MEDLINE using specific key terms. Thirty-one articles published in peer-review journals from the last six years (2009–2014) were reviewed. Most of the studies were quantitative studies. Factors discussed that impact on caregivers’ health and quality of life include the caregivers’ sociodemographic background and child’s disability-related factors. Several mediators and moderators including coping strategies, social support, parental stress, self-esteem and self-efficacy are described in this paper. This review highlighted the importance of these factors to better understand the complex nature of stress processes and the caregivers’ adaptations to their children’s disabilities."

However the evidence for the effectiveness of CTOs is limited. The evidence from local audits and evaluations is conflicted with some studies showing clear benefit and others not. The same is the case for uncontrolled before and after studies. The higher levels of evidence such as randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews, and Cochrane reviews have consistently failed to demonstrate benefits from CTO use on key measures such as symptom levels, functioning, and healthcare use. Despite this they are increasingly available internationally and often greeted enthusiastically by clinicians and families who want to ensure care and follow up for the mentally ill.

Results revealed that the 2-group bifactor AS model fit the ASI-3 data the best. Relatedly, although all ASI-3 items loaded on the general AS factor, the Cognitive Concern group factor was not defined in the bifactor model and may therefore need to be omitted in order to accurately model AS when conducting factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) in cross cultural contexts. SEM results also revealed that the general AS factor was the only factor from the 2-group bifactor model that significantly predicted anxiety, depression, and negative affect. Implications and importance of this new bifactor structure of Anxiety Sensitivity in East Asian samples are discussed."

Children in the NF group attended 20 twice-weekly sessions. Outcome measures included individual cognitive performance scores (ADS, K-WISC-III), ADHD rating scores completed by their parents (ARS, CRS) and brainwave indices of left and right hemispheres before and after NF treatment. Significant additive treatment effect in any of the symptom variables was found and a reduction of theta waves in both the right and left hemispheres was recorded in NF condition participants. However our randomized controlled study could not demonstrate superior effects of combined NF on intelligent functioning compared to the medication treatment only.

The study investigated and determined the best fitted PTSD models using DSM-5 PTSD criteria symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to examine model fit using the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale in 241 registered and practicing Filipino nurses (166 females and 75 males) who worked in the Philippines and gave direct nursing services to patients. Based on multiple fit indices, the results showed the 7-factor hybrid model, comprising of intrusion, avoidance, negative affect, anhedonia, externalizing behavior, anxious arousal, and dysphoric arousal factors has excellent fit to STS. This model asserts that: (1) hyperarousal criterion needs to be divided into anxious and dysphoric arousal factors; (2) symptoms characterizing negative and positive affect need to be separated to two separate factors, and; (3) a new factor would categorize externalized, self-initiated impulse and control-deficit behaviors. Comparison of nested and non-nested models showed Hybrid model to have superior fit over other models. The specificity of the symptom structure of STS based on DSM-5 PTSD criteria suggests having more specific interventions addressing the more elaborate symptom-groupings that would alleviate the condition of nurses exposed to STS on a daily basis."

Methods
Fifty-eight patients with schizophrenia and Seventy-seven healthy controls were recruited. Sociodemographic data were collected and they were subjected to the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS), and Trauma Assessment for Adults—Brief Revised Version (TAA).
Results
Correlations between impulsive behavior and psychosocial variables were examined. A significant association between level of impulsive behavior and severity of psychopathological symptoms was observed (P=0.0001). Young age (P=0.001), male patients (P=0.0001) and those with history of childhood sexual or physical abuse (P=0.0001), were more impulsive. Linear regression (step wise) analysis model showed that male sex (P=0.001), positive symptoms (P=0.006), and childhood physical abuse (P=0.001) were significant associations.
Conclusion
Male gender, positive symptoms as well as history of physical and sexual abuse before 18 years of age are important predictors for high levels of impulsive behavior in schizophrenia patients."

abstract = "Objective
Research suggests that rates of depression among general population samples in Asia may be significantly lower than in much of the rest of the world. However, whether this applies to depression among cancer patients is unclear, which is important to determine in order to identify depression treatment needs among cancer patients in this region. The purpose of the present study was to assess caseness rates of serious depression among general cancer patients in the Southeast Asian nation of Viet Nam.
Method
A total of 695 adult cancer patients from three hospitals in Da Nang, Viet Nam served as study participants. They were assessed at one time point for (a) demographic and (b) cancer characteristics, and (c) depression symptoms.
Results
The overall caseness rate for serious depression was 28%. Although rates of depression in general population samples usually are significantly higher in women than men, rates of depression among men and women did not differ significantly among our cancer patients. Higher levels of depressive symptoms were found, however, as a function of lower patient income and education, occupation, cancer stage, and type of cancer, but not marital status or age.
Conclusions
Caseness rates of depression are significantly elevated by a factor of 10–15 among Vietnamese cancer patients relative to general population epidemiological studies in the same region. Although a number of studies have found that rates of depression tend to be lower in Asian as compared to Western general population samples, depression rates among our Vietnamese cancer patients were similar to those reported among Western cancer patients. This suggests that whatever factors are responsible for the relatively low rates of depression observed in Asian general population samples may not be operating in regards to cancer-related depression. Overall, the value of these findings are not only that they provide information for policy makers in Viet Nam to support depression treatment among cancer patients, but also that they suggest that despite the apparent relatively low overall rates of depression it may be useful for cancer and mental health researchers in the region to conduct similar assessments for their policy makers."

The present study aimed to assess inter-rater reliability and prevalence of catatonia according to four diagnostic methods: Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) both screening and complete scale, Braunig’s Catatonia Rating Scale (CRS), ICD 10 and DSM5.
Methods
For inter-rater reliability, different raters evaluated patients using the definitions provides by the four scales: BFCRS Screen and Total, CRS, ICD10 and DSM5. Kippendorff’α was used to compute the inter-rater reliability. Concordance between different systems was assessed using spearman correlation. Prevalence of catatonia was studied using the four definitions in a clinical sample of consecutive adult admissions in a psychiatry ward of a tertiary care hospital.
Results
The inter-rater reliability was found to be good for BFCRS Total (α=0.779), moderate for DSM5 and BFCRS screen (α=0.575 and α=0.514 respectively) and low for CRS and ICD10 (α=0.111 and α=0.018 respectively). BFCRS Total and DSM5 definitions of catatonia had highest concordance (rs=0.892 p<0.001). In the prevalence sample of consecutive hospital admissions, the prevalence was found to be highest with the definitions of BFCRS Screen and ICD 10 (10.3%, confidence intervals [CI] 3.9% to 16.7%), followed by BFCRS Total and DSM5 definitions 6.9%, CI 1.6% to 12.2%) and while CRS yielded the lowest prevalence rate (3.4%, CI 0% to 7.2%).
Conclusion
Different methods used to determine catatonia in the clinical sample yield different prevalence of this condition."

The relationship between opioid use and sexual problems among males is complex one, as some are using opioids to increase their sexual performance while others are suffering from sexual problems due to its use. And research addressing this relationship is still limited.
Aims
The aim of the current study was to assess and evaluate sexual dysfunction in male subjects seeking treatment for opioid dependence and to compare it with healthy control group.
Methods and material
60 male subjects with opioid dependence for more than one year (ICD-10 criteria) were compared to 120 healthy age & tobacco abuse matched control group (case: control=1:2) using standard questionnaires evaluating various domains of sexual dysfunction.
Results
Opioid dependents were found to have sexual dysfunction ranging from 53.3% to 81.7% which was significantly greater than the healthy control group (15.8% to 41.7%).
Conclusions
Sexual dysfunctions are highly prevalent in opioid dependents and this should be addressed properly while assessing and treating a patient of opioid dependence."

Media reporting has consistently been shown to influence suicidal behaviour. Irresponsible reporting by the media can lead to imitative suicidal behaviour. The WHO has delineated guidelines for responsible media reporting of suicide. The study aims to examine whether Indian newspapers adhere to the WHO guidelines and whether there are differences in style of reporting between local and national newspapers and between English and Hindi newspapers.
Methods
The study was conducted on ten newspaper publications that were circulated in Jaipur, India from 1st October 2014 to 31st December 2014. All ten newspapers were screened daily for news items related to suicide. Each news item so obtained was studied in detail and then rated using a scale developed in India by psychiatrists and journalists. This scale is based on the WHO guidelines.
Results
On an average a newspaper publishes one news item related to suicide every other day. Suicide reporting in Indian newspapers has a strong inclination towards sensationalism. No effort was made to include any educative material the reports. On the positive side most newspapers did not publish the photograph of deceased, or glorify the victims. The newspapers did not try to portray suicide as understandable and were largely neutral in their reporting. The reporting patterns were similar across regional and national newspapers as also across Hindi and English language newspapers.
Conclusion
Suicide reporting in India is largely irresponsible and efforts should be made to sensitise media personnel in this regard."

Few researchers have offered an explicit theoretical definition of the phenomenon which is fundamental; as it not only pertains to the aetiology it also directs research and management of the phenomenon. Therefore this review explores ‘what is in a name’? Specifically possible aetiologies of food addiction, eating addiction and food addiction as an eating disorder are reviewed and the potential DSM-5 classification espoused. It is evident that the phenomenon requires further research and evaluation in order to delineate whether the phenomenon constitutes a disorder and if the phenomenon is found to be a valid entity the most appropriate designation. As it is too early to draw definitive conclusions regarding the concept all plausible designations and the associated aetiologies require further investigation."

However, findings for the size of the callosal area in patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FESz) are inconsistent. A possibility for these conflicting results is that the duration of illness in patients with FESz affects the CC size. The present study investigated the CC size abnormalities in patients with FESz. Forty-six patients with FESz whose duration of illness was less than 1year and 46 age-, sex-, and handedness-matched healthy controls were recruited to examine the CC size using magnetic resonance imaging. We measured the area of the CC using the Witelson’s scheme, which divided the whole area into seven subdivisions. Analysis of covariance indicated there was no difference in the whole or regional areas of the CC between patients with FESz and healthy controls. The rostrum of the CC was significantly correlated with the total score for negative symptoms and some of the subtotal scores. Our findings indicate that there was no reduction in the whole or regional area of the CC among patients with FESz. When comparing the callosal morphology and symptoms, negative symptoms increased in severity as the rostrum area of the CC decreased in size. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the size of the anterior CC is associated with the pathology observed in the early stages of FESz."

Advancements in cellular reprogramming techniques have made it possible to directly study brain cells from patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. We have systematically reviewed the applications of induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) and their neural derivatives in understanding the biological basis of schizophrenia.
Method
We searched the scientific literature published in MEDLINE with the following search strategy: (Pluripotent) AND (Schizophrenia OR Antipsychotic OR Psychosis). Studies written in English that used IPSCs derived from patients with schizophrenia were included.
Results
Out of 23 articles, which had used IPSCs from patients with schizophrenia, neurons or neural stem cells had been derived from them in a majority. Several parameters had been studied; the key cellular phenotypes identified included those of synaptic pathology, neural migration/proliferation deficits, and abnormal oxidative phosphorylation.
Conclusion
Cellular modelling using IPSCs could improve the biological understanding of schizophrenia. Emerging findings are consistent with those of other study designs (post-mortem brain expression, animal studies, genome-wide association, brain imaging). Future studies should focus on refined study designs (family-based, pharmacogenomics, gene editing) and a combination of cellular studies with deep clinical phenotyping."

Limited biological research data are available on acute and transient psychotic disorder (ATPD) vis-à-vis schizophrenia. P300 event related potentials (ERP) have been extensively studied as an important neurophysiological parameter in schizophrenia. However, no P300 ERP studies comparing the two disorders are available. We compared auditory P300 ERP in patients remitted from ATPD with schizophrenia in remission and biologically unrelated healthy controls.
Methods
In this case-control study design, 25 subjects remitted from ATPD were age-/gender-matched with healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia in remission. Clinical assessment and auditory P300 ERP (amplitude and latencies at central and parietal sites, reaction time) were recorded. The ERP parameters were compared across the three groups.
Results
All three groups showed significant differences in P300 amplitudes and latencies at central and parietal sites. Schizophrenia group differed significantly (p<0.001) from the ATPD group in all the P300 parameters. The ATPD group was found to have lower Pz latency (p<0.05) and lower mean reaction time (p<0.001) as compared to healthy controls.
Conclusion
The results suggest that P300 could easily distinguish between ATPD and schizophrenia in remission, thus neurophysiologically differentiating the two disorders. Lower P300 latency and reaction time, which indicate hyper-arousability, distinguished ATPD from normal controls, with implications for a better understanding of ATPD."

This study investigated the differences in psychological health and menopause-specific quality of life (MENQOL) between women with and without diabetes type 2 (T2DM) in Malaysia. Women with T2DM (n=320) were matched by age range to controls without T2DM (n=320). Data were collected from March 2012 to January 2013. Delusions Symptoms States Inventory (DSSI) instrument was used to identify symptoms of depression and anxiety. Women with diabetes had higher depressive (11.8% versus 8.4%) and anxiety (8.4% versus 6.6%) symptoms compared to women without diabetes. In both groups, the most common menopausal symptom was aches (muscles and joints). Women without diabetes had significantly higher scores for the sexual domain compared to women with diabetes (4.20 versus 3.21, p=0.001). The odds that a postmenopausal woman with diabetes was depressed or anxious on the DSSI scale increased significantly when the MENQOL score on the physical, vasomotor, and psychosocial domains increased by one unit. Both diabetes and psychological problems have negative impact on MENQOL. Our findings support the view of screening postmenopausal women with diabetes for depressive and anxiety, to improve overall quality of life."

This study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the 12-item Perception of Aggression Scale (POAS).
Method
It consists of three phases of testing, including (1) translation and back-translation and content validity; (2) semantic equivalence between translated Chinese and original English version; and (3) construct validity, internal consistency and test-retest reliability.
Results
The translated Chinese and back-translated English version showed excellent similarities and agreements between two independent translators. The Chinese version indicated high item- and scale-level content validity indexes (0.86–1.00) and satisfactory semantic equivalence with the original English language version (weighted kappa=0.48–0.90; intraclass correlation coefficient=0.91). Exploratory factor analysis in 249 nursing students resulted in three components (dysfunctional, functional and protective dimensions), explaining 64% of the total variance, with satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha=0.76–0.83) and good 2-week test-retest reliability (Pearson’s r=0.87). The Chinese version of POAS was found to be a valid and reliable tool to examine nurses’ attitudes towards patient aggression.
Discussion
Chinese nurses in this study viewed patient aggression to be an undesirable negative behaviour suggestive of uncontrollability behaviour presented by the patient under their care."

The present study reviews the delivery of a pilot curriculum-mentorship-based peer vocational support workers training in a Hong Kong public psychiatric hospital. The present paper reports (1) on the development of a peer vocational support workers training − Job Buddies Training Program (JBTP) in Hong Kong; and (2) preliminary findings from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.
Method
The curriculum consists of 15-session coursework, 8-session storytelling workshop and 50-hour practicum to provide Supported Employment Peer Service (SEPS) under the mentorship of occupational therapists. Six trainees were assessed using three psychosocial assessments and qualitative methods.
Findings
Compared to the baseline, the Job Buddies (JB) trainees showed an increase in awareness of their own recovery progress, occupational competence and problem-solving skills at the end of the training. Their perceived level of self-stigma was also lessened. In post-training evaluation, all Job Buddies trainees said they perceived positive personal growth and discovered their own strengths. They also appreciated the help from their mentors and gained mutual support from other trainees and from exposure with various mini-projects in the training.
Conclusions and implications
This pilot study provides an example of incorporating peer support and manualized training into existing work rehabilitation service for our JB trainees. Further studies on the effectiveness of service provided by peer support workers and for development on the potential use of peer support workers in other clinical and rehabilitation settings with larger subjects will be fruitful."

The pattern of symptom response to second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) has not been studied extensively. Understanding the time course of symptom response would help to rationally monitor patient progress.
Objective
To determine the short-term differential time course of response of symptom dimensions of first episode schizophrenia viz., negative, positive symptoms and 5 factors of anergia, thought disturbance, activation, paranoid-belligerence and depression to treatment with SGA olanzapine.
Methods
57 drug naive patients with schizophrenia were treated for 4 weeks with olanzapine 10mg/day, increased to 20mg/day in 1 week. Weight was recorded and ratings with the Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS), the Simpson Angus Scale (SAS) were performed weekly.
Results
43 patients completed 4 weeks of assessment. Scores on all of the dimensions improved. By the end of week 1, only positive syndrome, thought disturbance and paranoid-belligerence dimensions improved. Maximum improvement was seen with paranoid-belligerence by week 1, followed by positive syndrome in week 2, and depression at week 3. The percentage improvement in positive syndrome was significantly greater than negative. Over 4 weeks there was a mean weight gain of 2kg and there were significant extrapyramidal symptoms.
Conclusions
Olanzapine produced reduction in all dimensions, but the pace of responding of individual dimensions differed. Longer-term studies comparing SGAs with first generation antipsychotics are needed."

abstract = "Background
There has been an enormous use of internet among health professionals in the last decade. It has made significant changes in the health care system. Besides its several benefits, the excessive undisciplined use has led to the emergence of concept of internet addiction.
Objectives
The objectives of our study were to estimate prevalence of internet addiction among medical and dental students; to determine association of internet use pattern and psychopathology between medical and dental internet addicted (IA) students.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 597 students from medical and dental colleges. They completed semi-structured data, internet addiction test and mental health inventory questionnaires as per instructions provided. Students were divided into medical internet addicts and dental internet addicts for comparison.
Results
The prevalence of severe internet addiction was more among dental students (2.3%) than that among medical students (1.2%). There was significant difference between the students of medical and dental faculties, who fall under the category of addiction on the basis of-gender, computer ownership and purpose of internet use (P<0.05). The psychiatric symptoms such as depression and emotional ties also had statistically significant difference (P<0.05).
Conclusion
Significant differences were seen in some of the parameters of internet use pattern and psychopathology among the two groups of internet addict from health professionals. So, further studies need to be conducted among different groups of internet addicts to evaluate different parameters. Specific measures should be taken to prevent internet addiction and its complications."

Three scales – the Bangla MAAS, the short form of health 36 (SF-36) and the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) – were applied to 519 university students (51.4% female). Ninety-two participants were retested over a two weeks period to examine test-retest reliability. Consistent with previous studies, the results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed a single factor solution for the Bangla MAAS (χ2/df=222.243/90=2.47, CFI=0.93, NFI=0.87, and RMSEA=0.053). The temporal stability and internal consistency was also satisfactory (Cronbach’s alpha 0.85). The Bangla MAAS was significantly and positively associated with SF-36 Mental and Physical health components and negatively with IAT scores. Additionally, MAAS scored significantly varied with the presence of physical illness and different living conditions, suggesting the validity of the tool. The Bangla version of the MAAS is, therefore, a valid and reliable tool to measure mindfulness among young Bangladeshi adults."

abstract = "Early life immune aberrations have strongly been associated with the risk of schizophrenia. Amongst them, inflammation induced neurodevelopmental origin has emerged as one of the widely recognized underlying mechanisms. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an important anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokine. It modulates the expression of another immuno-inhibitory molecule, Human Leukocyte Antigen-G (HLA-G), predominantly expressed at the feto-maternal interface. Under physiological conditions, IL-10 and HLA-G molecules regulate the feto-maternal immune homeostasis by limiting the inflammatory states and influence the outcome of pregnancy. The aberrant expression of these molecules can cause pregnancy complications, which are known to confer strong risk to schizophrenia in the offspring. However, there is a considerable lack of information on the effect of the functional interactions between IL-10 and HLA-G on the risk of schizophrenia. We therefore examined the impact of possible correlation between IL-10 genetic variations and the plasma levels of soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) on schizophrenia risk. Genotyping of IL10 (-592 C>A, -1082 A>G) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed by PCR-RFLP method in 219 schizophrenia patients and 197 healthy subjects and levels of sHLA-G were estimated by ELISA in 46 patients and 44 healthy subjects. There was no significant difference in the genotype and allele frequencies between the groups for both the IL10 SNPs analyzed. However, we observed a correlation between IL10 genetic variation and plasma levels of sHLA-G in schizophrenia patients. Patients carrying CC genotype of IL10 −592C>A polymorphism had significantly lower sHLA-G levels compared to CA and AA genotypes. Our findings suggest the impact of possible correlation between IL-10 and HLA-G on schizophrenia risk."

Dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (DSP) is one of the key factors contributing to the development of antipsychotic treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). We investigated the efficacy of blonanserin, an atypical antipsychotic, for patients with TRS and DSP.
Methods
In this 12-month retrospective follow-up study, we investigated the cases of eight consecutive patients with unstable TRS and DSP treated with blonanserin as an add-on therapy. We examined changes in scores for the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF) during the 12 months after the administration of blonanserin.
Results
The patients’ total scores on the BPRS and GAF scores were significantly improved by 3 months at the latest. Positive BPRS and CGI-S scores were also improved by 6 months at the latest. The total chlorpromazine-equivalent doses of antipsychotics were significantly reduced from 1462.3±499.6mg to 794.1±642.8mg (p=0.001) after 12 months of blonanserin treatment, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.
Conclusions
Blonanserin may be a promising antipsychotic for the treatment of TRS and DSP."

While Iran has a high prevalence of IPV and depression, the association between IPV and depression has not been well examined. The Iranian data from the International Dating Violence Study (IDVS) 2001–2006 (ICPSR 29583) were analyzed. Twenty-three male and 75 female college students were selected in the IDVS Iranian data. Nearly all of the participants, male and female, reported being victims and perpetrators of IPV. Female participants were more likely to report depression compared to male participants. Participants who had experienced sexual IPV reported significantly higher levels of depression compared to those who did not experience sexual IPV. However, when substance abuse and partner conflict were analyzed, the contribution of sexual IPV on depression was no longer significant. This study suggests that IPV prevention and intervention programs should take into consideration that college-aged men and women frequently experience and use violence in dating relationships. Depression interventions should be included for female students. Substance abuse and partner conflict are important risk factors for depression."

Caring for a person with first episode psychosis (FEP) is a challenging and distressing task for the carers. The carers’ stress in the early stage of psychosis can increase their expressed emotion (EE) while social support is hypothesized to decrease EE. However, the influence of stress and social support on carers’ EE is not well understood in FEP.
Aim
To examine how the stress and social support shape expressed emotion in the carers of FEP.
Methods
Seventy one carers of the patients with non-affective FEP were recruited from the inpatient psychiatry ward of a tertiary mental health care center in South India. The family questionnaire, perceived stress scale and multidimensional scale of perceived social support were used to measure their EE, stress and social support respectively.
Results
Carers experienced high level of perceived stress, EE and poor social support. Perceived stress significantly increased EE (β=0.834; p<0.001) and social support did not significantly influence EE (β=−0.065; p>0.05). Perceived stress predicted 76 percent of the variance on EE (Adjusted R2=0.761).
Conclusion
The results emphasize high level of stress and EE in carers of patients with FEP that implies the need for appropriate psychosocial interventions to manage their stress."

Indian research on dual diagnosis is mostly on prevalence of co-morbidity in a particular type of substance use disorder or psychiatric disorder. They were not on overall prevalence of dual diagnosis in a clinical sample. The study aims to assess prevalence of dual diagnosis among first time visitors to a tertiary care deaddiction centre.
Methodology
The study participants were recruited using computer-generated random number table from 10th Apr 2013 to 28 June 2013 from a deaddiction centre in North India. Psychiatric diagnosis was done by qualified psychiatrist and confirmed by Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.).
Results
One seventy nine participants were recruited during the study period. The prevalence of dual diagnosis was 58 (32.4%). Affective disorder group 22 (12.3%) is the most common group followed by anxiety disorders group 20 (11.2%) and psychotic disorder group 9 (5.0%). Duration of use and dependence (in months) of alcohol, opioids, and nicotine was shorter and of cannabis and benzodiazepines was longer in dual diagnosis group compared to non dual diagnosis group.
Conclusions
This study screened the largest number of substance use disorders patients visiting a tertiary care centre in India using a sound methodology. The study reported that nearly one third of substance use disorder patients are cases of dual diagnosis. The prevalence reported in our study is lower than reported in some western hospital based and community based studies."

Data was utilized from the Singapore Mental Health Study (SMHS), a cross-sectional epidemiological survey conducted among the adult population (n=6616) aged 18 years and above. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0 (CIDI v3.0) was used to assess co-morbidity as well as the life-time and 12-month prevalence of disorders. Functional impairment and treatment-seeking behavior were also assessed. The life-time (0.9%) and 12-month (0.4%) prevalence estimates in the current study were found to be lower than those reported in Western populations but comparable to the prevalence estimates found in Asian countries. The relatively lower prevalence rate of GAD in this study suggests the possible role of culture in reporting and manifestation of anxiety symptomatology. The failure of a substantial proportion of individuals to seek treatment despite self-reported impairment was also identified as an area of concern."

Improvement in cognitive functions and sustenance of the improvement observed at follow-up period ranging from 2 to 6 months duration was underscored by all the four studies. Indigenous methods such as home-based CR techniques and Yoga therapy as an adjunct CR technique have been researched upon. Established method of CR such as the Integrated Psychological Therapy (IPT) has been used with modifications made to suit the cultural scenario. Other treatment methods such as family therapy have been added along with CR for chronic patients. The limited number of research studies has tried to encompass various dimensions.

Indian psychiatrists found somatic symptoms like pain, sleep and appetite to be significantly more important in depression and violent and aggressive behavior to be significantly more common in mania than did American psychiatrists. American psychiatrists found pessimism about the future to be more significant in depression and pressured speech and marked distractibility to be more significant in mania than among Indian psychiatrists. Both groups agreed the top four symptoms of psychosis were paranoia, lack of insight, delusions and auditory hallucinations and both groups agreed that visual hallucinations and motor peculiarities to be least significant. Despite a different set of resources, both groups noted similar barriers to mental health care access. However, American psychiatrists found substance abuse to be a significant barrier to care whereas Indian psychiatrists found embarrassing the family was a significant barrier to accessing care. Because psychiatrists see a large volume of individuals across different cultures, their collective perception of most common symptoms in psychiatric illness is a tool in finding cultural patterns."

Few patients in need of mental health care have access to psychiatric care in low and middle income countries. Public attitudes towards psychiatrists have not been adequately studied in most developing countries and especially in India, where on average one trained psychiatrist is available for 300,000 people. The aim of our study was to explore attitudes towards psychiatrists in the general population in two Indian metropolitan cities (Chennai and Kolkata) and to identify factors that could influence these attitudes.
Subjects and methods
Explorative surveys in the context of public attitudes towards psychiatrists were conducted in a convenience sample from the general population in Chennai (n=166) and Kolkata (n=158). Sampling was balanced for age, gender and school education.
Results
Comparing the two samples using a multivariate analysis, we found more negative attitudes towards psychiatrists in Chennai compared to Kolkata (p<0.0001). Negative attitudes correlated with lower education levels (p<0.001) and stronger religious beliefs (p<0.05) in both cities.
Conclusion
Attitudes towards psychiatrists differed widely between two large metropolitan cities in India. In line with previous studies, negative attitudes correlated with lower level of education and stronger religious beliefs across both cities. Future studies may identify finer cultural and social factors that play an important role in attitudes towards psychiatrists in a diverse country like India."

This article briefly reviews the literature pertaining to community treatment orders (CTOs) specifically how and why they are utilised and how effective mandated community treatment really is. This review discusses the use of CTOs in the context of the recovery model.
Conclusions
This article highlights the shortfalls in the current CTO system while also demonstrating the increase in acute coercive care. The literature pertaining to the effectiveness of CTOs is inconsistent with more recent reviews denoting that there is now robust evidence the CTOs are not effective. Further treatment that aligns with the recovery model as oppose to mandated treatment is known to increase treatment compliance."

Currently, evidence regarding ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for depressive disorder mostly originates from Western studies. Herein, we examined the validity of smartphone-based EMA for depression in Chinese patients and explored the determinants of use. A smartphone application, iHOPE, was used to perform daily EMA of depression, anxiety, sleep and cognitive performance. Outpatients with depressive disorder were recruited to use iHOPE for 8 weeks. Clinical characteristics and smartphone use patterns were assessed at baseline. We enrolled 59 Chinese patients with depression. In 8 weeks, participants interacted with iHOPE for an average of 10.8 (SD=12.3) days; a trend of decreased frequency of use (p=0.03) was observed. Scores of HAM-D at baseline was associated with, of the first 2 weeks, scores of PHQ-9 (p=0.005), EMA of depression (p=0.003) and anxiety (p<0.001), and poorer sleep quality (p=0.023). Among the demographic, clinical and smartphone-use variables examined, only limited internet package for smartphone (<500M per month) predicted higher use of iHOPE (p=0.04). The present study provides initial evidence for the feasibility of smartphone-based EMA in Chinese patients with depression. Level of engagement needs to be improved before determining its clinical usefulness."

In the 30 years between 1981 and 2010, 3414 homicide offenders were the subjected to pre-trial evaluations by experienced psychiatrists, almost half of whom (1596, 46.7%) met the international classification of diseases (ICD) 10 criteria for at least one mental disorder. The six most common individual diagnoses were alcohol dependence (15.9%), acquired organic mental disorder (7.3%), personality disorder (7.1%), schizophrenia (4.4%) and intellectual disability (3.6%). More than one disorder was found in 7.4% of offenders and alcohol dependence was the most frequently diagnosed co-morbid disorder. One in ten offenders were found to be not criminally responsible for their actions. Few homicides involved the use of substances other than alcohol, and firearms were used in 1.6% of homicides. The finding that people with mental disorders other than psychosis committed a high proportion of homicides in a region with a high rate of homicide, suggests that people with mental disorders are vulnerable to similar sociological factors to those that contribute to homicide offences by people who do not have mental disorder."

The subjects (25 patients with schizophrenia and 25 healthy controls) participated in two experiment examining the effects of the spatial location of stimuli and the action-relevance of objects. The results showed that the effect of spatial compatibility was similar in both the patients and the controls, whereas the influence of action-relevant objects was not highlighted in either patients with chronic schizophrenia or healthy controls.

Increasingly, it has been recognized to be impaired in people with schizophrenia, resulting in functional problems. Correspondingly, the past ten years have seen huge developments in the study of interventions to ameliorate social cognitive deficits among people with schizophrenia. In the present review, we systematically reviewed published studies on social cognitive interventions from 2005 to 2015. Of the 61 studies included in this review, 20 were on broad-based social cognitive interventions, which incorporated neurocognitive training, specialized learning technique or virtual reality social skills training. On the other hand, 31 studies on targeted interventions either focused on specific social cognitive domains, or a range of domains. Improvements in emotion processing and theory of mind were often reported, while social perception and attributional style were less frequently measured. Both broad-based and targeted interventions achieved gains in social functioning, albeit inconsistently. Lastly, nine studies on the use of oxytocin and one study on transcranial direct current stimulation reported positive preliminary results in higher-order cognition and facial affect recognition respectively. This review revealed that a wide range of social cognitive interventions is currently available and most have shown some promise in improving social cognition outcomes. However, there is a need to use a common battery of measurements for better comparisons across interventions. Future research should examine combination therapies and the sustainability of gains beyond the intervention period."

The study included 32 subjects with depression and 77 subjects without any psychiatric diagnosis who presented with self-harm and 50 healthy controls. Compared to healthy controls, those with self-harm irrespective of presence or absence of psychiatric diagnosis less often used positive religious coping and more often used negative religious coping. Further, among those without psychiatric diagnosis (with self harm), there was positive correlation of negative religious coping with impulsivity and hopelessness. Among those without psychiatric diagnosis with self-harm, both positive and negative religious coping correlated positively with depressive scores, severity of suicidal ideations, anxiety and irritability, but associations were stronger for negative religious coping than that for positive religious coping. The findings of the present study suggest that those who indulge in self harm have lower use of positive religious coping and higher use of negative religious coping."

To study the efficacy of atomoxetine in treating adult ADHD compared to placebo, we performed a Medline search for English language publications of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing atomoxetine to placebo for adult ADHD using the keywords “adult ADHD”, “atomoxetine” and “placebo”. A total of 41 RCTs were returned of which we included 13 relevant RCTs reporting data on 1824 patients with adult ADHD in the analysis. Standardized mean difference between atomoxetine and placebo for the mean baseline-to-endpoint change in total ADHD scores, impulsivity/hyperactivity and inattention scores was calculated, with a 95% confidence limit. Atomoxetine had superior efficacy than placebo on overall adult ADHD scores [−0.45; 95% CI −0.54, −0.35; overall effect p<0.00001]. Atomoxetine was superior to placebo on the domains of both inattention [−0.42; 95% CI −0.49, −0.35; overall effect p<0.00001] and impulsivity/hyperactivity [−0.36; 95% CI −0.44, −0.29; overall effect p<0.00001].

In order to test the coping flexibility hypothesis, which posits that flexible coping produces adaptive outcomes, the relationship between coping flexibility and the risk of depression was examined in the context of Indian adults. Participants (150 men and 150 women) answered questionnaires measuring coping flexibility and depressive symptoms. The risk of depression was assessed using a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score of 10 and a Center for Epidemiologic Studies’ Depression Scale score of 16 as cut-off points. Logistic regression analyses of the score cut-off points revealed that higher levels of coping flexibility were associated with lower risks of depression, after controlling for the effects of gender, age, and marital status. Overall, the coping flexibility hypothesis was supported in this Indian adult sample. These findings might contribute to preventing recurrent depression and to attenuating depressive symptoms."

The five-factor model of personality includes neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness to experience. The present study aimed to examine the relationship between the Big Five dimensions and mental health considering the mediating role of alexithymia as an important emotional-processing construct. A total of 257 participants were recruited from non-clinical settings in the general population. All participants completed the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI), 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), and General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28). Structural equation modeling was utilized to examine the hypothesized mediated model. Findings indicated that the Big Five personality dimensions could significantly predict scores of alexithymia. Moreover, alexithymia could predict mental health scores as measured by indices of depression, anxiety, social functioning, and somatic symptoms. The fit indices (GFI=0.94; CFI=0.91; TLI=0.90; RMSEA=0.071; CMIN/df=2.29) indicated that the model fits the data. Therefore, the relationship between the Big Five personality dimensions and mental health is mediated by alexithymia."

High risk of burnout in healthcare workers has long been recognized. However, there are no methods to predict vulnerability to burnout.
Methods
We examined whether temperament and character are associated with burnout and depressive state in residents by using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). The TCI was used for residents at the beginning of clinical training and then the Maslach Burnout Inventory–General Survey (MBI–GS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) were administered at the beginning of clinical training and after four and ten months. Participants were 85 residents who started clinical training after graduating from the University of Miyazaki Hospital in April 2012 and 2013.
Results
After ten months, 23.5% of participants were newly identified with burnout using the MBI-GS and 15.3% of participants were newly diagnosed with depressive state using the SDS. We found that residents with high Cooperativeness were significantly more prone to burnout and that residents with high Harm Avoidance and low Self-Directedness were significantly more prone to depressive states.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that the TCI can predict not only the risk for future depressive state but also the risk for future burnout. We feel it is important for the resident education system to identify residents with these temperament and character traits and to help high-risk residents avoid burnout and depressive state."

Seven hypotheses were formulated for verification. A total of 717 students were recruited following the multistage cluster sampling method, and data were collected by a specially designed structured questionnaire, academic achievement record and a standardized University Students Depression Inventory. Findings disclosed that 37.7%, 13.1%, and 2.4% of the students were suffering from moderate, severe, and extremely severe depression. A significant difference was found across semester, that is, semester II students reported a higher level of depression than semester III students. So far as academic stream is concerned, students from humanities and social science were found to be suffering from more depression compared to students from science and management streams. The study further disclosed that the students who reported positive views about the university academic environment and living arrangements had lower level of depression compared to their counterparts. Personal resilience’s such as being able to sharing personal problems with others and doing regular exercise were found to be associated with positive mental health. The findings of the study emphasize the need for immediate mental health support services for about 15.6% of the students who were either suffering from severe or extremely severe depression at the University."

Schizophrenia patients with significant auditory hallucinations (N=15) and healthy controls (N=15) performed the auditory signal detection task wherein they were instructed to differentiate between a 5-s burst of plain white noise and voiced-noise. The analysis showed that false alarms (p=0.02), discriminability index (p=0.001) and decision bias (p=0.004) were significantly different between the two groups. There was a significant negative correlation between false alarm rate and decision bias. These findings extend further support for impaired perceptual expectation system in schizophrenia patients."

We evaluated prevalence of aggressive behaviour and coercive measures on an acute Indian psychiatric ward where relatives are always present at the ward.
Method
Non-interacting, independent observers (specifically trained mental health clinicians) on an Indian acute, 20-bedded psychiatric ward gave structured reports on all violent episodes and coercive measures during a 30-day period. They used the Staff Observation Aggression Scale −Revised, Indian (SOAS-RI). The severity of the SOAS-RI reports were independently analysed by one of the authors.
Results
229 violent incidents were recorded, involving 63% of admitted patients. 27% of all admitted patients were subjected to intravenous injections. Relatives provoked 35% of the incidents and were the target in 56% of the incidents. Patientś own relatives were involved in managing the aggression in 35% of the incidents. Relatives of other patients were involved in 14% of the incidents. The likelihood of a patient to be physically restrained and that a relative would be participating in the coercive measures was increased when medical staff was targeted.
Conclusion
Relatives are commonly triggers and victims of aggressions on the inverstigated acute Indian psychiatric wards. Doctors and nurses are less likely to be victims but aggression towards them leads more commonly to coercive measures."

Although there are differences in cognitive domains by training targets, almost all neurocognitive remediation trainings in Korea have beneficial effects on early visual processing, various attention types, and executive function. Future studies need to investigate the mechanisms and various mediators underlying the relationships between cognitive functions and functional outcomes. With more comprehensive cognitive and social cognitive programs, we can enhance both cognition and functional outcomes of the patients with schizophrenia."

abstract = "Aim
Aripiprazole (ARP) is a popular antipsychotic drug that has demonstrated ameliorative effects on hyperprolactinemia. However, no study to date has studied the utility of ARP in patients with a long history of schizophrenia and antipsychotic treatment. We therefore examined the effect of partial antipsychotic regimen replacement with ARP on hyperprolactinemia induced by chronic antipsychotic use in patients with schizophrenia.
Methods
Sixteen patients with a schizophrenia diagnosis (F2) based on the International Classification of Diseases (version 10) were recruited. At months 0, 1, 3, and 6 of the study, serum prolactin, body weight, and blood glucose were measured, and QOL and psychotic symptoms were assessed using Global Assessment of Functioning scores and Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement (CGI-I) scores.
Results
Nine patients with an average age of 46.7±9.6 years and mean disease duration of 15.9±10.4 years were included in the final analysis. Serum prolactin levels significantly decreased and GAF and CGI-I scores improved significantly over the 6-month period after partial replacement with ARP. Additionally, no changes were observed in body weight or blood glucose over the 6-month period.
Conclusion
Partial antipsychotic regimen replacement with ARP improves hyperprolactinemia, and may improve the QOL of patients with a long history of schizophrenia.

Not much is known about sexual function in women with schizophrenia even though it may have a significant impact on their quality of life and maybe influenced by several factors.
Aims and objectives
This study aimed to assess the frequency and nature of sexual dysfunction in women with schizophrenia and study its association with marital quality, illness, treatment, and socio-demographic factors.
Methodology
This was a cross sectional, hospital-based study conducted among 63 women with schizophrenia attending the outpatient services of a tertiary care psychiatric hospital. Sexual dysfunction was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Side effects of medications, psychopathology, and marital quality were assessed using standard scales.
Results
Among the 63 women assessed, 44 (70%) reported sexual dysfunction. Impaired desire was reported by all women, impaired arousal by 58 (92.1%), poor lubrication by 30 (47.6%), impaired orgasm by 48(76.2%) poor satisfaction by 44(69.8%) and pain by 23(36.5%). Poor Marital quality (‘p’ value-0.001), higher scores on general psychopathology of the Positive and Negative symptoms scale of schizophrenia (PANSS) (‘p’ value-0.049) and side effects such as weight gain, menstrual disturbances, galactorrohea and dry vagina were significantly associated with Female Sexual Dysfunction (FSD) in univariate analysis. However, multivariate analysis found marital quality alone to be significantly related to FSD."

abstract = "Objective
Although psychoeducation has been found effective for improving the life functioning of patients with schizophrenia in high income countries, there have been relatively few studies of schizophrenia psychoeducation adapted for low and middle-income countries (LMIC), particularly in Southeast Asia. The present study assessed effects of the Family Schizophrenia Psychoeducation Program (FSPP) among Vietnamese patients and their families on the patients’ (1) quality of life and (2) medication non-compliance, and the family and patients’ (3) stigma towards schizophrenia, and (4) consumer satisfaction.
Method
This intervention study involved 59 patients, and their families, from the Da Nang Psychiatric Hospital, randomly assigned to treatment (n=30) or control (n=29) conditions. Control subjects received services as usual (antipsychotic medication); treatment group subjects received the FSPP as well. Blind-rater assessments were conducted at T1 immediately after project enrollment (prior to participating in the FSPP) and at T2 six months later.
Results
There were significant treatment effects on: (1) quality of life, (2) stigma, (3) medication compliance, and (4) consumer satisfaction, with all effects favoring the treatment group. Effect sizes were moderate to large.
Conclusions
This psychoeducation program appears to reduce stigma, improve quality of life and medication compliance, and increase consumer satisfaction of Vietnamese patients with schizophrenia and their families, beyond the effects of antipsychotic medication. It involves relatively little cost, and it may be useful for it or equivalent programs to be implemented in other hospitals in Viet Nam, and potentially other low-income Asian countries to improve the lives of patients with schizophrenia."

This study compared the knowledge, attitude and social distancing practices of the young undergraduate sub-population towards mental illness. A cross-sectional survey was done using a pretested questionnaire, which in addition to demographic details assessed exposure, knowledge, attitude and social distancing practices for mental illnesses. The study included (N=289; 55% Females; Average age 20.5 years) responses from nearly equal number of students from medical, psychology and other courses. Medical students chiefly attributed mental illness to biological factors while students from other courses perceived mental illness as God's punishment. More medical students believed that mental illnesses can be successfully treated and appeared to have less social distancing from the mentally ill. Males mostly reported stress and brain damage as the causative factors while females attributed mental illnesses to other biological factors. Males were found to be less afraid of a communication with mentally ill and more open to the possibility of marriage with someone suffering from a mental illness. Exposure to information about mental illness led to no significant variation in the studied variables. Thus, demographic variables and the academic course contribute to variations in knowledge and attitude of young adults. Education received by medical students has a positive impact on their attitudes, highlighting the need of introduction of informative awareness measures among other courses as well."

In the present study we aimed to investigate, whether an association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and clinical features and affective temperaments exists or not in first manic episode of bipolar disorder (BD) and to clarify the prevalence and predictors of MetS.
Method
A total of 150 patients who were received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder type I according to DSM-IV criteria and who were experiencing their first manic episode (FME) were screened consecutively for inclusion. NCEP ATP III formulated an operational definition of MetS based on the presence of three or more of the following characteristics: abdominal obesity (waist circumference), hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL or being on an antilipidemic agent, high blood pressure or being on an antihypertensive agent, and fasting hyperglycemia or being on antiglycemic agent. The patients who had been in remission period for at least 8 weeks were evaluated with SKIP-TURK and TEMPS-A. Remission was defined as YMRS score <5.
Results
37 (32.5%) patients had a MetS. Previous depressive episode, seasonality, negative family history and childhood trauma are determined as the predictors of MetS. Anxious and irritable temperament scores were higher in MetS (+) patients.
Conclusion
According to our results, links between MetS and BD may also have been predicted by genetic and environmental factors."

This research aimed to determine if a relationship existed between sleep problems in patients with schizophrenia and with depression and their reduced working memory (WM) performance. Thirty outpatients with schizophrenia, 30 outpatients with depression, and 30 healthy control participants were enrolled in this study. All participants completed a sleep questionnaire (i.e., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), two simple WM tasks tapping only its storage component (i.e., digit span forward and backward task), and two complex WM tasks tapping both its storage and processing components (i.e., letter-number sequencing and reading span task). The results showed that neither psychiatric group differed from the healthy controls on simple WM tasks. Patients with schizophrenia did not differ from those with depression in the performance of simple or complex WM tasks. However, patients with schizophrenia, and, to a lesser degree, patients with depression performed significantly worse than the healthy control participants on complex WM tasks, which was visible in lower WM scores for patients with depression and in slower information processing, as well, for patients with schizophrenia. Finally, a significant negative relationship was found between the PSQI score and the reading span task scores; thus, participants with worse performance tended to report more sleep problems. To conclude, sleep needs to receive more priority when treating patients with depression and especially patients with schizophrenia because better sleep improves (working) memory performance and daily functioning."

Participants were 784 adolescents aged 13–15 years. They completed self-report questionnaires that assessed (1) Non-Suicidal Self-Injury: the Self-Harm Questionnaire, Toronto Alexithymia Scale; (2) depression: Children’s Depression Inventory; (3) adolescent-parent relationship: Parental Bonding Instrument; (4) peer attachment: Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment; and (5) academic stress. Overall, 12.4% (n=97) of participants reported engaging in self-destructive behavior at least once in their lives. The primary reason for engaging in self-harm was to regulate negative emotions such as anger and sadness. As expected, the self-harm group showed statistically significant higher levels of academic stress, alexithymia, depression, and poor relationships with their parents and peers. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that alexithymia, depression, and peer relations were significant predictors of self-harming behavior. Given that the primary reason for engaging in self-harm is to cope with negative emotions, mental health professionals in school settings should regularly evaluate self-injurious behavior and provide prevention programs for adolescents at risk."

abstract = "Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) is the commonest type of dementia presenting with initial episodic memory decline followed by involvement of other cognitive domains. Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is one of the variants of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) characterized by the atypical presentation of relatively persevered memory in the initial stage. PCA is an uncommon early onset dementia affecting adults between 50 and 65 years. It presents predominantly with visuo-spatial and visuo-perceptual deficits. PCA is a phenotype with varied etiology most common being Alzheimer’s disease. The complex and atypical presentation with preserved memory and insight in patients with PCA poses challenge to clinicians in diagnosing at initial stages. There is also paucity of research on prevalence, course, prognosis and management of PCA. In this article we describe a middle aged gentlemen presenting with clinical features suggestive of PCA. We also discussed relevant literature."

Though this he syndrome has been associated with organic cerebral dysfunction particularly of the right hemisphere, most cases occur in the setting of schizophrenia. Here we report a schizophrenic patient who developed Frégoli syndrome."

Knowledge of QOL domains mainly impaired in OCD could provide specific areas for intervention. The current meta-analysis assessed differences in global, work and social, family, and emotional QOL outcomes between patients with OCD and heathy controls. Age, gender and OCD severity were examined as moderators. Case–control studies were included if patients with primary OCD were compared with controls on QOL outcomes. Electronic databases (1966–October 2014) were searched. Thirteen case–control studies were included (n=26,015). Patients with OCD had significantly lower scores on QOL relative to controls, with moderate effect sizes on global QOL and large effect size on work and social, emotional and family QOL outcomes. Studies using higher percentages of female patients and patients with less severe OCD symptoms reported significantly lower QOL outcomes for patients with OCD than controls. Studies comparing patients with OCD and patients with other psychiatric disorders were not included. Treatments should address QOL in OCD, particularly emotional QOL. Additional strategies targeting QOL should be implemented for female patients with less severe OCD symptoms."

abstract = "Background
Children with chronic non-episodic irritability were frequently diagnosed as suffering from pediatric bipolar disorder. Therefore in DSM-5 a new diagnosis of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) was included for such children.
Aims
This study aimed to identify DMDD in children and adolescents in Indian child and adolescent psychiatry clinic and elicit its phenomenology and co-morbidities.
Methods
Children of 6–16 years, presenting with irritability for more than one year were assessed using DSM 5 diagnostic criteria to make a diagnosis of DMDD. Severity of irritability was assessed using Affective Reactivity index (ARI). Co-morbidities were screened on Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia present and lifetime version (KSADS-PL) and diagnosed as per DSM-IV TR criteria. Overall behavioral problems were assessed on Conner's parent symptom questionnaire (CPSQ) and impairment in functioning on children's global assessment of functioning scale(C-GAS).
Results
21 subjects were diagnosed with DMDD. Majority of the subjects (15, 71.4%) were in the age group 6–12 years (mean age11.1±2.9 years) and were males (16, 76.2%). Most common presenting complaints were, frequent irritability and anger outbursts in 21 (100%) and inattention towards studies in 20 (95.2%) subjects. Most of the subjects (18, 85.7%) had moderate to severe irritability. 13 (61.9%) subjects had co-morbidities. Mean CGAS was 46.1±6.9.
Conclusion
DMDD can be diagnosed in Indian children using DSM 5 criteria. Such children presented with complaints of irritability and problems in studies. They commonly had co-morbidities and had moderate impairment of functioning."

C677T polymorphism of MTHFR gene was reported as risk factor for congenital defects, metabolic and neuropsychiatric disorders. Numerous case-control studies investigated C677T polymorphism as risk factor for schizophrenia but results of these studies were contradictory. To draw a conclusion, a meta-analysis of all available case-control studies was performed. PubMed, Google Scholar, Springer Link and Elsevier databases were searched for eligible case-control studies. Pooled odds ratio with 95%CI was used as an association measure and all statistical analyses were performed by Open Meta-Analyst and MIX software. Total 38 studies with 10,069 cases and 13,372 controls were included in the present meta-analysis. Results of meta-analysis showed significant associated between C677T polymorphism and risk of schizophrenia (ORTvsC=1.18, 95%CI=1.10–1.27, p=<0.001; ORCTvsCC=1.10, 95%CI=1.04–1.17, p=<0.001; ORTTvsCC=1.40, 95%CI=1.20–1.64, p=<0.001; ORTT+CTvsCC=1.19, 95%CI=1.09–1.30, p=<0.001). We also performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Subgroup analysis was done according to ethnicity and significant association was found between C677T polymorphism and risk of schizophrenia in all three ethnic populations—African (OR=2.51; 95%CI=1.86–3.40; p=<0.001), Asian (OR=1.21; 95%CI=1.10–1.33; p=<0.001) and Caucasian (OR=1.07; 95%CI=1.01–1.14; p=0.01). In conclusion the results of the present meta-analysis suggested that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism is a risk factor for schizophrenia."

Despite the waves of external aid and national concern geared toward improving healthcare services as part of the reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts after the Tsunami, mental health services still require much attention. This paper aims to understand the mental healthcare system in Aceh Province, Indonesia; its main focus is on the burden, on the healthcare system, its development, service delivery and cultural issues from the devastating Tsunami in 2004 until the present. We reviewed those published and unpublished reports from the local and national government, from international instances (UN bodies, NGOs) and from the academic literature pertaining to mental health related programs conducted in Aceh. To some extent, mental health services in Aceh have been improved compared to their condition before the Tsunami. The development programs have focused on procurement of policy, improvement of human resources, and enhancing service delivery. Culture and religious beliefs shape the pathways by which people seek mental health treatment. The political system also determines the development of the mental health service in the province. The case of Aceh is a unique example where conflict and disaster serve as the catalysts toward the development of a mental healthcare system. Several factors contribute to the improvement of the mental health system, but security is a must. Whilst the Acehnese enjoy the improvements, some issues such as stigma, access to care and political fluctuations remain challenging."

We aimed to assess postural sway and flexibility in patients with schizophrenia and identify clinical characteristics. Postural sway (length and range of trunk motion, and Romberg ratio) and flexibility (anteflexion in sitting) were measured in schizophrenia. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Drug Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) were used for the assessment of psychopathology and extrapyramidal symptoms, respectively. Characteristics associated with postural sway and flexibility were examined with regression analysis. A total of 100 patients (68 men, mean±S.D. age: 49.3±13.8 years, PANSS score: 83.4±15.1, DIEPSS score: 2.2±2.2) participated in this study. The anteflexion in sitting was not significantly correlated with length of trunk motion, range of trunk motion, or Romberg ratio. Postural instability was associated with higher DIEPSS overall severity score and PANSS positive symptoms. A significant correlation was also found between less flexibility and increased PANSS negative symptoms. In conclusion, flexibility and postural stability might be regarded as separate elements of physical fitness in schizophrenia. Prospective exercise intervention would be worthy of investigation to enhance postural stability and flexibility in an effort to prevent falls."

For this, patients presenting to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital with self-harm behaviour were evaluated for presence or absence of a psychiatric diagnosis, suicidal intent, personality traits, depressive symptoms and hopelessness by using structured instruments. The present study included 132 participants. The mean age of the sample was 28.7 years and the male: female ratio of 1.28:1. At least one psychiatric diagnosis was present in 41.7% of the sample, depression and substance use disorders being most common among them. Impulsive suicide attempt was present in 40.2% of the sample. Those with a psychiatric diagnosis were more likely to be older, males, married, have higher suicidal intent, more planned attempts and higher depressive symptoms as compared to those who did not have a psychiatric disorder. Impulsive suicide attempters had lower suicidal intent than non-impulsive attempters. Present study suggests that those presenting to the emergency with self-harm behaviour comprises 2 interrelated groups, differing on certain demographic features, severity of depressive symptoms, suicidal intent and impulsivity."

However, there is no consensus about the exact site of stimulation for rTMS. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) offers a potential technique in deciding the site of stimulation. The present study was conducted to assess the difference in outcome of brain SPECT assisted rTMS versus standard protocol of twenty sessions of high frequency rTMS as add on treatment in 20 patients with treatment resistant MDD, given over a period of 4 weeks. Thirteen subjects (group I) received high frequency rTMS over an area of hypoperfusion in the prefrontal cortex, as identified on SPECT, whereas 7 subjects (group II) were administered rTMS in the left dorsoslateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) area. Improvement was monitored using standardized instruments. Patients in the group I showed a significantly better response compared to those in the group II. In group I, 46% of the subjects were responders on MADRS, 38% on BDI and 77% on CGI. The parallel figures of responders in Group II were 0% on MADRS, 14% on BDI and 43% on CGI. There were no remitters in the study. No significant untoward side effects were noticed. The study had limitations of a small sample size and non-controlled design, and all the subjects were also receiving the standard antidepressant therapy. Administration of rTMS over brain SPECT specified area of hypoperfusion may have a better clinical outcome compared to the standard protocol."

Sixty six Iranian (19 men, 47 women) participated in the study. All participants were asked to complete Maudsley Obsessive–Compulsive Inventory, Penn Inventory of Scrupulosity, Perfectionism Cognitions Inventory, the Multidimensional Anger Inventory, and Ego Strength Scale. Results showed that perfectionism and anger were positively correlated with scrupulosity and non-religious obsessive–compulsive symptoms. Ego control was negatively correlated with scrupulosity, while ego resiliency was not correlated with any of these two sets of symptoms. Regression analysis indicated that among these variables, anger was the best predictor of non-religious obsessive–compulsive symptoms, while perfectionism and ego control were the best predictors of scrupulosity."

High incidence of metabolic syndrome has been evidenced in schizophrenia patients. However, gender-specific relationship with risk of metabolic disorders in first-episode schizophrenia has received poor systematic study.
Aim
We aimed at exploring the impact of sex difference on the parameters of glucolipid metabolism in first-episode psychosis schizophrenia (FEP) patients.
Methods
We performed a post hoc analysis of data from our previously performed clinical trial. A total of 60 FEP patients and 28 healthy sex- and age-matched volunteers were included. Blood glucose and lipid metabolic profiles, as well as schizophrenia-related clinical symptoms were assessed. The body mass index, level of blood insulin and the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) were measured.
Results
The FEP patients demonstrated significant increases in blood insulin concentration, insulin resistance and blood triglyceride when compared with healthy controls. In FEP patients, there were no differences in psychopathology measurements between the genders. BMI and HOMA-IR were significantly greater in male vs female FEP patients. In addition, a more severe dyslipidemia was also observed in male FEP patients, including an increased triglyceride level, an augmented LDL content and a decreased HDL concentration. Multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that the gender was significantly correlated to HOMA-IR.
Conclusion
These preliminary results suggest that male FEP patients may be more predisposed to insulin resistance and dyslipidemia than female FEP patients. These results could contribute to the understanding of prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome in FEP patients."

However, some studies from tropical countries including India suggest that the patients experience a greater proportion of manic episodes than depressive episodes. The aim of the present study was to examine the course of BD type 1 (BD I) in a sample of hospitalized Indian subjects. We examined the clinical course of 285 BD I subjects with at least 5 years of illness using standard life charting method. These subjects were hospitalized between October 2010 and October 2012. The predominant polarity (having at least two-thirds of their lifetime episodes at one polarity) was mania (79%). Unipolar mania (≥ 3 mania episodes and no episodes of depression) was observed in 48% of the subjects. The frequency of rapid cycling course was noted in 2.5% of the subjects. Predominant manic polarity group had the illness onset mostly with a manic episode (88.9%) and the predominant depressive polarity group with a depressive episode (73.8%). Mania was the predominant polarity with a high rate of unipolar mania and a majority of the subjects had greater number of manic episodes than depressive/mixed episodes. The onset polarity determined the predominant polarity during the course of illness. Predominantly, mania course could have significant implications in the treatment of bipolar disorder."

Electroencephalographic (EEG) mu activity is a neural marker of the mirror neuron system. This study investigated the mu activity, localization of its sources and functional connectivity, which was induced while watching reciprocal social interactive motion across various degrees of complexity. Eighteen healthy participants underwent high-resolution EEG recording using 256-channels while they watched a specifically designed, culture specific, video task that showed two persons interacting socially using body gestures. Task complexity was determined by (1) whether there was an identical gestural response or a non-identical one; (2) whether the participant watched two persons interacting or was virtually involved in the interaction. Source localization and functional connectivity analysis was conducted for mu activity across various tasks. We also correlated mu activity and functional connectivity measures with serum BDNF. We found that spectral densities in various brain sources of mu activity and their increased functional connectivity distinguished identical and non-identical reciprocal expression observations, while mu suppression alone did not discriminate various degrees of complexities. These findings might have important implications in the understanding of mechanisms underlying mirror neuron dysfunction in various psychiatric disorders."

But the evidence regarding the direction and strength of the association between these two disorders, for both adult men and women, are remain inconclusive. We systematically reviewed publications from five different databases: Pubmed, Embase, BIOSIS, CINAHL and PsychINFO. A total of 21 articles were included for the systematic review and 19 of them for the meta-analysis using a bias-adjusted (quality effect) model. This resulted in the inclusion of approximately 226,063 (33.7% men) participants. Those who were depressed had a 37% (RR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.48) increased risk of being obese, and who were obese had an 18% increased risk of being depressed (RR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.35). Those who were depressed had a 2% (RD: 0.02, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.03) excess risk of obesity, however, the reciprocal associations were not significant. The association between overweight and depression was not found significant in either direction. Both men and women were at risk of obesity and depression bi-directionally. In sensitivity analyses bi-directional associations were more pronounced among young and middle aged adults and in studies with longer follow-up. The findings of this study suggest that the strength of the association is greater for the direction leading from depression to obesity and this link was more pronounced for young and middle aged women."

Demographic information checklist and Cloninger’ Temperament and Character inventory (TCI) were two instruments applied in the study. SPSS software V.19 and tests independent t-tests, Chi squared and Spearman correlation coefficient were used for data analysis with significant level of <0.05. The average of innovativeness variables (M:74.12), harm avoidance (M: 65.17), reward dependence (M:50.030), and self-directedness (M:35.02) in case group in comparison with control group was significantly higher, and there was a significant difference between two groups variables (P-0.000). The novelty seeking had the highest average in the AIDS patients with a history of addiction (M:74.00), and there was statistically significant difference between perseverance variable (P-0.021) and cooperativeness variable (P-0.041) in the two groups of AIDS patients. There was a significant relationship between novelty seeking and age at the onset of AIDS (P-0.038), harm avoidance and age at the onset of addiction (P-0.046), persistence and age at the onset of AIDS (P-0.035) and the time infected with HIV (P-0.033). It is found that two groups are different due to the personalities, so it is essential to consider the personality traits in order to prevent AIDS and also successfully treat patients suffering from AIDS."

To study the clinical features of children with history of sexual abuse.
Method
A chart review of 40 children (<16 years) with history of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) evaluated at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at NIMHANS during a three year period.
Results
52.5% (N=21) of the children came from broken families. The most common form of abuse was contact penetrative (67.5%) followed by contact non-penetrative abuse (30%). Seventy-Five percent (N=30) had a psychiatric diagnosis at baseline and 37.5% of these children had comorbidities. The commonest diagnoses were Depressive Disorder (35%) followed by Stress related disorders – PTSD and Acute Stress Disorder (25%). Children abused multiple times were more likely to have psychiatric illness following CSA. Children abused by multiple perpetrators were more likely to have depression, psychiatric comorbidity and more prone to exhibit sexualized behaviour. Sixty five percent of children did not follow up 8 weeks after the initial consultation.
Discussion
Psychiatric morbidity is high in the population of children with history of CSA. It is necessary to assess the risk factors, circumstances of abuse along with psychiatric morbidity in order provide flexible and tailor made interventions for this population. In order to ensure the best possible care for these families, focused and time limited intervention that respect the needs of the child and addresses the ground realities of the circumstances of the family and the health system are the need of the day."

The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with non-fatal self-poisoning in Sri Lanka across three different age groups (namely 14–24 years, 25–34 years and ≥35 years). It was anticipated that the findings of the study would inform and guide development of preventive interventions for non-fatal self-poisoning in this country. 935 participants were interviewed within one week of admission to hospital for medical management of non-fatal self-poisoning, over a consecutive 14-month period. Socio-demographic factors, types of poison ingested, triggers and psychiatric morbidity was examined as a function of age. Results showed that a majority (83%) of participants were aged below 35 years. Younger participants aged <25 years were significantly more likely to ingest medicinal overdoses, compared to older persons (aged 25–34 years, and ≥35 years), who were more likely to ingest pesticides. Recent interpersonal conflict was a proximal trigger seen in all age groups, but suicidal intent, depression and alcohol use disorders increased with age. The overall study findings indicate that most who carry out acts of non-fatal self-poisoning in Sri Lanka are young (aged <35 years). Interpersonal conflict as a trigger is common to all age groups, but psychiatric morbidity and suicidal intent is higher in the older age groups, as is pesticide ingestion. Age specific interventions may be efficacious in the prevention of non-fatal self-poisoning in Sri Lanka."

We measured impulsivity in 60 subjects with bipolar disorder in relationship to socio-demographic and clinical variables. The subjects completed Data included socio-demographic details and clinical variables, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) in an Arabic version to assess impulsivity, The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview “MINI” version 05 to screen for alcohol abuse or dependence and mood graphic rate scale (MGRS) to evaluate mood state. Our results show that the mean score of BIS-11 was 71.5. Fifty-five per cent of the patients had a high level of impulsiveness. No differences were found relating to mood state. Impulsivity was related to Male gender, lower educational level, early age of onset, smoking, alcohol and drug misuse and prior suicide attempts.

The mean total BSQ scores of Bs were significantly higher than NBs, with both being significantly higher than the published normative score but lower than probable bulimics with no significant B vs. NB difference in mean total OFA scores. Because the Bs were significantly taller and reported more orthodontic treatment than NBs, the possible confounding by the higher economic status of the Bs was minimized by finding similar significantly higher BSQ scores for the small number of Bs (5%) than the remaining NBs (95%) in the documented lower socio-economic school. In summary, the experience of boarding in religion-dominated schools significantly increases body image concerns of adolescent females."

abstract = "Background
The current Mental Health Care Bill (MHCB) –2013 in India advocates least restrictive alternatives (LRA) in psychiatric treatment. However, we have little evidence on patient's perspectives of coercion and LRA.
Methodology
This was a hospital-based prospective pilot study. 170 subjects chosen by computer-generated random number sampling were screened. In 83 eligible subjects, all assessments including coercion assessment were completed within 3 days of admission and in 75 subjects reassessment was done within 3 days of discharge.
Results
Perceived coercion as measured by the MacArthur Perceived Coercion Scale (MPCS) decreased significantly from 3.72±1.98 at admission to 1.77±1.8 (<0.001) at discharge. This was accompanied by significant increase in global functioning, insight score (from 1.5±1.0 to 3.8±1.1; p<0.001) and as well as decrease in symptom severity (CGI-S) (from 5.9±1.1 to 1.8±1.9; p<0.001). Coercion is predicted by family type, employment status, socio economic status, severity of illness and level of insight. 87% patients reported that their admission was justified even though many felt coerced during hospital stay.
Conclusion
Coercion is a dynamic state and changes with treatment and care. Clinical care may result in an improvement in global functioning, insight as well as in reduction in severity of illness consequently leading to less coercion. During the time of discharge, majority of patients reported that their admission was justified, even though they felt coerced during hospital stay and agreed for treatment against their will within a safe, standardised coercive practice."

However, the available literature on Internet usage and eating disorders is scarce, especially in the area of social media and smartphone application (“app”) usage. This study looked at the Internet and smartphone app usage patterns of participants who presented with an eating disorder in Singapore, and whether it corresponded to severity of illness. Individuals who presented to the Eating Disorders clinic at the Singapore General Hospital completed a self-reported questionnaire on Internet and app usage. They also completed the EDE-Q, EAT-26 and CIA 3.0. 55 participants completed the study. 41.8% had anorexia nervosa, 34.5% had bulimia nervosa, and 9.1% were ED-NOS. 41.8% felt that apps helped to perpetuate their illness while 32.7% felt that the apps were helpful for recovery. Overall, any smartphone application usage was associated with younger age and greater eating disorder psychopathology and psychosocial impairment. While 30.9% had encountered eating disorder-related content on Facebook, only 12.7% visited Facebook groups related to eating disorders. For YouTube, “Cooking and Food” and “Beauty and Fashion” videos were among the top 3 types of videos that participants watched. In conclusion, Internet and smartphone app usage is significant, and they are associated with greater severity of illness. It is necessary to include interventions in this aspect as part of treatment of eating disorders."

A reason for this could be the lack of valid assessment instruments adapted for the diverse cultures and languages of the country. One of the most widely used and accepted questionnaires to assess internalized stigma is the 29-item Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale. The aim of the present study was to translate and adapt the ISMI to the Malayalam-speaking population of Kerala, India and to assess its content and factorial validity. The content validity of the Malayalam-language ISMI was studied through interviews with 7 experts on stigma in India. Factorial validity was examined by means of a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) based on a cross-sectional survey among 290 patients with mental illness attending follow-up outpatient and primary care clinics in Kerala, India. The expert panel concluded that the items of the translated questionnaire adequately represent internalized stigma in the Malayalam-speaking population of Kerala. The theorized factor structure of the ISMI consisting of five factors showed a suboptimal model fit (WRMR=0.940; TLI=0.971, CFI=0.948; RMSEA=0.059) which improved considerably after removal of the stigma resistance factor and three items with poor factor loadings (WRMR=0.819; TLI=0.982, CFI=0.966; RMSEA=0.051). Although our study identifies some sources of model ill-fit, it shows that a reduced version of the Malayalam-language ISMI can be a valuable tool for the study of internalized stigma in this cultural setting."

abstract = "Objective
To study the phenomenology, social, adaptive and global functioning of children and adolescents with OCD.
Background
Studies have shown varying prevalence of paediatric OCD ranging from 1% to 4%. Childhood-onset OCD have some important differences in sex distribution, presentation, co-morbidities and insight.
Materials and methods
25 subjects (6 to ≤18 years) with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of OCD were included in this study. Subjects were evaluated using K-SADS-PL, Children's Y-BOCS, HoNOSCA, C-GAS and VABS-II.
Results
The mean age of the sample was 14.9±2.2 years. Obsession of contamination was commonest (68%) followed by aggressive obsession (60%); commonest compulsions were washing and cleaning (72%) followed by checking (56%). Most distressing obsessions were obsession of doubt about their decision (28%), having horrible thoughts about their family being hurt (20%) and thought that something terrible is going to happen and it will be their fault (16%). Most subjects rate spending far too much time in washing hands (60%) as most distressing compulsion, followed by rewriting and checking compulsions (both 12%). 76% subjects have co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis. Anxiety disorders (24%), depression (16%), and dissociative disorder (16%) were common co-morbidities. Mean C-GAS score of the sample was 53.2±9.9. 44% of subjects had below average adaptive functioning.
Conclusions
The study shows that, most frequent obsessions and compulsions may be different from most distressing ones and this finding might have clinical implication. Most of the children and adolescent with OCD have co-morbidities. Children also had problems in adaptive functioning."

This paper describes the prevalence of heart disease with mental disorders and other chronic physical conditions among the Singapore resident population. Data were from the Singapore Mental Health Study which was a representative, cross-sectional epidemiological survey undertaken with 6616 Singapore residents, between December 2009 and December 2010. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview Version 3.0 was used to establish the diagnosis of mental disorders, while a chronic medical conditions checklist was used to gather information on 15 physical conditions, including various forms of heart disease. Health-related quality of life was measured using the Euro-Quality of Life Scale (EQ-5D). The lifetime prevalence of heart disease was 2.8%. Socio-demographic correlates of heart disease included older age, Indian ethnicity, secondary education (vs. tertiary) and being economically inactive. After adjusting for socio-demographic variables and other comorbid physical and mental disorders, the prevalence of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder were significantly higher among those with heart disease, as were diabetes, arthritis, kidney failure and lung disease. These findings highlight important associations between heart disease and various socio-demographic correlates, mental disorders and physical conditions. Given the high prevalence of mood disorders among heart disease patients, timely and appropriate screening and treatment of mental disorders among this group is essential."

In order to reduce disease burden, to improve quality of life and to provide holistic care, it is important to know about the relationship between schizophrenia and CVD. The objective of this review is to explore the extent of CVD problems, relevant risk factors and potential measures for early diagnosis and prevention of CVD among patients with schizophrenia. Worldwide studies show that patients with schizophrenia have a higher mortality and lower life expectancy than the general population. CVD is the leading cause of increased mortality in schizophrenia. Common CVD risk factors in schizophrenia include metabolic syndrome, sedentary behaviour, tobacco smoking, effects of antipsychotics, long chain omega-3 fatty acid deficiency and shared genetics between CVD and schizophrenia. The potential methods for early detection and prevention of CVD in schizophrenia are also discussed. Though the patients with schizophrenia form a high risk group for CVD, consensus guidelines for early detection and prevention of CVD in schizophrenia are lacking. Comorbidity of CVD in schizophrenia needs more serious attention by clinicians and researchers."

Adult patients with bipolar I disorder of manic or mixed type fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria and who were in the continuation phase were included. Safety (primary outcome) was assessed by incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (AEs). Effectiveness (secondary outcome), was evaluated by proportion of patients who did not have a relapse, change in Clinical Global Impression Score-BP version-Severity of Illness (CGI-BP) and Young's Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score. Data was recorded at three visits: visit-1 (baseline), visit-2 (end of 2 months±7 days) and visit-3 (end of 4 months±14 days), and summarised using descriptive statistics. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 489 and 468 patients were included in the safety and effectiveness analyses, respectively. Of the 66 AEs reported, 57 (89.0%) were mild and 7 (10.9%) were moderate (data missing for 2 events). In total, 75.0% (48/64) of the AEs were related to the study drug. No serious AEs reported (N=64). No relapse observed in 93.3% of patients. There was a significant (p<0.0001) reduction in the YMRS and CGI-BP scores from baseline to visit-3. Our study confirms the results of earlier studies in terms of good tolerability and effectiveness of divalproex sodium XR containing regimen in this study population."

This study compared NSS and cognitive functions in euthymic Bipolar I Disorder (BPI) cases to their non-affected first degree relatives and healthy controls. We also investigated the association between NSS and cognitive functions in these three groups. NSS were assessed in three groups using Neurological Evaluation Scale-revised (NES-r). Eight cognitive domains were assessed in 31 euthymic BPI cases, their 30 non-affected first degree relatives and 30 healthy controls using Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB). Euthymic BPI patients had significantly more NSS than non-affected first degree relatives on 5/7 tests (p-value ranges from 0.042 to p=0.0001) and healthy controls on all tests (p-value from 0.042 to <0.0001). Non-affected first degree relatives and controls did not have any significant difference. BPI participants performed worse than their non-affected first degree relatives on one neurocognitive domain of CNB (spatial memory accuracy, p=0.03) and healthy controls on four domains (spatial memory accuracy (p=0.04), abstraction and mental flexibility efficiency (p=0.04), spatial memory efficiency (p=0.04), and emotion efficiency (p=0.04). Non-affected relatives and healthy controls were similar on neurocognitive domains. Accuracy and efficiency indices of some specific cognitive domains were negatively associated with AV rating and tap copying NSS ratings."

It has been poorly studied in low-middle income countries such as India both within acute care as well as long stay settings. 272 psychiatry admissions had 19.9% prevalence of agitation with the most common form being non goal directed physical agitation (13.6%). Episodes of agitation were most likely to occur on the 3rd or 2nd day of admission. Substance abuse [O.R.=2.51(1.05–5.99)] and the presence of persecutory delusions [O.R.=2.62(1.34–5.15)] were independently associated with agitation. It is difficult to predict violence in acutely ill individuals and there is evidence that the emergence of more serious aggression may be preceded by milder forms of agitation. Therefore, there is a need to identify various forms of agitation and its correlates. An understanding of these factors may assist in planning appropriate interventions that could improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on caregivers."

Using the ‘Grounded theory’ approach, two major themes were identified as important factors influencing resilience: (1) Family and socially defined roles/responsibilities and in particular adherence to traditionally defined social responsibilities. (2) Participation in rituals and experiencing spirituality. Application and relevance of these themes in promoting resilience among young vulnerable adults are discussed."

The aim of the present study was to translate the instrument into Bangla and validate in Bangladeshi culture. A total of 200 adolescents participated in the study. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the data from 191 participants (88 girls and 103 boys; who provided complete responses) identified a four-factor structure of the HIT with 27 items. The four factors namely ‘Catastrophizing and mislabeling’, ‘Emotional reasoning’, ‘Self-centeredness and blaming’ and ‘Overgeneralization’ together explained 39.611% of the total variance. In line with the original scale we also defined four types of antisocial behavior. The HIT and its factors showed acceptable to good internal consistency (Cronbach's α=.83 for the HIT, and .40–.77 for its factors), and strong construct validity as revealed by the evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. Thus the Bangla version HIT appears to be valid and reliable, and therefore may be used in further research on cognitive distortions and antisocial behaviors in Bangladesh."

Anxiety and depression are reported as the most prevalent psychiatric disorders worldwide. Here, we studied the prevalence of such disorders with co-morbidities of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors in an urban population in Iran.
Methods
5900 people were selected from 15 to 75-years-olds through single-stage cluster sampling. In addition to examining them for CAD risk factors, Beck anxiety and depression inventories were used to measure anxiety and depression symptoms. The standardized population prevalence of such disorders is reported and the predictors of having anxiety or depression were assessed using Poisson regression model.
Results
Overall 25.4% had moderate and 22.7% had severe anxiety. Severe anxiety significantly and constantly increased by age groups (p=0.01). The risk for anxiety was higher among females (Adjusted Risk Ratio, ARR 1.2), and those who were student/soldier (ARR 1.07). Those with high level of physical activity were at lower risk for anxiety (ARR 0.92). The risk of depression (any level) was higher among females (ARR 1.3), those holding high-school level of education (ARR 1.41), and those who used opium either occasionally (ARR 1.17) or frequently (ARR 1.3). Both anxiety and depression were significantly associated with two main CAD risk factors, low physical activity and opium use.
Conclusion
We found that the majority of residents in Kerman, particularly women, are suffering from mild to server depression and anxiety symptoms. Public health interventions to increase public awareness on such symptoms, screening and delivery of prevention and treatment services are required to prevent from the growing burden of such disorders and cardiovascular diseases."

Several authors have studied prevalence of metabolic syndrome (Met-S) in schizophrenia patients. Studies conducted in Indian scenario have shown conflicting results. Community based studies reported extremely low prevalence of metabolic syndrome in contrast to hospital based studies reporting higher rates. In this systematic review we summarize results of studies conducted in India and discuss possible reasons for these discrepancies.
Methods
Literature search was conducted with keywords metabolic, schizophrenia and India in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct database. Studies assessing prevalence of metabolic syndrome using IDF or NCEP-ATP III criteria, conducted in hospital and community setting were included.
Results
Fourteen studies conducted in hospital setting and two studies conducted in community were included for analysis. Pooled prevalence of Met-S in patients with schizophrenia was 29.83%. Pooled prevalence in community based studies was 10.81% significantly lower than in hospital based studies 33.05%. Overall meta-analysis of studies with case control design showed an OR 3.03 for prevalence in cases compared to controls. Except in one study conducted in a rural community, all other studies reported higher prevalence of Met-S in schizophrenia patients compared to controls. Drug-naïve patients had a pooled prevalence of 11.86%.
Conclusion
In India, prevalence rates of Met-S in schizophrenia patients are comparable to the rates reported in western studies. Community based studies highlight a significantly lower prevalence compared to hospital studies. More community based studies will enhance our understanding of prevalence and determinants of Met-S in patients with schizophrenia."

The Cardiac Depression Scale (CDS) has been designed to measure depressive symptoms in patients with heart disease. There is no Arabic version of the CDS. We translated and validated the CDS in an Arabic sample of patients with heart disease.
Methods
Forward and back translation of the CDS was followed by assessment of cultural relevance and content validity. The Arabic version of the CDS (A-CDS) and the Arabic version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (A-HADS) were then administered to 260 Arab in-patients with heart disease from 18 Arabic countries. Construct validity was assessed using exploratory factor analysis with polychoric correlations. Internal consistency was assessed using ordinal reliability alpha and item-to-factor polychoric correlations. Concurrent validity was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient between the A-CDS and the depression subscale of the A-HADS (A-HADS-D).
Results
Cultural relevance and content validity of the A-CDS were satisfactory. Exploratory factor analysis revealed three robust factors, without cross-loadings, that formed a single dimension. Internal consistency was high (ordinal reliability alpha for the total scale and the three factors were .94, .91, .86, and .87, respectively; item-to-factor correlations ranged from .77 to .91). Concurrent validity was high (r=.72). The A-CDS demonstrated a closer to normal distribution of scores than the A-HADS-D.
Limitations
Sensitivity and specificity of the A-CDS were not objectively assessed.
Conclusions
The A-CDS appears to be a valid and reliable instrument to measure depressive symptoms in a representative sample of Arab in-patients with heart disease."

A total of 350 mother–child pairs with children aged between 16 and 30 months were recruited. M-CHAT-R was administered to all mothers to screen for ASD along with risk checklist. Based on screen result children were classified as ASD (high risk) and no ASD (low and medium risk) group. The association between risk factors and screen positivity for ASD was studied using odds ratio. According to our study, 33 (9.4%) screened positive for ASD. Mean age was 21 months. High mean paternal age at birth (P value 0.025), need for resuscitation at birth (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.47–8.10), NICU stay >12h (OR 4.7, 95% CI 2.26–9.94), late initiation of breastfeeding (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.83–8.39), neonatal seizures (OR 11.8, 95% CI 5.38–26.25) were associated with screen positivity for ASD. After adjusting for confounding, neonatal seizures, and maternal concern about child development were associated with increased odds of screening positive for ASD whereas exclusive breast feeding in the first 6 months of life is associated with decreased odds. Screening for ASD in children with above risk factors might help in early initiation of remedial interventions."

abstract = "Background
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder incurs a significant burden on HIV patients in Asia-Pacific countries; however, the incidence is difficult to estimate due to a lack of local epidemiological data. The impact of neurocognitive impairment in HIV patients is often underestimated due to a lack of education and awareness, and there are consequently gaps in the provision of screening and diagnosis to enable earlier intervention to limit neurocognitive impairment.
Method
This review seeks to redress the imbalance by promoting awareness and education among physicians concerning the neurovirulence of HIV and thereby increase screening efforts to improve diagnosis rates and clinical outcomes for underserved patients in this region. The Asia, Australia, and Middle East (AAME) HAND Advisory Board convened expert regional representatives to review current practice and recommend appropriate measures related to the implementation of standardised screening programmes and treatment recommendations to curb the developing HAND epidemic in the region. In particular, we recommend basic neuropsychological testing protocols that could be efficiently introduced into clinical practice for routine screening.
Result
We also propose simple guidelines for the management of HAND. We believe that HAND is a significant and under-reported diagnosis in HIV patients that warrants both greater recognition and further clinical investigation of the underlying pathophysiology and the impact of HIV disease progression, with HAND being associated with worse medication adherence and therefore possibly increased risk of ARV treatment failure.
Discussion
Widespread screening will lead to greater recognition of HAND and earlier intervention, which may lead to improved management strategies in the future."

A sequential exploratory mixed methods design was employed as the main methodology to develop the resilience scale according to the results from qualitative data by analyzing focus group discussions of 13 participants. Then, the scale was administered to 252 substance-dependent women from four substance-treatment centers. The psychometric properties were explored with an index of item objective congruence (IOC), Pearson correlation, second-order confirmatory factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha coefficient to estimate the quantitative data. The qualitative results showed that resilience is defined by three themes: individual, family and community factors, consisted of 13 different categories. The quantitative results also revealed that all 71 items in the resilience scale passed the IOC criteria, convergence and construct validity. The goodness-of-fit indices demonstrated that the resilience model was consistent with the empirical data. (Chi-square=74.28, df=59, p-value=0.08, RMSEA=0.03, SRMR=0.04, NNFI=0.99, CFI=0.99, GFI=0.96). The internal consistency, assessed by a Cronbach's alpha score of 0.92, can be interpreted as demonstrating high reliability. Furthermore, the structure of the resilience scale was confirmed by the available resilience literature. This study can help clinicians gain a more comprehensive understanding regarding the complex process of resilience among substance-dependent women and aid them in providing these women with the appropriate interventions."

Adolescent emotional responses and behaviors are often passed off as growth pangs and academic stress, thereby missing those that need deeper understanding and mental health interventions.
Aim
The aim of the study is to understand mental health status among the school adolescents in Tezpur, Assam.
Materials and methods
The present study was a cross sectional study that used convenience sampling in selection of the schools. A total of 10 schools were selected for the purpose of the study. 1403 Adolescents were selected for data analysis. Socio-Demographic Performa and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ] were administered to the participants.
Results
The results indicated that five predictors (gender, education, family type, academic performance, socio economic status in the family) explained 9.79% of the variance (F=5.040, P<0.000) in total difficulty levels: (Academic performance; β=0.08; t=3.15; P=0.002) and (Socio economic status; β=0.07, t=3.02, P=0.003).
Conclusion
In the study less than one tenth of the participants have some mental health issues and this calls for concern. Schools should have standing operation procedures in place to periodically screen adolescents for mental health related issues."

This selective review examines major cultural themes related to first- and second-generation Asian Indians living in the United States as they impact psychological and psychiatric dysfunction in this population. Specifically, we review the impact of Asian Indian culture on mental health, discuss the impact of acculturation and ethnic identity development on the mental health of Indian-Americans, and focus on typical mental health problems of Asian Indian adolescents, women and elderly in America. Finally, we provide a brief overview of empirically-supported treatment approaches and cultural considerations for additional treatments relevant to this population. This review is intended to provide an important foundation for more systematic empirically-driven investigation into better understanding how Asian Indian cultural themes impact mental health for Indian-Americans, and how to develop effective treatments for these issues in this cultural group."

This study aimed to examine the validity of the Arabic version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) in 149 illicit drug users.
Methods
We calculated α coefficient, inter-item and item-total correlations, coefficients of reproducibility and scalability (CR and CS), item difficulty and discrimination indices.
Results
The DASS-21 had an acceptable reliability; but values of the CR and the CS were less than acceptable. Items varied in difficulty and discrimination; some items are candidates for elimination.
Conclusion
The DASS-21 is a probabilistic and not a deterministic measure of distress; it has problematic items and needs further investigations."

It is a cross-sectional study covering a total of 370 adolescents (182 boys and 188 girls) from six higher secondary schools in Kolkata. The data was gathered by way of a semi-structured questionnaire and three standard psychological tests. Findings revealed that 52.4%, 25.1%, and 12.7% adolescents suffered psychological, physical, and sexual violence in the last year. Older adolescents (aged 17–18 years) suffered more psychological violence than the younger ones (15–16 years) (p<0.05). Sixty nine (18.6%) adolescent students stood witness to violence between adult members in the family. More than three-fifth (61.9%) adolescents experienced at least one type of violence, while one-third (32.7%) experienced physical or sexual violence or both. Whatever its nature is, violence leaves a scar on the mental health of the victims. Those who have been through regular psychological violence reported high anxiety, emotional adjustment problem, and low self-concept. Sexual abuse left a damaging effect on self-concept (p<0.05), while psychological violence or the witnessing of violence prompted high anxiety scores (p<0.05), poor emotional adjustment (p<0.05), and low self-concept (p<0.05). This study stresses the need to provide individual counselling services to the maltreated adolescents of Kolkata so that their psychological traumas can heal and that they can move on in life with new hopes and dreams."

Herbal medicine that is better culturally accepted may play an important role in treatment of depression. In this double blind placebo controlled clinical trial, 40 patients that were suffering from major depression according to DSM-IV criteria were randomly allocated to take either fluoxetine and saffron (20 patients) or fluoxetine and placebo (20 patients). The patients of the two groups were evaluated with Beck depression scale at the beginning of the study and after four weeks. Lipid profile (total Triglyceride (TG) level, total cholesterol level, low density lipoprotein (LDL) level and high density lipoprotein (HDL) level) of the patients also was measured at the beginning and end of the trial. 30 patients (19 in saffron group and 11 in placebo group) completed the study. The two groups improved significantly in depression severity at the end of the study without significant difference (P: 0.560). The lipid profile of the two groups did not change significantly. Our study did not demonstrate antidepressive effects for saffron. We did not observe any lipid lowering effect in saffron group too. Of note is that our study is preliminary and larger studies with more patients and longer duration are needed to prove our results. Clinical trial registration number: IRCT 2013110915334"

There is increasing evidence to suggest that the continuum may begin with Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI). This theory can be important in developing interventions for suicide prevention. However, in India, consistent usage of definitions of various forms of self-directed violent behaviors is lacking. In the present study, we reviewed definitions of various forms of self-directed violent behaviors that have been investigated in India. Further, we compared the usage of these definitions with the usage by WHO. Additionally, we reviewed NSSI research in India. Thirty-eight publications were identified by a comprehensive electronic search undertaken in Indian psychiatry, psychology, and mental health-related databases. Inconsistent definitions of eight self-directed violent behaviors were observed in Indian literature. Agreement on consistent definitions of various forms of self-directed behaviors is essential. Based on the findings of the current review, it can be suggested that culturally relevant large-scale research on NSSI in India is required to confirm the limited evidence that suggests high prevalence of NSSI in India."

abstract = "Background
The association between impulsivity and depressive disorders in adolescence has been little studied at the literature and in our country, yet impulsivity is a major risk factor for suicide. Thus we aimed on this study to evaluate impulsivity in 25 adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder MDD compared to a control sample and to analyze the correlations between impulsivity and clinical features of MDD.
Methods
Employing a matched case–control design, participants included 25 adolescents with MDD and 75 controls. We have administered the Barratt Impulsivity Scale BIS-11 for the two groups to evaluate impulsivity. Semi structured interviews according DSM 5 criteria were conducted for adolescents with MDD. The Child Depressive Inventory CDI was used to measure depressive symptoms in the control sample.
Results
Adolescents with MDD were more impulsive compared to controls according to the BIS-11 in its three domains: motor (24.96±6.26 against 20.6±4.84; p=0.000), attentional (20.88±5.03 against 16.64±3.2; p=0.000) and non planning (28.2±7.26 against 24.44±4.32; p=0.02). Impulsivity was not correlated with clinical features of MDD (suicide attempts, psychiatric comorbidities, antidepressant medication …).
Conclusion
Adolescents with MDD seem to be more impulsive than control subjects regardless their clinical features. Whether it is a specific characteristic or a symptom among others of MDD, impulsivity predicts health-related behaviors and associated damage that need to be detected and prevented in time."

Addictive potential of caffeine has long been reported, still there is lack of awareness about caffeine abuse in India. There is an intense need for appropriate public health regulatory measures and awareness about addictive potential & harms related to caffeine. To the best of our knowledge this is first case from India highlighting several important issues with progressive caffeine abuse resulting in dependence leading to physical, psychological, academic and social consequences; psychotic symptoms during intoxication; predisposing factors as impulsivity and novelty seeking traits in pre-morbid personality; psychosis in family; poor awareness of health hazards even among medical professionals. Widely variable caffeine containing products are available but caffeine content or its safety limit is not mentioned on caffeine products in India. Due to harmful consequences, legal availability to children, growing consumption of caffeine products, it is utmost essential to recognize caffeine as addictive substance and impose regulatory measures on sale, advertisement, maximum caffeine content, health consequences and safety limits of caffeine containing products. Further school teachers, parents and medical practitioners need to be made aware of health hazards of caffeine. Caffeine use shall always be enquired from patients presenting with psychiatric complaints. Further research and survey are required on caffeine use and related problems."

abstract = "Schizophrenia is a heterogenous disorder, and has often been subtyped on the basis of family history of psychotic disorders. Compared to those without, a positive family history is associated with an earlier age of onset, greater structural brain abnormalities and poorer clinical course. Given recent emphasis on mirror neuron system (MNS) in attempting to explain psychopathology in schizophrenia; present analysis tried to tease out differences in MNS functioning between these two groups. With ethical approval, 10 consenting right-handed patients with schizophrenia (ICD-10-DCR; M=8; Drug-naïve=2) were recruited and divided into two groups of five each (M=4, F=1): those with (age 29.40±5.85 years, duration of illness 50.80±30.84 months) and without (age 29.60±5.77 years, duration of illness 43.20±43.76 months) family history of schizophrenic illness (group difference p>0.05). MNS activity was assessed using event-related desynchronization of EEG Mu waves in response to biological motion on 192-channel EEG Neurofax EEG-1100K. On comparison, while patients had significantly lower mu suppression compared to controls (p<0.001); two schizophrenia groups did not differ between themselves, neither on MNS activity nor on psychopathology (p>0.05). Present study replicates finding of a dysfunctional MNS in schizophrenia patients, and represents a preliminary attempt at comparing two groups of symptomatic schizophrenia patients. In both these groups, MNS dysfunctions were comparable, and commensurate with respect to psychopathology. Thus, MNS dysfunction in schizophrenia might either be inherited or acquired. However, this abnormality forms a common base, and ultimate vulnerability marker, for development of psychopathology during active disease states."

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a widely used term for this condition in scientific and lay literature but is not acceptable to many patients because of perceived stigma due to implied psychological causation. CFS has recently been replaced by systemic exercise intolerance disease (SEID) by the Institute of medicine with the objectives of providing and disseminating evidence-based criteria and to provide a more acceptable name for this condition. Simultaneously, changes have taken place in DSM-5 with regards to this condition. Mental health professionals need to be aware of this change in the interests of patient care. The need to replace CFS with SEID and the nosological changes also indicate an inability to do away with the Descartian mind-body dualism despite efforts to the contrary and a need to debate the failure of the bio-psycho-social model to ‘mainstream’ and destigmatize psychiatry."
