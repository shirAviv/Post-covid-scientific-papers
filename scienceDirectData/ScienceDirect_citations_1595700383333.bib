abstract = "Aims
The effect of intentional weight loss on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in overweight and obese patients with heart failure (HF), diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or metabolic syndrome (MS) has not been studied. The purpose of the present study is to assess the short term effects of intentional weight loss on renal function in this population.
Materials and methods
Fifty nine patients were recruited to participate in a 3-month intensive behavioral weight management intervention and received one of two standard structured energy-restricted meal plans (1200 or 1500kcal/day) based on their computed calorie deficit. Weight and renal function (serum creatinine, BUN and estimated glomerular filtration rate based on two formulas – Modification in Renal Disease Study (MDRD), and modified version of Cockcroft-Gault formula reported by Salazar Corcoran for obese patients (absolute and relative formulas) – were evaluated at baseline and at 3 months.
Results
Participants had eGFR in the normal range at baseline and lost an average of 7.56±14.9 pounds (p<0.0001) over 3 months; however, there was no significant reduction in serum creatinine, BUN or eGFR.
Conclusion
This study provides evidence that intentional weight loss in overweight and obese patients with HF along with DM, and/or MS and normal baseline renal function does not adversely affect renal function overtime."

This study, for the first time, has investigated the effect of highly consumed oils in Iran on type 2 diabetic patient's blood pressure.
Materials and methods
After measuring height, weight and blood pressure and calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) of 200 patients (30–65 years old) with type 2 diabetes (26.7% men, 73.3% women) in diabetes center of Natanz, their consumed oil was obtained by questionnaire, and their blood lipid and glucose were also measured. Data analyzed by SPSS 16 software, one-way ANOVA, independent T test, and Means procedure statistic tests.
Results
In mean procedure test, the highest average of systolic and diastolic blood pressure was in patients consumed solid and semi-solid oils; and the lowest was in patients consumed vegetable liquid oils. However, women consumed solid vegetable oils have lower systolic and mean arterial pressures. In one-way ANOVA test, there was a significant relation between consumed oil and hemoglobin A1C (p=0.049) and diastolic blood pressure (p=0.032).
Conclusion
Consumption of solid and semi-solid oils, especially animal fat, cause increasing in blood pressure of diabetic type 2 patients; but consumption of olive oil, and to a lesser extent liquid vegetable oils, related to lesser increasing in their blood pressure."

abstract = "Aim
Non-enzymatic glycation impairs the structural and functional characterstics of human serum albumin (HSA) native conformation. Prolonged hyperglycemia causes cross links formation in proteins that may contribute to progression of diabetic complications.
Methods
HSA (20μM) was incubated with different concentration of d-glucose100, 200, 300 and 400mg/dl for a period of 40 days in phosphate buffer saline (20mM pH=7.4) under sterile conditions. Incubated samples were extensively dialyzed and structural changes were analyzed by far and near UV circular dichroism spectra measurement. Fructosamine assay with nitroblue tetrazolonium was performed to confer isomerisation between glucose and protein. Aggregations of the glycated product (AGEs) formed during reduction of nitrobluetetrazolium dye were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy. Crosslinks aggregates were investigated by in-situ Congo red binding assay. Red blood cells hemolysis test was performed to decipher the antioxidant activity of albumin samples.
Results
Fructosamine content in glycated albumin demonstrates the non-enzymatic addition of glucose to HSA and confers the formation of monoformazone (marker of glycation). Significant changes were found in the glycated samples of HSA compared to native (unmodified) in far and near UV circular dichroism. Transmission electron microscopy, Congo red staining, showed the formation of crosslink's aggregated mass in glycated HSA. Glycation of albumin reduces the antioxidant capacity of native albumin confirmed by red blood cells hemolysis test.
Conclusion
The finding of present study brings new evidences on the detrimental alterations of on albumin vital functions after non-enzymatic glycation with glucose. These results may emphasize the albumin associated diabetic complications under glycemic range of diabetes mellitus."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver means the presence of hepatosteatosis without significant alcohol consumption; it is strongly associated with obesity and metabolic disorder like type 2 diabetes and dyslipideamia. NASH may progress to advanced stages of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Increased body mass index and viral genotype contribute to steatosis in chronic hepatitis. The sonographic features of NAFLD include the presence of bright hepatic echotexture deep attenuation, and vascular blurring either singly or in combination. Dyslipidemia in patients with NAFLD is atherogenic in nature and it is characterized by increased levels of serum triglycerides and decreased levels of HDL cholesterol. Statins are potent lipid-lowering agents which decrease LDL cholesterol by 20–60%, decrease triglycerides by 10–33% and increase HDL cholesterol by 5–10% for the patients with NAFLD."

abstract = "Aims
To determine an association between hs-CRP and metabolic control/diabetic chronic vascular complications (DCVCCxs) in the patients with type 2 diabetes (DM). In addition, the possibility of using hs-CRP levels to predict risk of DCVCCxs will also be validated.
Methods
This cohort study randomly enrolled 608 patients with DM during the 2007–2008 study period. We also recorded basic laboratory findings at baseline and at one year, to include fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hs-CRP.
Results
Logistic regressions of odds ratios between hs-CRP and DCVCCxs (coronary arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy) showed significant correlations, except for cerebrovascular disease, as follows 0.2 (0.11–0.38), 0.09 (0.01–0.77), 0.06 (0.02–0.16), 0.31 (0.12–0.82), and 0.17 (0.07–0.43), respectively. Linear regression for changes in hs-CRP were significantly correlated with HbA1c (r=0.38), fasting plasma glucose (r=0.40), triglyceride (r=0.20), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r=0.12), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r=−0.12). No correlation was found for total cholesterol (r=0.06). Based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the cut-off points for hs-CRP levels for prediction of DCVCCxs were 2.89, 2.25, 2.10, 2.25, and 2.82mg/L, for coronary arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, respectively.
Conclusions
Our data showed that DCVCCxs were associated with hs-CRP in patients with DM. The cut-off point for hs-CRP can be used to predict association with DCVCCxs. Well-controlled metabolic components in diabetic patients, especially HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and triglyceride may reduce the level of hs-CRP."

Patients utilize a variety of sources to learn about their condition. This study assessed the association of these resources with patient knowledge, adherence, and physiologic outcomes.
Methods
Adults with Type 2 diabetes recruited at an outpatient clinic in Pune, India provided IRB-approved consent and completed surveys measuring diabetes knowledge, self-management, and educational resource utilization. Lab values were obtained from the patient’s medical record. Statistical analysis was conducted in SPSS to determine the association between educational resources and outcomes.
Results
We enrolled 82 patients with a mean age of 58.3 years. The most commonly used resource was books/pamphlets. The use of television and books/pamphlets as sources of information was significantly associated with greater knowledge and self-management. Use of books and pamphlets and peers with diabetes was associated with lower fasting and postprandial blood glucose. Regression analyses controlling for age, gender, and years with diabetes revealed that use of newspapers and magazines, books and pamphlets, and television were predictors of overall diabetes knowledge and nutrition knowledge. The use of television as a source of information was a predictor of the hours exercised per week.
Conclusions
Resources such as books and pamphlets, newspapers and magazines, and television are common ways that people with diabetes learn about their medical conditions. The use of television as a source of information predicted the greatest number of positive outcomes among patients, followed by use of books and pamphlets. These methods should be further explored in order to understand how their benefit may be maximized for patients."

Vitamin D has recently been given a lot of attention for its role in controlling insulin secretion. Many studies have spoken of its role in weight management, blood sugar control and many other metabolic variables.
Patient and methods
In a randomized double-blind clinical trial, 210 people with vitamin D deficiency were randomly allocated into two groups receiving vitamin D (50,000 units per week) or placebo for 8 weeks.
Results
Vitamin D levels were significantly increased in the group receiving vitamin D supplementation (13.7±5.2 unit increase versus 0.8±2.8). The increased levels of vitamin D lead to significant changes in fasting insulin levels (6.8±8.1 unit reduction versus 2.3±3.7), a 2-h insulin (31.1±34.9 unit reduction versus 4.5±24.6) and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) indices.
Conclusion
Correction of vitamin D deficiency leads to increased insulin sensitivity that was significantly able to maintain glucose in the normal range with lower levels of insulin."

A secondary objective was to investigate if the progression of diabetes-related complications had any affect on the fear of falling. This was a study of 38 patients enrolled at the Foot Center of New York. Prospective subjects were recruited if they reported an International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code consistent with diabetes using electronic medical records, expressed a desire to participate, conformed with the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study (they were over 18 years of age and considered alert and thereby able to consent to the study), and provided informed consent. A total of 38 patients were enrolled in the study. Most of the participants were male and African American. The mean number of podiatric manifestations in the group was 4.43 (SD=62.35). The mean HbA1c level for the group was 8.23% (SD=1.94). Several predictors of podiatric manifestations were examined in the study, including mean MFES (Modified Falls Efficiency Scale) score, age, concurrent treatments for neuropathy, and HbA1c levels. Simple correlational analyses revealed that there was no correlation between HbA1c and the number of podiatric manifestations. Several follow-up regression analyses were performed to assess the ability of HbA1c to predict podiatric manifestations when controlling for individual parameters such age and duration of diabetes. HbA1c did not predict number of podiatric manifestations after controlling for age and diabetes duration, age alone or diabetes duration alone. The study did find that patients receiving neuropathy drugs reported lower MFES scores (notably, lower MFES scores are associated with a higher risk of falling). HbA1c levels of patients receiving neuropathy drugs did not differ significantly from the HbA1c levels of patients not receiving neuropathy drugs. The podiatric manifestations of patients with diabetes in East Harlem, where this study was carried out, are wide-ranging and include nail and skin disorders, which are both recognized as common precursors to infections and amputations. Predictive tools could help reduce the economic burden of diabetes. This study assessed the ability of HbA1c to predict the total number of podiatric manifestations in diabetic patients. In the end, HbA1c was not a good predictor of the number of podiatric manifestations. The weak correlation between HbA1c levels and the total number of podiatric manifestations in this study might be due to the small sample size. Future studies, ideally involving a larger sample size, are needed to more accurately assess the potential of HbA1c for predicting lower extremity complications."

This study was designed to assess the prevalence of diabetes in people aged over 20 years in Ahvaz, Iran.
Materials and methods
The study population was chosen by cluster sampling. A checklist included: age, sex, weight, height, blood pressure, waist circumference, educational level, smoking status and previous history of diabetes was completed for each patient. Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) ≥126mg/dl and/or oral hypoglycemic treatment and/or insulin consumption was defined as diabetes, FPG=100–125mg/dl as Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) and FPG <100mg/dl as normal.
Results
Study population was 944 persons. Mean age of population was 42.2±14 years. Diabetes was detected in 15.1% of population. Only 40.4% of cases were aware of their disease. Diabetes was detected in 14.7% of female and 15.7% of male participants. Diabetes was related to age, waist circumference, family history of diabetes, hypertension, waist to hip ratio, educational level, marital status, serum triglyceride, cholesterol and body mass index (BMI) in both genders. But by using logistic regression analysis, age, family history of diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and marital status had significant effect on diabetes.
Conclusion
This study showed that using FPG criteria or current medication 15.1% of this population had diabetes and about 60% of patients were unaware of their disease. Age, hypertension, family history of diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and marital status are the risk factors of diabetes in Ahvaz population. IFG have high prevalence and diabetes screening should be intensified in this population."

Ramadan fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam. People with diabetes are exempted from fasting according to Islamic rules. However, many people with diabetes wish to fast. Physicians are asked frequently by their patients about their ability to fast and the possible impact of fasting on their glycaemic control. Studies about the effect of Ramadan on people with insulin-treated diabetes are scarce. This review aims to provide clinicians with the best recommendations for their patients with insulin-treated diabetes who wish to fast.
Methods
Four databases (Medline, EMBASE, Scopus and PubMed) were searched using the following MeSH terms and keywords: “insulin dependent diabetes mellitus”, “type 1 diabetes mellitus”, ‘Ramadan’ “and” “fasting”. In addition, a hand search of key journals and reference lists was performed. Sixteen full text articles were selected for review and critical analysis.
Results
All of the included studies except one found improvement or no change in glycaemic control parameters during Ramadan fasting. The incidence of major complications were negligible. Minor hypoglycaemic events were reported in some studies but did not adversely affect fasting. Postprandial hyperglycaemia was a major concern in other studies. However, the incidence of severe hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis were trivial.
Conclusion
Ramadan fasting is feasible for insulin dependent diabetic patient who wish to fast. Clinicians should advise their patients about the importance of adequate glycaemic control before Ramadan and frequent glucose monitoring during fasting. Certain types of Insulin seem to be more beneficial than other."

abstract = "Background
Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is associated with obesity, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). In non-diabetic populations, features of metabolic obesity (MO) are observed in a minority of normal-weight (NW) subjects. The cardiometabolic status of metabolically obese but normal-weight (MONW) individuals has not yet been phenotyped in T2DM.
Patients and methods
Prevalence and features of MONW were analyzed in 1244 T2DM patients, in whom MONW was identified as a BMI <25.0 and a MetS score ≥3/5. Among NW (n=262; 21%), those without MetS (n=152; NW-MetS[−]) were compared to NW-MetS[+] (n=110; i.e. 42% of NW and 9% of all T2DM).
Results
There were no differences between groups in age; gender; diabetes duration; smoking; BP; and LDL-C. NW-MetS[+] had higher BMI; waist; fat mass; visceral fat; liver steatosis and HbA1c, and lower insulin sensitivity. Non-right-handedness was twice-higher (18%) in NW-MetS[−]. NW-MetS[+] had higher apoB100 and triglycerides, and lower HDL-C and LDL size. Macroangiopathy was present in 39% of NW-MetS[+] vs. 22% of NW-MetS[−], as coronary (23% vs. 14%) or peripheral artery disease (14% vs. 5%) and TIA/stroke (15% vs. 7%). Microangiopathy was present in 54% of NW-MetS[+] vs. 32% of NW-MetS[−], as retinopathy (25% vs. 13%); neuropathy (29% vs. 18%); and albuminuria (39% vs. 20%).
Conclusions
MONW among T2DM represents a significant minority (about 1 in 10). Their cardiometabolic phenotype deserves attention due to multiple comorbidities, including a twice-higher prevalence of micro-/macrovascular damage in patients wrongly perceived at lower risk due to normal BMI. Unexpectedly, non-right-handedness was over-represented among metabolically healthy patients."

The study was designed for comparing the efficacy and cost effectiveness of Pregabalin and Duloxetine used in Diabetic Neuropathic Pain.
Methods
The prospective interventional 6 month study was conducted in a diabetic clinic of a 500 bedded tertiary care hospital in South India. The subjects having diagnosed with diabetic neuropathy and not treated with Pregabalin and Duloxetine or any other drugs of its class were selected. The data were collected using NPS and Neuro QoL questionnaires. The cost of both drugs used in the study was calculated as the mean of the price of 3 leading common brands of those drugs. The comparative efficacy was calculated by comparing the mean difference produced by both drugs in NPS and QoL scores. The cost effectiveness were calculated by ICER ratio.
Results
The results have shown a significant improvement in the mean difference of NPS and Neuro QoL scores of both Pregabalin (p=<0.001) and Duloxetine (p=<0.001) before and after the therapy, the Duloxetine dominates over Pregabalin in both. The mean cost of Pregabalin for 3 months therapy was found to be INR 668.7 and that for Duloxetine was INR 756. Duloxetine showed a better effect but more expensive. ICER ratio was calculated and found that a cost of INR 61.47 per extra QoL gained by Duloxetine.
Conclusion
The study have revealed that, both drugs are found to be effective.On conducting cost effective analysis, a significant better improvement in QoL of patients was obtained by Duloxetine with comparatively mild increase in the price."

The American Diabetes Association, National Institute for Health, National Institute of Health and Excellence (NICE), Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and World Health Organization websites were also searched. Most studies in this area are observational in design with few randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Articles and studies involving meta-analysis or RCTs were preferred over other types.
Results and conclusion
Effective weight management treatment in T2DM patient can be implemented in the primary care setting. Evidence based individualized lifestyle and pharmacologic measures supported by behavioral intervention and counseling with appropriate and informed surgical referrals has the potential to improve the success of weight management within primary care."

abstract = "Aims
Physical function is a determinant of survival in chronic diseases, however, little is known about functional capacity (FC) and self-reported health status of patients with type-2 diabetes (T2D). This study investigated the relationship between FC and health related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with T2D.
Materials and methods
This cross-sectional survey recruited 150 patients with T2D from a Nigerian university teaching hospital using purposive sampling technique. Socio-demographic and physical characteristics were assessed. FC and HRQoL including physical and mental health component summary (PCS and MCS) were assessed using the six minute walk test (6MWT) and Short-Form (SF-12) questionnaire respectively. Maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) was estimated, pre and post 6MWT cardiovascular parameters and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were assessed. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha level was set at p<0.05.
Results
There were 83(55.3%) women, means of age and FBG of participants were 64.2±8.7years and 7.4±2.4mmol/L respectively. The means of 6-min walk distance (6-MWD) and estimated VO2 max were 341.55±41.82m and 9.2±0.7mL/kg/min respectively. Significant differences were found between pre and post HR (t=−44.71; p=0.001), SBP (t=−38.38; p=0.001) and DBP (t=−38.58; p=0.001) following 6MWT. The means of PCS and MCS of HRQoL were 48.67±5.51 and 58.39±2.86 respectively. There were significant correlations between FC and each of PCS (r=0.678; p=0.001) and MCS (r=0.211; p=0.009).
Conclusion
Patients with T2D demonstrated low functional capacity and reduced HRQoL. Significant relationship exists between FC and physical and mental component summary of HRQoL. Exercise intervention to improve FC and HRQoL were recommended."

Insulin resistance (IR) a state of decreased sensitivity of target tissues to insulin is suspected usually in obese so can be overlooked in normal weight subjects thus it is important to find optimal method of IR assessment in clinical practice.
Aims
(1)Assessment if IR can be reliably and easily diagnosed by any of surrogate methods: HOMA, HOMA 2, QUICKI and Matsuda index, using data from routinely performed tests.(2)Retrospective estimation of IR resistance incidence among female patients with various BMI, hospitalized for various reasons, in order to confirm need for IR assessment.
Methods
HOMA, HOMA2, QUICKI, Matsuda index were calculated using data obtained from medical history of 130 female subjects – patients of the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases, in whom oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with parallel insulin concentrations assessment was performed.
Results
IR correlated positively with body mass index (BMI) in the entire study group, regardless which of four analyzed IR indices was used. Insulin resistance occurred in the obese as well as in normal weight and underweight subjects. The incidences of IR in the study group varied, depending upon chosen method and adopted cut-off values.
Conclusions
The need for quantitative assessment of IR in clinical practice is apparent. Proper selection of the best method of IR assessment remains a problem. HOMA appears the method of first choice for clinical use. There is an urgent need to establish universal or, at least, national standard cut-off values for IR, to introduce IR assessment in clinical practice."

abstract = "Background
The decreased number and impaired functions of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may associate with cardiovascular disease (CV) including atherosclerosis. However, the role of vistafin in regulation of angiogenic EPC subset maturation in T2DM patients without known atherosclerosis is still not fully understood.
The aim of the study
To investigate an association of serum vistafin level and number of circulating EPCs in T2DM patients beyond known CV disease.
Methods
This case–control observational investigation was evolved 54 subjects with T2DM and 35 healthy volunteers. The flow cytometry was used for predictably distinguishing cell subsets, which depend on expression of CD45, CD34, CD14, Tie-2, and VEGFR2. Biomarkers were measured at baseline of the study.
Results
All T2DM patients were divided depending median of vistafin level (5.88ng/mL) in to two cohorts with low vistafin level (<5.88ng/mL; n=29) and high vistafin level (≥5.88ng/mL; n=25) respectively. Logistic regression analysis has shown that visfatin, hs-CRP, age and BMI were the best variables in the prediction of EPC number labeled as CD14+CD309+ and CD14+CD309+Tie2+ cells. After adjustment of the model to age and BMI elevated visfatin level remained the best predictor for both CD14+CD309+ and CD14+CD309+Tie2+ EPCs (OR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88–0.95; P=0.001 and OR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.87–0.96; P=0.001 respectively).
Conclusion
We found that elevated level of vistafin was an independent predictor for declined numerous of non-classical EPCs labeled as CD14+CD309+ and CD14+CD309+Tie2+, whereas CD34+ subsets of EPCs did not associate with vistafin level in T2DM individuals."

The efficacy of insulin therapy in diabetes depends on proper storage and injection technique. The purpose of this study was to assess the practice of insulin administration among diabetes patients in a tertiary care center.
Materials and methods
This observational study was done in Endocrinology department of a tertiary care center during April–June 2015. The consecutive patients using insulin for at least three months by either syringe or pen were recruited. All of them underwent a survey by the questionnaire which focused on key insulin injection parameters.
Results
One hundred and sixty eight (74.67%) patients were storing insulin vials properly. The thigh was the most common site of insulin injection and 209(92.89%) study participants were rotating at the injection sites. Only 48.57% (34/70) subjects were mixing insulin properly before injection. The practice of hand washing and the cleaning of the injection site was practiced by 158(70%) & 171(76.44%) subjects respectively. One hundred and fifty six (69%) patients were injecting with the proper skin fold and 123(55%) subjects were injecting insulin at 90° angle. The majority of patients (91%) were throwing the needle and syringes directly into the garbage and public drainage system.
Conclusions
There was a significant gap between the insulin administration guidelines and current insulin injection practice. The diabetic education and counseling about proper insulin injection techniques should be provided to all diabetic subjects."

The metabolic syndrome developed after kidney transplantation is the result of several factors which are identical with the risk factors in normal population, however, also some factors typical for the transplanted patients—especially the effects of immunosuppressive therapy.
Material and methods
In the groupof 268 patients after kidney transplantation, which had no type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus before transplantation, we identified patients with metabolic syndrome(based on IDF criteria), 12 months from the kidney transplantation. In all patients, we recorded the following parameters: age at the time of transplantation, type of immunosuppression, waist measure, the value of triacylglycerols, the value of HDL cholesterol, presence of arterial hypertension, andthe value of glycaemia in fasting state (or presence of diabetes mellitus). The groupof patients was divided into the control group and the group of patients with metabolic syndrome.
Results
The average age of patients was 46.1±11.6years. The control group included 149 patients (55.6%),and we identified the metabolicsyndromein 119patients (44.4%). The patients with metabolicsyndrome were significantly older (P<0.0001), had significantly larger waist (both the entiregroup and the males andfemales) P<0.0001.The femaleswith metabolic syndrome had significantly lower value of HDL—cholesterol (P=0.0013), and significantly higher number of patients with metabolic syndrome had hyperglycaemia in fasting state or diabetes mellitus (P=0.0006).
Conclusion
By controlling the weight and waist, we may identify the risk patients for development of metabolic syndrome after kidney transplantation."

In this context, hyperglycaemia, oxidant stress, and inflammation are key factors that contribute in CV events and disease in type1 and type 2 DM, even when metabolic control was optimal and/or intensive glycemic control was implemented. It has been suggested that the effect of poor metabolic control or even transient episodes of hyperglycemia in DM associates in particularly with worsening ability of endogenous vasoreparative systems that are mediated epigenetic changes in several cells (progenitor cells, stem cells, mononuclears, immune cells), and thereby lead to so called “vascular glycemic memory” or “metabolic memory”. Both terms are emphasized the fact that prior glucose control has sustained effects that persist even after return to more usual glycemic control. The mechanisms underlying the cellular “metabolic memory” induced by high glucose remain unclear. The review is discussed pathophysiology and clinical relevance of “metabolic” memory phenomenon in DM. The role of oxidative stress, inflammation, and epigenetics in DM and its vascular complications are highlighted. The effects of several therapeutic approaches are discussed."

The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a matter of concern in elderly people with chronic diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of obesity, hypertension and diabetes on HRQoL among elderly.
Methods
A population based cross sectional study was conducted with 750 representative sample of elderly people aged 60–90 years in Babol, the northern Iran. The demographic data and the measurement of blood pressure and other anthropometric measures were collected. The validated short form (SF-36) questionnaire was used to assess the HRQoL. A multiple linear regression model was applied to assess the impact of obesity, abdominal obesity, hypertension and diabetes on QoL.
Results
The mean age (SD) of participants was 68.0±7.6 and 67.7±7.9 years for men and women respectively. Diabetes exerted the most negative effect on QoL score (adjusted coefficient=−9.2, 95% CI: −11.7, −6.5 points) followed by abdominal obesity and hypertension. Whereas a combination of three conditions was associated with a greater significant reduction in QoL scores in both sexes(adjusted coefficient=−14.5, 95% CI: −19.0, −9.9 points). However, the negative influence of obesity and hypertension on QoL was significant only in women.
Conclusion
Most components of the QoL is affected by diabetes, obesity and hypertension particularly in women. Diabetes alone or in combination with other conditions has a negative influence in both sexes with greater effect in women. These findings justify further professional support to compensate the negative influences chronic conditions on health-related QoL especially for older obese diabetic women."

High pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and excessive pregnancy weight gain lead to higher incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Aim of the study was to assess the effects of initial BMI and pregnancy weight gain on development of GDM in a rural Sri Lankan population. It was also hypothesized that these effects could be more pronounced in shorter mothers.
Methods
A case-control study was conducted at two rural hospitals in Sri Lanka. A case was defined as a pregnant mother admitted for the completion of pregnancy and diagnosed to have GDM (n=99). A similar group of mothers without GDM were recruited as controls (n=336). Data were collected through health records and direct interviews.
Results
Mean age of GDM and non-GDM mothers were 32.8 years 28.1 years, respectively. High pre-pregnancy BMI was a significant risk for GDM, with a rising trend with increasing BMI. In contrast to underweight mothers, the risk increases from normal weight [odds ratio (OR)=6.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2–19.4, p<0.01], overweight (OR=17.1, 95% CI 5.8–49.9, p<0.01) and to obese (OR=32.4, 95% CI 10.0–104.5, p<0.01). There was no significant difference in weight gain across mother's height groups. Height or leg length did not show an association with GDM. Family history of diabetes and past GDM were associated with GDM. GDM mothers had higher likelihood for cesarian deliveries, and babies with higher birth weight.
Conclusion
The pre-pregnancy BMI was the most important modifiable risk factor for GDM, and it should be the main preventive measure."

To correlate serum levels of TGF-β1 with motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities in patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus
Materials and methods
The study was conducted in diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus patients which were divided in patients with clinically detectable peripheral neuropathy of shorter duration (n=37) and longer duration (n=27). They were compared with patients without clinical neuropathy (n=22). Clinical diagnosis was based on neuropathy symptom score (NSS) and Neuropathy disability score (NDS) for signs. Blood samples were collected for baseline investigations and estimation of serum TGF-β1. Nerve conduction velocity was measured in both upper and lower limbs. Median, Ulnar, Common Peroneal and Posterior Tibial nerves were selected for motor nerve conduction study and Median and Sural nerves were selected for sensory nerve conduction study
Results
In patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus with clinically detectable and serum TGF-β1 showed positive correlation with nerve conduction velocities
Conclusion
High level of TGF-β1 in serum of T2DM patients with neuropathy show possible contribution in development of neuropathy. Due to its independent association this cytokine might be used as biomarker for diabetic peripheral neuropathy"

Exercise is an integral part of diabetes care. In Iranian women with type II diabetes, we compared the effects of supervised group exercise therapy with the effects of home-based exercise therapy on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), anthropometric parameters, glycaemic control and lipid profile.
Materials and methods
One hundred and two diabetic women were randomised to supervised and home-based groups.
Methods
Over 12 weeks, participants received supervised group-exercise therapy or a home-based exercise-therapy program. During the intervention, they were assessed three times: at baseline, and at weeks 6 and 12. Generalized Estimating Equation models were used to examine the associations between the type of exercise-therapy program and changes over time in anthropometric and biochemical outcomes, and in HRQOL scales of SF36 questionnaire.
Results
Relative to home-based group, supervised group improved significantly regarding role-physical, general health, mean body weight and body mass index from baseline to week 12 (p=0.01). Their reduction in mean body-fat mass from baseline to week 6 (p=0.04) was greater. Similarly, their role-physical, general health and role-emotional improved significantly during the intervention (p<0.05). From baseline to the twelfth week, the HbA1c level fell significantly (p<0.05) in both groups.
Conclusions
Supervised group-exercise therapy was more effective than home-based exercise therapy in improving HRQOL and body composition in diabetic women. However, home-based exercise therapy also produced significant improvements in glycaemic control, body composition and lipid profile. Whether in a supervised or home-based setting, the exercise intervention can therefore be effective in improving health outcomes in diabetic patients."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic and chronic disease which is characterized by hyperglycemia, and that is the major causes of various micro and macrovascular complications. Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), formed by the hydrolysis of proteins containing methylated arginine residues, is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which oxidize l-arginine to citruline and nitric oxide (NO), related to hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia. Apelin is a recently discovered peptide, present in a number of tissues and play role in insulin sensitivity improvement. In this study, our aim was to determine the levels of apelin and ADMA with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in type 2 diabetic patients with or without vascular complications.
Methods
This study included (a total of) 59 diabetic patients. Of the patients, 30 were diabetic with complications, and 29 without complications. In serum samples obtained from the patients, serum ADMA and apelin levels were measured with Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method.
Results
Our study totally enrolled 59 patients in two groups. No significant differences were found in sex, age, HbA1c and glucose levels among groups. Apelin and ADMA levels of group with complications were lower than those of group without complications, but no statistically significant difference of apelin and ADMA levels (p>0.05).
Conclusion
The results of this study have been showed no statistically significant relationship present between ADMA–apelin levels and complications of T2DM. Further studies involving larger patients populations and healthy controls should be done to clarify the pathogenetic significance of apelin and ADMA in diabetic vascular complications."

Tissue hypoxia is an important contributor to diabetic complications. Glycation of hemoglobin (Hb) and obesity are major determinant of oxygen saturation (SpO2) in blood. Hence, the present study was planned to evaluate the effect of obesity on SpO2 in a wide range of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in ambulatory type 2 diabetic patients.
Material and methods
A cohort of 60 subjects irrespective of diabetic status were recruited and clustered in group I (HbA1c <6.5) and group II (HbA1c ≥6.5) depending on HbA1c. Anthropometry and routine biochemical parameters were measured. HbA1c (%) were estimated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) respectively. SpO2 (%) levels were measured by pulse oximetry. Pearson correlation, bivariate regression and student ‘t’ test were used for statistical analysis.
Results
Blood concentration of HbA1c was <6.5 in 29 participants and ≥6.5 in 31 participants. Plasma fasting and post prandial glucose, HbA1c as well as Hb levels were significantly (p<0.50) higher in diabetics as compared to non diabetics. Waist circumference (WC) (r=−400; p=0.026) and body mass index (BMI) (r=−381; p=0.034) showed a significant negative correlation with SpO2 in diabetic patients. On adjusting HbA1c in group II, SpO2 was found to independently and inversely associated with WC (p=0.042) and BMI (p=0.049).
Conclusions
Obesity was found to be a strong independent contributor to reduction in oxygen carrying capacity in ambulatory type 2 diabetic subjects. However there is no effect of glycated Hb on SpO2 in the same population."

The increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and MetS related complications in the U.S. poses a serious public health burden. We aim to identify high risk groups at greatest risk of developing MetS in the U.S.
Methods
Using data from the 2001–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), MetS prevalence among adults (age≥18) was stratified by sex, race/ethnicity and age to identify groups at greatest risk of MetS. Mutlivariate logistic regression models evaluated for predictors of MetS.
Results
Overall, the prevalence of MetS in the U.S. was 78 million during the study period. There was a greater prevalence of MetS in females compared to males (34.4% vs. 29.6%, p<0.001). Females had a 25% higher risk of MetS compared to males (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.18–1.32, p<0.001). Hispanics had a higher risk of MetS when compared to non-Hispanic whites (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04–1.23, p<0.01). The prevalence of MetS increased with increasing age (age <40: 17.5% vs. age 40–49: 29.7% vs. age 50–59: 37.5% vs. age 60–69: 44.4% vs. age ≥70: 47.0%, p<0.001), and individuals age 70 and over were more than 5 times more likely to have MetS than those less than age 40 (OR, 5.12, 4.71–5.57, p<0.001)
Conclusions
The high prevalence of MetS in the U.S. affects females, Hispanics, and older individuals the greatest. The aging population and increasing Hispanic population further highlight the huge burden of disease MetS will place on the healthcare system in the U.S."

abstract = "Background
It has been documented that patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) and vascular complications have higher homocysteine levels. Hyperhomocysteinemia correlates with IR, increasing oxidative stress, which causes lesions of vascular endothelium leading to endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and atherosclerosis.
Objective
The objectives of the study were to examine homocysteine values, along with cardiovascular risk factors (lipid and apolipoprotein status, CRP, blood pressure), indicators of renal function (microalbuminuria/24h), glucose regulation and insulin resistance (glucose and insulin level, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, uric acid) and anthropometric parameters (BMI, WC, HC, WHR) in patients with and without MS as a correlation between homocysteine and MS factors.
Methods
The study included obese and overweight individuals, aged of 30–75 yrs. classified into two groups: with MS (n=35) and without MS (n=41).
Results
Patients with MS had increased WC, BMI, BP, glycaemia, HOMA-IR, TG, CRP, microalbuminuria, homocysteine and decreased HDL-C (p<0.05). Statistically significant difference between groups was found for WC, BMI, sBP and dBP, TG, HDL-C (p<0.01) and glycaemia, CRP, Apo B, HOMA-IR (p<0.05).

Dyslipidemia is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is a leading cause of mortality in developed and developing countries. This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of dyslipidemia and its risk factors in an urban group of Iranian adult population.
Methods
In this study, based on the criteria set by the National Cholesterol Education Program, the prevalence of dyslipidemia was evaluated in a population of 4737 people aged 45–69 years who participated in the second phase of an ophthalmology cohort study in Shahroud. Dyslipidemia prevalence was determined by age, sex, and risk factors of the disease; the findings were tested by using simple and multiple logistic regression.
Results
The prevalence of dyslipidemia was 66.5% (CI 95%: 64.4–68.6) in males, 61.3% (CI 95%: 59.5–63.2) in females, and 63.4% (CI 95%: 62.0–64.9%) in both sexes.

In multivariate logistic regression model, increase of age (for females), abdominal obesity, overweight and obesity, hypertension, and diabetes were associated with an increased odd of dyslipidemia.
Conclusion
The prevalence of dyslipidemia in middle-aged urban population in Iran is high, and with increasing age there is an increased risk of dyslipidemia. Hence, considering the growing trend of aging in Iran, there is need for taking special measures to deal with dyslipidemia as a health priority. Furthermore, the need for planning in order to reduce the risk of dyslipidemia and prevent its complications is greater than ever."

The aim of our study is to measure total Magnesium in pregnant women screened for GDM and to compare total magnesium between whom were diagnosed having GDM and those having normal pregnancy.
Methods
Our study is a prospective study involved 99 pregnant women referred to Maternity and Child Hospital Al Ahsa (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) for 100g Oral Glucose Tolerance test. All included pregnant women were in their 24–28 weeks of gestation with free past medical history and were free for any medicine. A 100-g Oral Glucose Tolerance (OGTT) with total plasma magnesium measurement were done to all included women. All patient were followed tell delivery.
Results
Among 99 patients enrolled in our study, GDM was diagnosed in 19 patients (19.2%). Fifteen patients have normal fasting glycaemia and were diagnosed having GDM on 100-g OGTT. Four patients have fasting glycaemia more than 126mg/dl (7mmol/l) confirming the diagnosis of GDM. Hypomagnesemia was confirmed in eight patients (8.08%). no one of them had GDM. The serum magnesium concentration in GDM women was lower that of normal pregnant women but the difference was not significant. (0.89±0.1 vs 0.92±0.2mmol/l, p=0.51). BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly different between the pregnant women who developed or not gestational diabetes.
Conclusion
In our study, the development of GDM cannot be explained by low total serum magnesium. The low total serum magnesium in patient diagnosed having GDM compared to whom free of GDM and the importance of magnesium in the genesis of insulin resistance should encourage more large trial to explain the exact role of magnesium in the pathophysiology of GDM."

The percent and distribution of body fat are important factors in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. Our aim was to investigate common anthropometric indices in their relationship with body fat content.
Methods
In a cross-sectional study 1360 healthy individuals (580 men and 780 women) in a cluster sampling, from Ahvaz, Iran, body fat content (using bioelectrical impedance) and anthropometric measurements [weight, waist circumference, a body shape index, abdominal volume index, body adiposity index, conicity, body mass index, hip circumference, waist to hip ratio and waist to height ratio] was obtained. The ROC curve analysis was used to compare each index with body fat percent.
Results
Significant difference was found between men and women in all anthropometric parameters (p < 0.001). Women displayed higher percentages in the overweight and obese categories (33.6% vs. 32.9% and 26.4% vs. 22.1%, respectively). In both men and women, the strongest correlations were seen between body fat percent and BMI, AVI and WHtR (r>7.9 and p<0.001). BMI, WHtR and AVI in men and BAI, BMI and WHtR in women showed the most accuracy for estimating body fat percent, respectively.
Conclusion
All anthropometric parameters could predict body fat percent with relatively good power, however BMI, WHtR and AVI are more powerful predictors. Based on our findings, we suggest using the AVI and WHtR instead of other indexes, as they are better able to assess the accumulation of fat in the abdominal area and are able to more accurately assess body fat percent, which are indicators of chronic disease."

abstract = "Objective
To compare the changes in various glycemic parameters in insulin-naïve type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients who were initiated on insulin glargine or insulin degludec in a real world setting.
Methods
Retrospective data were analyzed in consecutive type 2 DM patients in a real world setting, who failed oral therapy (at least 2 oral anti-diabetic drugs) and were initiated with either insulin glargine or insulin degludec. The parameters assessed were the changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, body weight, dose of Insulin and the total number of patient reported hypoglycemic episodes up to 6 months after initiation.
Result
At baseline, insulin glargine and insulin degludec groups were similar in terms of gender, age, weight, HbA1c and duration of diabetes. After 6 months follow up the change in HbA1c (−1.09 versus −1.45 P=0.124), change in FPG (−72.81mg/dl [−4mmol/L] versus −75.88mg/dl [−4.2mmol/L] P=0.755), and the change in body weight (+1.65 versus +0.85 P=0.082) were similar in glargine and degludec groups, respectively. Patients in insulin degludec group experienced significantly lesser patient reported hypoglycemic episodes (12 versus 40) and required significantly lesser dose (25.68Units versus 18.61Units per day; P=0.002) compared to insulin glargine. 41% of the patients reached HbA1C target of ≤7% with insulin glargine compared to 69% with insulin degludec within the specified time period.
Conclusion
Results from this real world analysis suggest that among type 2 DM patients who were initiated on insulin degludec as compared to insulin glargine may be associated with significantly lesser patient reported hypoglycemic episodes and lesser dose of insulin while achieving similar glycemic control. This study is however limited by the retrospective nature of the data collection."

Hyperglycemia induced oxidative stress is implicated as a contributor to the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications like diabetic nephropathy (DN). Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) is primarily involved in the neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by enzymatic conjugation with the scavenger peptide glutathione (GSH). Therefore, present study was aimed to evaluate the role of GST along with oxidative stress markers and their correlation in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without nephropathy.
Methods
This study comprised of 300 participants divided into three groups of 100 each: healthy controls (HC), T2DM without complications and DN. Plasma GST, malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced GSH levels and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) were estimated spectrophotometrically.
Results
Highest GST levels was observed in T2DM which was significantly higher (p<0.05) as compared to DN and HC. However, GSH and FRAP levels were found to be significantly lowest whereas MDA levels were significantly highest in DN as compared to T2DM and HC. GST showed a significant negative correlation with GSH, FRAP and positive correlation with MDA in both patients groups.
Conclusions
Highest activity of GST in T2DM might be as a compensatory mechanism in response to oxidative stress. GST is found to have significant negative association with decreased GSH. Altered redox milieu in DN collectively conspire to increase the risk of renal damage in T2DM."

We conducted multiple logistic regression analyses using data from the 2011–2012 United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate relationships between cardio-metabolic risk factors and increasing years of smoking cigarette or marijuana use. Statistical adjustments were made for both demographic and endogenous factors related to recreational substance use.
Results
Each year increase in marijuana use was significantly associated with increased odds of metabolic syndrome (OR=1.05; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.09), and hypertension (OR=1.04; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.07) adjusting for both demographic and endogenous factors related to recreational substance use. Each year increase in cigarette smoking was significantly associated with increased odds of hypertension (OR=1.03; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.06) and hyperglycemia (OR=1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.05) after adjusting for confounders.

In dermatological dimension, most studies focused on elucidated changes in skin temperature, color, hardiness and turgor as well as common skin disorders such as Diabetic Dermopathy (DD), Necrobiosis Lipoidica Diabeticorum (NLD) and Diabetic Bullae (DB), which are common in diabetic patients and have high potential for leading to limb-threatening problems such as ulceration and infection. In musculoskeletal dimension, most studies focused on range of motion and muscle strength, gait patterns and as well as foot deformities especially Charcot osteoarthropathy (COA), which is the most destructive musculoskeletal complication of diabetes.
Conclusion
DFS as a common condition in DM patients lead to ulceration and lower limb amputation frequently unless a prompt and comprehensive assessment was taken. So that dermatological and musculoskeletal assessments are usually neglected in primary health care, these assessments should be done frequently to reduce the high risk of serious complications."

Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. Metabolic syndrome is a common clinical presentation posing significant risk in cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated the correlation between the number of diagnostic criteria and serum adiponectin, leptin, resistin, TNF-alpha, EGFR levels and abdominal adipose tissue in the individuals with metabolic syndrome.
Materials and methods
This study included a total of 40 patients (18 men and 22 women) with metabolic syndrome that applied to the Internal Diseases Outpatient Clinic of Ümraniye Training and Research Hospital between March 2011 and August 2011. The data including age, gender, personal history, familial history, habits, height, weight, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, body composition (tanita) were recorded for each patient. Blood samples were collected for biochemical examinations. The serum adiponectin, leptin, resistin, TNF-alpha, EGFR levels were measured. Statistical analyses were carried out using the NCSS (Number Cruncher Statistical System) 2007 and the PASS (Power Analysis and Sample Size) 2008 Statistical Software (UT, USA).
Results
When the patients with metabolic syndrome were analyzed by gender, no statistically significant difference was found between the EGFR and TNF-alpha levels (p>0.05). On the other side, the visceral fat rating and GGT levels of women were significantly lower than those of men (p<0.05). However, the resistin and leptin levels were found significantly higher in female patients as compared to male patients (p<0.05).
Conclusion
In the present study, we did not observe any statistically significant change in abdominal adipose tissue thickness, serum TNF-alpha, adiponectin, resistin, and EGFR levels of the patients according to the number of diagnostic criteria; however, there was significant change in the patients’ leptin levels."

Obesity and diabetes are contributed to cardiovascular disease risk. The current study was performed to evaluate the association of central and general obesity and cardio-metabolic risk factors, including dyslipidemia and hypertension in T2DM patients.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study in T2DM adults. Body mass index (BMI) was used to identify general obesity and waist circumference (WC) was measured to define abdominal obesity (based on ATP III). Biochemical analyses, and anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were done for all participants.
Results
Participants with central obesity showed significantly higher systolic (132.5mmHg vs. 125.4mmHg, p=0.024) and diastolic blood pressures (84.9mmHg vs. 80mmHg, p=0.007) than participants without obesity. Dyslipidemia was more prevalent in all participants either by BMI (98.3% vs. 97%, 95% CI: 0.18–17.53) or by WC (97.2% vs. 98%, 95% CI: 0.07–7.19). Abdominal adiposity in diabetic subjects showed significant reverse association with high level of physical activity (OR=0.22, 95% CI: 0.06–0.85). Hypertriglyceridemia rate was increased with both central (OR=2.11; p=0.040) and general obesity (OR=2.68; p=0.021). After adjustment for energy intake and age, females had higher risk of general (OR=4.57, 95% CI=1.88–11.11) and central obesity (OR=7.93, 95% CI=3.48–18.08).
Conclusions
Females were more susceptible to obesity. Hypertension was associated with both obesity measures. Dyslipidemia, except for hypertriglyceridemia, was correlated to neither abdominal nor general obesity."

Metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. It is estimated that around 20–25 percent of the world's adult population has metabolic syndrome. In this manuscript, we have reviewed the existing data linking gut microbiome with metabolic syndrome. Existing evidence from studies both in animals and humans support a link between gut microbiome and various components of metabolic syndrome. Possible pathways include involvement with energy homeostasis and metabolic processes, modulation of inflammatory signaling pathways, interferences with the immune system, and interference with the renin-angiotensin system. Modification of gut microbiota via prebiotics, probiotics or other dietary interventions has provided evidence to support a possible beneficial effect of interventions targeting gut microbiota modulation to treat components or complications of metabolic syndrome."

Type 2 diabetes has grown to epidemic proportions in the U.S. and physical activity levels in the population continues to remain low, although it is one of the primary preventive strategies for diabetes. The objectives of this study were to estimate the direct medical costs of type 2 diabetes attributable to not meeting physical activity Guidelines and to physical inactivity in the U.S. in 2012.
Methods
This was a cross sectional study that used physical activity prevalence data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to estimate the population attributable risk percentage for type 2 diabetes. These data were combined with the prevalence and cost data of type 2 diabetes to estimate the cost of type 2 diabetes attributable to not meeting physical activity Guidelines and to inactivity in 2012.
Results
The cost of type 2 diabetes in the U.S. in 2012, attributable to not meeting physical activity guidelines was estimated to be $18.3 billion, and that attributable to physical inactivity was estimated to be $4.65 billion. Based on sensitivity analyses, these estimates ranged from $10.19 billion to $27.43 billion for not meeting physical activity guidelines and $2.59 billion–$6.98 billion for physical inactivity in the year 2012.
Conclusions
This study shows that billions of dollars could be saved annually just in terms of type 2 diabetes cost in the U.S., if the entire adult population met physical activity guidelines. Physical activity promotion, particularly at the environmental and policy level should be a priority in the population."

Materials and methods
Total beverages intake was estimated in shift and administrative staff of Ahvaz International Airport, Iran. Forty five male, aged 25–55 years, attending this institute were invited to participate in this study. They completed a three-day food records and all participants were measured plasma lipid profiles.
Results and conclusion
Forty one of participants completed all aspects of the study. Two clusters were emerged, labeled descriptively as Conventional including “high Sugar-sweetened drinkers” and “low sugar drinkers”. The highest intake of water was in cluster 1 (1170.9ml/day) even this amount is much less than the daily recommended amounts. There were significant differences in triglyceride levels among day and night shift workers. According to the results, there is inadequacy of water and high sugar beverage intake among the shift workers which it is a potential risk of some related chronic diseases such as metabolic syndrome with high triglyceride level in the future."

Several studies have shown that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may improve insulin resistance in various diseases. However, the possible effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on insulin resistance in PCOS still remains unclear. We evaluated the effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on insulin resistance in women with PCOS in a meta-analysis.
Methods
Literature searches of MEDLINE, PubMed Central and EMBASE for publications in English were conducted up to December 2015. We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated effects of omega-3 fatty acids supplements on insulin resistance in women with PCOS. Results are summarized as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Effect sizes of eligible studies were pooled using random-effects models (the DerSimonian-Laird estimator). We assessed the potential sources of heterogeneity using the standard χ2 test.
Results
Of 1202 papers, three RCTs were eligible for inclusion which involved 72 cases and 73 controls. The dose range for omega3 supplement was 1.2g to 3.6g and the duration of follow-up was from 6 to 8 weeks. There was no significant effect of omega-3 fatty acids supplements compared to placebo on insulin resistance (MD: 6.18; CI; −3.347, 15.382; p=0.208) and HOMA −IR (MD: 0.276; 95% CI=−1.428, 1.981; p=0.751) in women with PCOS.
Conclusion
The results provide an evidence that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may not have a beneficial effect on improving insulin resistance in women with PCOS."

Metabolic syndrome as a cardiovascular disease predictor, is proposed to be reduced by following a Mediterranean diet. This study was aimed to explore the relationships between metabolic syndrome and Mediterranean diet in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
Materials
A cross-sectional study was performed on 158 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients 28–75 years old (mean age: 54.3±9.6 yrs). Fasting glucose and lipid profile were measured. Blood pressure and anthropometric characteristics of each participant were recorded. Food frequency questionnaires were evaluated using an 11-item score to determine the adherence to Mediterranean diet.
Results
Totally, 55.4% of participants had a good adherence to Mediterranean diet. The risk of metabolic syndrome in women was significantly higher than in men (OR=8.65, CI 95%=2.88–25.99; p<0.001). Nuts, legumes and seeds consumption were associated with a significant lower risk of metabolic syndrome (OR=0.42, CI 95%=0.188–0.917; p<0.05).

To determine whether gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability of metformin monotherapy varies according to baseline BMI or at doses >1500mg/day in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
Methods
We performed a sub-analysis of the safety population from a prospective, multicenter, Phase IV open-label study in which 371 Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes received extended-release metformin monotherapy for 16 weeks. The incidence, severity and duration of GI adverse events (AEs) were compared between normal-weight (BMI<25kg/m2, n=155) and overweight/obese (BMI≥25kg/m2, n=216) patients. The primary objective was to determine whether baseline BMI affect the incidence, severity and duration of GI AEs, using Fisher's exact test and Student's t-test. Secondary objectives were to compare these factors according to final metformin dose (≤1500mg/day versus 2000mg/day).
Results
The proportion of patients who reported ≥1 GI AE did not differ significantly between BMI groups (25.2% of the normal-weight group versus 21.3% of the overweight/obese group; p=0.3840). Patients who reported GI AEs in the two BMI groups experienced similar GI AE severity (p=0.5410), mean duration (p=0.3572) and duration distribution (p=0.1347). There was no significant difference in GI AE severity and duration between metformin dosage groups (≤1500mg/day versus 2000mg/day).
Conclusions
Newly-diagnosed Chinese type 2 diabetes patients of normal weight are no more likely than overweight/obese patients to suffer from increased incidence rates, severity or duration of GI AEs when treated with first-line extended-release metformin monotherapy. Doses of 2000mg/day did not increase the severity or duration of GI AEs."

Methods
Cross-sectional multicenter study which included patients with stages 3 to 4 CKD. SHPTH was considered when the intact PTH levels (iPTH) were equal or higher than 70pg/ml. We divided the sample into two groups (diabetics and non-diabetics). We used robust statistical methods.
Results
409 patients (214 diabetics) were studied. HPTH was found in 60.4% of diabetics vs 65% of non-diabetics (P=0.42). Diabetics with HPTH were younger (79.5 vs 82.3 years-old, P=0.005), and had more hypertension (P=0.0014), dyslipidemia (P=0.0001) and comorbidities. In multivariate analysis, we found a significant relationship in case of diabetics, with age (OR: 1.04, 95%CI 1.005–1.09 P=0.02 ), and with statins treatment (OR 2.3, 95%CI 1.17–4.54, P=0.01).
Discussion
The prevalence of SHPTH between the groups was similar, however, diabetics had more presence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, and SHPTH in this case was also related with moderate microalbuminuria and lower levels of vitamin D. An association with statins was also found in this group."

Initially 67 questions designed and according to the experts’ panel 16 questions were removed and 11 questions were edited. Finally, content validity of 51 questions has been approved by the experts’ panel. According to Lawshe’s score if CVRs were at least 0.8, items will be has content validity. The results show that both internal consistency and intra-class-correlation were good (>0.75). Cronbach’s alpha and ICC were 0.84 and 0.82, respectively for all questions. To confirm structure of conceptual model, confirmatory factor analysis and Amos software was used. Goodness of Fit Index was RMSEA=0.027, GFI=0.95, AGFI=0.91, CFI=0.97; and showed that the hypothesized model is approved.
Conclusion
In general, we can say that the questionnaire is approximately comprehensive and complete. It is suggested that to assess awareness of diabetes type 2 in seven dominants (e.g. fundamentals, common symptoms, early and late complications, diet, control methods, and source of information of DMT2) this questionnaire should be used in general population."

To determine whether elevations of uric acid levels are associated with the cluster of disorders described in metabolic syndrome and to evaluate whether hyperuricemia may be considered a component of this syndrome.
Methods
One year case-control study was conducted in Bikaner, Rajasthan, India from January to December 2013. The study population consisted of 200 subjects, 100 with metabolic syndrome (case) and 100 without metabolic syndrome (control) aged between 18 and 80 years, attending OPD at PBM Hospital were studied. Controls were age and sex matched to the cases. Blood tests and all physical variables were examined using standard methods. Subjects were divided into 6 groups according to their possession of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 components of the metabolic syndrome. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA, linear regression analysis and multivariate linear regression model.
Results
Mean serum UA level was significantly associated with all components of metabolic syndrome (p<0.001) and had strong positive correlation (r=+0.66 to +0.77, p<0.0001) with all of them except serum HDL with which it showed strong negative correlation(r=−0.71, p<0.0001). It increased as the number of metabolic factors increased showing a highly significant trend (p<0.0001). On multivariate regression analysis UA contributed to 66.84% variance of metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
The current multivariate regression analysis clearly infers that uric acid can be considered as a marker and potential modifier of metabolic syndrome."

abstract = "Aims
This study examined the prevalence of sleep disorders (SD) and self-reported sleep symptoms and risk factors among adult patients diagnosed with T2DM.
Methods
Data were obtained from the 2012 US National Health and Wellness Survey, an annual Internet-based survey. A total of 7239 participants reported a diagnosis of T2DM. Patients also provided information on diagnosis of SD (e.g., insomnia, sleep breathing disorder, other sleep conditions, etc.) and regularly experienced sleep symptoms (e.g., difficulty falling asleep, sleep apnea, daytime sleepiness, difficulty staying awake, etc.). Logistic regressions were used to examine factors associated with SD and symptoms.
Results
The average age was 59.9 (standard deviation=12.2), 59.5% were male, 24.4% were diagnosed with SD, 76.8% reported experiencing any sleep symptom regularly (difficulty falling asleep, 30.5%; sleep apnea, 17.4%; daytime sleepiness, 26.8%; difficulty staying awake, 10.1%). Logistic regression models showed the strongest predictors of diagnosed SD were obesity class (OC) III (OR=2.20), White (OR=1.92), OC II (OR=1.57), smoking (OR=1.57), lower income (OR=1.49–1.19), unemployment (OR=1.38), and comorbidities (OR=1.35), all p<0.05. The strongest predictors of any sleep symptom were OC III (OR=2.22), OC II (OR=1.78), lower income (OR=1.74–1.24), female gender (OR=1.72), OC I (OR=1.60), White (OR=1.54), and smoking (OR=1.47), all p<0.05.
Conclusions
Almost 25% of patients with T2DM were diagnosed with SD and over 75% reported experiencing at least one sleep symptom regularly. SD and symptoms were strongly associated with obesity, White ethnicity, gender, low income, and smoking. Interventions focusing on weight management and smoking cessation have shown to improve T2DM and may improve SD."

Prediabetes is associated with dysglycemia, obesity, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, contributing towards the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases rendering them vulnerable for the same. The current study intended to explore the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) related with prediabetes by assessing oxidative stress and inflammation using serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and urine microalbumin (MA) and their correlation with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and physical measurements.
Materials and methods
Based on FPG values, 80 subjects were grouped into prediabetes and healthy controls. IL-6 and MPO were estimated in serum sample whereas MA was estimated in random urine sample.
Results
Prediabetes group had significantly increased (p<0.05) mean anthropometric measurements and IL-6, MPO and MA as compared to healthy controls. MPO had significant correlation with FPG (r-0.388) in the prediabetes group. IL-6 and MPO showed a positive correlation with body mass index (BMI (r-0.339, r-0.327)), waist circumference (WC (r-484, r-0.493)) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR (r-0.430, r-0.493)) while MA did not correlate with FPG and anthropometric measurements.
Conclusion
This study suggests that prediabetes is associated with central adiposity, inflammation and oxidative stress predisposing them to an increased risk for CVD."

The present study was designed to estimate the progression rates from combination of normal weight, overweight, obesity, and number of metabolic abnormalities (MA) to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a non-diabetic high risk population in Isfahan, Iran.
Methods
A total of 1869 non-diabetic first-degree relatives (FDR) of patients with T2D 30–70 years old were examined and followed for a mean (SD) of 7.3 (2.2) years for T2D incidence. At baseline and through follow-up, participants underwent a standard 75-g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test.
Results
The metabolically healthy overweight and obese at baseline were associated with incidence of T2D, independently of age and gender. Any one MA increased the risk of developing T2D among normal weight, overweight and obese individuals. Those with normal weight and ≥3 MA were over 20 times (odds ratios (OR) 20.21; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 2.4, 170.4) and those with overweight and ≥3 MA 22.5 times (OR 22.5; 95% CI 3.0, 167.0) and obese with ≥3 MA were 25.4 times (OR 25.4; 95% CI 3.4, 187) more likely to develop T2D than those with normal weight and without MA. Compared with participants without MA, obese individuals with concomitant MA were not significantly more likely to progress to T2D.

In sub-Saharan Africa, there is no precise use of metabolic syndrome (MetS) definitions and risk factors screening indices in many clinical and public health services. Methods proposed and used in Western populations are adopted without validation within the local settings. The aim of the study is to assess obesity indices and cut-off values that maximise screening of MetS and risk factors in the Nigerian population.
Method
A consolidated analysis of 2809 samples from four population-based cross-sectional study of apparently healthy persons≥18 years was carried out. Optimal waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) cut points for diagnosing MetS and risk factors were determined using Optimal Data Analysis (ODA) model. The stability of the predictions of the models was also assessed.
Results
Overall mean values of BMI, WC and WHtR were 24.8±6.0kgm−2, 84.0±11.3cm and 0.52±0.1 respectively. Optimal WC cut-off for discriminating MetS and diabetes was 83cm in females and 85cm in males, and 82cm in females and 89cm in males, respectively. WC was stable in discriminating diabetes than did WHtR and BMI, while WHtR showed better stability in predicting MetS than WC and BMI.
Conclusion
The study shows that the optimal WC that maximises classification accuracy of MetS differs from that currently used for sub-Saharan ethnicity. The proposed global WHtR of 0.50 may misclassify MetS, diabetes and hypertension. Finally, the WC is a better predictor of diabetes, while WHtR is a better predictor of MetS in this sample population."

abstract = "Aim
Optimal treatment intensification strategies in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving basal insulin supported oral antidiabetic therapy (BOT) remain controversial. The objective of the present study was to compare outcomes of BOT-intensification by either the uptitration of long-acting insulin glargine or by the immediate addition of a rapid acting insulin analogue (RAIA).
Methods
This was a prospective, observational, 24-week study in T2DM patients with BOT using insulin glargine and baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) between 7.0 and 8.5%. Patients were stratified by their physicians to one of the following treatment intensification strategies: Basal insulin titration to target with discretionary subsequent addition of RAIA at weeks 12 or 24 (GLAR), or immediate addition of RAIA at baseline (GLARplus).
Results
A total of 3266 patients were prescreened of whom 2202 fulfilled the selection criteria. Of these, 1684 patients were documented in the GLAR group and 518 in the GLARplus group. In the GLAR group, in 91 (5.5%) and 21 patients (1.3%) RAIA was added at weeks 12 and 24, respectively. The groups displayed similar baseline characteristics; except, mean diabetes duration was slightly shorter in the GLAR group (8.7 vs. 9.4 years). During the study, insulin glargine dose was increased from 18.7 to 26.4U (plus 7.7U) in GLAR and from 24.9 to 27.3U (plus 2.4U) in GLARplus patients. Mean RAIA dose was 9.6±4.7U at the final visit. After 24 weeks, HbA1c was reduced by 0.8 and 0.9% in the GLAR and GLARplus groups, respectively (both p<0.001). An HbA1c of ≤7.0% was achieved in 49.2% of GLAR and 48.5% of GLARplus patients. In both groups, we observed improvements in cardiovascular risk factors such as lipids and blood pressure. The rates of symptomatic (1.6 vs. 1.7%) and severe (0.18 vs. 0.19%) hypoglycemic episodes were low and comparable in both groups.
Conclusion
These findings provide evidence that treatment intensification in patients with type 2 diabetes not at glycemic target on BOT with insulin glargine is equally safe and effective using either long-acting insulin titration alone or the addition of a rapid-acting insulin analogue."

Hyperglycemia increases oxidative stress through the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which results in an imbalance between free radicals and the antioxidant defense system of the cells. A positive correlation was reported between lipid peroxide levels and diabetic complication.
Objectives
The aim of the present study was to investigate the state of oxidative stress in controlled and uncontrolled diabetic patients.
Methods
One hundred thirty nine participants were included in this study, grouped as: Group-I: Healthy Control group of non-diabetic normal subjects, Group-II: Controlled type-2 DM group of subjects with type-2 DM and HbA1c≤8% and Group-III: Uncontrolled type-2 DM group of subjects with type-2 DM and HbA1c>8%. Fasting blood glucose, 2h postprandial glucose, MDA and HbA1c were quantified. The association between diabetic control and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) was evaluated.
Results
The mean HbA1c increased significantly in uncontrolled type-2 DM subjects compared to controlled type-2 DM group. Lipid peroxidation as expressed in MDA was significantly increased in uncontrolled type-2 DM group compared to controlled type-2 DM, both groups show significant elevation in this parameter compared to healthy subjects. There is a significant positive correlation between MDA and HbA1c in the studied subjects.
Conclusion
The core problem during diabetes is poor glycemic control, which leads to protein glycation, lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress and ﬁnally varieties of complications. Periodic evaluation of lipid peroxidation products in diabetes mellitus is recommended as it could contribute to the early identiﬁcation and management of oxidative stress."

Competitive binding ELISA was used to evaluate betatrophin and OXT plasma concentrations. Correlations of the above biomarkers and patient clinical characteristics were also detected.
Results
As compared to the control MS participants (0.32±0.25ng/mL); betatrophin plasma levels were increased (P<0.001) in the MS-pre/T2DM patients (1.23±0.68ng/mL). On the contrary, OXT concentrations were decreased (P<0.001) in the MS-pre/T2DM patients (1222.46±514.55pg/mL) as compared to the MS control subjects (2323.42±848.68pg/mL). OXT concentration correlated negatively (r=−0.492, P<0.001), while HbA1c and FPG correlated positively with betatrophin plasma levels (P<0.001), but were inversely correlated with OXT levels (P<0.001) in the total sample.
Conclusion
Betatrophin levels are increased, while OXT levels are decreased in MS-pre/T2DM. We found an inverse correlation between the levels of the two biomarkers in addition to correlation between their levels and the degree of glycemic control."

GDF-15 is widely presented in the various cells (macrophages, vascular smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts), tissues (adipose tissue, vessels, tissues of central and peripheral nervous system) and organs (heart, brain, liver, placenta) and it plays an important role in the regulation of the inflammatory response, growth and cell differentiation. Elevated GDF-15 was found in patients with established CV diseases including hypertension, stable coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, ischemic and none ischemic-induced cardiomyopathies, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, as well as stroke, type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM), chronic kidney disease, infection, liver cirrhosis, malignancy. Therefore, aging, smoking, and various environmental factors, i.e. chemical pollutants are other risk factors that might increase serum GDF-15 level. Although GDF-15 has been reported to be involved in energy homoeostasis and weight loss, to have anti-inflammatory properties, and to predict CV diseases and CV events in general or established CV disease population, there is no large of body of evidence regarding predictive role of elevated GDF-15 in T2DM subjects.

The term ‘diabesity’ expresses their close relationship to each other, wherein both these metabolic disorders are characterized by defects of insulin action. The pathophysiology connecting obesity and diabetes is chiefly attributed to two factors: insulin resistance and insulin deficiency. Recent years have seen an increasing body of work on the following metabolic defects common to both obesity and diabetes such as, impaired tissue perfusion, sleep disturbances, androgen dysfunction, altered Vitamin D levels and GI stress. The scope of this review is to present the most widely accepted theories that link the two diseases, provide an update on some proposed unifying metabolic defects and highlight current and future prevention and management strategies."

To determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and prediabetes in a population of the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, aged 55–65 years; to observe if there are differences in prevalence between males and females, and to describe the frequency with which each component of the metabolic syndrome is found in this population.
Materials and methods
population-based cross-sectional study in Guayaquil. We recruited people of both genders, with ages ranging from 55 to 65 years. Through clinical history, physical examination and laboratory tests, we obtained necessary data to diagnose metabolic syndrome and/or prediabetes. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS® 22.
Results
we obtained a sample of 213 patients, 64.5% were females and 35.5% were males. Mean age was 60.3 years (±3.1). A total 65.8% of patients had increased waist circumference, and 45% were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Hypertriglyceridemia was the most prevalent condition in males, while women more commonly had low HDL. Prediabetes was diagnosed in 45.9% of our patients, and 19.5% had both disorders. There was no significant difference on metabolic syndrome prevalence between genders, but prediabetes was significantly more common in women.
Conclusion
we found a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome and prediabetes in Guayaquil, higher than what was reported in other areas. Abdominal obesity is even more prevalent. Women have prediabetes more frequently than men. Our patients, given their age, are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline by having metabolic syndrome and/or prediabetes."

Serum uric acid level has been suggested to be associated with metabolic syndrome risk factors. However, the association between metabolic syndrome and serum uric acid is still controversial and challenging. This study was aimed to investigate the association between serum uric acid levels and metabolic syndrome components in personnel of the Shahroud University of Medical Sciences.
Material and methods
This case–control study was conducted on 499 personnel aged 30–60 years old who were working in Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, in 2015. MetS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria. The relationship between serum UA level and the number of metabolic components was determined by linear regression analysis.
Result
In this study, the mean concentration of serum uric acid in men with the syndrome was higher than that in women. Mean serum UA level increased as the number of metabolic factors increased. The mean serum uric acid levels was 4.98±1.64 in patients with metabolic syndrome and 4.5±1.28 in non-patients (p=0.005). Subject with abnormal uric acid were almost 2.62 times more likely than other subject to develop the syndrome.
Conclusions
The results of this study showed that only hypertriglyceridemia is a component which increases the risk of hyperuricemia. In addition, hyperuricemia increases the risk of metabolic syndrome by more than two fold. It seems that high uric acid can be considered as a predisposing factor for metabolic syndrome; thus, it is recommended to measure serum uric acid in routine tests."

To determine if insulin resistance (IR), an important predictor of cardiovascular risk in the general population and in type 2 diabetes mellitus, can be assessed using simple parameters which are readily available in clinical practice.
Methods
This cross-sectional study included 194 patients with type 2 diabetes. Body mass index, waist index (WI), triglyceride levels, 1/HDL, triglyceride/HDL, uric acid and urine albumin:creatinine ratio were investigated as possible predictors of IR.
Results
WI correlated more strongly than any other parameter with log insulin levels, log fasting glucose to insulin ratio (FGIR), log fasting glucose to insulin product (FGIP), homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) and quantitative insulin check index (QUICKI). WI also emerged as the strongest independent predictor of IR indices studied in regression as well as in ROC analyses. At a cut-off of 1.115, WI had a 78% sensitivity and 65% specificity for predicting IR when HOMA-IR was used as indicator of IR, and 74% sensitivity and specificity when QUICKI was used as indicator of IR. Combining WI with other variables did not improve performance significantly.
Conclusions
In our cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes, WI was the parameter with the strongest association with, and the best predictor of, IR."

Increased incidence of CVD has been observed in recent years in the Kashmir valley (North India). Since the risk factor development of the cardiovascular diseases (CVD) takes place during childhood, we undertook an epidemiological survey to assess the prevalence of dyslipidemia in the school children of Kashmir valley.
Materials and methods
1131 children of 5–19 years of age were selected and evaluated for BMI, cholesterol, TGs, LDL and HDL levels from different areas of Srinagar city (urban) region of the Kashmir valley from June 2011–June 2014.
Results
The frequency of dyslipidemia in Kashmiri children varied along the subjects. Hypertriglyceridemia was seen in 82.6% of the males and 47.6% of females in the age group of 5–9 years, 38.5% of males and 51.1% of females in the age group of 10–14 years and 24.7% of males and 35.9% of the females in the age group of 15–19 years. Low levels of HDL than normal were seen in 34.7% of males and 19% of females in the age group of 5–9 years. Similarly low HDL levels were seen in 17.9% of males and 15.5% of females in the age group of 10–14 years. The incidence of low HDL was also seen in 4.9% of males and 10.8% of females in the age group of 15–19 years.
Conclusions
In the present study dyslipidemia was more common in centrally obese children and the most common component was high triglycerides and low HDL's. Female school children were at higher risk of developing CVD than males."

A cross-sectional secondary data set of 9359 individuals, age 30–74 years, receiving annual health check-up in 2012 were used in this studied. Identification of MS and CHD development was determined by International Diabetes Federation criteria and Framingham risk score, respectively, while kidney function was assessed by using the estimate glomerulus filtration rate (eGFR) and chronic kidney disease epidemiology (CKD-EPI) formula.
Results
The prevalence of MS was 16.1%. The majority pattern of MS in male displayed abnormalities of body mass index (BMI) plus triglyceride and blood pressure (BP). Most of them had high risk of CHD, and kidney function in stage 1 and 2. Furthermore, abnormalities of BMI plus BP and blood glucose were the main components related to high risk of CHD, and stage 1 of kidney function in female.
Conclusion
This finding showed the cleared pattern of the sequential abnormality factors which potentially use for setting the activity and empowerment team to prevention, promotion, and treatment strategy in MS patients. Particularly, BMI is the first assessment and then follow by blood pressure and blood sugar which could be used as the guideline for reducing MS associated with CHD and kidney disorder in Thai population."

Materials and methods
A cross-sectional, single interview study was performed in an outpatient department of an endocrinology institute. Total 80 type II DM patients without any associated complications of diabetes were included in this study. To diagnose Depressive Episode, structured clinical interview for DSM V was applied. Severity of depression was assessed by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). To assess socio-demographic characteristics of the patients, all of them were evaluated with a semi-structured socio-demographic performa.
Results
38.75% patients (N=31) were found to be suffering from depression. Among them 48.38% were moderately depressed and none were suffering from very severe depression. Significant association was not found between depression and socio-demographic factors of age (p=0.920), gender (p=0.251), economic profile (p=0.583), local background of the patient (p=0.646), educational qualification (p=0.935) and marital status (p=0.644). Similarly no association was found with duration of diabetes, HbA1c and BMI.
Conclusion
Exclusion of complicated cases didn’t seem to influence overall prevalence of depression, although reduction in severity was apparent. Thus even in those diabetic patients who are leading a complication free life, a detailed psychiatric analysis to rule out depression is mandatory."

Different approaches for screening and diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus(GDM) have great impact on all process of management of gestational diabetes and its future complications. The aims of this study were to evaluate rate, risk factors and outcomes of GDM based on International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups diagnostic criteria.
Materials
In a prospective study pregnant women attended 5 clinics in Ahvaz, screened for gestational diabetes mellitus using IADPSG criteria and followed up delivery from August 2014 to February 2015. At the first prenatal visit women underwent the fasting blood sugar test. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed for 750 mothers between 24 and 32 weeks of gestation. Logistic regression test for calculating the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals was used.
Results
The mean age of participants was 28.43±5.52years. The overall rate of GDM in our study was 29.9% (224/750). Incidence of gestational diabetes was associated with age group≥35years [OR=1.92(95% CI, 1.19–3.09)], family history of diabetes [OR=2.47(95% CI, 1.33–4.59)], previous GDM [OR=3.12(1.35–7.19)], BMI≥25 [OR=1, 71(1.10–2.67)] Using logistic regression. The most common maternal complication in studied women was cesarean section followed by hypertension and preeclampsia.
Conclusion
About one third of studied women diagnosed as GDM according to the IADPSG criteria. Risk factors of GDM were maternal age, family history of diabetes, Previous GDM, overweight and obesity before pregnancy, the same reported factors with 2 steps approach. Higher rate of GDM using this criterion may increase concern about healthcare costs and workloads."

The arterial stiffness measures used were pulse wave velocity (PWV), aortic pulse pressure (PP), augmentation pressure, augmentation index (AI), subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR) and ejection duration (ED).
Results
There was a significant increase (p<0.05) in most of the arterial stiffness variables following exercise. Exercise capacity had a strong inverse correlation with arterial stiffness and age (p<0.01).
Conclusion
Age influences arterial stiffness. Exercise capacity is inversely related to arterial stiffness and age in people with metabolic syndrome. Exercise induced changes in arterial stiffness measured using pulse wave analysis is an important tool that provides further evidence in studying cardiovascular risk in metabolic syndrome."

abstract = "Introduction
Dietary factors can affect the coronary heart disease (CHD). Results of previous studies on the association between the diet and CHD are not consistent in different countries. There were no data on this association in Armenia.
Objective
Aims of this case-control study were to evaluate the association between nutritional factors and CHD among Armenians in Yerevan.
Methods
During 2010 and 2011, we randomly selected 320 CHD patients with a diagnosis of CHD less than 6 months and 320 subjects without CHD (≥30years old) from the hospitals and polyclinics in Yerevan. Dietary intakes with 135 food items over the previous 12 months were evaluated using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire.
Results
After adjusting for some CHD risk factors higher intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were associated with a reduced risk of CHD, while this association was not witnessed for saturated fatty acids (SFA). In addition, findings indicated an inverse relation between vitamins (E, B6 and B12, folic acid) and fiber with CHD. In this population, smoking, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (MetS) were significantly more common among patients with CHD.
Conclusion
The intake of vitamins E, B6 and B12, folic acid, PUFA, MUFA and fiber appeared to be predictors of CHD, independently of other risk factors."
