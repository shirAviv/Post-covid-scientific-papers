abstract = "Objectives
To evaluate the medication adherence behaviour and knowledge of epilepsy patients before patient counselling and to monitor and evaluate the outcome of clnical pharmacist mediated patient counselling.
Methodology
A prospective interventional study with one-year duration was conducted among 100 epileptic inpatients of the neurology department in a south Indian tertiary care hospital. Clinical pharmacy students mediated education was provided to the patients and bystanders, and its effect on medication adherence and patient beliefs was assessed through medication adherence scale (MMAS-4) and an internally validated beliefs about medication survey form.
Results
Before the intervention, 40% of patients showed high adherence to antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy followed by 27% patients with a medium level of adherence and 33% of patients exhibited a low level of adherence. After the intervention, 62% of patients showed high adherence followed by 20% of patients with medium adherence and the remaining 18% exhibited a low level of adherence to AED therapy. Medication belief assessment after intervention also showed improving trends (P ≤ 0.05). The study defined that the overall improvement in medication adherence and knowledge of patients was found to be statistically significant after the intervention.
Conclusion
The study concluded that low adherence to the medications and lack of knowledge about the disease was the major reasons for the unsuccessful drug treatment which can be cleared up to a satisfying extent by the use of clinical pharmacist intervention."

abstract = "Background
Identification of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk factors is pertinent, for it can be an effective intervention for its prevention. As previous information regarding GDM risk factors from India were mostly descriptive and scarce from coastal Karnataka, a current prospective case-control study was designed to identify GDM risk factors among pregnant women seeking antenatal care.
Methods
A hospital-based prospective matched case–control study was carried among antenatal subjects seeking routine antenatal care at two secondary-level care private hospitals, affiliated to a University Medical College in coastal Karnataka. It comprised of 100 incident GDM cases and 273 frequency-matched controls. Data was collected by personal interviews using a pretested questionnaire. Data was entered and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences(SPSS), version 15.0.
Results
Risk factors using Carpenter and Coustan criteria and DIPSI criteria were found similar. Pooled data identified following significant GDM risk factors: marital age (25–29 years)(adjusted OR:18.2; 95% CI:1.9–177.6; p= 0.012), delayed menarche (adjusted OR:11.4; 95% CI:1.1–124.6; p=0.045), multiparity (adjusted OR:14.1; 95% CI:1.8–109.8; p=0.011), family history of DM (adjusted OR:66.6; 95% CI:6.9–645.2; p < 0.001), high maternal perceived stress (adjusted OR:21.6; 95% CI:1.9–248.8; p=0.014, less physical activity (adjusted OR:21.0; 95% CI: 2.8–158.8; p=0.003), and low intake of green leafy vegetables (GLV)(adjusted OR:41.7; 95% CI:3.7–472.4; p=0.003). Positive current polyhydramnios and recurrent vaginal infections were also identified as significant risk factors (p<0.05).
Conclusions
Modifiable risk factors identified were low physical activity, high antenatal perceived stress, multiparity, marital age ≥25 years, and low pre-pregnancy intake of GLV, which were also comparable using two criteria in vogue for GDM diagnosis. Pre-conception advice on healthy lifestyle may prove beneficial."

To study the level of adherence and factors associated with adherence to anti-diabetes medication among patients with diabetes.
Method
ology: In this cross-sectional study, 124 diabetes patients attending medicine OPDs at hospitals affiliated to Kasturba medical college, Mangaluru were assessed regarding their adherence to anti-diabetes medications using the Morisky 8-Item Medication Adherence scale. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done to determine the factors associated with good adherence.
Results
The mean age of the patient was 59.8 ± 11.2 years. The median duration of diabetes was 7 (3–12) years. In our study 43.5% (n = 54) of the participants had low adherence to anti diabetes medications. On Univariate analysis, absence of side effects, and regular blood glucose monitoring were found to be significantly associated with good adherence (P < 0.05). However, on multivariate analysis, absence of side effects was found to be significantly associated with good adherence (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
Absence of side effects is the factor independently associated with good adherence. The interventions planned to combat the problem of non-adherence to medications should be targeted towards reducing the side effects of medication."

Present observational study was conducted in Obstetrics and Gynecology department of a rural tertiary center of Northern India over 6 months (July–January 2019) on 155 term (≥37-≤42 weeks) antenatal women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy fulfilling inclusion criteria. Immediately after delivery, arterial blood sample was drawn from doubly clamped 10–12 cm long umbilical cord in pre-heparinized insulin syringe, which was sent for pH estimation and 0.5 ml in lithium heparin tube for lactate dehydrogenase levels. One- and 5-min neonatal Apgar score was noted by pediatrician. Cord blood pH and lactate levels were then compared with overall neonatal outcome. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS-22 version.
Results
Mean values of umbilical cord arterial pH and LDH was 7.2 ± 0.1 and 449.5 ± 562.9 U/L respectively. Significantly low mean cord blood pH (7.03 ± 0.12) and high LDH levels (939.74 ± 781.75 U/L) were observed in neonates of eclamptic mothers (p = 0.00). Mode of delivery had significant effects on cord blood parameters with significantly low pH and elevated LDH levels seen in neonates delivered by emergency LSCS for fetal distress (p < 0.05). Cord blood LDH levels were more significantly associated with NICU admission, neonatal morbidity and mortality. Cord blood LDH was a better predictor of neonatal outcome with 100% sensitivity and 79.73% specificity.
Conclusion
Cord arterial blood lactate dehydrogenase levels were better predictor of overall neonatal outcome."

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. There is sudden need of statistical modeling due to onset of COVID-19 pandemic across the world. But health planning and policy requirements need the estimates of disease problem from clinical data.
Objective
The present study aimed to predict the declination of COVID-19 using recovery rate and case load rate on basis of available data from India.
Methods
The reported COVID-19 cases in the country were obtained from website (https://datahub.io/core/covid-19#resource-covid-19_zip/). The confirmed cases, recovered cases and deaths were used for estimating recovery rate, case load rate and death rate till June 04, 2020.
Results
A total of 216919 confirmed cases were reported nationwide in India on June 04, 2020. It is found that the recovery rate increased to 47.99% and case load rate decreased to 49.21%. Death rate is found to be very low 2.80%. Accordingly, coincidence of the difference of case load rate and recovery rate (delta) will reveal a declination in expected COVID-19 cases.
Conclusion
The epidemic in the country was mainly caused by the movement of people from various foreign countries to India. Lockdown as restricting the migration of population and decision taken by the government to quarantine the population may greatly reduce the risk of continued spread of the epidemic in India. This study predicts that when the case load rate gets lesser than recovery rate, there after COVID-19 patients would be started to decline."

For effective planning and optimum allocation of resources, accurate assessment of burden due to tobacco and its projection is essential. There are number of reports in India during last 3-4 decades, reporting tobacco related cancers (TRC). However, there is no visible study in India attempting to assess cancers due to tobacco (CDT).
Objectives
To assess CDT in India and States by sex and urban/rural and project the same till 2025.
Materials and methods
The basic inputs required were 1) tobacco prevalence, 2) relative risk of cancer due to tobacco, 3) incidence rates of TRCs, and, 4) population. These were obtained respectively from 1) recent five rounds of NSSO, 2) our recently published study, 3) reports of PBCRs, and, 4) projections of Registrar General of India. Our recently published method was applied to assess the CDT and regression method for projection.
Results
The overall burden of CDT in India was estimated to be 169 thousands in 2015 and it was projected to around 236 thousands by 2025, an increase of nearly 39.6%. CDT accounted for nearly half of TRCs. The CDT as percentage of TRC was highest for Tripura followed by Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram and West Bengal. Detailed analysis indicated regional diversity in both CDT and TRCs.
Conclusions
Present study reports absolute burden of CDT as well as the same as a percentage of TRC for India and its States till 2025. This may help policy planners and administrators in prioritizing the resources and proactive decisions pertaining to anti-tobacco measures. Non-availability of enough PBCRs to capture regional diversity may also be addressed by competent authorities."

In India, it was reported previously about varying prevalence of asthma and chronic bronchitis among leather tannery workers with moderate to high exposures at the workplace to be significantly associated with asthma. This study intended to estimate the prevalence of asthma, tuberculosis, and chronic bronchitis among leather tannery workers and to identify the risk factors associated with it.
Data and Methods
The data used in this study were collected through a cross-sectional household survey of 284 male tannery workers in the Jajmau area of Kanpur city in the state of Uttar Pradesh, during January–June 2015. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with respiratory symptoms.
Results
The prevalence Asthma and Chronic Bronchitis among Tannery workers was 12.3% and 11.6% which is higher as compared to non-tannery workers. The findings revealed that the prevalence of symptoms suggestive of asthma, tuberculosis, and chronic bronchitis among the tannery workers was higher compared to non-tannery workers. The study revealed that long time tannery working harms health, as tannery workers are more likely to be suffering from asthma and chronic bronchitis who worked above 11 years in the tannery (p < 0.62).
Conclusion
The study concludes that age, education, media exposure, working hours in the tannery, type of work engagement within tannery occupation, and exposure to chemicals are the major risk factors for asthma, tuberculosis, and chronic bronchitis among the male tannery workers. Specific health insurance facilities should be provided, such as the Employee's State Insurance Scheme (ESIS), from the day a person begins work in a tannery."

Misuse and overuse of antimicrobials is one of the world's most pressing public health problems. Nurses are important members of healthcare team and thus it is essential to know behaviour of antibiotics use among budding nurses.
Aim & objective
To assess prevalence and practices of self-medication with antibiotic among undergraduate nursing students.
Methods and material
This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 216 randomly selected undergraduate nursing students studying at a tertiary care teaching hospital in Uttarakhand. Data was collected using a valid and reliable questionnaire for self-medication practices with antibiotics and were analysed by using descriptive statistics.
Results
Prevalence of self-medication with antibiotics was 78.7% and among them 53.5% practiced it for 2–3 times in past one year. Azithromycin (37.5%) and Amoxicillin (30.1%) were commonly used antibiotics, primarily for the treatment of sore throat (30.6%) and fever (27.1%). The main reasons for self-medication were adequate knowledge of antibiotics use (39.4%), and to save time (30.6%) &cost (13.5%). The main source of obtaining antibiotics was hospital pharmacy (66%) with verbal advice from nurses/paramedical staff (32.3%) and senior undergraduate nursing students (23.7%). Surprisingly, 68.3% participants suddenly stopped the antibiotic use and 52.7% of them changed over the drugs during treatment.
Conclusions
High prevalence of self-medication practices with antibiotics among budding nurses is a serious issue; which necessitate educating them with risks and harms of inappropriate use of antimicrobials. Furthermore, sensitizing the pharmacists for not advising and selling antibiotics without medical prescription."

Prevalence of anaemia among children has been a major health problem in developing countries. An estimated 73 million children below age five in India (58%) are anaemic (NFHS-4, 2017) despite of a number of vertical interventions across different states. This study has analysed the extent of socio-economic inequalities and spatial heterogeneity in anaemia among children using data from the recent round of Indian DHS, known as National Family Health Survey.
Methods
Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to assess the effects of socio-economic and demographic predictors on prevalence of anaemia among children under age five. Socio-economic inequalities in the prevalence of anaemia among children were analysed using Concentration Index and Poor-rich Ratios. Further, the spatial heterogeneity in the prevalence of anaemia were analysed using autocorrelation and auto regression models.
Results
The highest negative values of Concentration Index and Poor-rich ratios were observed in Mizoram (−0.204) and Nagaland (−0.120). The univariate Moran's I statistics was 0.63 for child anaemia suggesting a profound and significant spatial heterogeneity in the prevalence of anaemia among children in India. The spatial autocorrelation of anaemia among children with anaemia among mother was 0.46. Other predictors included in the model having significant autocorrelation with anaemia among children were underweight (0.74) and experience of diarrhoea in seven days preceding the survey (0.35). The results of SEM explained that coefficients of mother's anaemia (0.74), uneducated mothers (0.10) and underweight children (0.10) were some of the key predictors of child anaemia in India.
Conclusion
The study findings suggest greater investment in addressing micronutrient deficiencies among children and child feeding practices, by adopting differential approaches especially in the regions with higher prevalence of anaemia."

Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and tuberculosis (TB) represent major public health problems. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is the assessment of the prevalence of tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), and co-infection of both, in pregnant women.
Methods
We searched the literature in PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge and MeSH, from all years of study until 25 April 2018, for articles and abstracts describing tuberculosis, HIV, and co-infection of HIV/TB during the pregnancy. Risk ratio (RRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome were combined, using a random-effects model. Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria.
Results
There was not an association between the incidence risk of tuberculosis during pregnancy in women without any underlying disease. (Risk ratio = 2.43, 95% CI = 0.97–6.08, p = 0.056, I2 = 88.636, df (Q) = 4, Q-value = 35.198).

Coronavirus disease - 19 (COVID-19) spread throughout the world and become pandemic. To stop and control the rapid infection of COVID-19 lockdown is the best option. Sudden lockdown implies change in entire lifestyle of the population. Social isolation affects individual's lives by greater reduction in their physical activity, which might increase the chance of infection by reducing immunity. To what extent, the physical activity is reduced during this lockdown period among physiotherapy professionals, and students who propagate physical activity is not known. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on physical activity level and energy expenditure among physiotherapy professionals and students.
Material and methods
One hundred and forty three volunteered physiotherapy professionals and students participated in web-based open E-survey. The survey was carried out by sending the Google Forms link for International Physical activity questionnaire-short form (IPAQ-SF) through social networking sites using Google Forms to gather the amount of PA before and during COVID-19 lockdown period and analysed using Wilcoxon signed rank test.
Results
Among identified 261 potential survey participants, 143 responded, reaching a response rate of 54.8%. Total physical activity before and during COVID–19 lockdown period were 7809.7 (3849.7–11769.8) MET-min/week and 4135.7 (867.2–7404.1) MET-min/week; p < 0.0001.

The socio-economic attributes of Indian villages are emulated through occupation. The principle types of occupation in Indian villages encompass of agriculture, fishing, weaving, cottage industry, handicrafts, etc. ‘Occupational health’ dichotomizes somatic and psychological health that encapsulate within and outside the workplace.
Objectives
This study will focus on the prevalence of self-rated health problems with the multiple responses of the workers, along with the determinants of occupational health problems among workers engaged in handloom sector.
Methods
Primary data was collected in Sualkuchi block, Kamrup Rural district, Assam through structured questionnaire during February to April 2016. Total 250 samples were interviewed and statistical techniques like Bivariate and Relative risk ratio was used.
Results
About 80% of the workers are suffering from health problems, which are a major concern in the handloom sector. More than half of the respondents reported suffering from musculoskeletal disorder, making it the most prevalent disorder in the sample. Statistical analyses revealed a positive significant association between the intensity of health problems and an increased number of years of work experience and hours of working.
Conclusion
The study underlines the need for further research regarding the postural strain of weavers and also suggests the implementation of ergonomic design into weaver workstations to minimize the adverse effect of their current working postures. Improving upon the weaver's work-posture could improve their quality of life."

abstract = "Objectives
The objective of this study is to identify the determinants and measure the trends in maternal health-facility based utilization in Bangladesh. This research shows the importance of each variable and their role in utilizing maternity care in Bangladesh.
Materials and methods
In our study, we have analysed BDHS 2004, 2007, 2011 and 2014 data to measure the determinants and trends in maternal health services in Bangladesh, using the binary logistic regression model.
Results
Our study revealed that the variable education of women, place of residence, wealth index, and husband's education have a significant association with the maternal health services utilization. Women who completed higher education were more likely to use antenatal care (AOR = 3.76, CI = 2.07–6.52), skilled birth attendants (AOR = 2.82, CI = 1.96–1.4.08) and postnatal care (AOR = 1.87, CI = 1.31–2.68). Women from urban areas were more likely to use ANC (AOR = 1.30, CI = 1.05–1.60), SBAs (AOR = 1.64, 9 CI = 1.40–1.92) and PNC services (AOR = 1.45, CI = 1.23–1.70) than women from rural areas. Women from the richest households were more likely to use ANC (AOR = 2.30, CI = 1.80–2.95), SBAs (AOR = 2.23, CI = 1.83–2.71) and PNC (AOR = 1.78, CI = 1.47–2.16) than poor women.
Conclusion
Maternal health service utilization should be more targeted towards the rural women in Bangladesh as there seems a high inconsistency in service utilization among urban and rural mothers. ANC is an essential entry point for the ensuing application of delivery and PNC services. So, it is recommended to promote women's education and empowerment with improved geographical access and strong ANC policies."

Population explosion remains a major cause of concern in India. Although, the country became the first to implement a national population control programme in 1952, it is yet to effectively control its population growth.
Methods
A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess the utilization and barriers for non-utilization of contraceptives among slum resident married women of Udupi district, Karnataka, India between October 2017 to July 2018 The survey involved 323 married women aged 18–45 years. Data were generated using self-developed and validated questionnaire. Generated data were analyzed using descriptive analysis.
Results
The result of the study showed low utilization of contraceptives at 38.7%. Leading barriers for non-utilization are fear of side effects (65.2%), followed by desire for girl/boy child (31.3%), husbands’ disapproval (25.8%), followed by 17.7% no family support (in-laws), lack of knowledge about contraceptive methods (25.3%), and lack of personal interest to use contraceptives (23.2%). The most frequently used method was tubectomy (73.6%). Copper T (14.4%) and male condom (8.0%) were predominant method among the temporary family planning methods used by the study population.
Conclusions
The low contraceptive rate might be attributed by fear of side effects, desire for girl/boy child, husbands’ and family (in-law) disapproval, lack of knowledge about contraceptive methods and lack of motivation to use. Education, encouragement of health education programs and involvement of the spouse and in-laws might promote contraceptive utilization in slum dwellers."

Increase in reactive oxygen species formation induced by hyperglycemia through activation of electron transport chain considered as the initiators in the development of diabetes complications. Prevalence of DKD is raising continuously with disparate growth in low to middle-income countries and under-recognized as a global burden of disease. DKD imposes an enormous humanistic, economic, and societal burden. DKD in the initial stage is often undiagnosed until the manifestations of serious complications. The major hurdle in the early diagnosis is limited knowledge, unroutine screening. Timely diagnosis and appropriate interventions are the best approaches to deal with this catastrophic condition. Early diagnosis can have lifetime benefits by controlling the progression of the disease, increasing life expectancy, decreasing the humanistic and economic burden. Even after all these benefits; DKD cases are diagnosed when the condition worsens. Non-availability of potential diagnostic biomarkers is the main barrier to the early diagnosis of DKD. The present review highlights the worldwide prevalence, risk factors, and potential biomarkers for the early detection of DKD."

Also, this study provides forecast of transmission rate of Covid-19 incorporating the heterogeneous characteristics of the group of population according to age.
Methods
The heterogeneous-mixing model was used to forecast the transmission rate of Covid-19 and effect of Enhanced Community Quarantine in various Local Government Units (LGUs) in the National Capital Region (NCR), Philippines.
Results
The result of the study revealed that the mobility of people has significant contribution to the transmission rate of Covid-19. The result of the study revealed that the mobilization of workers, who are exempted in ECQ, would greatly affect the transmission of disease to those who are in the senior citizen group. The increase in the confirmed cases of Covid-19 is associated with the transmission from those workers, who are exempted from ECQ to senior citizens and the young age group. LGUs in the NCR, Philippines will experience a different pattern of peak periods ranging from the third week of April to the last week of May.
Conclusions
This study concluded that in order to achieve the containment of the spread of Covid-19 in the Philippines, the government should be stricter in implementation of the ECQ and incorporate the different pattern of transmission of Covid-19 in deciding whether to extend or to lift the ECQ."

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a prevalent infection among HIV-seropositive women that still needs to be subjected to more researches. This study is aimed at determining the occurrence of vulvovaginal Candida species and their antifungal susceptibility pattern in HIV-seropositive women from the Behavioral Disease Counseling Center in Ahvaz, Iran.
Method
In this analytical cross-sectional study, 85 HIV-seropositive women with the mean age of 26.15 years (SD. 9.60) were evaluated. Vaginal swabs were collected from women to identify various Candida species through conventional methods and API 20 C AUX system. Antifungal susceptibility testing was done on specimens against Amphotericin B and Azole antifungals. Eventually, all data were analyzed by SPSS.
Results
The occurrence of vulvovaginal Candida species was 34.11% (29) among 85 HIV-seropositive women. Out of 29 Candida spp., 18 (62.06%) C. albicans, 6 (20.68%) C. glabrata, 4 (13.79%) C. dubliniensis, and 1 (3.44%) C. krusei were identified. There was no significant association between VVC and some medical variables such as antiretroviral therapy, birth control methods, underlying diseases, and CD4 count (PV > 0.05). However, there was a significant association between VVC and age and pregnancy (PV < 0.05). The most Candida spp. showed considerably resistant to Amphotericin B and Itraconazole while all species were susceptible to Caspofungin.
Conclusion
The high occurrence of Candida spp. (34.11%) among HIV-seropositive women is notable, with the highest frequency of C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. dubliniensis, respectively. Also, their notable resistance to Amphotericin B and Azole antifungals necessitates more effective treatments for VVC, particularly in pregnant women."

Despite of long-term inverse consequences of caesarean delivery, the incidence is rising high in many states in India including West Bengal. The paper examines socio-demographic correlates of cesarean delivery and post-delivery complications and care among women in West Bengal.
Methods
Using a sample of 5328 live births born within the last five years of the survey to the 4459 women in West Bengal obtained from the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS-4), the study estimates cesarean delivery rates and average delivery costs separately for private and public hospitals. Descriptive bivariate statistics and logistic-model were used to examine differentials and determinants for C-Section delivery.
Results
Almost 24% livebirths born within the last five-years preceding the survey reported as cesarean delivery. The cesarean delivery rate is alarmingly high in private hospitals (71%) compared to public hospitals (19%). Nearly 55% of total cesarean delivery was contributed by private hospitals only. The multivariate analysis shows that the mother's level of education, mother's BMI, and household economic conditions have shown a significant positive association with the higher prevalence of caesarean delivery.
Conclusion
Caesarean delivery became a primary mode of delivery without any medical consideration especially in private hospitals in West Bengal. These unnecessary deliveries need to be cheeked in priority for safe motherhood and wellbeing of mother and child."

The study was a community based cross sectional study. A total of 360 women (15–49 years) who had a child in the last five years preceding the survey were interviewed and studied. The results of overall analysis showed that only 34.6% women received ANC from health professionals, whereas mere 5.3% deliveries were taken place at health facilities. Mother's education, partner's occupation, family income and area of residence were significant predictors of these services utilization. Place of receiving ANC was an influencing factor of health facility delivery. Women who didn't receive ANC in health facilities were almost three times (OR: 2.95, 95% CI: 1.06–7.9) less likely to deliver in health facilities compared to the women who received ANC. The study underscores the urgent need of addressing socioeconomic differences and targeted interventions might help the women who need to utilize these services more often. The study also pointed out huge differences of these services utilization with national average. Though further investigation is necessary but emphasis should be given more to address the barriers of maternal health service."

Although there is no licensed vaccine for monkeypox, smallpox vaccine has been shown to be 85% effective in preventing the monkeypox. This study was conducted to assess the willingness of frontline healthcare providers to be vaccinated with smallpox vaccine to prevent monkeypox.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Indonesia. The willingness was assessed under two scenarios: fully subsidized and non-subsidized vaccine. Explanatory variables such as sociodemographic profile, workplace and professional characteristics, and knowledge of monkeypox were collected. A logistic regression assessed the influence of these explanatory variables on participants’ willingness.
Results
Out of 510 received participants’ responses, 407 (79.8%) were analyzed. With a fully subsidized vaccine scenario, 381 (93.6%) of the participants were willing to be vaccinated and in an unadjusted analysis, gender, education, monthly income, and type of workplace were associated with willingness. With a non-subsidized vaccine (i.e. the vaccine price was US$ 17.9), the proportion who were willing to be vaccinated decreased to 71.9%. In adjusted analyses for both scenarios, gender was the only independent predictor for willingness; men were less willing to be vaccinated than women, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.37; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16, 0.87 and aOR: 0.42; 95%CI: 0.27, 0.67, respectively for subsidized and non-subsidized scenario.

HIV Sentinel Surveillance among pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics, ANC-HSS, is used to estimate HIV prevalence among the general population. Despite the declining trend, HIV prevalence among the general population in Karnataka is still higher than the national average (0.22%), with a recent, noticeable stabilization. Demographic analysis on concentrated HIV infection among pregnant women could be potential indicators for targeted HIV interventions among general population as well as and prevention of parent to child transmission (PPTCT).
Objectives
To analyse the demographics of HIV-positive pregnant mothers in Karnataka, thereby identifying the most-at-risk populations (MARP) within the general population.
Methods
In total, 24800 eligible pregnant women aged 15–49 attending the ANC clinic for the first time during the surveillance period (Jan–Mar, 2017) were enrolled. Demographic data and blood samples were collected, recorded and tested for HIV. Age-specific factors associated with HIV prevalence, besides the demographics of the HIV positive pregnant women, were analysed to identify the MARP for targeted HIV interventions.
Results
Comprehensively, none of the demographic factors was significantly associated with HIV prevalence. Nevertheless, analysis of demographics, HIV test history and ART status of HIV-positive pregnant women reveals prominent prevalence patterns. The epidemic was majorly confined within young, less educated, primigravida and rural mothers of low economic status.
Conclusion
ANC-HSS is designed to estimate the HIV prevalence among general population at national, state and district levels and is not reflective of the concentrated epidemic confined to MARP. Identifying the disease pattern specific to MARP is essential for effective targeted interventions and disease management."

abstract = "Background
Tribals are intrinsically isolated and socially disadvantage groups currently living in India. Health parameters like nutritional deficiency leads them to several health consequences. Main objectives on which study is based, was to know prevalence and determinants of nutritional status among tribal women in Maharashtra.
Data sources and methodology
Data of 3923 tribal women from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), was used. Bi-variate and Logistic regression was calculated using a statistical tools linked with nutritional status. A spatial tool (ArcGIS) was used to study spatial variation of BMI & Anaemia in Maharashtra.
Results
The prevalence of underweight is lower among tribal women but more than half of the total women are anaemic, less than 6% of obesity among them in Maharashtra. In the spatial analysis, predominant results of any anaemia of tribal women were found in the Northwest districts of Maharashtra. The highest (2.5–4.6%) and the moderate percentage (1.5–2.5%) of severe anaemia, and obesity were found in almost all the districts located in western Maharashtra, whereas the prevalence of high (48–62%) and moderate (35–48%) underweight was found dispersedly throughout Maharashtra.
Conclusion
Tribal community in India is most susceptible in terms of social, health and education development. The government needs to focus on regional and community-based development approach for overall health improvement among tribal women in Maharashtra. These results may help policymakers to prepare apt strategies for the overall development of health among the people in general and tribal women in particular."

abstract = "Introduction
Diabetes Mellitus is a major chronic disease associated with many complications and high morbidity. The need for lifestyle modification and regular adherent treatment makes the management of the disease difficult. This study examines the scope of m-Health in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in terms of glycemic control.
Methods
A randomized controlled study was performed among the patients attending the outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital in Mysuru city. A mobile application named DIAGURU, mainly focusing on lifestyle modification and medication management was used for a period of 6 months from April 2019 to September 2019 by 150 patients in the study group while another 150 participants served as controls. The change in glycosylated haemoglobin levels was assessed after six months.
Results
The mean HbA1C levels at the starting of the study was found to be 7.36% ± 1.04 in the study group and 7.84% ± 1.33% in the control group. A repeat HbA1c test after six months showed a mean level of 7.10% ± 0.96% among the participants who received the intervention and 7.97% ± 1.37% among the control group. The values were showing a trend of reduction in the intervention group, with a median reduction HbA1c of −0.2% (−0.3% to −0.2%). Among the participants who did not receive our intervention, a median increase of 0.1% (0%–0.2%) in HbA1c was noticed. Mann Whitney U test was performed, and it showed a statistically significant association with a p value less than 0.001.
Conclusion
From this study, we conclude that an intervention with a mobile application aimed at lifestyle modification and medication management in addition to regular medical treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus patients resulted in a better glycemic control compared to a control group who did not receive the adjuvant intervention.

The evaluation of knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of health care providers on the life-threatening drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and the implementation of specific interventions may enhance patients’ safety. The current study was designed to evaluate the KAP of healthcare providers (HCPs) on life-threatening DDIs using different drug information sources.
Methods
Validated questionnaire contains demographic data, knowledge and practice questions related to the life-threatening DDIs, and attitude towards the preferable sources of drug information. The survey forms were distributed to pharmacists as well as ward doctors in departments of cardiology, nephrology, neurology, and infectious diseases, in Penang General Hospital, Penang, Malaysia.
Results
The overall response rate for 220 distributed questionnaires was 65.45%. Knowledge level is associated with healthcare specialty (p < 0.001), with 100% houseman officer having low knowledge, years of experience (p < 0.05) (50% of the HCPs with11–15 years of experience had high knowledge) and postgraduate study (p < 0.05), which 78.2% of HCPs without postgraduate studies had a low knowledge level. An association was obtained between knowledge level and attitude towards the use of computerized interaction checker (25% and 66.7% of respondents with high knowledge level had agreed and strongly agreed, respectively, to use computerized interaction checker, p < 0.05). Respondents with high knowledge level had agreed (33%) and strongly agreed (33%) to practice screening of DDIs at admission, p < 0.05.
Conclusion
Prescribers may have insufficient knowledge to avoid potential life-threatening DDIs. These findings affirm the necessity of well-designed computerized alerting systems, in addition to highlighting on pharmacists’ role as the competent source of drug information."

Nasal polyposis (NP) is an inflammatory condition in nasal and paranasal sinus cavities and its pathophysiology is poorly understood. It seems likely that the trace elements such as zinc and selenium may play a critical role in the genesis of inflammatory sinonasal disease.
Objectives
The aim of this study was to investigate the role of these elements in NP and compare these findings with normal nasal mucosa.
Methods & materials
In this descriptive-analytic cross-sectional study which was done at Imam Khomeini hospital of Ahvaz between July 2018 and June 2019, selenium and zinc levels measured in polyp tissues of 72 patients (47 men and 25 women) and were compared with healthy nasal mucosa of 36 control cases (15 men and 21 women). Hydride generation and flame atom absorption spectroscopy were utilized for selenium and zinc quantifications, consequently.
Results
The mean tissue zinc and selenium levels were, respectively, 18.569 μg/g and 68.65 ng/g in patients group and 71.015 μg/g, 249.53 ng/g in control group. It was found that the concentrations of zinc element were significantly lower in polyp tissues than healthy nasal mucosa. In the case of selenium no significant difference was found between patients and controls.
Conclusion
Trace elements are undoubtedly useful, and further studies are needed to determine the effect of zinc and selenium on nasal and sinus polyps."

Antibiotic resistance is becoming a serious threat throughout the world. General community misuse and misconceptions in using antibiotics have been predicted to play a role in increasing antibacterial resistance (ABR). This study aimed to reveal the practicing antibiotic in the community, as information for national programs for reducing inappropriate antibiotic usage.
Methods
This study was a qualitative phenomenology approach, and the data collection was with in-depth interview. Semi-structured interviews with the interview guide were conducted from June 2019 to December 2019. Interview responses were transcribed, categorized, and coded for themes by thematic content analysis.
Results
We approached 26 participants. The most antibiotic used by participants was Amoxicillin and Supertetra®. Most participants did not know that antibiotics must be obtained from a pharmacy with a doctor's prescription. Even so, although some respondents already knew that antibiotics could only be obtained by prescription, some of them still get antibiotics without a prescription. Most informants got antibiotics from health workers (doctor-dispensed antibiotics, pharmacy staff, midwives, nurses) or non-health workers (stalls). Some of them used antibiotics as self-medication for reducing cold, flu, fever, pain, cough, headache, tired, and sore throat. Most respondents stopped their medicine when they were getting well, kept the remained antibiotics, and used it if they get sick in the future. Few participants shared their antibiotics to the family member.
Conclusions
Misuse and misconceptions about antibiotics occur in the general community. It is essential to educate the general public on an understanding of how to obtain and use rational antibiotics."

Iodine plays a critical role in fetal brain development and hence has immense importance during pregnancy. Even mild to moderate iodine deficiency in pregnancy has adverse effects on obstetric and neonatal outcome. So, the aim of this study was to assess the trimester-wise urinary iodine status of pregnant women in rural areas and determine their iodine intake.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Sarojini nagar, which is a rural block of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh from August 2016 to July 2017. All married pregnant women (15–45 years) of different trimesters attending the primary health centre (PHC) for antenatal check-up were enrolled in the study after written consent. Total 300 pregnant women were interviewed for Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) survey. Urine and salt sample was taken from 200 of them for biochemical analysis of iodine. Estimation of iodine in urine was done by wet digestion method and in salt by iodometric titration.
Results
The median urinary iodine concentration of the rural pregnant women was 246.5 μg/L with IQR of 194.9–383.4 μg/L. On comparing the urine iodine levels in the three trimesters, maximum deficiency was observed in first trimester (39.5%) followed by third trimester (31.6%) and a dip was seen in the second trimester (28.9%). The median urinary iodine levels did not show a significant difference across the three trimesters.
Conclusion
Iodine insufficiency was observed among pregnant women. Maximum deficiency was observed in first trimester which is the most vulnerable period of gestation responsible for organogenesis and fetal brain development."

Violence against children has become rampant, especially among the families with addicted parents. Accordingly, the present research was conducted to investigate the prevalence of child abuse among the families with addicted parents in the west of Iran taking into account family risk factors.
Methodology
The present research was performed with a cross-sectional design. The statistical population included all the addicted parents having the 6-12-year-old children who referred to the Narcotic Treatment Centers in Kermanshah province, Iran during 2017–2018, among which 273 subjects were randomly selected to be included in the study and filled out the Child Abuse Potential (CAP) Inventory.
Results
The results showed that the prevalence of physical and psychological abuse was equal to 43.2%. After controlling the influencing variables, child abuse among the boys was reported to be 0.67 times more than that of the girls. Furthermore, with the increase in the number of siblings, the chances of child abuse were escalated so that, those with three or more than three siblings were 2.92 times more likely to be abused than those without siblings. Being a homemaker mother increased the chance of child abuse by 0.62 times, and the occurrence of psychological problems in the family increased the chance of child abuse by 2.56 times. The chance of child abuse among the parents who were both addicted was 2.66 times more than the families where the father alone was addicted.
Conclusion
Given high prevalence of child abuse among the families with drug-addicted parents, supportive organizations are required to play a more prominent role, and it would be also essential to provide effective care programs for empowerment of the children."

Ever since the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak emerged in China, there has been several attempts to predict the epidemic across the world with varying degrees of accuracy and reliability. This paper aims to carry out a short-term projection of new cases; forecast the maximum number of active cases for India and selected high-incidence states; and evaluate the impact of three weeks lock down period using different models.
Methods
We used Logistic growth curve model for short term prediction; SIR models to forecast the maximum number of active cases and peak time; and Time Interrupted Regression model to evaluate the impact of lockdown and other interventions.
Results
The predicted cumulative number of cases for India was 58,912 (95% CI: 57,960, 59,853) by May 08, 2020 and the observed number of cases was 59,695. The model predicts a cumulative number of 1,02,974 (95% CI: 1,01,987, 1,03,904) cases by May 22, 2020. As per SIR model, the maximum number of active cases is projected to be 57,449 on May 18, 2020. The time interrupted regression model indicates a decrease of about 149 daily new cases after the lock down period, which is statistically not significant.
Conclusion
The Logistic growth curve model predicts accurately the short-term scenario for India and high incidence states. The prediction through SIR model may be used for planning and prepare the health systems. The study also suggests that there is no evidence to conclude that there is a positive impact of lockdown in terms of reduction in new cases."

Providing information for myocardial infarction patients is an important nursing function and is part of the role of health-care professionals delivering cardiac education. It is essential to acknowledge and incorporate the self-perceived needs of patients into the information they receive. Hospital stays are becoming shorter, reducing the opportunities for nurses to provide pre-discharge information to patients. This highlights the challenge of adequately assessing and meeting patients' Learning needs.
Aims and objectives
To explore the Learning needs of patients who have received treatment for a myocardial infarction before their hospital discharge. Also, to examine differences in learning needs among patients according to their demographic characteristics.
Materials and methods
A descriptive, cross-sectional, design was used to answer the research questions. A convenient sample of 55 patients interviewed in a coronary care unit at large north-western hospital in Saudi Arabia. Cardiac Patients Learning Needs Inventory (CPLNI) was used to collect data.
Results
Information about risk factors, anatomy and physiology, and medication were the most valued information by MI patients prior to discharge. There was a statistically significant difference between patients’ total learning needs according to their socio-demographic characteristics. Younger patients needed more information than older ones. Highly educated patients needed more information than those in the uneducated group.
Conclusion
This study suggests that MI patients have high learning needs within 24–48 h before hospital discharge. In addition, patients’ learning needs vary according to their demographic characteristics.
Relevance to clinical practice
Assessment of MI patients’ information needs before their discharge from hospital helps in developing effective cardiac educational programme that will help these patients in their recovery at home."

Despite flows in transport policy, it is noticed many more proven wider social factors distressing the number of road traffic accidents including injuries and deaths. A wider social determinants among low socioeconomic groups including identity crises largely contributes towards an increased rate of road accidents today in india.
Aim
The major aim of this paper is to provide evidence of why more road accident occurrence is distributed through Indian marginalized society, and explicitly between diverse and low socioeconomic groups and reasons thereof.
Method
This first-ever study has been done in South Karnataka-India among 33 accident survivors exclusively from the marginal groups using a purposive sampling technique, participated in qualitative interviews, and focus group studies. Data has been analyzed using suitable statistical software's.
Result
The result showed a valid and reliable direction regarding the association of different low socio-economic issues as a key factor for road accidents specifically among disadvantaged youths. Distinct social disparities, deprivation, social exclusion lead to identity crises which play a key role in causing more risk for road accidents among the underprivileged sections. The rate of injuries or death is also determined by the exposure to risk, which can differ between different socioeconomic groups.
Conclusion
It is noted that higher levels of deprivation lead to a higher fatal injury rate or death among low socioeconomic groups. Identity crisis because of low socio-economic profile turning a deprived, marginalized, vulnerable, and excluded people especially adults shows risky and adventurous driving. There is a need to have preventive and behavioral modification for high-risk groups."

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a global epidemic. With the start of a new decade, new strategies and health goals are expected to be formulated. The aim was to investigate a highly prevalent NCD European state to assess the age of onset for most NCDs. Such evidence can aid in the development of new preventive strategies.
Methods
A national health examination survey was conducted to explore the adult population (18–70 years) of Malta for common NCDs. Both self-reported and examination data were used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, overweight and obesity. The study population was stratified by ten years age-groups and sex for both descriptive and analytic analyses. Association studies were conducted to identify links between type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, overweight and obese status and different age groups, while adjusting for confounders.
Results
The men were significantly more metabolically unhealthy that the women across all age groups. However, a higher newly diagnosed diabetes prevalence across all age groups was established for women. Dyslipidemia, diabetes and hypertension were observed to be present from the 30–39 year age group. On modelling, this age group was associated with these NCDs even after adjusting for confounders.
Conclusion
The fourth decade of life appears to be the starting point of metabolic dysregulation, contributing to long-term health and economic burdens. Furthermore, considering this is a childbearing age group, metabolic impact can be transmitted on to their offspring. Preventive action including dysglycaemia and dyslipidaemia screening should be considered from a young age."

abstract = "Background
Frenal attachments are thin folds of mucous membrane with enclosed muscle fibers that attach the lips to the alveolar mucosa and underlying periosteum. It also has septomaxillary ligament that transmits septal growth force to premaxilla. Most often, during the oral examination of the patient the dentist gives very little importance to the frenum, for assessing its morpholology and attachment. However, it has been seen that an abnormal frenum can be an indicator of a syndrome or can cause severe mucogingival problems and prevalence of unaesthetic diastema.
Objective
So, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the variations in morphology and attachment of Frenum in diverse population.
Materials and methods
The present cross-sectional study enrolled 400 patients comprising both males and females within the age group of 20–40 years. The frenal attachment was recorded according to the classification by Mirko et al. (1974) and Sewerin (1971). The data was arranged in a tabulated form and analyzed using SPSS software. Chi square test was used for the analysis of the data.
Results
Around 61.3%, 30.3%,26.7% of the population in age group 20–30 showed gingival, papillary, papilla penetrating type of frenal attachment respectively. Presence of diastema was seen in 63.6% of female population and 36.4% in male population.
Conclusion
It can be concluded that the type of frenal attachment varies with the ethnicity of the population and that diastema is more prevalent amongst females with papilla penetrating type of frenal attachment."

abstract = "Objectives
The current study sought to investigate how sport nutrition supplements are used among a population of gym users in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the factors that underlie the consumption patterns of such supplements.
Methods
A descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out in fitness centres in Dubai, UAE. Face-to-face, questionnaire-based interviews were then conducted; the structured questionnaire that was used was mainly composed of two sections: demographic and socio-economic information and beliefs and behaviours regarding sport nutrition supplements. The data were analysed using SPSS version 24.
Results
A total of 300 respondents participated in this study and completed the whole questionnaire. In this study, 40.3% (95% CI 34.7%%–45.9%) of the respondents reported using sport nutrition supplements. The statistical modelling results showed that the belief that sport nutrition has positive effects on exercise performance, the belief that sport nutrition makes users healthier and smoking status were jointly highly associated with sport nutrition supplement behaviours.
Conclusion
The restriction of the availability of these sport supplements over the counter (OTC) is recommended, and health care providers and regulatory bodies are encouraged to contribute to efforts to provide counselling and raise awareness of the proper methods of use and the possible risks of such intake behaviour."

Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by bacteria and risk factors. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of obesity on the severity of periodontitis using the basic periodontal examination (BPE) index.
Methods
Age, gender and smoking status were collected from 258 periodontitis subjects with code 3 (shallow periodontal pocket) and 4 (deep periodontal pocket) of BPE. Periodontal status was examined using BPE criteria, detailed probing pocket depth (PPD) in sextant with BPE code 3 and full mouth PPD with BPE code 4 were recorded, plaque index and gingival index with WHO probe. Body mass index (BMI) was used to assess obesity. The relation with the severity of periodontitis was assessed using chi square and ANOVA tests.
Results
Among recruited patients, 77 were normal weight, 97 were overweight and 84 were obese, and those with shallow PPD, deep PPD and with furcation numbered 121,101 and 36, respectively. The BMI levels were higher in the smoker and older patients (>45 years) than in non-smoker and younger (≤45 years) patients and the differences were statistically significant (p = 0.004, 0.035, respectively). Average BMI levels in patients with deep PPD (28.4 ± 4.9) were higher than in those with shallow PPD (26.5 ± 5.1). Patients with obesity and overweight exhibited statistically significantly higher average PPD (5.3 ± 1.1 mm, 5.2 ± 0.9 mm, respectively) than normal weight (4.7 ± 0.3 mm) patients. Obesity status and severity of periodontitis were shown to have statistically significant association (p = 0.017).
Conclusions
This study suggests individuals with overweight and obesity experience more severe periodontitis than normal weight individuals in an Iraqi population."

The study uses official and large scale survey data, namely India Human Development Survey 2012, National Family and Health Survey 2016 and National Sample Survey 75th round on health 2019. The official data claim that around 109 million families are covered under existing GFHIs by 2017–18, while estimates from survey data do not substantiate it. The actual coverage reported by the households in survey is found 68.2% less than the claim made by the governments in official data. The size of coverage of GFHIs however makes them world's largest pro-poor health insurance schemes. The coverage amount ranges from Rs 30,000/family under Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana to as high as Rs 3,30,000/family under Bhamashah Swasthya Bima Yojana, Rajasthan, and Rs 5,00,000/family under Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana. The penetration of various scheme is recorded high among non-poor and urban as compared to their other counterparts with a wide variation across states/districts, posing serious challenge for ensuring equitable access to healthcare to the general population. The contribution of insurance in financing total health expenditure is increasing, but has substantially low share, it is the households OOP (out-of-pocket) that still constitute the higher share in financing health expenditure."

abstract = "Background
Since the onset of the COVID-19 in China, forecasting and projections of the epidemic based on epidemiological models have been in the centre stage. Researchers have used various models to predict the maximum extent of the number of cases and the time of peak. This yielded varying numbers. This paper aims to estimate the effective reproduction number (R) for COVID-19 over time using incident number of cases that are reported by the government.
Methods
Exponential Growth method to estimate basic reproduction rate R0, and Time dependent method to calculate the effective reproduction number (dynamic) were used. “R0” package in R software was used to estimate these statistics.
Results
The basic reproduction number (R0) for India was estimated at 1.379 (95% CI: 1.375, 1.384). This was 1.450 (1.441, 1.460) for Maharashtra, 1.444 (1.430, 1.460) for Gujarat, 1.297 (1.284, 1.310) for Delhi and 1.405 (1.389, 1.421) for Tamil Nadu. In India, the R at the first week from March 2–8, 2020 was 3.2. It remained around 2 units for three weeks, from March 9–29, 2020. After March 2020, it started declining and reached around 1.3 in the following week suggesting a stabilisation of the transmissibility rate.
Conclusion
The study estimated a baseline R0 of 1.379 for India. It also showed that the R was getting stabilised from first week of April (with an average R of 1.29), despite the increase in March. This suggested that in due course there will be a reversal of epidemic. However, these analyses should be revised periodically."

Documentation is a communication tool that helps in the exchange of information stored between caregivers. Quality documentation promotes structured, consistent and effective communication between healthcare providers. This is a preliminary study on the documentation in tertiary care hospitals for initial steps to be taken by the concerned health officers and decision makers.
Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out with a total of 80 respondents who were selected conveniently from a tertiary care hospital in Durgapur. Study utilized a dichotomous self-administered questionnaire. Qualitative characteristics were summarized using frequency and percentages. Chi-square test was used to investigate associations. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, Version 25, Licensed by IIHMR University, Jaipur) was used for analysis.
Results
Majority of the nurse (67.5%, n = 54) had satisfactory knowledge, attitude & practice. Chi-squared test of association revealed no significant relation between gender and knowledge, attitude & practice (χ2 = 0.15, df = 1 and p = 0.697). No significant association of knowledge, attitude & practice was observed with age (χ2 = 1.48, df = 2 and p = 0.477) and years of experience (χ2 = 2.31, df = 1 and p = 0.128).
Conclusion
The nurses appeared to be familiar with the required documentation knowledge. A pressing need was felt to emphasize on all aspects of in-patient documentation under continuous nursing education program. Newly appointed nurses were equally good in documentation compared to their senior counterparts. This study advocates the necessary actions to be taken for enabling nurses for timely documentation of patient details for improved communication with other health workers."

The study of birth interval is important for maternal and child health. The long birth interval is favorable for maternal, child health, and nutritional outcomes. The present study is an attempt to explore the relationship between birth intervals and poor nutritional condition of children under five years of age in India.
Methods
The unit of analysis is children under five years of age in India. The data come from the fourth round of Indian National Family Health Survey, 2015–2016. Bivariate and logistic regression model were used to explore the relationship between birth intervals and the poor nutritional status of children.
Results
The logistic regression shows a 28% increase in stunting for those children born with a birth interval of less than 24 months. Also, there is a 26% increase in underweight for children of birth interval less than 24 months. It is evident that low birth weight, poor facilities during pregnancy are statistically associated with poor nutritional status of children.
Conclusion
Therefore, the present study attempts to determine to what extent the length of preceding birth interval influences the child undernutrition and the result revealed that short birth intervals are associated with an increased risk of child stunting and underweight even after controlling the biological, social and behavioral predictors. The study suggests that interventions that aim to increase birth intervals, including family planning and reproductive health services, may be important in improving nutritional status in children."

This paper provides pragmatic evidence from India that son preference has pronounced effects on the sex composition of children ever born at the family/micro level. We used the National Family Health Survey-4 data consisting of 455,694 ever-married mothers, aged 15–49, for this study. By assuming that the child sex ratio is a binomial distribution for a Bernoulli random variable, we considered three dependent variables for this study are ideal number of songs, actual number of sons and desired for next child. Women who had attained the highest level of education had a 56% lower preference for sons than others. As far as, regional differences are concerned, women in the northern region preferred the boy child more than those in the southern and western regions."

Timely and safe transport of patients from the emergency scene to the appropriate healthcare facility for further care is a complex process. Administering emergency services in minimal time is a challenge in a country with basic lacunae in infrastructure”, making the role of EMTs (emergency medical technicians) and ambulance quality vital in saving lives.
Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional study using a structured questionnaire for the emergency medical technicians and ten parameters to inspect the quality of ambulances was used. Emergency medical technicians in 150 ambulances were interviewed and ambulance was inspected through convenience sampling. Chi-squared test was applied to investigate the association between quality of ambulance & emergency medical technicians’ knowledge. Logistic regression was used to obtain the measure of association adjusted for confounders. SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 25, (Licensed software of IIHMR University, Jaipur) was used for analysis.
Results
Majority of the ambulances 68% (n = 102) were found to have met the standards. Almost 71% (n = 107) of the EMTs were observed to have below average knowledge. Among ambulances not meeting the standards, 66.7% (n = 101) had EMT with below average knowledge. Ambulance quality was found to be independent of the knowledge of EMTs after adjusting for the effects of years of experience and age of the EMTs.
Conclusion
Majority of the ambulances were found to have met the standards however public health workers should work towards improving the emergency medical technicians’ knowledge on transportation of emergency cases."

Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is explored as a new technology for communicating with computer over past few decades. It uses signals collected from brain to communicate, control or instruct computer or electronic devices. Analyzing the signals collected is most important task. If the collected data contains overlapping classes, directly applying classification techniques is inefficient.
Methodology
To examine and analyze the data, clustering can be useful to exploit information about dispersion of different classes. In this paper, we propose an agglomerative method for clustering high dimensional EEG signal data using multi prototype approach. This bi-phase algorithm chooses appropriate representatives in first phase, and combines them in second phase. We use squared error clustering in first phase to produce multiple prototypes located in highly dense region. A new combination measure is also proposed using fuzzy logic, to evaluate degree of prototypes can be combined.

Solid waste management is growing concern particularly in developing countries due its ill health effects to proximate communities. Study assess health effects of dumping site among nearby community members and identifying potential risk factors.
Methods
A cross-sectional household survey was conducted using a case comparison design. Study population consisted of an exposed group and non-exposed group (nearby and a distant community respectively; n=200 each) having similar socio-economic and living conditions. To assess the health effects of dumping site, data on selected morbidities has been analyzed using the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method.
Results
The study findings suggest a relatively higher prevalence of selected morbidities among exposed group than non-exposed group particularly for respiratory illness (23% v 10%), eye irritation (20% v 9.5%) and for stomach problem (27% v 20%) respectively. Result from PSM suggest that exposure to the dumping site leads to a higher prevalence of respiratory illness (12%), eye irritation (8%) and stomach problems (7%). Multivariate analysis suggest respondents from the exposed group were significantly more likely to suffer from respiratory illness (OR 3.06, p < 0.01), eye infection (OR 2.39, p < 0.01) and stomach problems (OR 1.66, p < 0.05). Assessment of air-quality-index suggests poor levels of PM10 and PM2.5 during fire broke-out in Deonar dumping site.
Conclusion
Study concludes that the prevalence of morbidities found to be significantly higher among the exposed group than non-exposed group particularly it is significantly higher for respiratory illness and eye infection. The propensity score matching methods reinstate that morbidities found to be significantly higher among exposed group than non-exposed group."

Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in South Delhi, India. 100 pre-diagnosed patients each of dengue and malaria were studied. Features on clinical examination, and results of radiological and biochemical investigations were recorded. Continuous variables were compared using t-test, whereas categorical variables were subjected to chi-square test. P-value of ≤0.05 was taken as significant.
Results
All patients presented with short pyrexia (fever <7 days). Rash (27%), pruritus (28%), abdominal pain (30%) and breathlessness (20%) were significantly associated with dengue, whereas headache (99%) was significantly associated with malaria. Radiological investigations showed patients with dengue had pleural effusion (46%) and ascites (49%), and hepatosplenomegaly was more common in malaria (44%). Mean hemoglobin levels, and platelet counts were significantly lower in malaria (11.24 g/dL, and 62.07 × 103/mm3 respectively), than in dengue (13.03 g/dL, and 84.61 × 103/mm3 respectively). Liver enzymes showed rise in both diseases with a marked elevation in dengue. Raised serum bilirubin levels and mild renal dysfunction were both highly significant for malaria (P < 0.001).

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, accounting for 10% of disability-adjusted life years lost in low- and middle-income countries. Few studies have been conducted in Haiti. WHO has cited a substantial lack of information on chronic disease prevalence in Haiti impeding progress in interventions. (Organization., 2014) Preventing and managing CVD through use of risk prediction tools is key in addressing this growing problem.
Objective
Using data from 1798 adults aged 25–65 years old with urban and rural Haiti, we estimated the 10-year CVD risk groups (<10%, 10% to <20%, 20% to <30%, 30% to <40%, and≥40%) based on the WHO/ISH cardiovascular risk score chart.
Methods
In addition to performing a questionnaire based on the WHO STEPS instrument, we measured two blood pressure values, weight, height, abdominal circumference, as well as point of care test finger stick blood sample for hemoglobinA1c, creatinine, and cholesterol (total, HDL and triglycerides). For blood pressure, 2104 (99.1%) completed two measurements, 2074 (97.6%) were measured for height, weight, and waist circumference, 1858 (87.5%) had hemoglobinA1C for diabetes, 1980 (93.2%) had creatinine, and 1819 (85.6%) had cholesterol. As a result, 993 urban and 710 rural had complete data for this analysis.
Results
The overall predicted CVD risk scores were: 75% (<10%), 15% (10% to <20%), 5.0% (20% to <30%), 1.3% (30% to <40%), and 2.9% (≥40%). Female gender and older age were significantly associated with higher 10-year CVD risk while urban/rural location, education, and income were not.

Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms with different prevalence in different genders, age groups and various parts of the CNS. This study aimed to investigate the incidence of malignant neoplasm of brain (C71) based on Fars population data.
Methods
This study was cross-sectional, carried out based on Fars population –based Cancer Registry (FPCR) data. Data was collected retrospectively reviewing all malignant neoplasm of brain patients’ records during a 5-year period (2011–2015). Age Standardized Incidence Rates (ASR) were calculated based on world population standards. To analyze the ASR time trends by gender, we carried out a chi-square goodness of fit test.
Results
Findings revealed that 1043 cases of malignant neoplasm of brain were registered, 438 (%41.9) of which were women. Malignant neoplasm of brain became the eighth malignancy in 2015 in both genders. Its incidence was higher in men (26.15/100000) than in women (19.45/100 000). There was an increasing but not significant trend from 2011 to 2013 in both men and women (p = 0.722, p = 0.478, respectively). The highest increase was in 2013 (ASR = 6.64 in men and ASR = 5.71 in women per 100,000).
Conclusion
Brain and other CNS tumors are an important source of cancer deaths around the world. Regional variations in incidence may provide clues leading to genetic and/or environmental causes as well as a basis for expanding knowledge about their epidemiology. This study demonstrated that the trend had been increasing in the years during which the study was conducted."

Our aim in this study was to translate the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-A and B) scales to Arabic, linguistically validate them for use in a representative sample of the Lebanese population, and to check the reliability of these Arabic versions.
Methods
This study is cross-sectional, conducted between November 2017 and March 2018, which enrolled 1332 community dwelling participants using a proportionate random sample from all Lebanese Mohafazat.
Results
Three factor analyses for the anxiety scales were run over the whole sample (N = 1332). All of the HAM-A, STAI-A and STAI-B items could be extracted from the list. All items from all the scales did not over-correlate to each other (r > 0.9), did not have a low loading on factors (<0.3) or a low communality (<0.3). The factor analysis results showed 2 factors for HAM-A (Cronbach alpha = 0.921), 3 factors for STAI-A (Cronbach alpha = 0.928) and STAI-B (Cronbach alpha = 0.898). A significantly high ICC was found between the HAM-A, STAI-A (ICC = 0.709) and STAI-B (0.704). In addition, a significantly high ICC was found between the STAI-A and B scales (ICC = 0.884).

The scale of HCV problem in Egypt prioritized the development of a national control strategy that employs the use of locally manufactured generic direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Achieving sustained virologic response in chronic HCV patients is the key for preventing fibrosis progression and ultimately its resolution.
Objective(s)
To evaluate impact of generic DAAs on liver fibrosis in chronic HCV patients using some non-invasive biomarkers (NIBMs).
Methods
A total of 280 chronic HCV patients (18 treatment experienced and 262 naive) were enrolled and received the standard of care. All patients were clinically evaluated before starting treatment and at 4, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment.
Results
The sensitivity and the specificity of the tested NIBMs for predicting cirrhosis versus liver ultrasound ranged between 75.0-79.6% and 59.4–67.2% respectively. All NIBMs showed significant linear decline during the treatment and follow up periods among responders but tended to fluctuate in values toward an increase among non-responders. In cox regression analysis, normal baseline ALT, AST, total serum cholesterol, serum albumin, WBCS, prothrombin activity and early stages of liver fibrosis predicted improvement in liver fibrosis by 1.5–2 folds. The mean probability of recovery at 1, 3, 6 months varied between the different scores and ranged from 0.059 to 0.637, 0.125–0.741, 0.538–0.951 respectively.
Conclusion
The results provide prognostic data on the improvement in liver fibrosis over the treatment course and follow up periods without the need for a liver biopsy. Early detection and management of HCV infection should be emphasized to maximize the benefits of the treatment."

abstract = "Background
Stunting describes the condition of chronic malnutrition in children under the age of five, especially in the first 1000 days of life, so that it has an impact on increasing morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between passive smoking and stunting in children 25–59 months old.
Method
This cross-sectional study used a stratified random sampling technique in 123 children 25–59 months old. Exposure of cigarette smoke is assessed from the length of exposure to cigarette smoke using The Secondhand Smoke Exposure Scale questionnaire.
Results
Bivariate statistical test with Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact Test showed the relationship of stunting to length of cigarette smoke exposure (p-value <0.000; OR 10.316), water source (p-value 0.040; OR 0.145), hygiene (p-value 0.028; OR 2.742), exclusive breastfeeding (p-value 0.041; OR 0.396), history of pregnancy disorders (p-value 0.035; OR 2.791), and recurrent respiratory infections (p-value <0.000; OR 21,368). Logistic regression analysis showed that the length of smoking increases the risk of stunting (p-value <0.000; OR 13,49), and the most influential variable was recurrent respiratory infections (p-value <0.000; OR 30.57).
Conclusion
Length of exposure of more than 3 h a day increases the risk of stunting by 10,316 times. Public policy needs to provide health education in the community and family about the effects of cigarette smoke exposure on the increased risk of stunting in children."

abstract = "Background
The Indian government provides for free/subsidized services in public hospitals and conditional cash transfer (CCT) schemes for delivery care. Our objectives were to estimate the proportion of women reporting out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) for delivery care at home and public hospitals, magnitude of components of OOPE for public hospitals by wealth status, and to determine the factors associated with OOPE for delivery care at home and public hospitals in South 24 Parganas district.
Methods
We did a community based cross-sectional analytical study among women who delivered between November 2016 to March 2017. We calculated median (Inter-Quartile Range) direct and indirect expenditures. We did multiple logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (95% confidence interval).
Results
All women reported OOPE for delivery care. Median OOPE was INR 865 (IQR: 520,1700) at public hospital and INR 1700 (IQR: 550,2300) at home. Among public hospital deliveries, majority of OOPE was due to indirect expenditure, 35.8% due to wage loss. Poorest women had the highest median gross OOPE. The middle-income group had the highest median percentage of reduction in OOPE for home delivery after receiving government subsidy. OOPE was most likely for a male child (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.1–2.0) for home delivery and for caesarian section (OR 56.8, 95% CI 13.6–237) among the public hospital deliveries.
Conclusions
Women incurred OOPE for delivery care at home and public hospitals despite free/subsidized care. Augmenting the package of delivery-related CCT schemes and increase in universal health insurance coverage for economically poor households can reduce the financial burden of delivery care in the district."

To determine the awareness about Pre-Hospital care among school teachers in Mangalore and to determine how many teachers have received formal training in Pre-Hospital care.
Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among school teachers in 5 schools across Mangalore. Convenience sampling was done. Data was obtained from 118 school teachers across five schools in Mangalore, India using a self-administered questionnaire.
Results
It was observed that 61.9% of teachers knew that personal protective equipment has to be worn while giving first aid to someone. Knowledge of school teachers about choking, allergic reactions, heart attacks and hypoglycemic state was considerably better while 94.9% of school teachers knew how to handle a person in a hypoglycemic state. Most teachers, i.e. 93.2% of teachers knew the signs and symptoms of trauma to the head. However only 49.2% teachers knew how to handle nosebleeds. Only 17.8% teachers knew that an allergic reaction to a bee sting must be washed for at least 30 min. Only 57 participants had received previous training in Pre-hospital care. Out of these, 43.8% received training from nurses and 33.3% from paramedical staff.
Conclusion
The proportion of school teachers who have received pre hospital training in the recent past was low, their knowledge regarding first aid care was found to be adequate."

Population-based cancer registry (PBCR) plays a significant role in burden of cancer estimation. Estimating the completeness of cancer registry is one of the criteria to assess the quality of data (results). Also, Capture-recapture is one of the methods used to assess completeness of cancer registry.
Objective
This study was aimed to estimate the completeness of lung and bronchial cancer registry using three-source capture-recapture method in Khuzestan province.
Materials and methods
This study was carried out using three-source capture-recapture method and data were obtained from three sources including medical records, death certificates and pathology labs (reports) in Khuzestan. In this study, total new cases of lung and bronchial cancer registered by the three sources in 2011, were enrolled. Among the sources, the common cases were identified and the completeness rate of lung and bronchial cancer registry was calculated by log-linear method using R software, finally.
Results
Totally, 426 new cases for lung cancer had reported from the three sources in 2011. The completeness index of lung cancer registry was totally estimated 72%, as well as it was independently 40%, 25% and 37.6% for the medical records, pathology reports and death certificates sources, respectively.
Conclusion
According to the results, after collection and remove repetition of the cases related to lung cancer, it should be added their number registered by the pathology (labs), medical records and death certificates sources by 28%–40%, to estimate actual incidence of lung cancer. Also, the actual incidence of lung cancer cases related to each of medical records, pathology and death certificates was calculated by adding the reported values by 60%, 75% and 63%, respectively."

The present study focuses on the different determining factors of institutional delivery among the women (last birth women who had at least one live birth preceding five years of the survey) aged 15–49 years in India.
Method
The entire study based on secondary data which was collected from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4 conducted in 2015–16. Binary (0, 1) logistic regression has been performed for the proper depiction of the results.
Results
The results shows that there were a number of determining factors of place of delivery in India and the result of binary logistic regression shows that there was a huge difference in the likelihood of deliver at institution among the ever-married women i.e. middle aged (25–34 years) women were more likely [AOR:1.127, 95% CI:1.034–1.229, p < 0.01] to deliver at institution than the younger aged women; women having higher birth order (4 or 4+) were less likely to deliver at institution than the low birth order; higher educated women were more likely [AOR:2.737, 95% CI:2.223–3.371, p < 0.01 ] to deliver at institution than the lower educated women; Hindu women were more likely to deliver at institution than the other religious women; richest women were more likely to deliver at institution than the poor women; the women who received antenatal care at the time of pregnancy period were more (2.8 times) likely [AOR:2.833, 95% CI:2.632–3.049, p < 0.01] to deliver at institution than the women who don't received any antenatal care and the women who enjoy the higher autonomy were more likely [AOR:1.199, 95% CI:1.071–1.342, p < 0.01] to deliver at institution than the women who have low or partial autonomy in India.

Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are one of the most important occupational problems. However, there has also been no worldwide review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of MSDs among operation room personnel. The present study aimed to investigate and estimate the prevalence of MSDs among operating room personnel using a systematic review and meta-analysis study.
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in 2019. The researchers searched Medline/PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Embase, and Google Scholar. Studies classified by categories of country and populations. In order to determine and control the quality assessment of articles, researchers use the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist.
Results
A total of 111 articles from databases were found. Final screening included 12 into statistical analysis. Based on the random-effect model, the prevalence of MSDs in neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists & hands, upper back, lower back, hip, knees, and ankles & feet was 53.66% (CI 95%: 43.30–64.02), 55.63% (CI 95%: 43.90–67.36), 23.01% (CI 95%: 14.75–31.27), 38.79% (CI 95%: 21.95–55.62), 44.20% (CI 95%: 27.80–60.59), 61.48% (CI 95%: 44.33–78.64), 26.56% (CI 95%: 10.40–42.72), 43.43% (CI 95%: 23.80–63.06), and 57.06% (CI 95%: 48.25–65.87), respectively. Based on the results of meta-regression, there was no statistically significant relationship between prevalence of MSDs and mean of age, and year of study.
Conclusion
The study results revealed the high prevalence of MSDs, specifically in lower back among the operating room personnel. Considering the difficult conditions of working in the operating room, MSDs and particularly back pain are unpreventable."

The extension of industrialization in rural India during previous decade has opened wide employment opportunities. As a result, the per-capita income and expenditure capability of these individuals and their families have raised. However informal sectors in rural areas, particularly with restricted public health care facilities and lack of social security scheme coverage, out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditure could result in catastrophic health expenditure (CHE).
Aim
To study the relation of sociodemographic and occupational factors with CHE among rural informal sector families.
Method
ology: All 13 villages of Gangad (Gujarat state, India) primary health care catchment area was cross sectionally investigated. After informed written consent, data regarding sociodemographic profile, total health expenditure and health facility access were collected from 429 representative households through pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. The sample was categorized based on the major source of income (occupation). SPSS software was used to execute the statistical analysis.
Results
About 61.8% families accessed government health facilities. While 71% of families were from lower-middle and lower socioeconomic class experiencing the brunt of CHE (i.e. 57.9% of families in this sociodemographic group experienced CHE). The proportion of CHEs among families accessing public health care facilities had substantially lower (13.2%); whereas higher proportion of CHEs were reported among families of factory workers (45.5%) and agricultural labor (25.5%).
Conclusion
In the interest of reducing the OOP health expenditure (thereby reducing the incidence of CHE) and sustainable growth, the vulnerable informal sector is recommended to be adequately protected under social security schemes by either government or employer."

Clinical pharmacy is a relatively new field of practice in Indian hospital settings, the health care providers (HCPs) has scarce knowledge regarding the roles & activities of the clinical pharmacist. The objective of this study was to determine the perceptions of health care providers towards clinical pharmacists who work on healthcare teams in terms of the potential benefits of clinical pharmacists and the current expectations of physicians and to explore the barriers that impede the clinical pharmacists' contributions from the physician's point of view.
Methodology
The study was conducted as an interventional study in a tertiary care hospital among HCPs (n = 153) in three phases. Pre and post-interventional phase consisted of auditing the behaviour and attitudes of HCPs about clinical pharmacy services and interventional phase consisted of developing professional recognition & professional awareness. The statistical test was performed using the Chi-Square test and analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Results
41.1% of the HCPs stated that they have not heard about clinical pharmacy services. A significantly higher number of physicians prefer face to a face communication system (χ2 = 6.428, df = 1, p < 0.05) compared to nurses & other HCPs. Lack of clinical pharmacist time was found to be the first barrier to the inter-professional relationship. 48.6% of the physicians reported that they never had open communication with the pharmacist.
Conclusion
GPs are aware of the current professional training of clinical pharmacist as being more patient orientated. However, GPs strongly disagreed that clinical pharmacist has the right to set therapeutic decisions or to maintain a complete medication profile of patients."

Sierra Leone includes in countries which exhibit the highest prevalence of under-five mortality in the world. A range of factors are known to have challenged the under-five survival in the country; some comprise outbreak of epidemics, socioeconomic inequalities, regional disparities, and unsuccessful implementation of healthcare initiatives. The present study aims to identify crucial predictors of under-five survival.
Methods
This paper used the Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey (SLDH, 2013). A Cox Proportional Hazards Model was applied to the sample of 24,742 children to analyze the adjusted and unadjusted hazards ratio of crucial risk factors of under-five mortality.
Results
The results show that birth interval and birth size are leading risk factors of under-five mortality in Sierra Leone. A birth spacing exceeding three years is associated with the lowest risk compared to 2–3 years and lesser than two years. The average or larger birth size has the lowest hazards followed by smaller than average, and the magnitude of the effect remains the same in adjusted and unadjusted models. The wealth status is a crucial predictor only in the unadjusted model. Mother's age, sex of the child, and a number of children in the household are significant covariates.
Conclusion
Given the research findings, this study recommends for re-orientation of reproductive healthcare strategies to target the younger mother and birth-spacing, and integration of nutrition-related interventions with the maternal healthcare initiatives to influence the child birth-size."

abstract = "Background
Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the most common illnesses affecting people of all ages worldwide. Viruses contribute to 30–70% of acute respiratory infections. Identification of these respiratory viruses is not given high priority except influenza; however, the knowledge about prevalence of non-influenza viruses, their seasonal pattern and genetic evolution have significant epidemiological value.
Methods
As a part of National Influenza-like illness surveillance programme, respiratory specimens were collected children and adults with symptoms of ILI or ARI, between January 2012 and March 2015 (including SARI cases). Real-time PCR was done to identify 13 respiratory viruses. Sequencing was done for representative isolates of each virus using ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer.
Results
During the study period between January 2012 and March 2015, a total of 648 patients with symptoms of ARI were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 20.2 years (SD = 19.13, median = 18); 292 (45.1%) were children (≤13 years) and 356 (54.9%) were adults. Respiratory viruses were identified in 44% (287/648) of all patients. Influenza accounted for the maximum number of cases- 179/648 (27.6%). Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated with 34 cases (5.2%), followed by HMPV 24 (3.7%) and PIV-3 20 (3%). Four patients died due to INF A/H1N1 (2012-2, 2015-2) as a result of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (CFR 3.7%). Among the non-influenza viruses, no particular seasonality pattern was observed over the different months of the study period.
Conclusion
Antibiotic usage in treating acute respiratory infections empirically is not justified as nearly half of ARI are due to viruses; nearly 28% of them were due to influenza viruses. Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated, followed by HMPV. This study is based on an active influenza surveillance initiated after 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, in the Union territory of Puducherry which has contributed significantly to the knowledge of the burden of influenza and non-influenza viruses among children and adults. Such surveillance network has paved the way for better diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions."

Metabolic syndrome is one of the most important risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing chronic diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its component as well as to find out the predictors in India. It has also tried to see the coexistence of metabolic syndrome and other morbid conditions.
Methods
This study has utilized the secondary data collected in fourth round of National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), which was conducted during 2015–2016 in India. Since this study is concentrated on metabolic syndrome among women and men, so various information regarding biomarker measurements and various socio-economic, demographic and lifestyle characteristics have been used. Appropriate bivariate and multivariate analysis have been done to carry out the results.
Results
In this representative sample of Indian men, about 1.1% have met the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria for metabolic syndrome whereas almost 1.5% women aged 15–49 have met this criteria. The results of multivariate analysis revealed that the risk of metabolic syndrome increase steadily with age and the risk is quite high among people belonging to higher wealth quintiles and postmenopausal period.
Conclusion
Though this study has shown a comparatively lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome but at the same time it has highlighted some high prevalence for the components of metabolic syndrome. So emphasis should be focused on prevention, early detection of metabolic risk factors and treatment of its components that will have a significant impact on future adult health."

Many western studies have revealed that the vegetarian diet has a lesser risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). However, very few studies have been conducted in India on the association of diet with lipid profile and risk factors on developing CHD. The study aims to assess the association of risk factors with diet among CHD patients.
Methods
The observational study was conducted for one year among CHD patients. Newly diagnosed CHD patients aged above 18 years and patients with or without comorbid conditions were included in the study. Patients with a past medical history of CHD and dyslipidemia were excluded. Patient's demographic details like age, gender, educational status, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, personal history like alcohol consumption, smoking, and diet were collected. The association of diet with total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and triglycerides (TG) were analysed.
Results
Among 251 patients, 45 (18%) were found to be vegetarians, and 206 (82%) were omnivorous. Compared to vegetarians, omnivorous group has shown high levels of LDL (p-value 0.00), HDL (p-value 0.011) and TC (p-value 0.00). The omnivorous group has more likely to smoke and consume alcohol (p-value 0.013). Omnivorous group of CHD patients without lifestyle risk factors have shown high levels of LDL (p-value 0.000), TG (p-value 0.000) and TC (p-value 0.000).

abstract = "Background
Low vitamin D levels have been associated with various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, although data are not consistent. Serum vitamin D levels depend on different synthesis steps which are controlled by gene cascade. This study investigated whether low serum levels of vitamin D and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in the vitamin D cascade (VDR, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24 and DBP) could be risk factors for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
Materials and methods
71 Patients with ACS and 443 healthy controls were genotyped for polymorphisms in genes of the vitamin D cascade. Clinical findings were correlated with serum levels of the vitamin D metabolites 1,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3.
Results
25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 insufficiency was more common in ACS patients than in controls (p < 0.05). After adjustments for variables and propensity score the SNPs rs4646536 and rs2296241 within CYP24 and CYP27B1 are significantly associated with ACS (p < 0.05). CYP27B1 rs4646536 genotype TT is more frequently found in ACS patients compared to healthy controls, whereas genotype TC is found at higher frequency in controls (79% vs 44% and 42% vs 5%, respectively, p < 0.01). CYP24 rs2296241 SNP genotype GG occurred less frequently in ACS vs controls (7% vs 18%), while genotype AG was found more frequently in ACS (79% vs 57%, p < 0.01).
Conclusions
Lower vitamin D levels as well as polymorphisms within the CYP27B1 and CYP24 genes seem to promote ACS. These findings may offer potential for identification of patients at increased risk for cardiovascular incidents."

Excessive and insufficient sleep disrupts glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the evidence underlying the association between sleep duration, sleep quality and glycaemic control in Asian diabetic population remains unclear. We aimed to perform a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of observational studies to examine the sleep duration and sleep quality on glycaemic control in Asian population with T2DM.
Methods
A systematic search was performed on PubMed and Embase from inception through April 2019 to identify studies assessing the relationship between sleep duration, sleep quality and glycemic control in Asian population with T2DM. Estimated the pooled mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a weighted random-effect model.
Results
Overall, seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results suggesting short sleep was associated with significantly higher HbA1c levels compared to normal sleep (MD: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.06–0.17). While long sleep duration was associated with significantly higher fasting plasma glucose levels (FPG) (MD: 5.30; 95% CI: 3.27–7.34) compared to normal sleep duration. Good sleep quality was significantly reduced the FPG levels (MD: 11.28; 95% CI: 5.13–17.42), compared to poor sleep quality.
Conclusions
Our study suggested that sleep duration, as well as the quality of sleep, is thought to be an important factor in the metabolic function of type 2 diabetes patients. Further studies warrant to confirm the present findings and to establish the potential causal relationship between sleep and glycaemic control."

India accounts for more than 2/3rd of total deaths due to NCD's and South East Asian Regions make up to 62% of disease burden. Obesity being major risk factor for NCD's, Post-Partum weight retention (PPWR) could be an important preventable predisposing factor, reducing one's risk of acquiring NCD's. Objectives: (1) Determine Post-Partum Weight Retention (PPWR) among Mothers at near one-year post delivery and determine its association with socio-demographic, cultural and behavioural factors.
Methodology
It's a cross-sectional community based study, conducted at Urban -Primary Health Centres and Anganwadi centres of Mysuru, Karnataka, India among the mothers between 10 and 14 months post-delivery. Multi-stage sampling technique was adopted to recruit estimated sample size of 150 Mothers. Data on pre-pregnancy weight was obtained retrospectively from the Maternal and Child Health cards and present weight, waist circumference, hip circumference were measured using standardized procedures. Data on sociodemographic, cultural and behavioural factors were collected using culturally adopted pre-tested self-administered questionnaire. Data was analysed using SPSS V25 (Licensed to institution).
Results
91.3% Mothers retained weight post-partum. Among them, 55% had shifted to higher category of Body Mass Index. Significant Statistical difference was seen w.r.t waist circumference, hip circumference, frequency of breast feeding, consumption of cereals/fat, practice of food taboos and physical activity between mothers with PPWR and without PPWR.
Conclusion and Recommendation
Significant Proportion of Mothers had PPWR. Routine maternal and child follow-ups post-delivery should be utilized for creating awareness on lifestyle changes to reduce PPWR."

The level of development and quality of life for a country depends on its newborn. Bangladesh has failed to reduce the number of underweight children between 1990 and 2015, whereas overweight is one of the most visible yet neglected public health issues. Hence, immediate actions need to be taken to improve both cases. The objective of this study is to identify the influencing socioeconomic and demographic factors for the discrepancy in under-5 child's weight.
Methods
The study is based on the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), 2014. Originally, the data was collected from 17,866 households. After extracting the variable from the sample weighted original dataset, this study covered 8092 respondents. The dependent variable, under-5 child's weight was settled by scheming weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ) and Body Mass Index-for-age Z-score (BAZ). Then, the polytomous logistic regression model was incorporated to get insight into the underweight and overweight categories relative to the normal weighted under-5 child.
Results
The significant predictors for influencing under-5 child's weight are place of residence, mother's and father's education level, mother's body mass index, mother's current working status, mother's age at first birth, father's occupation, child's birth order, and region of residence.
Conclusion
Parental education, mother's current working status and place of residence have the most significant effect on under-5 child's weight. Public health officials and administrators of Bangladesh across sectors need to develop more effective programs and strategies for effective actions to adequately address the good nutrition and health of a child."

Self-efficacy is regarded as a significant factor in self-concept, motivational theories, and health-related behaviors, and can seriously influence one's level of performance. The current article seeks to determine the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) among substance abusers.
Methods
The research method is descriptive and adopts a validation approach. 261 individuals (47 females and 214 males) were selected among the substance abusers who referred to Kermanshah Farabi Therapeutic Educational Center in 2017 in an accessible procedure, and the subjects completed the GSE Scale and AWARE (Advanced WArning of RElapse) Questionnaire-Revised Form. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha coefficient, correlation coefficient, and divergent validity were used for data analysis.
Results
The mean and standard deviation of the GSE score of the addicts was 25.79 ± 8.54. The findings corroborated the single-factor structure of the GSE Scale among substance abusers. This factor explained 0.67% of the total variance of the GSE Scale. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was obtained to be 0.94. The results showed that the correlation between the GSE Scale and AWARE Questionnaire was −0.51, and was significant at p < 0.01.
Conclusion
Given that the results showed that the GSE Scale has sufficient validity and reliability among substance abusers, it seems that this tool can be used to screen GSE screening among addicts."

abstract = "Background
Uncontrolled population growth is an ongoing global concern. Rapid population growth contributes not only to the incidence of poverty but also to the transmission of poverty across generations. Adoption of family planning is crucial to limiting the unsustainable growth of the population. Although family planning services are offered free of cost, the acceptance of contraceptive methods shows wide regional variations.
Objectives
To determine the prevalence and pattern of contraceptive usage and to determine the magnitude of unmet need among the married women of reproductive age in an urban area of Mysuru.
Material and methods
A community based Cross-Sectional study was carried out among 457 married women in the reproductive age group. House to house survey was conducted and data was collected by interview method using a pre-tested, semi-structured proforma after obtaining informed consent. Data was coded and entered into MS Excel 2016 and analysed.
Results
The prevalence of contraceptive use was found to be 55.1%. The most common contraceptive used was the terminal method of tubectomy. Male Condom was the most common temporary method of contraception used. The unmet need for contraception was found to be 18.16% with an 8.06% unmet need for spacing and a 10.6% unmet need for limiting.
Conclusion
Contraceptive prevalence was 55.1% with 18.16% unmet need for contraception. Misapprehension and fear of side effects was a major reason for non-utilization of contraceptives. Routine Family Planning counselling and peer discussions will go a long way in dispelling the myths associated with family planning."

Though there are issues with the projected morbidity and mortality figures, there is a general agreement that the data collection processes need to be strengthened, especially in the context of developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. The high burden of disease associated with communicable diseases in Africa, increases the overall antibiotic use and weakens the healthcare system of the continent. Even though the scale of antibiotic use may be lower than in some other regional contexts, the high burden of infectious disease makes antimicrobial resistance a priority in the continental context. In human health sector, antibiotic resistance is becoming a problem in community acquired infections as well as healthcare associated infections. This situation is fuelled by the rampant misuse of antibiotics across the African countries; and the surveillance efforts have been quite weak in this regard. Antibiotic use is increasing in food animal production too, as the continent is moving towards various intensification methods to improve productivity. Therefore the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance patterns in animal health and food animal production, has a lot of significance in understanding the potential threats to human health and food security. But for any surveillance system to be effective, especially in the context of AMR, it needs to be truly ‘One Health’ in its approach. The division between animal health and human health is not scientific, but cultural in its character. This has to be broken down to create a proper ‘One Health’ surveillance system with data integration possible at different levels."

India has the highest number of envenomation and the highest number of deaths due to snakebite in the world. However, there is wide variation in the regional prevalence of snake species involved in causation of snakebites. The objectives of the study were to determine the prevalence of causative species involved in snakebites presented to the institution and identification of risk factors that triggered the infliction.
Methods
The cross-sectional study was conducted among snakebite causalties admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Malappuram district of Kerala. Data were collected from the medication charts of confirmed bite victims admitted to critical care unit of the hospital prospectively. Statistical analysis was performed using χ2, Student's t-test and ANOVA.
Results
The sample comprised of 60 (65.9%) males and 31 (34.1%) females, fashioning a gender ratio of 1.93. The causative snake species was unidentified in 48 (52.7%) instances. Russel's viper, hump nose viper (HNV), spectacled cobra and common krait were involved in 21 (23.1%), 14 (15.4%), 5 (5.5%) and 3 (3.3%) inflictions respectively. 77 (84.6%) victims were residents of rural area in opposition to 14 (15.4%) from urban area. 80 (87.9%) subjects presented with an alleged bite at lower extremities as opposed to 11 (12.1%) with infliction on upper extremities.
Conclusions
Russel's viper constituted the most prevalent species among identified cases in the study setting. Male gender, working class population, outdoor occupation without adequate protective footwear, monsoon season and rural residency were identified as risk factors for contracting snakebites."

The primary objective was to determine the outcome, in terms of mortality and development of bilirubin encephalopathy, of neonates with severe hyperbilirubinemia. The secondary objective was to determine the possible risk factors for development of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE).
Methods
Consecutive neonates of >35 weeks gestation admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) with a serum bilirubin >20mg% in first 72h of life or >25mg% later were enrolled in the study. The clinical and demographic characteristics of the neonates were recorded. Neonates were treated with phototherapy and exchange transfusion as required. Outcome in terms of mortality and development of bilirubin encephalopathy was noted. Discharged neonates were followed at 1, 3, and 6 months for chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (CBE).
Results
Out of 64 neonates enrolled, 28 (44%) were admitted with ABE. Four with ABE left against medical advice. Out of 60 neonates studied, 5 (8.3%) expired. A total of 17 (89.5%) neonates of ABE group and 25% of all neonates developed CBE on follow-up. A lower weight on admission (2254.68+417g vs 2481.75+369g; p=0.0195), ABO/Rh incompatibility (odds ratio 4.00; 95% CI: 1.13–14, p=0.030), a positive Coomb's test (odds ratio 5.7; 95% CI: 1.53–21.4, p=0.0096), culture-proven sepsis (odds ratio 16; 95% CI: 0.82–312, p=0.067), and normal vaginal delivery (odds ratio 5.5; 95% CI: 1.1–27.4, p=0.037) were found to be significant risk factors for development of ABE.
Conclusion
Nearly half of the neonates admitted in a tertiary care NICU with severe hyperbilirubinemia had features of ABE on admission. The risk was more if they were born vaginally, had a lower weight on admission, had blood group incompatibility with positive Coomb's test, and had sepsis."

Cervical cancer, mainly caused by human papillomavirus infection, is one of the most frequent cancers in women in the developing world including India. The present study attempts to explore the risk factors related to symptoms of cervical cancer.
Materials and methods
A total of 1319 females of age groups ranging from 14 years to 85 years were included in the present study and analyzed for symptoms and risk factors for cervical cancer.
Results
The prevalence of painful micturition, white discharge per vagina, and pelvic pain in the age group 25–44 years was found to be 22.1%, 21%, and 8%, respectively, and the distribution of symptoms was statistically associated (p<0.05) with age. Chances of developing painful micturition were significantly related to age group 45–54 years (AOR=2.5; 95% C.I.: 1.4–4.5), while the likelihood of developing pelvic pain was significantly related to the females of age groups of below 25 years (AOR=8.4; 95% C.I.: 1.4–12.1) and 25–34 years (AOR=7.9; 95% C.I.: 1.7–8.3). Pelvic pain was also independently related to the abnormal age of menarche (≤11 or ≥16 years) (AOR=3.6; 95% C.I.: 1.6–8.5) concerning the standard age of start.
Conclusions
Findings of the study indicate that there is lack of awareness about the key risk factors for cervical cancer among women that pointed out the issue of limited knowledge which may work as an obstacle in health services utilization."

On 10th November 2014 health workers from Bardhwaja village informed district surveillance unit, Howrah, about suspected measles outbreak. We investigated it to confirm etiology, estimated coverage and effectiveness of MCV.
Method
We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 0–15 years’ children (n=613). We did house-to-house survey to identify measles cases, defined as occurrence of fever with rash with one of the three: cough, coryza, conjunctivitis. We tested blood samples from 8 case-patients. We described the distribution of case-patients by time, place and person. We estimated the coverage (and 95% CI) of MCV and compared the attack rate (AR) among vaccinated and unvaccinated children to estimate effectiveness of MCV.
Result
We identified 68 measles case-patients (AR: 11.1%, no death). All sera were positive for IgM measles antibodies. Cases started occurring from 2nd week of September, peaked during October and declined during November. Median age of case-patients was 84 months (IQR: 54–114 months); Vaccine coverage of MCV1 among 9 months to 15 years’ children was 64.8% (379/584) and that of MCV2 among 16 months to 5 years’ children was (62/98) 63.2%. Compared to unvaccinated children, those who received one (RR: 0.16, 95% CI 0.09–0.2) and two doses (RR: 0.09, 95% CI 0.02–0.4) of measles vaccine were at lower risk. The risk of measles was higher among children of religious minority (RR: 28.3, 95% CI 7–114.5). Vaccine Effectiveness of one and two doses of measles vaccine was 83.4% (95% CI 71.2–90.4) and 90.32% (95% CI 59.2–97.7) respectively.
Conclusion
MCV coverage in Bardwaja was low. We recommended strengthening of outreach immunization targeting religious minority."

Bacteria and fungi are important aetiological agents of infectious keratitis in India. This retrospective study was done to know causative fungal and bacterial species and associated risk factors in patients with suspected fungal or bacterial keratitis. The study included all cases (400) of corneal ulcer investigated and treated at a tertiary care hospital over 6 years.
Methods
Gram staining and 10% KOH wet mount were performed on corneal scrapings. Further identification of fungal and bacterial agents was done using routine methods.
Results
Fungal and bacterial pathogens were identified in 94 (23.50%) and 44 (11.00%) cases, respectively. Keratitis was significantly associated with fungal aetiology. Most frequent agent of fungal keratitis was Fusarium species (26, 27.66%). Fungal keratitis was associated with young and middle-aged agriculturists and labourers, and corneal injury with vegetative matter. Most frequent agent of bacterial keratitis was Staphylococcus aureus (22, 50.00%). Bacterial keratitis was associated with co-existing ocular diseases, diabetes mellitus, previous ocular surgery, contact lenses and metallic foreign bodies in eyes. Fungal keratitis cases had worse overall outcome compared to bacterial keratitis.
Conclusions
Knowledge of predisposing factors and microbiological confirmation of keratitis is indispensable to initiate appropriate therapy. We found continuous rise in incidence of Fusarium keratitis, which is disturbing due to multidrug-resistant nature of the fungus. Routine surveillance of fungal and bacterial keratitis is needed to know the existing and emerging pattern of pathogens."

Birth weight is one of the most important criteria for determining the neonatal and infant survival. More than 20 million infants worldwide, representing 15.5% of all births, are born with low birth weight (LBW), 95.6% of them in developing countries. The level of LBW in developing countries (16.5%) is more than double the level in developed regions (7%). The prevalence of LBW is estimated to be 15% worldwide with a range of 3.3–38% and occurs mostly in developing countries. According to NFHS III, prevalence of low birth in India is 22%. LBW remains an unresolved important national concern in India. The goal of reducing LBW incidence by at least one-third between 2000 and 2010 is one of the major goals in ‘A World Fit for Children.’ Hence, the present study is being proposed to explore the determinants of LBW.
Objective
To study the sociodemographic determinants of LBW babies in Wardha district.
Material and methods
A case–control study was conducted in Wardha civil hospital to investigate the determinants of LBW. Cases were defined as singleton live born when the birth weight was less than 2500g as per WHO. One control was selected for each case from consecutive live births, in which the birth weight was equal to or more than 2500g in the same hospital. Information was obtained by maternal interview, from medical records, and by anthropometric measurement of mother and infants taken within 48h after birth. Data were entered and analysis was done with the help of a computer using EPI-INFO 6.04.
Results
Among various sociodemographic and socioeconomic determinants of LBW studied, the determinants that were found associated with high odds of LBW were as follows: maternal age less than 20 years or more than 30 years, nuclear family, poor standard of living, tobacco use by father, female sex of the baby, and among environment and housing characteristics, the absence of sanitary latrine was found to have significant association with LBW."

abstract = "Purpose
Pelvic organs are naturally prone to positional and volumetric changes over time. These individual organ changes may result in variations in the clinical target volume (CTV) position and shape. Planning target volume (PTV) that encompasses the CTV with some margins to account for such uncertainties in patient positioning, organ motion, and beam geometry is universally accepted today in radiotherapy. Keeping this view in mind, the present study has been planned in order to determine the setup error (random and systematic) in patients of carcinoma cervix and rectum image-guided radiotherapy and to propose a population-based three-dimensional CTV to PTV margins in IGRT scenario.
Materials and methods
The mean margin displacements of 61 patients measured through different directions. The proposed method is used to estimate margins of displacement of specific CTV dosing. A further method is illustrated to simulate the dose received by the CTV. The margin distance compared with Van Herk model through consideration of systematic and random errors. Different site-wise displacements were measured and compared. The CTV performance dosimetry has been carried through proposed model and compared with the traditional margin for each of the datasets.
Results
The PTV margins obtained on lateral, longitudinal and vertical sides on Cervix site are 0.91, 1.93 and 0.96 [Van Hark's formula] and 0.84, 1.79 and 0.89 through proposed formula. It can be noted that in both the cases, the respective margin obtained through proposed method was lesser in comparison to that of Van Hark's method.
Conclusions
The presence of heterogeneity in patient's random error is natural. This random error is highly influential on radiotherapy margin widths of the patients. The Bayesian statistics are useful to deal with such a problem. In this article, a simple and well-defined model is adopted to deal with the patient's heterogeneity problem. It has been observed that the model accounted the variability in the margin estimation. The variation in margin can be extended from one cancer site to another cancer site."

Urban India has seen dramatic improvements in per capita income, life expectancy and educational level in the past century. This should translate to better awareness and utilization of prosthodontic treatment options. The aim of this study was to gauge the veracity of the above hypothesis.
Materials and methods
A total of 1200 partially dentate and edentate patients visiting 2 dental hospitals for prosthodontic rehabilitation were randomly selected and administered a questionnaire and clinical examination. Data including distance of patient residence from hospital facility, patient desired prosthodontic treatment, prosthodontist's assessment of required treatment and disparity between demand and assessed treatment need were collected, evaluated, and statistically analyzed utilizing Graph Pad Prism Software with α=2 and p<0.05.
Results
Forty-nine percent of the patients visiting the hospitals disagreed with professional advice. The reasons recorded for this included lack of awareness (39%), financial constraints (20%) and clinical limitations (32%) (p<0.01).
Conclusion
A significant disparity was found between professional prosthodontic advice and patient desired management, possibly due to lack of understanding or communication between the prosthodontist and patient. This may be overcome by increasing awareness aids and programs in the hospital set up, and more time given to communication."

The aim of the present study aimed to identify the prognostic factors influencing AIDS progression in HIV positive patients in Hamadan province of Iran, using random survival forest in the presence of competing risks (death from causes not related to AIDS). This method considers all interactions between variables and their nonlinear effects.
Methods
A data set of 585 HIV-infected patients extracted from 1997 to 2011 was utilized. The effect of several prognostic factors on cumulative incidence function (probability) of AIDS progression and death were investigated.
Results
The used model indicated that using antiretroviral therapy tuberculosis co-infection are two top most important variables in predicting cumulative incidence function for AIDS progression in the presence of competing risks, respectively. The patients with tuberculosis had much higher predicted cumulative incidence probability. Predicted cumulative incidence probability of AIDS progression was also higher for mother to child mode of HIV transmission. Moreover, transmission type and gender were two top most important variables for the competing event. Men and those patients with IDUS transmission mode had higher predicted risk compared to others.
Conclusions
Considering nonlinear effects and interaction between variables, confection with tuberculosis was the most important variable in prediction of cumulative incidence probability of AIDS progression."

Ear diseases in children are a major public health problem in developing countries. Among the risk factors of ear morbidities, socio-demographic factors play an important role.
Objective
To determine prevalence of ear morbidities and its socio-demographic determinants in children 1–10 years in an urban primary health center in Delhi.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 160 children aged 1–10 years in an urban primary health center situated in Delhi over a period of 3 months from January to March 2015. Primary caregivers (mother/father) of ill children aged 1–10 years who came to seek medical care for their children were interviewed using pre-tested, predesigned, semi-structured questionnaire schedule. Data was analyzed using SPSS software (version 17). Chi-square test was used to observe the differences between proportions. The results were considered statistically significant if “p” value was less than 0.05.
Results
The study was conducted among 160 children of which 87 (54.4%) were males and 73 (45.6%) were females. Majority of families were Hindu (90.6%) and nuclear (53.8%) residing in same community. 30 (18.8%) children reported with ear complaints to out-patient department. 50 (31.2%) caregivers reported history of ear complaints in the child. Most common complaints were foreign body (14.37%), hearing loss (11.24%) and ear discharge (5.62%). No association was seen with age, gender and education of caregivers.
Conclusion and recommendations
There is a need to take immediate measures for prevention and control of common ear diseases in children."

Rotavirus infection is the common cause of severe diarrhea among under-five children. Globally it is responsible for majority of the hospital visits and admissions due to diarrhea in this age group. This hospital-based surveillance aimed to assess the burden of rotavirus diarrhea and to identify its prevalent strains among under-five children.
Methods
The study was conducted in two secondary level health care facilities of Manipal University, Manipal during November 2011 through July 2012. All under-five children admitted with acute diarrhea were recruited into the study.
Results
A total of 95 children were admitted with acute diarrhea during the study period. Of the 95 stool samples collected, 14 were inadequate and 81 samples were tested for the presence of rotavirus using commercial enzyme immunoassay kit (Premier Rotaclone Qualitative ELISA). Rotavirus positive samples were shipped to Central laboratory at CMC, Vellore for strain surveillance and characterization. Out of the 81 stool samples tested for rotavirus, 31 samples (38.3%) were positive for rotavirus VP6 antigen. Rota positivity was observed to be highest during the month of December (29.0%) and lowest in the month of June. Majority of the rotavirus positive cases (45.2%) were among children aged 13–24 months and among those who had very severe diarrhea (56.5%). The most common genotypes identified were G1P[8] and G2P[4] strains (25.8% each).
Conclusions
Though the burden of overall diarrhea among under-five children is not very high in this area, the proportion of rotavirus diarrhea among the hospitalized children is considerably high."

Health insurance is advocated as a means for improving healthcare utilization, reducing rising healthcare cost and protecting households against impoverishment by high medical expenses. This study addresses the research question that whether health insurance schemes have been able to provide financial risk protection to a larger segment of the society?
Objective
The study aims to review the status of Health Insurance Schemes in terms of providing financial risk protection to the people in Uttar Pradesh (UP), India.
Data and methods
The present study is drawn from the unit level records of the 71st round of National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). Out of this nationwide survey, we considered only UP for this study. Data were analyzed using STATA 13.0. We used bivariate cross-tabulations to highlight salient feature of insurance coverage with socio-economic and demographic characteristics.
Results
The results reveal that the government funded insurance schemes (Employee State Insurance Scheme (ESIS), Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna (RSBY) and Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS)) and others have succeeded to provide financial support to a very limited population. Only 4.8% population are covered by any health insurance scheme in UP.
Conclusion
Reducing high out-of-pocket expenditure through health insurance coverage is a major concern, and therefore, there is a need to maximize the coverage under different health insurance schemes in UP. Otherwise, growing number of people will keep falling into poverty in the future."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of demises reported in the 21st century.
Objective
Our objective is to develop a screening score to estimate the probability of cardiovascular events, stressing on the importance of including outdoor air pollution to improve the validity of the scale among the Lebanese adult population.
Methods
A case–control study was carried out between October 2011 and October 2012 comparing CVD cases to a control group (Sample 1). Two multivariate analyses using logistic regression were carried out to evaluate predictors of the dependent variable. The second model included the outdoor air pollution variables, while the first did not. The adjusted odds ratios (OR) obtained were rounded to the nearest units and used as coefficients in the generated scales. Following the scale set up, a second case–control of 200 patients was also performed for clinical validation (Sample 2).
Results
Our study showed that the scale for screening of CVD, which included outdoor air pollution variables, can foresee the CVD outcomes better than the score using only the traditional CVD risk factors. The areas under the curve were 0.737 (0.692–0.882; P<0.001) and 0.864 (0.825–0.903; P<0.001), respectively. Our results also provide some evidence of the clinical validity of the scale.
Conclusion
This screening scale could detect subjects at elevated risk for CVD in the clinical settings."

The objective of this study is to evaluate the risk factors in very low birth weight preterm newborns screened for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in a tertiary care hospital and to find the relationship of risk factors to the severity of disease. Very few reports on risk factors of ROP are available from this part of South India.
Methods
A prospective screening study was done enrolling 812 preterm babies during the period April 2013 to April 2015 and followed up until maturation of retina or regression of disease. The study population included preterms ≤32 weeks and or ≤1500g at birth admitted in newborn intensive care unit. Nested case control analysis was done in 203 cases with ROP against a control group of 609 babies. Multivariate analysis of binary logistic regression model was performed by taking ROP as dependent variable and independent variables were those which were found significant (p<0.05).
Results
On multivariate analysis apart from low birth weight and low gestational age, risk factors found statistically significant were apnea (p=0.020), blood transfusion (p=0.001), hyaline membrane disease (p=0.035), phototherapy (p=0.033), ventilator support (p=0.033) and oxygen use more than seven days (p=0.007). Factors significantly associated with severity of ROP were oxygen by continuous positive airway pressure (p=0.02), congenital pneumonia (p=0.001), shock (p=0.02), hyaline membrane disease (p=0.03) and surfactant use (p=0.003).
Conclusion
Compromised pulmonary function along with oxygen, surfactant therapy and shock are important risk factors for severe ROP. Antenatal risk factors have no significance in the development of ROP."

The aim of this study was to develop a brief measure of psychological distress related to obesity, intended specifically for use among the Arab adult populations, and to test its psychometric properties.
Methods
Items of the scale were identified through examination of relevant literature, discussions with obese adults, and expert panel feedback. Validity and reliability of the scale were tested using two convenience samples of Lebanese obese adults (n=380). The scale was also administered to a third sample of obese depressed patients (n=50) for clinical validation. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity were assessed.
Results
Exploratory factor analysis revealed two factors reflecting “Social functioning” and “Psychological functioning” that explained 78.2% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the two-factor model with good data fit. The scale demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's α=0.96 and 0.95 for samples 1 and 2, respectively) and test-retest reliability (Intraclass coefficient=0.91). Significant correlations were found between Obesity specific Distress total score and constructs measuring the impact of weight on quality of life (r=−0.73), body shape dissatisfaction (r=0.76), and psychological distress (r=0.66) suggesting good convergent validity. Our results also provide some evidence of the discriminant validity of the scale.

Dyspepsia is a common clinical symptom with prevalence of 5–20% of Outpatient (OPD) consultation at tertiary care hospital. The cause is not detectable in more than half of the patients. The common organic causes include peptic ulcer, esophagitis, and malignancy.
Aim
To study the clinical profile of patient presenting with dyspepsia in a tertiary care hospital of Assam, and correlate with endoscopic findings.
Materials
This is a hospital based observational study conducted over an year. Adult patient with dyspepsia was included after informed consent. Clinical data and endoscopic findings of patients with dyspepsia were collected with the help of a structured questionnaire.
Results
158 patients with dyspepsia were assessed by Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) Endoscopy. Mean age of patient was 40.04±14.3. 70.8% patients were males. 15.19% had history of smoking, 50.06% had history of tobacco consumption, 38.61% were alcoholic and history of NSAID consumption was seen in 9.49%. Alarm symptoms such as weight losss, anemia, UGI bleed were observed in 18.35% patients. Endoscopy revealed normal findings in 43.67% patients. Significant endoscopic findings were diagnosed in 56.32% patients. These included Peptic Ulcer in 25.95%, esophagitis in 4.43%, and UGI malignancy in 3.16%. Other significant lesions constituted less than 2%. Incidence of UGI malignancy was higher in patients more than 50 years. On comparing the endoscopic findings in patients of dyspepsia with alarm symptoms to those of dyspepsia without alarm symptoms, a statistical significance was observed with a p value of 0.013.
Conclusion
In patients with dyspepsia presence of alarm symptoms is more significantly associated with organic lesion on endoscopy. Though the incidence of malignancy was low, endoscopy in patients more than 50 years may help in early diagnosis and reduced morbidity of these patients."

abstract = "Background
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are gold standard in assessing the effectiveness of a clinical intervention because of their high internal validity. However, the same does not hold true for interventions conducted at the population level like public health interventions. Well-designed RCTs are not easy to conduct at population level. Similarly, well planned, high-quality non-RCTs or observational studies can complement RCTs. Because of this, several systematic reviews of public health interventions are assessed with other study designs, namely non-RCTs and observational studies. In such situations, studies of similar study design are pooled together to obtain an overall effect estimate. This is inevitable, because the principle of meta-analysis does not offer an opportunity for combining effect estimates coming from various study designs. If the meta-analysis performed for each study design provides contrasting results, then this introduces a quandary for the decision makers and public health policy makers to call for a decision.
Objective
The present study aims to integrate the results coming from a variety of study designs in order to obtain a single estimate of effect of intervention.
Methodology
Bayesian approach to meta-analysis was used by formulating prior distribution from observational studies or non-RCTs and likelihood function from RCTs. Five systematic reviews of public health intervention were used to demonstrate the methodology.
Results/conclusions
By formulating prior distribution from observational studies, the posterior estimates were found to be different than that from the results of RCTs or other study designs. The posterior pooled-estimate was found to be precise and the width of the credible interval narrowed. Inclusion of the relevant observational studies (or non-RCTs) in the systematic review is a potential advantage for evaluating the effectiveness of public health intervention."

Poor recognition of the danger signs of CAP, inappropriate care seeking, and community distrust in the primary health system are factors largely responsible for CAP related deaths in rural India. Our objective was to develop and pilot test culturally sensitive communication messages for improving symptom recognition of CAP as a means of encouraging timely health care seeking, and to promote trust in the government primary health system as an effective source of CAP treatment among children.
Methods and materials
Qualitative research was carried out between February and July 2014 in the states of Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) and Bihar in northern India. Message development entailed a six-step process: (1) theme identification, (2) creative conceptualization of messages, (3) pretesting messages in focus groups (FGs), (4) modification of messages, tagline/logo based on feedback, (5) piloting modified messages in FGs and further refinement and (6) harmonization of final communication products to ensure consistency.
Results
Messages were piloted in 49 FGs in 7 rural districts. Hindi terms for the signs of respiratory illness and lay use of “pneumonia” as a term encompassing CAP were understandable across all dialects. Five text, five audio and four video based messages were initially developed and pretested. Three text based messages, four audio and three video were deemed acceptable for pilot testing and refinement. Messages selected for use in future communication programs balanced measures of popularity with measures of maximum comprehension and least misunderstanding. Messages selected were harmonized so they would reinforce one another. Common logo and tagline ensured that the messages would be seen as components of a new outreach program associated with the government's efforts to address CAP as a primary healthcare priority.
Conclusions
Culturally sensitive messages for improving case management of CAP were developed through a multi-stage, evidence-based research process in a rural population. They need to accompany health systems strengthening efforts to increase confidence in government health facilities."

abstract = "Background
Human and animal rabies have been known to be present in Zambia since the early 1900s. However, systematic reporting, analysis, and dissemination have remained limited. This study aims to quantify trends and patterns in confirmed rabies cases and human dog bites based on reported hospital and laboratory data in Zambia, for the period 2004–2013. We further explore the space–time evolution of risk of confirmed rabies cases and dog bites.
Method
Data on human dog bites, confirmed rabies cases by province for the period 2004–2013, and on rabid dogs in the period 2005–2012 were analyzed. We calculated the incidence rates, by year and province, and modeled the spatial variability in risk at province level using Poisson spatial regression.
Results
A total of 14,818 dog bites occurred in all provinces for 2004–2013. The rate of dog bites ranged from 0.01 to 9.18 per 10,000 population. The incidence rate of rabid dogs varied from 2.4 to 17.5 per 10,000 dog population. Over the years, the risk of dog bites varied. The highest risks were at Western province (RR=14.91, 95% CI: 9.08–34.09) in 2004 and Lusaka province from 2009 to 2013. The risk of rabies in dogs increased in Central province (RR=1.79, 95 CI: 1.11–2.74).
Conclusion
This study reveals increasing trends in reported dog bites and rabies. The increase could be a case of improved reporting due to change in health policies or indeed high incidence necessitated by change in ecosystem. Moreover, the risk of dog bites and confirmed rabies seem to be established in selected provinces. A more detailed epidemiological design is warranted to establish such increases in risk."

Parkinson's disease (PD) is complicated with several cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, obesity and hypertension. The epidemiological exploration of PD patients in regard to north Indian population is limited in literature. Thus, present study aimed with an epidemiological study of PD and its associated risk factors among the north Indian population.
Methods
We examined total 384,000 individuals, out of which 260 patients with PD were diagnosed and identified during the period of September-2011 to August-2015. Sociodemographic and clinical status of patients was recorded. Blood pressure and depressive status were measured by expert clinicians as per standard protocol.
Results
In present explorative study the prevalence of PD, 67.71 per 100,000 individuals has been observed. The observed male/female ratio was 2.66. On Beck Depression Inventory scale for the measurement of depression, 55% depressive PD patients have been observed which included 40% and 15% PD patients with minor and major depression, respectively. Arterial systolic/diastolic blood pressure <130/80, 130/80 to 139/89 and ≥140/90mmHg have been observed in 23.85%, 35.77% and 40.38% of patients with PD, respectively. Genetic history, head injury/trauma, type-2 diabetes and association of Alzheimer's disease were 5.40%, 7.31%, 6.54% and 3.46% observed among the patients with PD, respectively.
Conclusions
The study concluded that PD with 67.71 (per 100,000) of prevalence rate can be associated with several risk factors such as male gender, genetic history, head injury/trauma, type-2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, depression and blood pressure among the populations of North India."

India is one of the most privatised health systems with high OOP payment for health care in the world. The financial burden of OOP payment has an iniquitous effect on access to health care as it restricts health care accessibility among poor. To provide universal health care access to all its citizen government has launched health insurance programs in the recent past.
Objective
The study attempts to understand the impact of health insurance schemes on tackling the economic burden of out of pocket expenditure and its effectiveness in reducing economic inequalities in health care spending.
Method
The study utilises National Sample Survey 2014 data to fulfill the objectives. Bi-variate analysis and two-part model were used to examine the association of health insurance with the level of health expenditure and financial burden.
Results
The paper shows that health insurance schemes are effective in reducing the burden of OOP expenditure but economic disparities in the financial burden of OOP expenditure exist where the poor with less income spends a greater share of household income than the rich.
Conclusion
An increasing coverage of poor under health insurance no doubt protects against health care impoverishment, but mere provision health care does not address the issue of equity in health spending as the burden of health spending was more among poor. The major implication of the findings is that there is a need for analysing the efficiency and equity implication of the health insurance schemes in providing financial protection"

The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents is a public health concern. Increase in prevalence and severity of obesity among children and adolescents has been attributed largely to behavioral factors.
Objectives
(1) To assess the prevalence of overweight and obesity among the early adolescents studying in the schools of Dibrugarh town. (2) To assess the association of dietary habits and physical activities of the study participants with overweight and obesity.
Methods
School-based cross-sectional study was done among 800 adolescents (10–14 years). Weight status was assessed using WHO-2007 reference for body mass index. For diet, food frequency method was used. Physical activity questions were according to Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Chi-square test, Fisher's test, and odds ratio were used to analyze associations.
Results
Of the total adolescents, 46% were girls. Prevalence of overweight and obesity was 22.5% and 9.7% respectively and was more in girls (p<0.05) and younger age (p<0.05). Less frequency of major meals, extra snacks, irregular food habit, breakfast skipping, and increased restaurant visits were associated with increase in overweight/obesity (p<0.05). Obesity was more in adolescents who never took green vegetables (OR=1.9, p<0.05) and fruits (OR=5.9, p<0.05) and with daily intake of soft drinks (OR=2.2, p=0.002), bakery products (OR=2.6, p<0.0001), chocolate (OR=3.5, p<0.0001), and deep fried foods (OR=2.9, p=0.0001). 26.6% adolescents were leading sedentary life. Decreased involvement in physical activity was associated with overweight and obesity (p<0.0001).
Conclusion
Prevalence of overweight/obesity in adolescents is substantial. Dietary behavior and physical activity significantly affect weight of adolescents."

Global initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to instituting and adjusting therapy for children with asthma. The objective of this study was to describe the physicians prescribing patterns of childhood asthma, in accordance with GINA guidelines.
Methods
This hospital-based, cross-sectional study was conducted after institutional ethical clearance. Children aged 1–12 years with asthma were recruited after parental consent from the outpatients’ department (OPD). Drugs used for the treatment of acute exacerbation of asthma and for long-term control of asthma were assessed as per the GINA 2009 guidelines. Qualification together with identity of treating physician was kept anonymous.
Results
From August 2008 to August 2011, 250 children were recruited. Out of them, 35.2% had mild intermittent, 37.2% had mild persistent, 20% had moderate persistent and 7.6% had severe persistent asthma. There were 94.4% children with acute exacerbation of asthma. For the management of current episode of acute exacerbation of asthma, SABA through oral route (77.3%) was preferred over inhalation (22.7%). Antibiotics (53.4%) and antitussives (52.1%) were prescribed in considerable proportions of exacerbations. The prescription pattern of controller drugs was not in line with the GINA guidelines, as it did not vary much across asthma severity categories. As compared to intermittent asthma, children with persistent asthma were prescribed as and when required salbutamol more (OR=2.5; 95% CI=1.15–5.51; p=0.018). None of the prescriptions have any documentation of evaluation of either severity of asthma or level of control of asthma.
Conclusion
Prescription pattern of drugs for asthma exacerbation and long-term control do not correspond to GINA guidelines recommendations. Operative strategies aimed at implementing existing guidelines into daily practice are urgently needed."

We have found that chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) is diagnosed at an earlier age in poorer populations than in more affluent populations. We had used data from the Glivec® Patient Assistance Program (GIPAP) involving 33,985 patients from 94 participating countries and documented the geographic variation in CML age of onset, with low income identified as a major risk factor for early age of onset. As India is the largest cohort within GIPAP, we studied several demographic factors in this population to investigate other possible contributors to early age at onset.
Methods
We analyzed data collected 2002-2008 from 14,167 Indian patients to investigate demographic factors related to age at diagnosis focusing on income and occupation as risk factors.
Results
As in the first study, patients with an earlier age at diagnosis of CML were more likely to be in families with lower annual income. In addition, we found age at diagnosis varied across different occupations; patients who were self-employed and worked in agriculture/fishing were more likely to be diagnosed at a younger age than patients working in the government. Geographic variation in age at CML diagnosis was also observed, possibly reflecting the influence of environmental and socioeconomic factors on the pathogenesis of CML.
Conclusions
Environmental factors apparently play a major role in determining age of diagnosis of CML. Analytic studies are needed to determine the relative importance of various exposures such as to herbicides/pesticides, dietary habits and other factors related to income to identify specific contributory factors in the pathogenesis of CML."

Exclusive breastfeeding has been shown to be protective against infants’ illnesses. Evidence is sparse about the association of different breastfeeding patterns on neonatal illnesses.
Methods
The study was conducted at two urban public hospitals at Lucknow. Neonates who did not have any morbidity or congenital malformation and were residents of Lucknow were enrolled within 48h of birth and followed up once at 6 weeks of age, at the outpatients clinic or home to assess neonatal illnesses and established (voluntary) breastfeeding pattern (exclusive, predominant, partial, never breastfed). Association of established breastfeeding patterns with neonatal illnesses was studied using multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.
Results
A total of 1020 neonates were enrolled. Follow-up information on occurrence of neonatal illnesses (if any) as well as established breastfeeding pattern was available for 937 (91.8%) enrolled neonates. Among these, 46% (431/937) presented with any illness, with 20.2% (189/937) reported with at least one danger sign of severe illnesses as mentioned in Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI). Partially breastfed neonates were significantly more likely to develop any illness (Adj. OR=6.6; 95% CI: 4.0–10.8, p<0.001) as well as IMNCI illnesses (Adj. OR=5.8; 95% CI: 2.9–11.8, p<0.001) as compared to exclusively breastfed neonates. Similarly, predominantly breastfed neonates were also significantly more likely to develop any illness (Adj. OR=3.4; 95% CI: 2.0–5.8, p<0.001) as well as IMNCI illnesses (Adj. OR=2.9; 95% CI: 1.3–6.4, p<0.01) as compared to exclusively breastfed neonates. The strength and consistency of these associations remained similar on refitting the model with term, singleton, and normal birth weight neonates.
Conclusions
Exclusive breastfeeding during the neonatal period was significantly protective against the occurrence of any illness as well as illnesses mentioned in the IMNCI program, as compared to predominant or partial breastfeeding."

Head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) is maximally encountered in India across the globe, and the environmental influences/interactions leading to cancer particularly education and income are very different in the developed countries than the third world.
Material and methods
A prospective assessment of 707 histologically proven HNSCC patients was undertaken regarding the possible role of 2 determinants viz. education and income on cancer prevalence. Standard questionnaires were filled up for the outpatients in the department of otolaryngology and variables such as demographics, site of involvement, the education and family income were analyzed accordingly.
Observations
The cancer was seen more among those with the education status of less than grade V (58%), than between VI and VIII grade (21%) or between IX and XII grade (8.5%) and higher. Of those with the education category of less that grade V, oral cavity was the most common site involved (29%). The cancer rates among income category of less than Rs. 1000/- (46%) was significantly more than those of Rs. 1001–2000 (29%) and Rs. 2001–4000 (10%). Thereafter there was a drastic fall in the cancer rates among the further higher income categories.
Conclusions
Two points have emerged from this study; that is likely to have the highest impact on cancer control: (1) implementing compulsory education till class VI and (2) Enhancing family income to Rs. 4000/INR per month. These are likely to have a complicated interaction with various procarcinogenic practices and environment and their correction is very likely to reduce the cancer occurrence through prevention."

This study included Pakistani trained health care Map facilitators from June 2010 to September 2011. Four separate Map sessions on how Diabetes Works, living with Diabetes, eating healthy & exercising, and starting insulin treatment were facilitated by a trained facilitator. Each 60–90-minute session includes 3–12 trained facilitators. Evaluations were performed after the session through a questionnaire having questions about use of DCM for educating people with diabetes, contents of each Map, role of facilitator, and overall impact of DCM education tools on participating respondent.
Results
Out of 274 HCPs, 94.3% and 96% agreed that it is a better way of patient education and it provides better education as compared to print material respectively. Around 70% and 80% participants agreed that contents of “How Diabetes Works” & “Healthy Eating and exercise” are not difficult for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) respectively while most of the participants (80% and 76.5%) found contents of “Living with Diabetes” and “Starting Insulin” valuable and easy to apprehend. Most of the participants mentioned that self-monitoring of blood glucose, understanding regarding oral hypoglycemic agents, and insulin injecting technique should be included. Majority healthcare providers (80%) were satisfied with facilitation of Expert Trainer.

India along with Nigeria is estimated to account for over 1/3rd of all maternal deaths worldwide in the year 2015. However, among all the maternal deaths, most of the deaths can be prevented. But for that all women need access to antenatal care (ANC) during pregnancy.
Objective
The present study aims to highlight the current status of ANC coverage in India. Further this study examines the extent of expenditure incurred for seeking ANC.
Materials and methods
Data for the analyses are drawn from the 71st round of the National Sample Survey Office conducted between January to June 2014. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses have been used to fulfil the objectives of this paper.
Results
Despite having a vast public health infrastructure and several safe motherhood programmes, overall 9.2% pregnant women did not consume IFA supplements, 6.6% did not receive TT dose and 10.3% pregnant women could not receive any ANC during pregnancy in India. Among the states, Uttar Pradesh accounted for a large number (16.7%) of pregnant women who neither did consume IFA tablets nor received any ANC (22.4%) during pregnancy. However, a woman had to spend a large amount of money to seek ANC from both public and private health care facilities.
Conclusion
After a tremendous emphasis given to delivery of free ANC services throughout the country, India is still very far from achieving universal coverage of ANC."

Numerous advancements are nowadays being developed in the field of medicine to improve the clinical outcomes among chronic kidney disease patients. Though these therapies help the patients to live longer life, still their quality of life remain uncertain.
Objective
The objective of the study was to assess the health related quality of life (HRQOL) among end stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis.
Methods
A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 50 patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis in a tertiary level referral hospital in Kerala. Patients who had completed at least three months of maintenance hemodialysis, and aged 18 years and above of either sex were included in the study. The socio demographic details of the patients were collected through patient and bystander interviews and from their hospital case records. HRQOL was evaluated using a standardized scale of Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form questionnaire.
Results
Among HRQOL, the mean score of kidney disease component summary was higher than Mental Component Summary and Physical Component Summary (60.48±11.81, 41.83±15.78 and 36.49±16.30 respectively). Patients possessed better quality of life in Social support (73.54), Dialysis staff encouragement (67.56) and Quality of social interaction (67.56) and the worst scores in Role-physical (13.57) and Role-emotional (17.72) scales.
Conclusion
The study has shown that the quality of life of hemodialysis patients was highly impaired and it clearly defines how the disease state adversely affects the physical and mental status of the patient."

abstract = "Background
In post-conflict situations, there is a clear deterioration and damage of health care system. Libya, the second largest country in North Africa, had experienced a major armed conflict in 2011 that resulted in heavy damage of health system. The objectives of this study were to: assess the damage that affected Libyan health care system during the armed conflict, identify the problems, outline priorities and barriers, and to plan for emergency, sustainable, and long run intervention.
Methods
Integrated quantitative and qualitative methodologies system including characterization, observation, and free-response questionnaires were used to identify damage, needs, and problems of the Libyan health care system in the immediate post-conflict period. A total of 216 different health care facilities scattered over four regions in West part of Libya (battlefield of armed conflict) were studied. Different parameters were used to assess the extent of the damage and the quality of health services of studied facilities during the conflict period. The facilities studied include Emergency Hospitals, Primary Health Care Centers, Regional Hospitals, Tertiary Health Care Hospitals, and Private hospitals.
Results
A total of 216 health care facilities were studied, and the structural damage was evident among 62 (28.7%) of them. Of those damaged, 11 (5.1%) were completely destroyed and 51 (23.6%) were partially damaged. Primary health care centers accounted for 49 (22.7%) of the damaged facilities followed by Emergency & Accident Hospitals. The extent of the damage varied from one region to another and even among provinces within the same region. The most influential factor significantly hit were short of medical supplies (medical disposables and essential pharmaceuticals), followed by lack of medical staff security, lack of communication (and health care management (P<0.001)). Unusual problems emerged including neglected orphans, dead bodies, and emergence of unusual infection, particularly among displaced provinces.
Conclusions
The Libyan national health system is a victim of armed conflict, with destruction of clinic and hospital infrastructure. This study highlights the major damage that Libyan health care system has experienced and identified the important needs for a successful development and future planning. National and international efforts should be combined to restructure the Libyan health system and long run sustainable strategies have to be implemented."

In this paper, we compared the risk of mortality by different parametric frailty models, namely gamma, inverse Gaussian, positive stable and lognormal, with respect to Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) values on liver transplantation patients. We conclude that lognormal frailty model gives slightly lower frailty variance compared to the other frailty models when Weibull distribution is considered as baseline hazard. Therapy and MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) scores may have significant role in liver transplant patients when distribution of frailty is considered as lognormal with Weibull baseline hazard for fitting the model. Therefore, there is 4.6 times more risk in getting hazard of mortality for patients receiving conventional therapy with consent for participation as compared to patients receiving new therapy with consent for participation with 95%CI [1.059, 20.199], p-value 0.042."

Lead has been classified as a probable carcinogen, and ambiguity regarding its toxicity persists due to limited epidemiological evidences. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of occupational lead exposure and symptoms, which indicate malfunctioning in eye, digestive system, upper respiratory tract, chest and skin among men in a case control study.
Methods
Incident cases, which are occupationally exposed to lead (n=208) and general healthy population controls (n=64), were interviewed to fill a validated questionnaire for checking their health status. Body mass index (BMI) was also calculated. The cases consist of workers, who are employed in automobile repairing, tyre and tube maintenance, lead acid battery recycling etc. Comparison was done using t test and Mann Whitney's U test. Odds ratio was also calculated.
Results
The workers were having an increased prevalence of symptoms than normal healthy controls examined throughout this study. BMI was observed to decline continuously among workers with respect to increase in the years of exposure at workplace environment. This decrease in BMI was significant in comparison to healthy controls among group of workers having more than 15 years of exposure to their workplace environment. The symptoms studied throughout this study were also observed to increase in per cent frequency among workers with increase in exposure time.
Conclusion
Increase in the frequency of symptoms was observed among workers with increase in years of occupational exposure. BMI in workers was significantly declining with increase in years of exposure to work environment."

Neonatal deaths constitute two-thirds of infant deaths in India; 45% of the deaths occur within the first two days of life.1
Methods
The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of use of voucher system in HBNC in Golaghat District of Assam with a secondary objective to assess awareness and utilization of different maternal and child health related services. A community-based before/after intervention study was conducted in Golaghat District of Assam. Two-stage cluster sampling was used. All ASHAs (accredited social health activist) of the selected beneficiaries were assessed. All mothers who delivered were given a set of 6 HBNC double perforated numbered vouchers following baseline study and capacity building of ASHA. When the ASHA visits the baby and examines it using the standard recording format, mother/caregiver handed over the appropriate number of the voucher. The ASHA received the HBNC incentive only after all the six vouchers were submitted. Endline survey was done after 6 months of intervention. Rates, ratios and proportions were determined and chi-square test was done to assess the difference in knowledge and practices.
Results
A total of 582 and 650 caregivers and 174 and 182 ASHAs were assessed in baseline and endline. Only 68.2% know about birth preparedness, while 90.9% know about young infant and child feeding; 77.7% know about family planning and reproductive tract infection (RTI/STI) and 77.3% know the importance of safe delivery, while all know about immunization; 54.5% know about essential newborn care, 81.8% know the importance of home visit and all were unsatisfied with their incentives. Significant improvement was found in HBNC practices, antenatal and post-natal care, iron folic acid supply and immunization following introduction of voucher system (p<0.05).
Conclusions
Introduction of HBNC was found to be an effective intervention tool to improve knowledge on different healthy behaviour related to mother and child health, especially neonatal health, awareness of different services available amongst beneficiaries and practice pattern improvement amongst both service provider and beneficiaries."

This study was conducted in the Department of Medicine, Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital, Faridkot on 100 cases (with metabolic syndrome diagnosed on International Diabetic Federation criteria) and 100 age- and sex-matched controls (without metabolic syndrome) between 30 and 60 years of age by echocardiography to assess LVDD.
Results
Overall prevalence of diastolic dysfunction was 73% in the cases and 14% in controls with an increasing trend with increasing age in both groups showing age an important determinant of diastolic dysfunction; gender-wise difference was not significant in any group. However, increasing trend with increasing body mass index, elevated blood pressure, elevated fasting blood sugar, elevated serum triglyceride, and deceased serum high density lipoprotein was noted showing their risk correlation in the outcome of diastolic dysfunction; participants without metabolic syndrome had lesser diastolic dysfunction (14%).
Conclusions
The diastolic dysfunction in metabolic syndrome was found to be higher that supports the assumption that metabolic syndrome could be correlated to risk of development of LVDD. Holistic prevention of metabolic syndrome has an important role to prevent development of diastolic dysfunction."

There is a high prevalence of congenital malformations (CMs) in the tea garden community of Assam, Northeast India. The present cross-sectional study was carried out to assess if insufficiencies in maternal nutrition during the periconceptional period are associated with high incidence of CM in the said community.
Method
Over a period of 2 years, 156 pregnant women with a mean age of 25.7 years (SD 4.7) were enrolled. During an interview, anthropometric and obstetric data pertaining to periconceptional use of iron and folic acid (IFA) were collected. Adequate iodine intake during pregnancy was determined by measuring urinary iodine (UI) levels in each trimester.
Results
Malformations were noted in 16 babies, giving an uncorrected incidence rate of 102.5/1000 births. Among the participants, 87 (55.8%) were underweight and 6 (3.8%) were overweight. Periconceptional IFA supplementation was self-reported by 31 (19.8%). The median urinary iodine concentrations (MUICs) in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimesters were 170μg/l (IQR 100μg/l), 275μg/l (IQR 166μg/l), and 265μg/l (IQR 160μg/l), respectively. An analysis of maternal nutrition indicated that IFA supplementation reduced the risk of birth defects. However, a pre-pregnancy BMI>23kg/m2 and a 1st trimester MUIC<150μg/l increased the odds of having an infant with CM. Maternal age <20 years and illiteracy also elevated the risk.
Conclusion
Inadequacies in periconceptional maternal nutrition are associated with the high incidence of CM. Community members should also be sensitized against early pregnancy and educated to minimize the risk."

In India, epidemiological services are well developed and epidemiology teaching is very much part of curriculum from undergraduate to doctorate level of studies. In spite of all the initiatives to sensitize physicians towards clinical epidemiology (CE), this academic discipline is still not popular as it should be. The development of CE teaching and the present situation along with way forward are discussed in this article.
Objectives
This review article is aimed to describe the evolution of CE in India and critically look into the concept and scope of CE and evidence-based medicine (EBM) in the Indian setting.
Methods
This paper is a review of the status of ‘clinical epidemiology – popularization’ in India and the scope for further progress towards this direction.
Results
The development of CE has taken a new pace after the introduction of EBM. Both CE and EBM are propagated by INCLEN-trained faculty mostly among medical students and teachers. The paper also looks into the linkages between public health epidemiology and CE in the context of involvement of clinical epidemiologists in public health programs.
Conclusions
After discussing the directions for future, the paper proposes the inception of CE unit at each medical college and also the objectives and structure of such a unit. The article concludes emphasizing the need of public health orientation of CE, the importance of promotion of epidemiology in developing countries through capacity building, and allocation of dedicated funds towards popularization of CE. There is also an urgent need for replication and scale-up of clinical epidemiology unit (CEU) model to other medical colleges."

abstract = "Objectives
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a higher incidence of bladder cancer (BC); however, the evidence underlining the association between pioglitazone use and BC risk remains inconclusive. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to investigate the effect of pioglitazone on risk of BC in T2DM patients.
Methods
We searched all publications regarding risk of BC with pioglitazone use through PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane library databases from inception to March, 2017. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method.
Results
Total 15 observational (9 cohort and 6 case-control) studies were meta-analyzed. The pooled results showed a significant association between risk of BC and pioglitazone use (HR 1.20, 95%CI 1.09–1.31; P<0.0001; I2=4%). In subgroup analysis, cumulative dose of pioglitazone (− and >mg) showed a significant association with risk of BC (HR 1.27; 95%CI 1.05–1.54; P=0.01; I2=0% and HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.36–2.08; P<0 I2=0% respectively). In addition, a significant association was seen with risk of BC and pioglitazone treatment duration (12–24 months and >24 months) (HR 1.43; 95%CI 1.19–1.71; P=0.0001; I2=0% and HR 1.58; 95%CI 1.27–1.97; P<0.0001; I2=29% respectively). Meta-analysis of pioglitazone vs. rosiglitazone use, showed a significant association (HR 1.34; 95%CI 1.05–1.71; P=0.02; I2=0%) with BC risk and pioglitazone use.
Conclusion
Pioglitazone use is associated with risk of BC in T2DM patients. Risk of bladder cancer appears to be associated with higher dose and longer duration of pioglitazone use."

Quite often disease data are available in aggregated formats mostly to maintain confidentiality. This leads to a misalignment problem when the goal is to analyze risk at a different level of spatial resolution different from the original administrative level where data were available.
Objective
To estimate and map the risk of measles at a sub-region level in Namibia using data obtained at a regional level.
Methods
Using measles data from Namibia for the period 2005–2014, both multi-step and direct approaches were applied to correct for misalignment. Subsequently, ecological Bayesian regression models were fitted and compared.
Results
Results show that the variables standardized birth rate, counts of measles cases for previous year, unemployment rate and proportion of vaccinated children against measles by age 12 months were significant determinants of measles risk. Constituencies having elevated measles risk were identified mostly in the northern corridor with Angola.
Conclusion
We recommend that relevant authorities should make geographical target intervention and redesign prevention and control strategies based on these findings."

Results
Out of 52 patients, 30 had initial PCT levels ≥2.0ng/ml, 10 (≥0.5–<2.0ng/ml) and 12 (<0.5ng/ml). Initial PCT values were significantly higher in non-survivors as compared to that of survivors [15.3 (5.3–45.5) vs. 1.8 (0.33–8)ng/ml; P=0.006].
Conclusions
Measurement of serum PCT levels was found to be helpful in diagnosing sepsis in culture negative patients. Lower PCT values can help in ruling out sepsis and limit antimicrobial use. High initial PCT levels can predict severity of sepsis and mortality."

Lumbar puncture (LP) refusal rates of as high as 30% have been reported in developing countries. Without LP, the patients may suffer suboptimal treatment or unnecessary complications from their disease. Due to a lack of studies exploring the reasons behind this LP refusal, no solution has been suggested to address this problem. Therefore, we carried out this study with the aim of determining knowledge of and attitude towards LP among the public.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey study among staff in a public university in Malaysia was conducted using stratified random sampling. Self-administered questionnaires were sent to 500 staff members from April to August 2015. The questionnaire, which included questions on demography, knowledge and attitude towards LP, was pre-tested and validated (Cronbach’s alpha=0.701).
Results
A total of 316 of 500 (63%) responded, of which 294 were complete and analysed. The median (IQR) age was 34 and 65% were female. 80% had tertiary education. The mean knowledge score was 6±3; 74% were categorised into poorly informed, 23% moderately informed, and 3% well-informed. The mean attitude score was 35±4; 3% were categorised as having poor attitude, 72% moderate attitude, and 27% good attitude. Respondents with higher education had a higher knowledge and attitude score (p=0.001), while respondents afraid of needles had a lower attitude score (p=0.019). Total knowledge scores and total attitude scores showed a positive correlation (r=0.272, p=0.001).
Conclusion
The public are not adequately informed about LP, leading to the unreceptive attitudes towards LP consent. Therefore, the public should be educated about LP to create better awareness."

Therefore, this study aimed to explore new targets of katG and inhA gene mutations and their correlation with isoniazid (INH) minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Uttar Pradesh, India.
Materials and methods
The level of INH resistance was measured by absolute concentration method. DNA sequencing was performed to determine mutations in INH-resistant and -sensitive isolates.
Results
Totally, 44/50 INH-resistant isolates had the following mutations in katG gene at codon 315: Ser-Thr (41/44), Ser-Ile (1/44) and Ser-Asn (1/44), with INH MIC ranges 2 to >16μg/ml. Only one isolate showed the following mutation at codon 299: Gly-Ser with MIC of 0.2μg/ml. Two isolates showed the following novel mutation in inhA gene at codon 17: Pro-Gln. One isolate had the following mutation at codon 94: Ser-Ala in inhA gene. These 3 isolates also had mutations in katG gene. The following mutation was seen in katG gene at codon 234: Ala-Gly. There were also mutations at codon 265; synonymous mutations were seen in both INH-sensitive and -resistant isolates, and hence have no association with INH resistance.
Conclusion
The katG 315 (Ser-Thr) mutation is most frequent and associated with high level of INH resistance. However, extremely low frequency of mutation at codon 94 (Ser-Ala) in structural region of inhA gene decreases their apparent contribution in INH drug resistance."

Although they are additions to the ongoing physiological development or arise from maladaptive behavioural responses, the evidence remains limited. The vague aetiology and the self-limiting nature, has devoid these conditions of robust clinical attention, both in the research and clinical practice. Frequent early-life intestinal insults may translate as a risk factor in the development of chronic GI disorders and psychological problems later in life.

A wide variety of speech and language disorders has been known to exist. These disorders impair the ability to communicate to different extent so as to adversely affect social, emotional and functional well-being of a person. In literature, little has been documented about types of various such disorders and their frequency of occurrence. Less is known about pattern of such patients seeking speech language assessment and therapeutic services. Hence need of the present study.
Method
Data was collected from a total 6707 patients reporting with communication difficulty to Audiology and Speech Language Pathology wing of ENT department, GGS Medical College Hospital, Faridkot, a tertiary care hospital of Punjab, India. Patients’ data were classified depending on (a) age, (b) gender, and (c) diagnosis.
Results
Maximum number of patients was aged below 10 years of age which accounted to approximately 43% of the total patients with speech and language difficulties. The number of patients was observed to reduce as age increased. Mis-articulation was most common among all disorders in the first two decades of life where as stuttering was maximally evident in the young age group (21–30 years). Voice related difficulties were most affecting in the middle age groups (31–50 years).
Conclusions
Results of the present study would be useful in guiding administrative authorities to establish adequate and suitable infrastructure, employment of disability specific professionals and manpower, proper planning and execution in order to accommodate variety of case load.

The present work intended to investigate the carriage of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes in multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from various clinical specimens.
Methods
A total of fifty S. aureus isolates from blood cultures, wound swabs, urine sample, nasal swabs, and sputum sample were examined for their antibiotic resistance against 20 different antibiotics by means of E-test, M.I.C Evaluator Strips, and disk diffusion methods. Detection of resistance and virulence-encoding genes (mecA, van, fnBPA, and Panton-Valentine Leucocidin (PVL)-encoding genes) was performed by PCR.
Results
In the current study, low number of MRSA isolates has been detected from five different clinical samples (22%, n=50). In this study, we observed multiple drug resistance in S. aureus isolates from wound swabs; nasal swabs, blood cultures, and urine sample. No vancomycin-resistant genes were detected in all 50 isolates; similarly, no PVL and van genes were detected, while mecA and FnBP genes were detected in low number of isolates.
Conclusion
Although the number of MRSA and fnBPA-positive S. aureus reported in this study is generally low, and despite the absence of PVL and van-encoding genes, the results reported in this study may continue to shed some light on the prevalence of MRSA in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Further epidemiological surveys are required together with additional infection control measures to limit the spread of MRSA particularly multidrug-resistant strains."

Diarrheal disease is one among the top five causes of death in low- and middle-income countries. It is the second leading cause of death in children under five years of age. Diarrheal disease contributes to the mortality of nearly 1.5 million children and globally there are about two billion cases of diarrheal diseases every year. In the present study, we studied the spatio-temporal pattern of acute diarrheal disease (ADD) ward-wise and to estimate and compare two widely used Bayesian models in the study of measuring relative risk of ADD in Chennai Corporation, Tamilnadu, India.
Materials and methods
Data on ADD were obtained from Communicable disease hospital, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India from 2009–11. Geographical Information System (GIS) technique was used to map ADD data ward- wise and relative risk was estimated using empirical Bayes approach using Poisson gamma and Poisson log normal models.
Results
Over a period of three years from 2009–11, nearly 7661 cases of ADD were reported in Chennai Corporation. The cumulative incidence rate of diarrhea was 142.6 cases per 100,000 population ranging from minimum of 0 to maximum of 1699.7 cases per year. Males had higher average incidence 147.4 cases than females with 137.7 cases per 100,000 population per year. Also, the cumulative incidence was higher in the age group of 0–4 years (306.8 cases) than that in any other category. Higher incidence was observed during the months of Apr–Jun (55.2 cases) than that in any other seasons. Choropleth map indicates that higher incidence of ADD was more prevailed in northern part of Chennai near coastal area which includes the wards from Tondiarpet, Basin bridge, and Pulianthope zones. The posterior relative risk estimate obtained using empirical Bayes approach identified 23, 30, and 19 wards having relative risk significantly greater than 1 for years 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. Fitting standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) and the other two models showed that, consistently Tondiarpet ward had the highest relative risk of ADD in all the three years (relative risk (95% credible interval) based on SMR, Poisson gamma and Poisson log normal models were 13.3 (11.6, 15.2), 13.0 (11.3, 14.8), 13.3 (11.5, 15.1) in 2009 and 8.0 (6.9, 9.2), 7.8 (6.7, 8.9), 8.0 (6.9, 9.1) in 2010 and 19.6 (17.0, 22.3), 19.0 (16.5, 21.7), 19.5 (16.9, 22.1) in 2011, respectively.
Conclusion
GIS mapping of ADD during the years from 2009–11 identified wards having higher incidence near northern part of Chennai near coastal area. Thus estimation of relative risk using empirical Bayes approach and mapping of disease would help us to estimate accurate incidence despite small observations and to take precautionary measure to prevent and control the spread of the disease."

The surge in motorization coupled with expansion of the road network has brought with it the challenge of addressing adverse factors, such as the increase in Road accidents in India. Significant variation exists within the country. Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, has seen liberalized economic policies of the government, increasing purchasing power of the people, and easy availability of the loans, which have contributed to the changing transportation system and increase vulnerability to Road Traffic Accidents (RTA). The present study aims to establish the baseline information on RTA in Bhubaneswar.
Objectives
(1) To estimate the incidence and distribution of RTA in the year 2012. (2) To determine the epidemiological variations of accidents in the city. (3) To suggest recommendations to the traffic police and administration.
Methodology
It is a descriptive secondary data analysis of police records of reported RTA of the year January–December 2012 collected from all the police stations within the administrative region of Bhubaneswar, urban and rural inclusive. The data thus collected were analyzed for various epidemiologic factors, which were found contributory to the accidents.
Results
Total number of RTA reported for the year was 625, thus accounting for the incidence of vehicular accidents for Bhubaneswar city, which had a 9.07/10,000 population; majority of the accidents had occurred during 9–12am in both urban and rural areas. Grievous injury accounted to 38% of the total while fatality due to RTA was nearly 30%. The epidemiological trends that emerged were that 84% occurred in urban areas and mainly on the National Highways (46.7%); 18% of RTA occurred during rainfall, though no significant association could be made out and much is attributed to under reporting of data; motor cars (37%) and trucks (19.1%) were predominately involved. Majority of the victims were in the productive age group, 18–24, years and mainly constituted males (68%). Data were analyzed for statistical inferences using proportions and graphs. Recommendations were shared with the Traffic police department and Health departments and it was suggested that yearly trends may be discussed so that problem areas may be identified and action initiated.
Conclusion
The results hint at the necessity for routine analysis of the police records in a collaborative and integrated approach across many sectors like health, traffic police, transport, and law enforcers."

A case–control study was conducted to assess the risk factors associated with AES. All cases reported from two hospitals in the district were selected with four controls per case selected randomly. Questionnaires were administered using geographical positioning system (GPS) enabled Tablets.
Results
The median age was 4 years (IQR: 3–6.5) in both cases and controls. Case-fatality rate was 274 per 1000 AES cases. Logistic regression analysis showed significant association (p<0.05) with literacy status, occupational status of parents, travel using public transport mode and presence of lychee orchard near the vicinity of households. Goodness-of-fit of model using chi-square statistic based on Hosmer–Lemeshow test was found to fit well for the final model (p=0.353).

abstract = "Background
Public health interventions are conventionally cited as a popular example of complex interventions. Complexity of public health interventions has always been an obstacle for the meta-analysis of these studies. Earlier an attempt was made by Public Health Evidence South Asia (PHESA) to numerically measure the complexity in public health interventions by a tool. This study is an extension of that initiative which aims to investigate various statistical distributional properties of the complexity score and adjust the measured complexity in meta-analysis.
Methods
Complexity score of 71 studies was used to identify the best probability distribution that fits the complexity score, study its sampling distribution and determine the optimum power transformation. Meta-regression was employed to adjust the measured complexity in meta-analysis.
Results
Lognormal distribution was observed to be an ideal probability distribution for the complexity score, the sampling distribution of the mean of complexity score was found to be normally distributed and the optimum power transformation for the complexity score was ‘−0.42’. The raw estimate from random effects meta-analysis was found to be −0.05, 95% CI −0.14 to 0.04, whereas the estimate adjusted for complexity from meta-regression was −0.048, 95% CI −0.13 to 0.03. There was a reduction in the proportion of heterogeneity (I – squared) after adjusting for complexity (73.01%–66.30%), indicating that complexity had an impact on the effect estimates of studies.
Conclusion
The concept of measuring the inherent complexity and adjusting it in meta-analysis adds novelty to the existing meta-analysis approach. This innovative approach is likely to create a new dimension for meta-analysis of complex community level interventions and provide more precise evidence. However, further methodological research and piloting is required to establish the validity and sensitivity of this approach."

abstract = "Background
The caregiver burden for mental health is found all over the world and almost eight out of ten caregivers face it when providing care to the mentally ill person, as the illness is challenging and chronic in nature. Stigma due to mental health contributes to increase in the burden of caregivers.
Methods
A qualitative research methodology was adopted to understand the perception of caregivers of mentally ill patients. In-depth interview of 20 participants was conducted who were the caregivers of mentally ill patients in the hospital.
Results
From the perceptions of caregivers, we have derived four themes under which the perceptions of caregivers are described.
Conclusion
We can conclude that stigma towards mental health in the society is a burden for caregivers when taking care of mentally ill patients and it is obstructing overall mental and physical well-being of the patient."

abstract = "Introduction
Anaemia among children is one of the major nutrition-related morbidities in developing countries. Surveillance of moderate-to-severe anaemia is recommended for the assessment of burden of anaemia in countries with high burden of anaemia. The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with moderate-to-severe anaemia among the children aged 6–59 months in Nepal based on Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2011.
Methods
This study used the dataset from the NDHS 2011. The information of last-born children whose haemoglobin was measured during the survey was used for analysis in this study. The factors associated with moderate-to-severe anaemia among children were examined using Chi-square test and logistic regression. Complex Sample Analysis was used to account for the study design and sampling.
Results
Of the 1605 last-born children aged 6–59 months, 343 (odds ratio (OR) 20.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.9–23.2%) had moderate-to-severe anaemia. Almost half (49.1%) of the children had some degree of anaemia. Mothers’ education, anaemia, ethnicity and children's age were significantly associated with moderate-to-severe anaemia among children. The mothers, who had no education (OR 3.362; 95% CI 1.485–7.611), who were suffering from anaemia (OR 3.278; 95% CI 1.884–5.704) and who were from disadvantaged Dalit ethnic groups (OR 1.739; 95% CI 1.133–2.669) were more likely to have their infants with anaemia. Similarly younger infants aged 6–11 months were more likely (OR 3.477; 95% CI 2.412–5.012) to suffer from anaemia.
Conclusion
There was comparatively a high prevalence of anaemia in children aged 6–59 months. Proper treatment for mothers’ anaemia with special attention on less educated and from disadvantaged ethnic groups will help reduce the anaemic status in children."

Iron deficiency during pregnancy is identified as a serious public health problem in most developing countries including India. In India, the majority of the pregnant women are anemic due to a variety of biological and socioeconomic reasons. The purpose of this study is to assess the factors influencing the consumption of Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation in high focus states of India.
Material and Methods
The present study is based on National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3, 2005-06) data. 11085 Recently delivered women. Variables named religion, place of residence, women’s and education, birth order, wealth index, husband’s education, husband’s occupation, type of caste/tribe, and husband present during antenatal care (ANC) visit were taken as predictors. Women who received at least 90 IFA tablets were considered as outcome variable.
Results
Well educated women are four times more likely to adhere recommended dose of iron supplements (OR=4.21; 95% CI=3.30–5.36, p<0.01). Women with birth order below 2 (OR=2.33; 95% CI=1.84–2.95, p<0.01), women whose husbands are present during ANC visits (OR=2.17; CI=1.92–2.45, p<0.01) and women with high socioeconomic status (OR=2.12; 95% CI=1.70–2.65, p<0.01) are more likely to consume at least 90 days’ iron supplement. Women who had any mass media exposure had 1.34 times (OR=1.34; 95% CI=1.13–1.58, p<0.01) more chances to intake at least 90 IFA tablets.
Conclusions
Higher education and lower birth order infer to more iron consumption among pregnant women."

A sudden increase in the estimated number of reported cases of patients infected with H1N1 virus and resultant number of deaths poses a challenging issue in the control and response to the disease. In the current study we sought to summarize a set of pre-defined measures and non-pharmacological interventions that can be employed to control the spread of H1N1 flu in India. The main purpose of this study is to document a basis for advice to health care providers on use of non-pharmacological treatments for patients and avoid further spread of this kind of illness.
Methods
Based on database search, some non-pharmacological interventions were identified and documented. The existing literature was scoped for this purpose to extract the relevant data for the analysis purpose. Studies with H1N1 outbreak and pandemic data of India were included and studies undertaken outside India were excluded.
Results
The critical non-pharmacological measures to control H1N1 as identified from this review include closing schools, training of health care providers, timely vaccination of health care workers, creation of isolation wards, spreading awareness about the flu, regular disease surveillance and monitoring program, washing hands, following disinfection and sanitary practices, avoiding crowded areas, using tissues and other face masks while sneezing, allocation of separate trained staff, preparing region specific pandemic preparedness plans & surveillance strategies.
Conclusion
The proposed recommendations should be clearly communicated to the target audience as a reference for preparation of health systems and providers for combating the H1N1 virus."

To study socio-cultural impact of PCOS on Indian Women especially those belonging to Economically Weaker Section (EWS).
Methodology
It is a field work based study in which females suffering from PCOS were interviewed in the Outpatient Department (OPD) of a Government Hospital in Jammu. Majority of the respondents belonged to EWS and did not know anything about PCOS. Semi-structured interview schedule was used to interview patients who visited OPD for the treatment. Entire data were collected from 15th November 2016 to 31st December 2016. Information provided by respondents is used as narratives in the present study. Theories of stigma and social construction of illness have been used to analyse respondents' approach towards the disease and the way they perceive the onset of PCOS.
Results and discussions
Entire discussion part has been sub-divided into: PCOS as a tabooed disease; infertility: a major consequence of PCOS; Lack of awareness about the disease; and social construction of PCOS. Respondents are found to have a grave concern about the disease due to their inability to adhere to the socially constructed role of a woman. Since, menstruation is still a tabooed topic of discussion in many parts of Indian society, hence they abstain from discussing about irregularity of periods till situation goes out of hand. Married women are marred by the stigma of infertility and unmarried ones fear future infertility.
Conclusion
Lack of awareness and compulsion to fulfil socially expected role of a woman, women suffering from PCOS, in this part of India, aim only at becoming pregnant (in case of married women) and normalising their monthly periods (in case of unmarried females). However, there is need to spread awareness about PCOS and encouraging women to adopt knowledge, attitude and practice approach to manage this disease."

To assess incidence of spontaneous preterm births and determine biochemical and obstetric risk factors for spontaneous pre-term births in a cohort of antenatal women visiting a secondary care hospital.
Methods
A prospective cohort study was designed to include 1420 pregnant women coming for antenatal care at a secondary care hospital. The cohort was followed throughout pregnancy and relevant history, obstetric and ultrasonographic examination and biochemical investigations was carried out in 2nd (20-24 weeks period of gestation) and 3rd trimester (28-32 weeks period of gestation). Outcome of delivery was noted for all the subjects.
Results
A total of 1133 women were recruited. Among the 1071 respondents, 11 had abortions, 93.1% delivered at term while 5.9% had preterm deliveries. Preterm deliveries were noted among 6.5% women with short stature, 13.3% with cervical length <2.5cms and 5.2% among women with anaemia. Statistically significant association was noted between Oligohydramnios, IUGR and preterm births. Salivary estriol was lower in women who had preterm births as compared to term births.
Conclusions
The incidence of preterm births (5.9%) was low in the present cohort. Oligohydramnios and Intrauterine Growth Retardation (IUGR) were identified as significant risk factors for preterm births. Conventional risk factors like short cervix, short stature and biochemical inflammatory markers were not identified as predictors of prematurity. Lower levels of salivary estriol identified among women at risk of preterm births demonstrates the utility of the test as a non-invasive investigation for early identification of preterm births."

To improve access to basic health services, Government of India, in 2005, inducted Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHAs) as community health workers. Evaluation of ASHA program in Howrah district of West Bengal indicated low performance of ASHAs in providing maternal care. We conducted an unmatched case-control study to identify factors associated with low performance of ASHA in Howrah district.
Methods
We categorized 993 ASHAs as low (cases) and 994 as adequate (controls) performing, based on average incentive received by each ASHA, and randomly selected 261 cases and 261 controls. We interviewed ASHAs to collect information about factors influencing their performance including socio-economic details, workload, training and support and supervision. We calculated crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals using simple and multiple logistic regression respectively.
Result
Compared to adequate performing ASHAs, low performing ASHAs were more likely to serve larger population than the recommended norm of 1200 [OR: 1.8; 95%CI: 1.2–2.5] or got less supervisory visits by Auxiliary Nurse and Midwife (ANM) in field [OR: 1.75; 95%CI: 1.03–2.98], did not have any stocks of Iron Folate tablets (IFA) [OR: 4.85; 95%CI: 1.37–17.1] and belonged to religious minority [OR: 2; 95%CI: 1.26–3.35].
Conclusion
Low performance of ASHAs was associated with population overburden, not having IFA in stock, less field visit by ANM and religious minority in Howrah district. For improving performance of ASHAs, we recommended recruiting new ASHA, ensuring uninterrupted IFA supply and strengthening supporting supervision. These measures need to focus on ASHAs belonging to Muslim religion."

Main objectives of the study were the following:1.To achieve a recovery rate of 75% in severe acute malnutrition (SAM) children and 35% in severe underweight (SUW) children, in tribal community based management of severe malnutrition.2.To achieve a case fatality rate of <4% in SAM and SUW children in the above setting.3.To reduce current prevalence rate of SAM and SUW by at least 35% after 3 years of intervention.
Design
Community-based prospective, single-group intervention study.
Setting
Primary and secondary care was given to participants from 14 villages of the tribal area of Melghat.
Participants
Severely malnourished children (SMC:734), tribal, male and female of the 6–60 months age group were enrolled and 680 children completed the study over a period of 3 years. Sample size (N=762) was estimated considering the prevalence of severe malnutrition (SAM and SUW) in 6–60 months population as 21.5%; design effect was 3.0 and relative precision was 10%, with 95% confidence interval.
Interventions
LTF (local-therapeutic-food) with MN (micronutrients), treatment of infections and BCC (behavior change communication) were given for 90 days to SMC by VHW (village health worker).
Outcome measures
Rate of recovery, case fatality rate, and reduction in prevalence of SAM and SUW.
Results
Majority of SMC (69.1%) in the 6–24 months age group were SAM, while majority of SMC (65.3%) in the 25–60 months age group were SUW. Recovery rate of SAM is 75.9%, 77.8%, and 79.4% at the end of 8th, 10th, and 12th week, respectively; the recovery rate for SUW is 37.5%, 42.7%, and 45.4%, respectively. Case fatality rate for SAM is 0.6% and for SUW is 0.2% after 8th week. There is significant reduction in prevalence of SAM (p – 0.005) and SUW (p – 0.0001) children at the end of the study.
Conclusions
The study shows efficacy of LTF-MN and effectiveness of our community-based model in acute and chronic malnutrition. Further research is needed for deciding the exact duration of SUW therapy.

abstract = "Aim
Pediatric tuberculosis (TB) is endemic in Mumbai, India. However, geographical distribution and demographic pattern of children affected with TB are not known. This study aims to determine a geographical and demographic profile of children with TB.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study that included children from 0–15 years of age suffering from TB, who were referred to our Pediatric TB Clinic, and were seeking treatment at the clinic located in central Mumbai from 2010 to 2011. The patients were diagnosed with tuberculosis based either clinically (fever with cough for more than 2 weeks/loss of weight or failure to thrive/recent contact with an adult having tuberculosis), bacteriologically (positive AFB culture), or histopathology suggestive of caseous granulomas. Records of all the patients were reviewed and the age, gender, type of tuberculosis, drug-resistant (DR) TB, community of patient, and the region of residence were recorded. The association of age, gender, type of tuberculosis, and drug resistance with area of residence as well as type of community was analyzed.
Results
A total of 242 children were included in the study. Mean age of presentation was 5±3.8 years. Male:female ratio was 1.1:1. Totally, 230 (95%) patients were from Mumbai whereas 10 (4.1%) patients were residing outside Mumbai. We were unable to record the residence of 2 patients. Of the 230 patients from Mumbai, 63 patients (26%) were from the Central Mumbai, 93 patients (38.4%) were from Central suburbs, 18 (7.4%) were from the South Mumbai and 57 (23.6%) were from Western suburbs of Mumbai. The association between the area of residence and type of tuberculosis (pulmonary TB, p=0.1349; abdominal TB, p=0.063; bone TB, p=0.871; latent TB, p=0.0783; disseminated TB, p=0.9; adenopathy, p=0.6576; neuro TB, p=0.2564; serositis, p=0.170), gender (p=0.7139), drug resistance (p=0.5182), and age (p=0.2403) was not statistically significant. Overall, 195 (80.6%) patients were Hindus and the remaining 47 (19.4%) patients were Muslims. Similarly, the association between the community (Hindu and Muslim) and type of tuberculosis (pulmonary TB, p=0.7518; abdominal TB, p=0.2146; bone TB, p=1.0; latent TB, p=0.2217; disseminated TB, p=1.0; adenopathy, p=0.3403; neuro TB, p=0.8157; serositis, p=1.0), gender (p=0.2121), drug resistance (p=0.3625), and age (p=0.8721) was also not statistically significant.
Conclusion
TB at our center was predominantly seen in children from Central Mumbai, which may be due to the central location of our hospital. However, types of TB, DR-TB, were seen equally in children from all parts of the city and were not located to any specific region."

Scrub typhus is a potentially fatal rickettsial infection endemic in Asia. But there are only very few reports of pediatric scrub typhus from Southern Kerala, which is situated in South India.
Objective
To study the clinicoepidemiological profile of pediatric patients with scrub typhus in Southern Kerala.
Methods
Clinical profile of 108 consecutive, 1- to 12-year-old children diagnosed with scrub typhus admitted in a tertiary care teaching hospital in South India from August 2011 to May 2015 was studied.
Results
The median age of affected children was 6.83 years with a male to female ratio 1.42:1. Definite clustering of cases was noted from Nedumangaud Taluk, a hilly area in Trivandrum district (24%). A seasonal pattern was observed with a peak during the months of August–January (84.26%). Most common symptoms apart from fever were cough, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Most common signs were splenomegaly in 68.52% of cases and lymph node enlargement in 59.26% of cases. Eschar was present in 44.44% of cases, with the commonest site being inguinal region. Complications were seen in 9.25% of cases. Myocarditis was the most common complication and one case had associated coronary artery dilatation also. Case fatality rate was only 0.93%. Doxycycline and azithromycin were the antibiotics used. Fever subsided within 24h of starting treatment in 73.15% of cases and within 48h in 84.26% of cases.
Conclusion
Scrub typhus is a common cause of fever in South India. Awareness among medical professional should be a high priority as late detection is the cause of failure of treatment, complications, and even mortality."

As India is considered as the diabetic capital of world, a huge burden of undiagnosed metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a possibility. Early intervention can be planned if MetS can be detected early to avert cardiovascular morbidities.
Aims
To assess determinants of MetS amongst population living in Dibrugarh District of Assam.
Methods
Community based cross-sectional study conducted in Dibrugarh District of Assam, with multistep sampling. Study area, i.e., four rural sub-centres and two urban electoral blocks, were selected randomly. From the list of population of selected area the consenting eligible were included. Sample size was 1700 population with MetS. Socio-demographic information, World Health Organization's Steps questionnaire for behavioural risk factors along with dietary history, anthropometric assessment and laboratory investigations were conducted in three stages. Statistical analysis used: rates, ratio, proportion, univariate and multivariate analysis.
Results
MetS was 47.6% (1606 of 3372 screened) and mean age 47.1±10.9 years. Univariate analysis showed educational status, occupation, family history of hypertension and diabetes, tobacco and alcohol consumption, financial stress, depression, less physical activity, more consumption of meat, fish, egg, diary products, and high-energy food significantly associated with MetS. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed age, education, occupation, computer owner (OR: 3.69, CI: 2.10–6.47, p=0.000), family history of diabetes (OR: 3.18, CI: 2.10–6.47, p=0.000), stress (OR: 1.85, CI: 1.45–2.35, p=0.000), consuming dairy product ≥3 times/week (OR: 2.57, CI: 1.68–3.94, p=0.000) and nuts and oilseed <3 times/week (OR: 2.37, CI: 1.90–2.96, p=0.000) have significant association.

A door to door survey was conducted in 5 islands (surveyed population: 22,558) of Lakshadweep to identify the population at risk for communication disorders. Those who were at risk were screened to identify the same in the second phase. Screening was conducted in camps held at three islands. The prevalence of communication disorders was then estimated for the at-risk population.
Results
The percentage of individuals who were at-risk of communication disorders as estimated from the survey data was found to be 3.63%. Among those who appeared for the screening camp 42.64% of individuals were found to have ear related problems and 57.36% individuals had speech–language disorders. Also, males had higher prevalence of ear related (53.77% against 46.23%) and speech language related problems (60.29% against 39.71%).
Conclusions
The prevalence of hearing loss was lesser and the prevalence of speech–language disorders higher compared to the mainland. Among the communication disorders, speech and language disorders were more prevalent. Males were more prone to the communication disorders than females."

To assess etiology, clinical profile, and outcome of pathological neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, including various Rhesus (Rh) blood group incompatibilities.
Methods
This was a prospective observational study of 200 neonates, with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy and/or exchange transfusion, presented at tertiary care neonatal unit during August 2011 to July 2012. Detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory work-up were performed. In case, if major blood group incompatibility was found negative, the blood was further processed for G-6PD status, hereditary spherocytosis, and for non-Rh D incompatibility by testing non-Rh D antigens status in mother–infant pair.
Result
ABO incompatibility (64 cases, 32%), Rh D incompatibility (28 cases, 14%), and sepsis (42 cases, 21%) were major causes of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, while the etiology could not be ascertained in 31 (15.5%) cases. Rh C and Rh E incompatibilities were observed in 28 (14%) and 6 (3%) cases, respectively among those neonates who did not exhibit major blood group incompatibility (ABO and Rh D). Rh C incompatibility was less severe than Rh D, and Rh E was least.
Conclusions
Blood group incompatibilities (ABO and Rh D) and sepsis are important causes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates requiring treatment. Though less common, non-Rh D incompatibility can contribute to severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and needs to be investigated."

abstract = "Objectives
To assess the prevalence and explore the risk factors for hypoxia (SpO2 levels <92%) in ambient air in children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
Methods
This was an observational study, conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital in north India. Included were children aged 1 month to 5 years having pneumonia with lower chest indrawing (LCI) or severe pneumonia. Excluded were those on oxygen supplementation at time of hospitalization, patients in shock, those with cyanotic congenital heart disease and where parental consent was not obtained. World Health Organization criteria were used for assessing the severity of CAP. Anaemia and moderate malnutrition were defined as haemoglobin <10g/dl and weight/height <−2 SD, respectively. Peripheral oxygen saturation was measured using a single, portable, battery-powered pulse oximeter at the time of admission and a cut-off of <92% was used to define hypoxia. Haemoglobin was measured by cyanmethemoglobin method.
Results
From July 2013 to June 2014, 165 patients with CAP were admitted, of which 135 patients were eligible for inclusion, and of them, 74.8% (n=101) had pneumonia with LCI and 25.2% (n=34) had severe pneumonia. Hypoxia was found in 40% (n=54/135) of the patients, and of them, 37% (n=20/54) had pneumonia with LCI and 63% (n=34/54) had severe pneumonia. Hypoxia was associated with severity of pneumonia (p value <0.001). In the unconditional logistic model, adjusted risk of hypoxia with malnutrition was 12.1 ((95% CI) 5.0–29.4, p value <0.001) and with anaemia was 4.5 ((95% CI) 1.8–11.2, p value 0.001).
Conclusion
Since a substantial proportion of CAP had hypoxia at hospitalization, prompt detection at admission is essential especially in children with anaemia and malnutrition. Moreover, primary prevention of malnutrition and anaemia in children less than 5 years would contribute significantly in reducing prevalence of hypoxia and thus CAP-related mortality."

abstract = "Background
Folate deficiency has been found to be associated with congenital birth defects like spina bifida, anencephaly, etc. Pregnant women have an increased need for folic acid (600μg/day) to support the growth of the placenta and foetus and prevent birth defects.
Objectives
The present study was conducted to assess deficiency of serum folate among pregnant women and its epidemiological determinants.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Doiwala block of Uttarakhand state, a hilly state of the country, and a total of 95 pregnant women participated. Pregnant women were randomly selected from antenatal clinics organized at sub-centres and primary health centres. Blood samples were analyzed for serum folate by competitive immunoassay using direct chemiluminescent technology. Fully automated ADVIA Centaur XP Immunoassay system was used for analysis.
Results
Analysis of data showed that mean serum folate level among pregnant women was 10.1±5.9ng/ml (95% confidence interval 8.9–11.2). As per World Health Organization cut-off levels, a total of 28 (29.4%), 95% CI (20.2–38.5), women were having folate deficiency (≤5.9ng/ml), and out of them 3 were having folate levels below 3ng/ml (severe folate deficiency). 9 (9.4%) women had elevated levels (>20ng/ml). 57 (60%) women were in the normal range (6–20ng/ml). Out of various biosocial determinants considered, education and economic status have shown significant association with folate deficiency. A significant difference was observed in the mean serum folate level among pregnant women living in joint and nuclear type of family. Mean serum folate levels showed a slight negative correlation with body mass index (Spearman's rho=−0.22, p=0.03900) and gestational age (correlation coefficient: r=−0.26, p=0.009).
Conclusion
It is concluded that higher level of education, living in joint family during pregnancy and availability of designated APL (Above Poverty Line) or BPL (Below Poverty Line) card are important determinants for better serum folate level and lower chances of folate deficiency."

A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out in Gokulpuri area in Delhi from January to December 2014 among 550 mothers/caretakers who were residing in the study area and selected by stratified random sampling. Data were collected using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire consisting of items on socio-demographic details and history of acute respiratory infections (ARI), diarrhoea, measles and malaria in the past 15 days. Data were analyzed by using SPSS 17. Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test was used for testing any significance of association and “p” value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The study showed that 282 (51.2%) children were 1–5 years old and 290 (52.7%) were male. Prevalence of ARI was found to be 16% followed by diarrhoea to be 4.2% in the last 15 days. There was no case of measles in the area. 123 (22.3%) were found to be moderately malnourished. Prevalence of ARI was significantly less in exclusively breastfed children compared to not exclusively breastfed children (p=0.002). For other childhood diseases, the difference was not statistically significant.
Conclusion
The childhood diseases had a considerable burden in the area. Protective factors like colostrum and exclusive breastfeeding should be promoted by raising awareness among caregivers. Intensive health education campaigns should be carried out in the area to prevent childhood diseases."

Diabetic foot is the most serious and disabling long term complication of diabetes, adversely affecting the health related quality of life (HRQoL).
Objectives
To evaluates the impact of patient-education (PE) on HRQoL of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients.
Methods
This randomized controlled study on the effect of PE on improvement of HRQoL, conducted in Kasturba Hospital, Manipal, India consisted of 135 DFU patients with 65 subjects in the control group (CG) and 70 subjects in the intervention group (IG). RAND-36 questionnaire was employed for evaluating HRQoL scores of DFU patients in both groups at baseline and after six months of PE.
Results
Subjects in the both IG and CG reported poor HRQoL scores, on all the eight subscales at baseline. After six months of PE, HRQoL improved substantially in IG with respect to CG and IG at baseline (p < 0.05). Likewise, in both CG and IG, the physical component summary scale (PCS) scores (24.1 ± 6.6 vs 25.6 ± 7.3) and the mental component summary scale (MCS) scores (27.3 ± 5.4 vs 28.8 ± 7.1) were similar and poor before PE. However, six months post PE, in IG, the Both PCS and MCS scores increased dramatically from 25.6 ± 7.3 to 42.9 ± 9.7 and 28.8 ± 7.1 to 48.8 ± 8.4 (p < 0.05) respectively.
Conclusion
The remarkable improvement in the HRQoL in IG at six months follow-up suggests that PE significantly improves HRQoL in DFU patients. Overworked physicians and paucity of trained doctors in resource-poor settings obligate task-sharing with non-physician healthcare providers."

Multivariable linear regression and a Cox proportional hazards assessment were used to determine associations between age of CML diagnosis and crop-specific regions.
Results
Patients in the agriculture/fishing occupation sector from high rice-production areas developed CML earlier (2.71years) than those living in areas with lower levels of rice production (p-value=.01).
Conclusions
These data show a geographic relationship between crops grown and mean age of CML diagnosis. Whether crop type is a reflection of differences in specific occupational chemical uses or dietary practices, and how each of these factors relates to CML risk requires investigation at the individual level."

Little research in low and middle-income countries has been conducted on shifts in levels of smoking among those suffering from chronic diseases exposed to cessation messages. We present data on such shifts among diabetes patients participating in a randomized controlled cessation trial in Kerala state, India. The two-arm trial tested the relative effectiveness of diabetes specific cessation messages from doctors and the added value of motivational interviewing by trained cessation counsellors.
Methods
Two hundred twenty-four smokers who participated in the trial were followed for 2 years. Intention to treat analysis documented changes in levels of smoking. We defined low-level smoking as 1-5 sticks per day, medium-level as 6-10 sticks, and high-level as more than 10 sticks. Twenty-three low-level smokers were interviewed about why they continued to smoke, and household response to their smoking.
Results
At baseline, 32% of the 224 diabetes patients were low-level smokers, 24% medium-level and 44% high-level smokers. At year two 34% of the participants in the trial had quit smoking, 37% were low-level smokers, 16% medium-level smokers and 13% high-level smokers. Forty-nine percent of low-level smokers at baseline continued to smoke at low level. Fifty percent of mid-level and 45% of high-level smokers who did not quit shifted to low level smoking A majority of low-level smokers and their families perceived low-level smoking to be safe.
Conclusions
Low level smoking among diabetes patients is common. Proactive and sustained cessation efforts are called for that are attentive to disease complications as teachable moments."

Ageing is not an illness, but the elderly are vulnerable to slowly evolving chronic diseases. The difficulties faced by the elderly are uncountable leading to social and cultural differences in the present Indian society.
Objective
This study was conducted to assess the socio-demographic profile, lifestyle practices and morbidities of the elderly and their association, particularly with non-communicable diseases. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the field practice area of a medical college in a city in north part of India. A total of 225 elderly patients (60 years old and above) residing in urban area were interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire through house-to-house visit.
Results
Out of the total, there were 51.1% females (n=115), 99.1% Hindus (n=223), 51.1% married (n=115), 79.6% lived in joint families (n=179) and 52.9% belonged to upper middle class (n=119). Tobacco consumption was seen in 62.1% (smoking; n=110) and 19.7% (smokeless; n=35) elderly. About 18% (n=32) were consuming alcohol. More than half of the study participants were not doing physical activity. Majority of the elderly in the study (n=197; 87.6%) had one or more diagnosed diseases at the time of study. Morbidity was found associated with type of family, regular exercise, dietary habit, addiction user, duration of smoking, socio-economic status, alcohol consumption, smoking and tobacco chewing.
Conclusion
Many of the lifestyle practices such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption and physical inactivity were prevalent amongst elderly. Majority of them were suffering from more than one morbidity, which was found to be associated with their unhealthy lifestyle practices. There is a need to target interventions for inculcating healthy lifestyle practices amongst elderly."

There exists a number of studies on the causes and determinants of childhood mortality in the developing world. However, to best of our knowledge, none of the existing studies have examined the effect of wealth and birth interval on childhood mortality in Nigeria. This study is an attempt to fill that gap.
Methods
Data for this study comes from the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2013, which is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey. This study uses information on 119,386 under-5 children to analyze the effect of wealth and birth interval on childhood mortality. Bi-variate and Cox regression technique were applied for analyzing the cross-sectional data drawn from representative survey.
Results
Under-5 mortality was higher in mothers who were poor, illiterate and working either as a professional/technical worker or as an agricultural worker. Children whose mothers were illiterate and had less than two years of the birth interval had the highest under-5 mortality. Younger mothers (aged less than 20 years) lost more children. Under-5 deaths were more among those mothers who were poor and had less than two years of birth interval. The child mortality was significantly high in poor households with low birth interval.
Conclusion
Under-5 mortality is low among those who had higher wealth status and more than two years of birth interval. In order to reduce or eradicating the effect of birth interval and wealth effect, there is burning need to control the economic inequality and birth interval."

High incidence of migraine has caused to categorize it as one of the most debilitating human diseases. This study aims to investigate the incidence of migraine headache and the factors associated with it among medical students.
Methodology
The present research is a descriptive, cross-sectional study. The sample size includes 390 subjects that were selected through proportionate stratified random sampling. To this purpose we used a questionnaire that was designed according to international headache standards criteria. Data was analyzed by SPSS. Accordingly, chi-square, independent t-test, and logistic regression were used for evaluation of clinical data.
Results
In the finding it was reviled that 318 subjects out of 390 participants in the study had experienced headache (81.53%). In total, 27 subjects (6.9%) were suffering from migraine including 77.8% women and 22.2% men. The most common complication of migraine headache is dizziness by 17.2%. Factors intensifying migraine headaches include stress (63%), sunlight or fluorescent light (55.6%), loud noise (48.1%), fatigue (77.8%), and overheating (51.9%).
Conclusion
among the factors affecting the intensification of migraine headaches, stress, sunlight, noise, fatigue, heat, menstruation in women, too much work, late sleep at night and some foods such as fish, caffeine, pepper, fat and fried foods were also identified as the food factors intensifying migraine headaches. Since the students of medical sciences are a part of health care system and such headaches will reduce their efficiency in health care delivery. Socio-economic impact of migraine on quality of life of student considerable and must be emphasized in health-treatment programs and plans."

Single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) being one of the most commonly used methods that significantly improved the detection of coronary artery disease. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of SPECT in diagnosis of coronary artery disease.
Methods
Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from 1997 through 2017. The full economic evaluations of SPECT as the first and only test in diagnosis of coronary artery disease were included in this study. Non-English studies, conference abstracts and letters/editorials were excluded. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist was used to review the methodological quality of included studies.
Results
Eight studies met the systematic review inclusion criteria. In general, the quality of the included studies was high. The abstract of studies had the least degree of compliance with the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist. The majority of the papers used decision tree model and estimated cost from a payer's perspective. This study revealed wide heterogeneity in the methodology particularly in setting, comparators, time horizon, and perspective.
Conclusion
By conducting this systematic review on 8 valid studies, it was found that the cost-effectiveness of an imaging test strongly depends on the pretest likelihood of disease. The included studies on cost-effectiveness provide conflicting evidence in support of the use of SPECT in diagnosis of coronary artery disease. This study showed that the cost-effectiveness of an imaging test varied between subgroups of patients."

Trauma is the commonest cause of death and major morbidities in children and adolescents worldwide. There has been a lack of data on the epidemiology of trauma among children in Chinese cities include Hong Kong. Therefore the current study was conducted to examine the spectrum of paediatric trauma in Hong Kong and to address knowledge gaps in its epidemiology and prevention.
Objective
This study aimed to describe the epidemiological features of paediatric trauma and explore the characteristics in the low income group which would help to guide the design of effective interventions and future research on prevention of paediatric trauma.
Method
A descriptive study on the epidemiology of trauma in children ≤18-year-old using a standardised injury registry embedded within a population-based hospital database. Information on demographics, injury type, mechanism, injury severity score (ISS) and injury prevention prioritization score (IPPZ) were collected to identify the epidemiological features and prevention initiatives.
Result
The overall female to male ratio was 1: 1.97, which increased with age from 1:1.45 (infant; below 2 years old) to 1:2.67 (adolescent; 12-18 years old). The overall mean ISS was 7.98 (SD 9.18), ISS increased with age significantly (rho=0.143, P<0.001). The most common context of trauma included travelling (IPPZ: 59.94, mean ISS 10.2 ± 10.23, n=402), leisure activities (IPPZ: 52.04, mean ISS 5.6 ± 6.77, n=312), street/highway (IPPZ: 70.22, mean ISS 10.48 ± 10.53, n=475) and home (including garden and out buildings) (IPPZ: 69.56, mean ISS 6.64 ± 7.94, n=539). Severity of paediatric injuries among low-income group did not differ from the general population.
Conclusion
The study provided updated epidemiological characteristics of paediatric trauma, which could be used to guide focus prevention of paediatric trauma. The findings also highlighted further study initiatives including injury surveillance, geographical analysis and environment modification."

Prevalence of Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) are on the increase and there is an urgent need for novel and effective treatment modalities in the management of NCDs. Objective of the current study is to understand the success of one such ‘novel’ Yoga and Naturopathy based ‘Lifestyle clinic’ model, executed at various government rural and urban settings in Tamil Nadu, South India. The patient trends and health conditions with which they had visited these Yoga and Naturopathy centers are presented in this article.
Method
We retrospectively analyzed the data abstracted from various government Yoga & Naturopathy centers/Lifestyle clinics in Tamil Nadu, which includes the total number of outpatients, name and frequency of diseases diagnosed and treatments offered.
Results
Total number of outpatients who had approached the centers/Lifestyle clinics between the period of 2015 and 2018 was 8,914,820. There was a positive increase in the trend of the number of patients who visited various Yoga and Naturopathy centers on a year-on-year basis since 2015. Of the patients identified, most patients visited the rural centers- National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) (44%). Patients who had visited other centers like District Headquarters Hospital (DHQHpl) and Medical College Hospitals (MCH) were 31% and 25% respectively.
Conclusion
Our study suggests that the Yoga and Naturopathy based ‘Lifestyle clinic model’ is successful in the community and there is a positive increase in trend among patients for utilizing these government centers. Further analysis of the characteristics of patients getting treated would help future researchers to implement stronger clinical evidence and its implementation on a larger scale."

Aim
Thus, this study was designed to compare the macronutrients and micronutrients intake of adolescent girls with Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA) values.
Methods
A Community based cross-sectional study was carried out in five selected schools of Udupi Taluk by adopting stratified random sampling technique and 422 adolescent girls were enrolled in the study .Data on demographics, dietary pattern, anthropometric measurements were noted.
Result
The study results revealed that majority, 65.2% of the adolescent girls were at 15 years of age. The BMI was low to the age,whereas height for age was corresponding in comparison with the WHO growth standard. The daily mean intake of macronutrients namely protein, fat and energy intake was 53.33g, 47.89g and 1693.33kcal respectively. Similarly the daily mean intake of micronutrients like calcium, iron, zinc, was 642.86mg, 9.74mg and 1.97mg respectively. Further analysis of percentage of adequacy of macronutrients and micronutrients showed that 23.1% of the adolescent girls were substantially excess in their protein intake and majority of the adolescent girls were having substantially inadequate intake of various micronutrients including iron and calcium.
Conclusion
Majority of adolescent girls were substantially inadequate in their micronutrients intake. Hence there is need for regular sensitizing nutritional programme at school and community level to prevent reproductive related complications in their future life."

This study investigated the prevalence of lip and palate clefts, need for reoperation and primary surgery in unrepaired patients younger than 18 years old in Zanjan province, northwest of Iran.
Methods
All urban and rural healthcare centers and the education department of Zanjan province were informed about this project. After identifying all patients with cleft lip and palate, they were sent to the plastic surgery clinic of our hospital. Their data were gathered, including sex, age, clinical classification, surgical modality, complications, surgery satisfaction and un-repaired patients.
Results
A total of 87,356 people were examined by social workers. Among them 120 children and adolescents had cleft lip and palate (1.37 per 1000). 59 (49.1%) patients had cleft lip and palate, 35 (29.1%) patients had only cleft lip and 26 (21.6%) patients had only cleft palate. 25 patients (20.8%) had not done surgery (detection rate was 2.86 per 10,000). Secondary surgery was done in 39 patients (41.05%). In spite of a referral health system in Iran, 25 children with cleft lip had not been operated.
Conclusion
Although most of the identified patients had been operated before, almost half of them had to undergo surgery again. Given the lack of studies on this topic in Iran, our findings can form the basis for further studies to precisely identify the roots of cleft lip and palate and properly plan to decrease its risk factors. Further studies are needed to identify reasons of missed detections and why primary surgeries are not satisfying."

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a common condition that occurring during pregnancy and while untreated can be associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.
Aim
The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of ASB in pregnant women referred to prenatal care clinics and determine risk factors and resistance patterns of bacteria isolated from urinary tract infections.
Methods
In a prospective study 220 women without urinary symptoms referred to prenatal care clinics randomly. After obtaining informed consent and complete a demographic questionnaire urine samples were taken and cultured. The isolates from all the cases of ASB were identified and antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the Kirby- Bauer disc diffusion method.
Results
In this study, the minimum age was 16 years and the maximum was 42 years, mean age was 29.25 ± 7.56 years. The average gestational age in women with ASB was 28.7 ± 6.4 weeks and in patients without ASB was 27.6 ± 5.7 weeks. About 12% of women had ASB. E. coli was found to be the most common isolate. In this study, educational level, previous history of UTI, non-compliance with preventive measures and multi-parity were risk factors of ASB. The least antibiotics resistance was to nitrofurantoin, ceftriaxone, and norfloxacin.
Conclusion
Routine screening of antenatal women during all trimesters must be considered for preventing the adverse maternal and fetal outcomes particularly with known risk factors like low educational level, multiparity and previous history of UTI."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is divided into ancient and modern lineage. Both lineages have different virulence property and therefore associated with different immune responses and disease severity in tuberculosis (TB) patients. The aim of this study was to determine the association between MTB lineages and the level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and lung tissue damage among Indonesian TB patients.
Methods
Thirty new and active TB patients were recruited randomly from Dr. Soewandhie Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia. MTB isolates were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and their lineages were determined by primer-specific PCR targeting TbD1 and RD9 region gene. The degree of lung tissue damage was assessed and classified using NICE Scoring System and TNF-α level of BALF was measured by ELISA.
Results
MTB were detected in all patients in which 17 and 13 isolates were classified as modern and ancient lineage, respectively. Modern lineage was associated with the degree of lung damage (odds ratio [OR]: 3.97; 95% CI: 1.57–6.37), p < 0.001). This lineage was also associated with high TNF-α level (OR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.31–47.00, p=0.026). In addition, the level of TNF-α was higher in severe compared to mild lung damage cases (p = 0.001).

abstract = "Context
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common affective disorder and is considered as an important public health problem as most of the time it remains unrecognized and affects the health of not only the mother but also the interpersonal relationships, mother-infant bonding as well as emotional and cognitive development of the baby.
Objective
To estimate the prevalence and analyze the factors associated with PPD.
Settings and design
A community based cross-sectional study was conducted in rural areas of Udupi Taluk, Karnataka over a period of six months.
Methods and material
Four hundred ten (410) postnatal women within six months of their deliveries were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire, and were screened using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).
Statistical analysis
Descriptive analysis was done on socio-demographic variables, obstetric, neonatal and postnatal and psychosocial factors. Logistic regression was carried to analyze the factors associated with PPD.
Results
Prevalence of PPD was 21.5%. Higher level of maternal and paternal educational status, labour complications, more than two children, history of an abortion and sleeping difficulty of the mothers were found to be statistically significant for PPD.
Conclusion
Early identification of symptoms and timely referral to appropriate health care provider can prevent major depression in the postnatal period.
Key messages
Higher level of educational status of mothers was found to be a risk factor whereas educated fathers were protective for PPD."

In oncology setup, the personalized medicine with the Dynamic Treatment Regime(DTR) is the attractive tool for treatment management. It is based on sequence rule by changing the required treatment by looking into patients dynamic condition repeatedly. This repeatedly measured condition generates the longitudinal data and the time-to-event data jointly. The time-to-event data is generated with competing risks. Now handling the joint longitudinal and survival data with competing risks is itself challenging. It becomes more challenging to decide the best effective treatment strategy while we work with DTR approach in presences of competing risks through joint longitudinal and survival model.
Methods
This article is dedicated towards development of statistical methodology to handle competing risk analysis for DTR in repeatedly measured survival data. In this study a simulated dataset is used to resemble the observed data distribution seen in a motivating cancer trial data.
Results
This algorithm is prepared through Bayesian analysis to obtain the best effective therapeutic regimen. The OpenBUGS function is prepared, which provides the therapeutic effect comparison and there after estimations between different treatment sequences.
Conclusion
This developed method is easy to handle for personalized medicine context in oncology for supportive decision rule."

Methods
In this case control study, 22 cases (drug resistant TB patients) and 88 controls (TB patients selected out of those with successive treatment) were randomly selected from a cohort of TB patients in Northern of Iran. The required information was collected from TB registration software in Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.
Results
Of 22 drug resistant TB patients, resistance to isoniazid, rifampin and also multidrug resistance were observed in 10(9.1%), 3(2.7%) and 9(8.2%) respectively. Moreover, 22.2% of MDR cases, 66.7% of rifampin resistant cases and 40% of isoniazid resistant patients had experienced previous TB treatment (p = 0.363). Logistic regression models showed that the history of previous treatment was significantly associated with drug resistance (OR = 16.55, 95% CI = 2.83–96.89).

Employment of the mother is considered to be one of the most important barriers to exclusive breastfeeding (EBF).
Aim
To study the factors influencing EBF practices among working mothers in Udupi taluk.
Methods and material
A community-based cross-`sectional study was conducted among breastfeeding mothers employed in any form of occupation having an infant less than six months old (n=137). Interviewer administered structured questionnaire was used to collect data.
Statistical analysis used
Chi-square test was performed to find the association between different variables and EBF.
Results
The prevalence of EBF among working mothers was found to be 17.5% although 75% of them had adequate knowledge on EBF and its benefits. Around 52% of the mothers did not receive any maternity leave benefits. Only 11% of mothers were allowed breaks in between working hours but none of the mothers were provided with crèches at their workplace. The commonest reason to discontinue EBF was early resumption of work after childbirth. Factors such as educational status of working mother and her husband, occupation of husband, place of delivery, sex of the newborn, frequency of breastfeeding per day, practice of expressing and storing breastmilk before leaving for work and breaks during working hours were found to be statistically significant with EBF practice.
Conclusions
These findings emphasize the need to guarantee the support to breastfeeding policies at workplace which in turn would motivate working mothers to continue EBF after resuming work."

Health camps are a popular way for community outreach and most such camps are done in sporadic manner. Effectiveness of such camps are not documented well.
Methods
We documented the variables of the children seen in 3 such health camps and did an audit.
Results
A total of 345 children attended the all the 3 health camps of which 1 was in rural setting (camp A) and 2 were in urban setting (camp B&C). Most children had some ailments; 83.8%, 96.1% and 61.9% in Camp A, B and C respectively. In all the three camps, a majority of the children had trivial common ailments, for which treatment was given on site. Viral upper respiratory tract infection was the most common diagnosis. A total of 18 (5.1%) of children required referral to our institute for further evaluation. No child referred for follow at the institute had come back in the 7 days following the camp. The incomplete primary immunisation rates and underweight rates for under-five attending the camps were very low (0.01%, 3.17% and 8.3% underweight and 1.5%, 0% and 23% of incomplete immunisation in Camp A, B and C respectively) suggesting that the true at risk population was probably not reached.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the widely used drugs available as over the counter for treatment of acid-related gastrointestinal disorders. Concerns have been raised about the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) with the prolonged use of PPIs. This meta-analysis aims to determine the association between PPI use and risk of developing CKD.
Methods
The methodology complies with our registered protocol at PROSPERO (CRD42016040073). PubMed and Embase were searched from inception to 27th September 2017. Two reviewers independently screened and selected the observational studies comparing CKD outcome in patients on PPI. The quality of selected studies was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were also performed. All the analysis was performed by using RevMan v5.3.
Results
The 6 included studies comprised of 4 cohorts and 2 case-control studies with 720758 patients from cohort and 84078 patients from the case-control study. All the studies were of highest quality. Overall pooled relative risk (RR) of developing CKD was 1.32(95% CI 1.19 to 1.46), (p-value=<0.00001) and for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) RR was 1.88 (95% CI: 1.71 to 2.07), (p=<0.00001) in patients receiving PPI. The higher incidence of CKD was seen in diabetic patients taking PPI with RR of 1.82 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.72), (p-value=0.004).
Conclusion
An association between proton pump inhibitor use and risk of developing chronic kidney disease and ESRD was found in the study."

India’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) in North 24 Parganas District of West Bengal reported outbreaks of acute diarrhoeal diseases (ADD) during 2010-2014 without laboratory confirmation. Hence, we described the surveillance system and evaluated in terms of selected surveillance attributes: simplicity, acceptability, timeliness of reporting of ADD/outbreaks, representativeness, positive predictive value, usefulness.
Methods
We described the surveillance through review of documents, manuals, records and interview of surveillance staff. For evaluation of the surveillance system, cross sectional study was conducted among 95 sampled Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), 22 Block Medical Officers (BMOHs) of the District and also abstracted data from records. We developed indicators for surveillance attributes and computed proportions for the same. We computed descriptive statistics for timeliness of reporting.
Results
Seventeen percent (n=15) of first ANMs and six of nineteen medical officers had correct knowledge on ADD case definition. One-fourth of the ANMs reported lack of communication, training, supervision and lack of feedback in preceding six months. Median time taken to intimate district rapid response team (RRT) and to collect specimen from the date of first case reporting was the same day of reporting of index case (Range: 0–2days vs. 0–3 days) during ADD outbreaks in 2014. Of the five reported ADD outbreaks in 2014, one was laboratory confirmed.
Conclusions
Knowledge regarding case definition was poor at all level of health workers. Existing supervision and feedback mechanism needs to be improved. Timeliness of reporting to district RRT and specimen collection during outbreak had improved overtime."

The current study aims to clustering different types of disability in Kermanshah Province and determine its predictive causes.
Methods
The statistical population of this cross-sectional study includes all the households living in rural and urban areas of Kermanshah Province in western Iran. Using multi-stage cluster sampling, 10150 households were selected from July to December of 2017 based on the population share of each city district. The required data were obtained using a 13-item questionnaire developed by the research team. The obtained data were analyzed using two-step cluster analysis, chi-square test, and multinomial logistic regression analysis.
Results
This model suggested five clusters including (i) geographically scattered subjects with mental abnormalities, (ii) geographically scattered subjects with physical motor abnormalities, (iii) non-eastern subjects with multiple abnormalities, (iv) non-northern subjects with multiple abnormalities, and (v) geographically scattered subjects with visual-auditory abnormalities. Multinomial logistic regression emphasized the significance of some causes of disability, particularly head trauma and trauma caused by car accidents (P < 0.05). There was a significant difference among the clusters with regard to socio-demographic variables (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
The eastern areas of Kermanshah province are facing a larger number of mental disorders caused by mother's disease during pregnancy and cousin marriages. Other major causes of disability include head trauma and trauma caused by car accidents. In western areas, physical-motor disability is more frequent, and in central areas, visual-auditory abnormalities are more prevalent."

Iran is considered as one of the most important endemic foci of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) worldwide. Recently, sporadic cases of CL have been reported in some parts of Mazandaran Province, northern Iran. This study aims to determine the clinical and epidemiological aspects of CL, for the first time, in this area.
Methods
All CL cases registered during 2009–2016 were entered into this descriptive study. Required data was collected from the portal of surveillance system in excel format and entered into SPSS Version 16 software and described as percent frequency, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. The analysis was performed using Chi square and independent T tests.
Results
During 2009–2016, 343 subjects were entered into the study. Among investigated patients, 72.6% were male and 87.8% had history of travelling. Mean age of patients was 30.7 years and 21.6% of whom were reported in November while 18.4% were identified in October. The lesions were found in upper limb (39.7%), lower limb (25.7%) and face (6.4%). Of them, 37.3% had one lesion and 22.4% had two lesions. There were no significant difference in the mean age of men and women (p = 0.648) as well as number of lesions in both genders (p = 0.190).
Conclusion
Our results showed that the most CL cases in the studied area were aged 15–44 most of which had history of recent travelling to endemic areas.

Elder abuse (abuse/violence/neglect or disrespect as defined by BKPAI data) among elderly is a deserted and overlooked issue especially in developing countries including India.
Aim
To assess the elder abuse and its association with socio-demographic factors among elderly population.
Materials and Methods
This study comprises data from BKPAI 2011. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis have been used for the following study.
Results
A total of 9852 elderly people were included in this study which was carried out in seven states of India. The mean age of the study subjects was 68.04±7.29 years. Among 9852 elderly people 10% (987) were faced elder abuse. In unadjusted odd-ratio the status of elder abuse was found statistically significant with state, type of residence, sex, age group, caste, education, marital status, migration status, occupation, health condition and economic dependency etc. But in binary logistic regression analysis state, type of residence, sex, education, caste and their migration status were found statistically significant with elder abuse.
Conclusion
From the result of this study, the existence of “violence”, “neglect”, and “disrespect” within the society and community is approved. The problems of abuse among older persons were more mental than physical and elderly at getting older, without partner, with bad health condition, having less money or with no security are on more risk of getting abused."

Studying the impact of economic crisis on healthcare resources is important because the economic crisis is an important socio-economic determinant of healthcare resources and is strongly linked to a number of health outcomes. We aimed to examine the impact of the economic crisis on healthcare resources in the Eastern Mediterranean countries of World Health Organization (WHO).
Methods
In this study, health expenditure per capita was considered as the indicator of healthcare resources and the unemployment rate was assumed as a proxy of economic crisis. Hausman test showed that to perform the analysis it is required to use a random effect panel data model from 2005 to 2013. The data were taken from the World Bank database and the calculations were performed using the statistical software STATA 12.
Results
The results showed that the unemployment rate and out-of-pocket payment (OOP) had a strong relationship with healthcare resources. So, a 1% increase in unemployment rate leads a $ 138 decrease in health expenditure per capita and a 1% increase in OOP is accompanied with a $ 12 decrease in health expenditure per capita (p-value<0.01). In this regard, countries having an unemployment rate more than 5% and OOP more than 25% indicate $ 260 health expenditure per capita less than countries with OOP less than 25% and an unemployment rate less than 5%.
Conclusions
The findings imply that during the economic crisis there is a decrease in healthcare resources for Eastern Mediterranean countries. In this connection, the unemployment rate and OPP are important predictors of healthcare resources."

abstract = "Background
The study investigates the pharmaceutical care concept to optimize drug therapy, minimize drug related problems and thereby improving health related quality of life (HRQoL) of stroke patients. Since stroke is a major health problem that negatively affects the patient’s quality of life, it is relevant to the current pharmaceutical care scenario in a developing country like India. HRQoL related to stroke and life satisfaction after stroke is the important healthcare measures.
Methodology
Prospective interventional study conducted among inpatients of neurology department in a tertiary care referral hospital. 128 Patients with TIA/ischemic stroke were allocated to intervention group and control group (64 in each group). Pharmaceutical care was provided to the patients in the intervention group. SF-36 questionnaire was administered to both control group and interventional group to evaluate the patient’s HRQoL. Adherence to entire therapy and antithrombotic therapy in both control group and intervention group were assessed using Morisky Medication Adherence Scales MMAS-8.
Results
Prevalence of ischemic stroke was more compared to hemorrhagic stroke. During the study, the intervention group showed high adherence to overall therapy than the control group. With an intensified pharmaceutical care, improvement in the HRQoL was observed in intervention group and was manifested in subscales and summary measures of SF-36.
Conclusion
The study enables demonstration and application of a pharmaceutical care program among stroke patients to prevent complications to improve HRQoL. This study indicates that pharmaceutical care can be performed in both hospital and community settings as it provides more benefit and positive impact on patient’HRQoL."

There are promising applications of 4D printing in the medical field. The need is to identify the research status and explore where this new set of technologies effectively can be deployed.
Methods
Research articles till September 2018 are searched from Scopus by keywords as “4D printing” and “4D printing""medical" and undertaken a bibliometric analysis of the identified papers. Further relevant papers were studied for application in the medical field.
Results
Search through Scopus identified 171 research articles on 4D printing and 13 research articles on 4D printing in the medical field. This study states that 4D printing is the latest technology that creates innovation and addresses complex medical problems. Paper briefly describes the 4D printing and details its difference from 3D printing technology. We have identified five steps to be used to create a medical model by using this technology and its prospective implementation for medical applications. Identified that research is carried out on 4D printing, but decidedly less publication is available in the medical field reporting the application of this technology. Finally, we have identified nine significant applications of 4D printing in the medical field. The main limitation is that it requires extensive investment & support for transformation.
Conclusions
4D printing is to provide benefits to medical practitioners especially in the areas not covered by 3D printing technologies. 4D printing helps to create a 3D physical object by adding smart material layer by layer through computer-operated computer-aided design (CAD) data. It adds a dimension of transformation over time where printed products are sensitive to parameters like temperature, humidity, time etc. This technology can provide extensive support in the medical field, especially with better and smart medical implants, tools and devices. Now doctors and researchers can explore with 4D printing technology to provide better service to the patient."

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is among the leading causes of death in children under 5years of age worldwide. In India 15% of child mortality is due to CAP.
Aim and objectives
To enumerate direct and indirect medical expenditures and out of pocket expenditure incurred by parents and to calculate spending burden ratio (SBR) in hospitalized children of severe CAP under 5years of age.
Methodology
Prospective observational study conducted in a tertiary care, teaching hospital in India from September 2015 to August 2016 in children aged 1 month to 59 months hospitalized for WHO defined severe CAP. Included were cases treated on any of the following four regimens in first 48h of admission: Amoxicillin-clavulanate(AC) only, Amoxycillin-clavulanate(AC) with aminoglycoside(A), 3rd generation cephalosporin(3GC) only and 3rd generation cephalosporin plus vancomycin (3GC+V). Clinical and expenditure data was abstracted from hospital chart review and from expenditure diary maintained by parents. SBR was calculated by dividing out of pocket expenditure by mean monthly income of family.
Results
Out of 100 CAP patients recruited (66% were <12months of age), distribution by antibiotic regime was as follows: AC 14(14%), AC+A 42 (42%), 3GC 18(18%) and 3GC+V 26(26%). History of prior use of antibiotic was present in 78% AC, 62% AC+A, 83% 3GC and 92% 3GC+V regime. Total mean direct expenditure of 100 cases was INR 10381(SD=7954) of which 72% was incurred as expenditure on drugs and hospital charges. Mean direct medical expenditures was least in AC regime INR 6772(SD=4808) which was 57% of family’s mean monthly income and most in 3GC+V regime, INR 17088(SD=9387) being 260% of mean monthly income (p value <0.01). Mean indirect expenditure was similar in all regimes. SBR in AC regime was 0.39, in AC+A regime was 0.36, in 3GC regime was 0.55 and in 3GC+V regime was 1.01. (1 USD=65 INR)
Conclusion
In hospitalized children with CAP, Direct medical expenditure is driven by expenses on drugs and hospital charges.Therefore, reducing these would reduce total medical expenditure and thus financial burden on families of uninsured patients."

Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies in women. Early diagnosis of BC and metastasis among the patients based on an accurate system can increase survival of the patients to >86%. This study aimed to compare the performance of six machine learning techniques two traditional methods for the prediction of BC survival and metastasis.
Methods
We used a dataset that include the records of 550 breast cancer patients. Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Least-square SVM (LSSVM) and Adabag, Logistic Regression (LR) and Linear Discriminant Analysis were used for the prediction of breast cancer survival and metastasis. The performance of the used techniques was evaluated with sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio and total accuracy.
Results
Out of 550 patients, 83.4% were alive and 85% did not experience metastasis. In prediction of survival, the average specificity of all techniques was ≥94% and the SVM and LDA have greater sensitivity (73%) in comparison to other techniques. The greater total accuracy (93%) belonged to the SVM and LDA. For metastasis prediction, the RF had the highest specificity (98%), the NB had highest sensitivity (36%) and the LR and LDA had the highest total accuracy (86%).
Conclusions
Our finding showed that the SVM outperformed other machine learning methods in prediction of survival of the patients in terms of several criteria. Nevertheless, the LDA technique as a classical method showed similar performance."

The objective of this study was to estimate the proportion of Staphylococcus aureus carriers among the health care personnel in General Surgery and Orthopaedics Departments of Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram and also to estimate the proportion of methicillin resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among them.
Methods
All the health care personnel in General Surgery and Orthopaedics Departments of Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, who were willing to take part in the study and gave consent were recruited. A semi structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Nasal swabs from both nostrils and hand impression specimens from both hands were obtained and cultured on blood agar and MacConkey agar plates for detection of Staphylococcus aureus, followed by antibiotic sensitivity testing. MRSA was confirmed with Hichrome agar.
Results
Out of the 341 subjects, 125 (36.7%) tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus, and 10 (2.93%) tested positive for MRSA. All 10 study participants were from the surgery department.
Conclusion
More than one-third of the healthcare personnel were found to be carriers of Staphylococcus aureus. The prevalence of 2.93% of healthcare personnel being carriers of MRSA is a cause of concern. The causes of personnel from only one department being found to be carriers, need to be evaluated further for finding the determinants of such carrier state."

Design
The body mass index (BMI) data of both men and women of six states and India for the year 1992–2011 was collected from the publicly available reports of National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) and for 2014–15 was taken from National Family and Health Survey –IV (NFHS-IV). The data for monthly per capita expenditure was extracted from national sample survey (NSS) reports. The 25-year historical BMI prevalence data between 1991–92 and 2014 were tested for linear, quadratic and cubic trends. The analysis was done using STATA.
Settings
Data for six states of India and pooled estimate of India was collected and analyzed.
Main findings
All states show a decline trend in underweight and increase trend in overweight/obesity. The pooled estimates for India reports though the trend of underweight is declining in both men and women still it is above 20% and after 20years the prevalence will be 10%. The trend test for overweight/obesity was found to be significant at P value<0.05 in all the six states and India in both the sex.
Conclusion
The regional variances in prevalence of the nutrition among rural Indians and suggests state specific nutritional policy should be developed for double burden of nutrition."

abstract = "Background
Breast carcinoma is one of the commonest cancer in women accounting for major health burden worldwide. Metabolic syndrome is a known risk factor of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) as well as breast carcinoma. APRI (Aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index), a known non-invasive marker of liver fibrosis and steatohepatitis has never been studied in patients of metabolic syndrome with breast carcinoma. Breast carcinoma has various modifiable risk factors such as obesity and alcohol consumption. Hence, we compared APRI score in patients with breast carcinoma in order to establish a possible correlation.
Aims and Objectives
Our primary objective was to study APRI (Aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index) score in patients of breast carcinoma with and without metabolic syndrome. The secondary objective was to study APRI score in post-menopausal women with breast carcinoma.
Material and Method
This prospective observational study included 151 patients of breast carcinoma, these patients were sub grouped into two, with and without metabolic syndrome and pre and post-menopausal women. Multiple demographic and biochemical parameters including APRI score were studied in these groups. The sensitivity and specificity of APRI score was calculated in these groups.
Results
A total of 151 patients of breast carcinoma were included in the study group.53.64% patients with breast carcinoma had metabolic syndrome. The mean values of AST (Aspartate aminotransferase), BMI (Body mass index), FBS (Fasting blood sugar) and APRI score were significantly higher in the patients with metabolic syndrome. More than 50% patients of breast carcinoma belonged to the post-menopausal age group. Mean values of AST (aspartate aminotransferase), BMI (body mass index), FBS (fasting blood sugar) and APRI were higher in this group. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve of APRI score of metabolic syndrome patients was 0.93 and that of post-menopausal women was 0.82.
Conclusion
APRI score can be used as a surrogate marker of metabolic syndrome in patients with breast carcinoma. It is also useful in planning preventive strategies in patients with breast carcinoma especially in post-menopausal age group."

To evaluate potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) and potential prescribing omission (PPO) among hospitalized geriatric patients using STOPP and START criteria respectively, to study morbidity and drug use pattern and to collect feedback from the physicians to improve rational drug therapy.
Method
OLOGY: A prospective observational study was carried out for a period of 12 months among patients aged ≥65 years. The study was conducted in three phases. During first phase, the patient's data were recorded in data collection form and analyzed using STOPP/START criteria. During second phase, the results of first phase were introduced to the physicians along with the criteria and feedback form. During third phase, the prescriptions were re-assessed to determine the acceptance of criteria.
Results
A total of 210 patients were included in the study during the entire study period with 108 patients in first phase and 102 patients in third phase. The prevalence of PIM detected using STOPP criteria during first and third phase were 43.5% and 40.2% respectively. Similarly the prevalence of PPO detected using START criteria during first and third phase were 52.8% and 53.9% respectively.
Conclusion
The study shows that there is high prevalence of PIM and PPO among hospitalized geriatric patients which are unacceptable and there should be consensus for considering such evidence based screening tools while prescribing drugs to elder peoples."

As in all developing countries, there could be a large number of stroke cases that can be prevented provided that individuals at risk are recognized. We aim to develop a score for screening individuals at risk of stroke in the Lebanese population.
Methods
A hospital-based case-control study was conducted for the score generation. Data were collected through a designed data collection sheet at two Lebanese tertiary hospitals between January 1st, 2012 and December 31st, 2014. A logistic regression determined the association of stroke risk factors with stroke, and the rounded coefficients generated the Risk of Stroke Score (ROSS). Another case-control study was conducted for the score validation. Data were collected through a standardized questionnaire at five different Lebanese tertiary hospitals between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2016. ROSS was validated by comparing it to hospitals final diagnosis.
Results
ROSS was constructed with good properties, comprising 10 items. The area under the curve was high at 0.869 (0.838–0.899; p<0.001). A score <2 points indicated a 94.4% high negative predictive value of stroke. A score >10 points had more than 85.4% positive predictive value of stroke. In the validation study, ROSS had an area under the curve of 0.826 (0.790–0.863; p<0.05), 88.7% negative prediction value and 96.2% positive prediction value.
Conclusion
It is highly recommended to use the ROSS, particularly in the primary care setting, as a good assessment tool to predict stroke among high-risk people and encourage them to get involved in intervention programs to prevent this disease."

abstract = "Objective
Foreign-origin street children are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS mainly due to poverty, violence, early sexual activity and poor access to health care services. This study aimed to highlight the effectiveness of peer education intervention to reduce HIV-risky behavior among street children with Afghan nationality.
Methods
Sixty-one street children were stratified by sex and then randomly allocated to either an intervention or control group by assigning each participant computerized random numbers. The intervention provided peer education services, focused on mode of disease transmission, prevention approaches and awareness of HIV/AIDS services by peers.
Results
At least 80% of participants in the intervention and control groups completed the study period, respectively. At the end of the study, statistically significant increase of knowledge and attitude improvement as well as a decreased tendency to do risky sexual intercourse among the intervention subjects was shown. Moreover, there was a time intervention interaction for knowledge and attitude improvements followed by intervention (interaction p value=0.001), while it was not significant for risky sexual behavior (interaction p value=0.44).
Conclusion
Peer education was an effective and easy-to-apply educational method that increased knowledge and improved attitudes about HIV/AIDS among foreign-origin street children, while it was less efficient with regard to long-term reduction in risky sexual behavior."

abstract = "Background
The phenomenon of Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (DRTB) has been evolving aggressively and is posing great threat to tuberculosis control programs worldwide. But what really is fueling drug resistance in high disease burden countries apart from other well known risk factors, with this intent in mind the present study was developed and carried out to. The aim was to capture the presence of Fluoroquinolone (FQ) mono-resistance among drug-sensitive TB cases.
Methods
A total of 1280 sputum smear-positive patients were enrolled in the study and were subjected for Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST) using First-Line Drugs (FLD's; Rifampicin, Streptomycin, Isoniazid and Ethambutol) using liquid culture DST and Line Probe Assay. These samples were further subjected to second-line drugs DST (ofloxacin and kanamycin) and DNA sequencing to confirm FQ mono-resistance.
Results
The occurrence of FQ mono-resistance among FLD sensitive cases was found to be 3.2% (35/1099). Xpert MTB/RIF assay and rpoB gene sequencing were showed 100% concordance with FLD DST. A total of 35 FQ mono-resistant isolates were further sequenced for gyrA, gyrB and rrs genes. The gene sequencing was found to be in agreement with the DST results for 34 (3.1%) isolates with gyrA and gyrB genes.
Conclusion
Presence of FQ resistance among drug sensitive TB cases is a red flag sign. The findings of the present study suggest that, second-line DST should be routinely performed not only for drug-resistant cases but also for drug-sensitive cases so as to capture prevailing true drug resistance at an initial stage."

Birth control is an important determinant of maternal survival. Contraceptive use helps the couple to have the desired number of children in the family as well as to practice the desired birth interval between pregnancies.
Objectives
(1) To study the choices of contraceptive method by working women following the first childbirth. (2) To study the factors influencing the decision making for the contraception by these working women.
Materials and methods
A community-based cross sectional study of 178 women from urban and rural parts was done using a semi-structured questionnaire at Udupi taluk, Karnataka. 30×7 cluster sampling technique was followed. Systematic random sampling was done to select total 30 clusters from urban and rural areas.
Results
It was shown that mean age of women was 29±3.516 years, husbands’ mean age was 33±4.711. Majority (74.7%) of the women were from rural area. Majority (99.4%) had knowledge of contraceptives but only 43% were practicing contraception. Majority (44.9%) were using copper T. Health concern (60.7%) was the major factor influencing decision making about family planning services. Majority (91.6%) couples took joint decision about contraception.
Conclusion
Although the awareness of contraceptives among working women was high, less than half of the women were practicing contraception. Copper T was used by the majority of working women. Fear of side-effects was the major concern among non-users of contraceptives. Decision making was based on the mutual discussion between the couple."

abstract = "Objective
The objective of this research article is to present a novel feature selection strategy for improving the classification performance over high dimensional data sets. Curse of dimensionality is the most serious downside of microarray data as it has more number of genes(features). This leads to discouraged computational stability. In microarray data analytics, identifying more relevant features required full attention. Most of the researchers applied two stage strategy for gene expression data analysis. In first stage, feature selection or feature extraction is employed as a preprocessing step to pinpoint more prominent features. In second stage, classification is applied using selected subset of features.
Method
In this research also we followed the same strategy. But, we tried to introduce a distributed feature selection(dfs) strategy using Symmetrical Uncertainty(SU) and Multi Layer Perceptron(MLP) by distributing across the multiple clusters. Each cluster is equipped with finite number of features in it. MLP is employed over each cluster, and based on the highest accuracy and lowest Root Mean Square error rate(RMS) dominant cluster is nominated.
Result
Classification accuracy with Ridor, Simple Cart (SC), KNN, SVM are measured by considering dominant cluster’s features. The performance of this cluster is compared with the traditional filter based ranking techniques like Information Gain(IG), Gain Ratio Attribute Evaluator(GRAE), Chi-Squared Attribute Evaluator (Chi). The proposed method is recorded approximately 57% success rate, 18% competitive rate against traditional methods after applying it over 7 well high dimensional and one lower dimension dataset.
Conclusion
The proposed methodology applied over very high dimensional microarry datasets. Using this method memory consumption will be reduced and classification performance can be improved."

Chronic pain is very common in Asian communities. It is a major cause of activity limitation and has a significant impact on individuals and society. One of the most common ailment for which patients seek for medical care is pain. This study was performed in the urban area to study the association of some of the modifiable risk factors of chronic pain.
Objective
To estimate the prevalence and associated risk factors of chronic pain among adults residing in the Urban area of Udupi Taluk in Karnataka, India.
Methods
The cross-sectional study included 360 participants of above 18 years of age. The participants were recruited using Simple Random Sampling technique from January 2017 to June 2017. Descriptive and analytical methods were used to estimate the prevalence and to identify the associated risk factors.
Results
It was observed during the study that prevalence of chronic pain for adults older than 18 years was 62%. Low back pain and knee pain were the common ailments reported. About 50% of those who reported chronic pain, had the complaint for more than 5 years and reported more than six in Visual analogue scale. The postural factors associated with chronic pain were lifting weight, bend trunk heavily during work, repetitive movement of neck, trunk and shoulder, lifting hand above shoulder level and experience of fall.
Conclusion
Present research revealed that higher prevalence of chronic musculoskeletal pain exists in the urban population of Udupi Taluk, which was influenced by repetition of same joint movement, trauma and depression irrespective of the other risk variables."

The purpose of this research work is to explore the patients’ perceptions and experiences of self-management of diabetes in the rural area of Pakistan and to better understand differences in diabetes self-management among men and women living with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as the barriers and challenges of self-management of diabetes.
Methods
30 participants were recruited from a medical centre at Al-Rehman hospital at Abbottabad, Pakistan. Qualitative method was used to conduct interviews of n=30 patients with Type 2 diabetes using a semi-structured interview approach with audio recording to explore their perceptions and experiences of the self-management of type 2 diabetes and the factors that influence the management of diabetes.
Results
The qualitative analyses revealed six themes: stigma attached to the disease; self-management in context; patient-doctor relationship; adherence to diet and exercise; access to diabetes resources; and social support. Women were more adaptable to diabetic conditions, disclosed their diabetes more readily and are a lot more ready to integrate management into their daily lives, whereas men were more reluctant to tell friends and family about their diabetes due to the stigma attached to the disease and were less observant of self-management practices in social settings. Women used socially interactive resources such as internet access and education classes whereas men relied more on self-directed learning and wanted the guidance of health professionals. Finally, both men and women reported lack of support from the health care practitioners and families in managing their diabetes.
Conclusions
The results of this qualitative research highlighted the challenges of diabetes self-management among men and women in the rural area of Pakistan and barriers to self-management. These findings may help to inform gender-sensitive diabetes self-management approach, diabetes awareness in the population, counselling and support."

Excluded were those illness of  ≥14 days, prior hospitalization for same illness and who were on anti-tubercular therapy and having fast breathing due to congenital heart disease.
Results
From August 2014 to July 2015, of 196 patients admitted, 152 were included of which 11 (7.2%) expired. On unconditional logistic regression analysis, controlling for abnormal sensorium, cyanosis, and severe acute malnutrition, platelet count <0.7lac/mm3 on admission predicted mortality (adjusted OR=10.7, p<0.03) and had good specificity (95.4%) but low sensitivity (45.5%).
Conclusion
Since low platelet count is an independent predictor of mortality in children with severe CAP, it must be estimated routinely in all cases."

Snakebite envenomation is a vital status necessitating immediate treatment following case detection. Many cases of snakebites are recorded every year due to the suitable climatic conditions for the existence and survival of snakes in south Iran.
Methods
In the present retrospective cross-sectional study, 195 snake (Reptilia: Squamata: Viperidae; Echis carinatus sochureki) bite cases referred to 10 rural health centers, two health care stations and the Haji-Abad Central Hospital of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences (HUMS) were surveyed during 2012–2016. Seasonal time series models were applied to fit a linear model to describe and predict the monthly trend of snakebite cases.
Results
Among these patients, males (70%, 136) from rural areas (79.5%, 155) were mostly recorded. The mean (±SD) age of victims was 33 (±17.0) years old and the most common age group was 20–29years (32%). Most snakebites took place outdoors (80%), on hands and legs (97%), and among unemployed people and farmers (61.0%). Snakebites often happened between midnight and 6 am (32%); also 51% of them occurred during summer. Most (70%) patients had pain at the bite sites. The location of being bitten (indoors or outdoors) had a significant difference with patient’s sex (χ2=7.764, P=0.021).
Conclusions
Time series analysis proposed a mixed seasonal autoregressive moving average, ARMA (1,0)×(1,1)12 as the best process for the monthly trend of snakebite and to predict the incidence of snakebites. Local residents should be more cautious on snakebites during warm seasons."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is strongly associated with dyslipidemia. Rosuvastatin exhibits greater efficacy in the treatment of dyslipidemia as compared to other statins, so we aimed to explore its effect on NAFLD patients.
Methods
We conducted a prospective observational study (6-month) to evaluate NAFLD patients with dyslipidemia receiving rosuvastatin with hypocaloric diet (N=81) or hypocaloric diet alone (N=114). Using propensity score matching, patients (N=76) were divided into two equal groups. Serum levels of periostin, adiponectin, TNF α and IL-6 were determined using ELISA kits; hepatic steatosis was evaluated by ultrasound; hepatic fibrosis was assessed by NAFLD fibrosis and BARD scores at 0 and 6 months, and liver enzymes were assessed at 0, 2, 4, 6 months of study treatment.
Results
Rosuvastatin, in addition to hypocaloric diet diminished hepatic steatosis (p=0.011); decreased serum periostin (p=0.003), TNF α (p=0.012), IL-6 levels (p=0.010); increased serum adiponectin levels (p=0.028), and improved NFS, BARD scores (p>0.05). Alteration in grades of hepatic steatosis were found significantly correlated with change in serum levels of periostin (rs=0.256, p=0.025) and adiponectin (rs=0.282, p=0.014), while association was insignificant with the changes in serum TNF-α (rs=0.148, p=0.202) and IL-6 levels (rs=0.127, p=0.274).
Conclusion
Treatment with rosuvastatin, in addition to the hypocaloric diet, resulted in a significant decrease in serum periostin levels; ameliorated grades of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis scores, indicating that rosuvastatin, in addition to hypocaloric diet may be effective treatment for NAFLD with dyslipidemia."

Malnutrition in infancy contributes to high mortality and morbidity. In India, government has established nutrition rehabilitation centres for managing children with severe acute malnutrition. The study was conducted with aim to understand how community perceived malnutrition and how child's size at birth, infant and young child feeding related behaviours and child's illness were associated with decline in the child's growth or health.
Methods
Qualitative research employing focused ethnographic methodologies was used. From February–December 2016, cases studies and in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 mothers of malnourished children <24 months of age (cases), purposively recruited from nutrition rehabilitation centre of 3 districts in Uttar Pradesh, North India. Twenty-four mothers of gender and age matched well-nourished controls from village of cases were also interviewed. Focus group discussion was done with community health workers from villages of cases. Data were coded and after analysis and data triangulation, emerging concepts were grouped into core themes linked with malnutrition.
Results
Grounded on experience of participants, emerging themes were that importance of exclusive breastfeeding was neither understood nor emphasized, there was no concept of complementary feeding, family food lacked diversity, malnutrition was not recognised as a health hazard, and there was lack of autonomy of females in reproductive and general health issues.
Conclusion
Given these paths to malnutrition in infancy, there is an urgent need to create community awareness about malnutrition as a disease as well as about optimal breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices in infancy by using innovative behaviour change communication strategies."

Conclusion
The bibliometric analysis shows that there is an increasing trend in the research work undertaken in 3D scanning application in the medical field, this also explains future potential and contribution. Corporate are exploring 3D scanning for commercial medical applications along with part analysis & designs before the actual production. It helps to create efficient implants easily and quickly. In this paper, we have summarised 3D scanning applications for medical purposes. This technology helps to produce medical implant according to the required specification. It is used for the accurate measuring of patient's body shape, size and skin surface area or an individual part of the body. In medical, data varies from patient to patient, so for producing a 3D digital image, 3D scanning technologies are used which provide digital 3D models. We can obtain improved patient treatment through the integration of digital models with Virtual Reality and Holographic techniques. The significant limitation of this technology is that it can only scan the outer surface of the body or part/model."

Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is a simple and cost-effective intervention for the promotion of child health and survival. The purpose of the study was to assess the prevalence of exclusive breast feeding (EBF) practices and its determinants among slum women.
Methods
A cross sectional study was carried out in the year 2015–16 among 160 mothers having infants aged 6–12 months residing in slum areas of Bhubaneswar, India. Multi-stage, cluster sampling technique was used to select the study population. Exclusive breastfeeding practice was the dependent variable and all relevant information was collected using a semi-structured schedule. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors significantly associated (p < 0.05) with EBF practice.
Results
Only 21.2% women were exclusively breast feeding their children for six months. After adjustment for confounders, multivariable analysis revealed that being housewife (adjusted OR [aOR]: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.39–5.19); smaller family size (aOR: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.42–5.08); ≥3 antenatal visits (aOR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.19–4.76); and ≥3 postnatal visits (aOR: 3.12, 95% CI: 1.41–6.67) were the independent predictors of EBF practice among study participants.
Conclusions
Prevalence of EBF practice is very low in slums of Bhubaneswar. Creating breastfeeding enabling working environment for working women, placing more emphasis on smaller family size, and regular antenatal and postnatal visits could be helpful for promotion of EBF practice among slum women."

Purpose
The children and their mothers were given an opportunity to express their perspectives about the disability and its impact on the daily life of the child.
Method
OLOGY: 12 children (6–15 years) and their mothers were enrolled between January to June 2017. In-depth interviews were conducted to know the experiences and perspectives of children with congenital hand differences and their mothers. Transcribed verbatim of interviews were analyzed by manual coding followed by thematic analysis.
Results
Children expressed that they performed most of their daily activities with partial or minimal involvement of their parents. They exercised a certain degree of independence in meeting their self-care needs by adapting to the disability and reported that they were cared and supported by family members. Although these children encountered stigma from society, they were able to cope with the situation by accepting their disability with positive support from their parents. Majority of mothers and children reported that the surgical intervention has improved the physical functioning of hand. All the participants reported that they did not depend on any orthosis for daily activities. The orthosis provided were only to retain the correction of their deformities and was used mostly as a night splint.
Conclusion
Children with congenital hand differences were capable of independent living and showed positive coping towards the societal stigma. Surgical treatment has improved the function and confidence of their children as stated by their mothers."

The pathophysiology of severe dengue is related to increased capillary permeability and plasma leakage into extracellular space. A simple, low cost risk prediction tool for plasma leakage will be useful for clinicians practicing in rural areas without imaging facilities.
Study design
A prospective observational study was carried out over 12 months at the National Hospital, Sri Lanka enrolling patients with confirmed diagnosis (via NS1 antigen testing) of early dengue infection. Clinical features on admission and investigation results on D3, D5 and D7 of the illness were recorded. Evidence of plasma leakage was confirmed by ultrasonography.
Results
A total of 179 patients met the inclusion criteria (males; 91, 50.8%, mean age: 31.6 years, SD ± 14.7). Sixty seven patients (67/173, 38.7%) had ultrasonographic evidence of plasma leakage. Several clinical features (severe vomiting, severe diarrhoea, abdominal pain and liver tenderness) as well as mean differences of some investigations were significantly associated with progression to plasma leakage. However, only liver tenderness on day 3 emerged as independent significant predictors of critical phase in the adjusted analysis (specificity: 93%, sensitivity: 44%).
Conclusions
Having liver tenderness by day 3 of the illness is helpful to identify a subgroup of patients at risk of plasma leakage."

The objective of current study is to increase the classification accuracy of learning algorithms over cardiotocography data by applying preprocessing technique. Due to the diversity of sources, large amount of data is being generated and also has various problems including mislabeled data, missing values, noise, high dimensionality and imbalanced class labels.
Method
In this study, we suggested a technique to handle imbalanced data to increase the classification performance of various lazy learners, rule based induction models and tree based models. We used Symmetric Minority Over Sampling Technique (SMOTE) on real dataset to accelerate the performance of various classifiers. We identified that primary dataset is suffering with imbalanced problem, which means the most of the records belong to same class label. Prediction of imbalanced data is biased towards the class with majority instances. To overcome this problem, dataset has to be balanced.
Results
As a result of the suggested method the performance of classification algorithms are increased. The obtained result show that majority of classification techniques performed better over balanced dataset when compared with imbalanced dataset.
Conclusion
Classification performance over balanced dataset has recorded improved performance than imbalanced dataset after applying the SMOTE."

The main objective is to map different facial expression to the movement of the wheelchair.
Methods
The headset used for this purpose comprises of an EEG cap which has a total of 16 electrodes connected out of which 14 electrodes are used for acquiring data and the rest 2 are used as ground and reference. To operate the wheelchair the subject has to place the cap on his/her head and different facial expressions (clench, smile, blink, etc.) are performed. The movement of muscles around the face due to facial expressions can be observed from the EEG signals being recorded. Each expression is linked to movement of the wheelchair. Signal is preprocessed to remove the artifacts and then features are extracted using Fast Fourier Transform. In this paper, for classification we have used state-of-the-art machine learning technique which is a slight variation of Extreme Learning Machine called as Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine abbreviated as OS-ELM.

abstract = "Background
Mumps are known to occur in Zambia, but outbreaks are rare. Here we report on a recent mumps outbreak, between January and September, 2015.
Objective
The study was to verify the existence and extent of mumps outbreak in Copperbelt province; to describe the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak; to identify risk factors associated with the illness; to confirm the etiology of the outbreak through appropriate laboratory testing; to inform disease control strategy and advocate for mumps, measles and rubella vaccine in Zambia, which has not yet been implemented.
Study design
A case report. Clinical records of cases suspected of mumps in the district were reviewed. Cases covered the first 36 weeks of 2015 (January to September, 2015). Charts were generated to capture the epidemic curve. Detailed analysis using data from Luanshya was carried, by calculating relative risk for the demographic factors and place of residence.
Results
Between week 1 and 36 of 2015, a total of 1651 cases of mumps were reported. The primary case was a four year old male child, and was diagnosed in the first week of January. Week 14 and 19 reported the highest number of cases, but the cases plateaued in week 33. Laboratory analysis provided a test positivity rate of 70%. Most cases (71%) were children aged between 1 and 9 years of age. This group was at least 3 times higher at risk than those <20 years.
Conclusion
Several factors may have contributed to the emergence of mumps outbreaks including intense exposures, overwhelming protection offered by the vaccine, combined with non-optimal vaccine coverage, low immunogenicity and waning immunity. It is therefore recommended that, first, continued surveillance be maintained so that cases are identified, contacts are traced, and inform implementation of appropriate infection control measures. Second, continued Information, Education and Communication (IEC) on good hygiene practices, modes of transmission and risk factors in schools and other public places is recommended. Third, there is need to establish local emergency health services linking schools and health facilities. Furthermore, health authorities should make concerted efforts to enable diagnostic tests for mumps within the country, while at the same time we advocate for Measles, Mumps & Rubella (MMR) vaccine in Zambia."

With the increase in widening role of women, need for family planning and contraceptive use is ever increasing. Healthy reproductive and sexual health for many women is still a dream in Northeast India. Bulk of women are unaware about morbidity associated with the contraceptive use as the service providers usually do not provide information on side-effects to the user thus women suffer silently, which ultimately may lead to severe health consequences.
Objectives
Present study aims to understand the pattern of contraceptive use and morbidity associated with it.
Methods
Present study uses District Level Household and Facility Survey 2012-2013 (DLHS-4) data of seven North-eastern states of India. Only the currently married women (CMW) who are usual resident and not pregnant are retained. Hence a sample of 30,670 CMW are kept for assessing contraceptive use, subsequently 7,825 CMW are filtered for understanding contraceptive morbidity. Statistical technique like Cramer’s V and Phi test, and logistic regression are used for the analysis.
Results
Result shows that the percentage of using modern contraceptive method was highest in Sikkim and lowest in Meghalaya. Key findings of the present study are that women with higher parity, having information about side effects and belonging to non-tribal community are more likely to report having contraceptive morbidity, whereas it is opposite for the users of modern spacing methods
Conclusion
Higher parity women in particular should be provided information about proper use and side-effects of modern contraceptives, so that they can make an informed choice of contraception and lead a healthy life."

There is a need to identify the contemporary level of adoption of 3D scanning technology in the dental area. This structured literature review based research first tries to identify different types of scanning technologies and then the necessary steps as used to create a design and manufacture dental implant using the 3 D scanning. A large number of the relevant research papers on 3D scanning applications in dentistry are identified through Scopus and analysed using bibliometrics. This analysis indicates towards an increasing trend of research on 3D scanning applications in the field of dentistry. Different applications of this technology are discussed in the context of dentistry and observed that this technology create innovation in dental products for a dentistry lab. The dentist can take advantages of this technology towards designing custom teeth, crown, braces, dentures, veneers and aligner. 3D digital models also support teaching in dental education for better understanding and practice of the teeth anatomy. Along with the scanning of the complete denture of the patient, direct printing of the same is done by using AM technology produces denture which directly fits the mouth of the patient.

To assess the prevalence, morbidity and treatment seeking behavior amongst children aged 5–15 years, suffering from allergic conjunctivitis.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was done in a semiurban low-income community in Chandigarh, India. Children of age group 5–15 years, having allergic conjunctivitis were identified by systematic random sampling technique. A survey proforma and an interview schedule was used to gather information on socio demographic profile and data pertaining to allergic conjunctivitis and related morbidities among the study subjects. Intensity of symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis was also assessed using proforma and an observation checklist.
Results
A total of 217 subjects were enrolled. Prevalence of allergic conjunctivitis was 12.22%. Occurrence was more in males (13.44%) than females (10.71%). Itching and frequent eye rubbing were the commonly reported symptoms. Dust (35%) was the most common precipitating factor and perennial conjunctivitis was more common (54.8%). Reported co-morbidities included allergic rhinitis / hay fever (23.9%), dermatitis (9.7%) and asthma (0.5%). Only 44% subjects had sought treatment from a doctor; and barely 11% completed their treatment.
Conclusions
Allergic conjunctivitis has a high prevalence among children but is frequently overlooked. Inspite of its frequency, treatment seeking behavior is low amongst the affected population. Identification of patients and their appropriate treatment is important to improve the ophthalmic health of the community."

Despite enough evidence available supporting temporal relation between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and overt DM, former has earned less attention while managing current diabetes epidemic. This calls for a community-based ‘Life-cycle approach’ that could employ mutually-linked interventions specific to GDM prevention at various stages of life cycle by utilizing involving already existing Indian health system.
Methods
Freely accessible, full-text articles published between 1990 and 2018, available in PubMed and Google Scholar in English language, pertaining to GDM risk factors and its preventive strategies were reviewed using combination of medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords.
Results
GDM prevention begins right from pre-pregnancy phase. Adoption of a healthy lifestyle, mass awareness of risk factors, early identification and prompt referral are key to avert pre-GDM development. During pregnancy, government of India (GoI) mandates universal GDM screening for all Indian pregnant women, avoiding any undiagnosed/untreated GDM woman, thus preventing occurrence of complications including overt DM. Those screened GDM positive are more likely to develop overt DM throughout postpartum. During postpartum, American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends postpartum diabetes screening for all women with GDM, by employing two h 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and HbA1C prior to and beyond three months postpartum, respectively.
Conclusions
Promotion and practice of life-cycle approach would be key to curb overall diabetes incidence."

Malaria is one of the most prevalent diseases in urban areas. Malaria flourishes in sub-tropical countries and affect the public health. The impact is very high, where health monitoring facilities are very limited. To minimize the impact of malaria population in sub-tropical domains, a suitable disease prediction model is required. The objective of this study is to determine the malaria abundances using clinical and environmental variables with Big Data on the geographical location of Khammam district, Telanagana, India.
Methods
Prediction model is based on the data collected from primary health centres of department of vector borne diseases (DVBD) of Khammam district and satellite data such as rain fall, relative humidity, temperature and vegetation taken for the time period of 1995–2014. In this study, we test the efficacy of the artificial neural network (ANN) for mosquito abundance prediction. Prediction model was developed for the period of 2015 using a feed forward neural network and compared with the observed values.
Results and conclusions
The results vary from area to area based on clinical variables and rainfall in the prediction model corresponding to areas. The average error of the prediction model ranges from 18% to 117%. Clinical data such as number of patients treated with symptoms and without symptoms can improve the prediction level when combined with environmental variables. We perform preliminary findings of malaria abundances by collecting clinical big data across different seasons. Further, more exploration is required in prediction of malaria using big data to improve the accuracy in real practice. In this manuscript, we perform some preliminary findings of malaria abundances by collecting larger data across different seasons. Till today, many models have been developed to examine the malaria prediction with different approaches, but malaria prediction with environmental and clinical data is a new approach with big data analysis."

Diabetic foot infections (DFI) are common complications among diabetics. These wounds can cause discomfort and often become infected. In India, currently there is a paucity of data on patient adherence towards antibiotic use in DFIs. Therefore, this study was aimed to evaluate antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, antimicrobial therapy and its adherence in DFI patients.
Method
A prospective observation study (N = 150, newly diagnosed DFI patients) was conducted in Kasturba hospital, Manipal over a period of 6 months. Culture and Sensitivity pattern of the microbes of the patients were obtained from hospital data management system to develop cumulative antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. Medication adherence was measured by using Culig adherence scale at the first follow-up visit.
Results
The most common microbes were Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (23.9%), Klebsiella pneumonia (13.3%) and Escherichia coli (13.3%). Inj. Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid 1.2 gm (28.6%) was highest prescribed empirical therapy in DFI's followed by Inj. Cefuroxime-Sulbactam 2.25 gm (14.6%), Ceftriaxone (0.7%) and Trimethoprim- Sulfamethoxazole (2%) was the most sensitive antibiotic. Cumulative antimicrobial susceptibility pattern shows Chloramphenicol, Colistin, Levofloxacin, Rifampicin has developed resistance towards most of the common organisms in DFI. Statistically significant association was observed between empirical therapy with T.Cefuroxime 625 mg and improved clinical outcomes (p < 0.001).

abstract = "Background
The Antenatal care and institutional delivery to improve maternal and child health is the prime focus of the time. India, with its large economic diversity, the health care utilization may depend on type of service provider i.e. public or private. The present study estimates the trends in the utilization of public and private maternal health care services and the associated socio-demographic factors, the major focus being Antenatal care and skilled delivery.
Methodology
The present population based cross-sectional analysis is performed on the secondary data of India from three rounds of District Level Household Survey (DLHS) conducted in 1998–99, 2002–04 and 2007–08. Indicators for maternal health care utilization are based on full antenatal check up (FANC) as defined by RCH program and skilled institutional delivery attendance (SID) as defined by WHO by the mode of service provider (Public vs Private). Multinomial logistic regression was used for statistical analysis by considering these indicators as the outcome variables treating various socio-demographic factors as independent variables.
Result
The urban area, other than SC/ST caste, higher wealth index and more than 10 years of mother’s & father’s education have high proportion of maternal health care utilization. Lower parent’s education have shown lower relative risk ratio of FANC and SID accessibility throughout the survey periods. Wealth indices as a factor of FANC and SID are observed higher in private sectors as compared to public sectors during second and third survey. Women with more pregnancy related problem have chosen private sector for their institutional delivery during all the survey periods. Maternal health programme related initiatives such as when health worker visit for antenatal care and women counselled to go for institutional delivery have shown improvement in terms of accessibility.
Conclusion
This study used multinomial logistic regression which attempts to integrate the different socio-economic and demographic factors as well as maternal health related program initiatives by mode of service provider. The analysis strongly brings out the preference for public sector and private sector for seeking maternal services mainly depends on the various socio-economic characterises. Program initiatives clearly demonstrate that accessibility is higher for public sector. However,the improvement in the public sector is stagnating beyond a point across India. Public-private partnership needs to be explored by keeping in mind that the efforts are to be directed more for deprived section of the society."

abstract = "Background
Cancer is an important health issue. According to the WHO report, globally, cervical cancer comprises 12% of all cancers in women and it is the leading gynaecological malignancy in the world. In many developing countries, it is the most common cancer among women where 85% of the estimated 493 000 new cases and 273 000 deaths in 2002 occurred worldwide.
Objectives
1. To study the association between cervical cancer and parity. 2. To study the association between cervical cancer and other selected exposure variables
Settings and design
A hospital based case-control study was conducted in Shirdi Sai Baba Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Manipal, Udupi District
Methods and material
A total of 273 participants (91 cases and 182 controls) were included. Information on demographics, habits, reproductive history, sexual history and menstrual history was taken using a semi-structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis used: Data was analysed using SPSS version 15. Univariate and Multivariate logistic regression was used to find out the association between the outcome and exposure variables. Results are expressed in odds ratio.
Results
Marital status (married) is an important risk factor for cervical cancer, OR=2.98 (1.23–7.20). People having history of alcohol use were at 4.55 (1.17–17.73) times at risk of developing cervical cancer when compared to those who did not use alcohol. Age at menarche of 13–14years was found to be a significant risk factor of cervical cancer with OR of 2.91(1.18–7.20). Age at 1st coitus of <18years had an odds ratio of 5.44(2.73–6.38) and was significantly associated. At least one abortion is an important risk factor with odds of 2.61 (1.70–18.96). Also, adjusted odds ratio for parity of 3–5 was 3.16 (1.12–8.91) and 5.57 (1.70–18.96) for women having ≥6 parity when compared to women having parity of less than 3 and was statistically significant.
Conclusions
The study showed that marital status, history of alcohol use, <18 years of age at first coitus, age at menarche and parity of >3 as risk factors of cervical cancer"

Scanty evidence is available on association of multimorbidity with frailty in younger adults. We aimed to investigate the frailty among 40 years or more aged population, it's association with multimorbidity and healthcare utilization.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was done among patients aged ≥40 years attending two randomly selected primary-care centers in Odisha, India using validated tools. Associated factors were identified using multivariate regression.
Results
Out of 364 people contacted, 320 agreed to participate in the study having mean age of 53.39 years. More than 36% of the study participants were frail. Higher frailty was reported among 60 years or older people (78%), whereas, nearly 40% people aged less than 60 years were prefrail. Nearly 50% of multimorbid people (≥3 chronic diseases) were frail. According to multivariate regression, a unit rise in chronic condition count increases the odds of frailty by 3 and 4.5 times in the age group <60 and ≥ 60 years, respectively. After adjusting for other variables, frailty was found to be strongly associated with outpatient visits (Adjusted exp (β coeff): 1.03) whereas, medicine intake count was inversely related.
Conclusion
Frailty and multimorbidity are associated not only among elderly but also in middle aged population. Also, frailty increases the frequency of hospital visits. Thus, attempt should be made to identify frailty in middle age population."

abstract = "Background
We aimed to compare the treatments of esophageal cancer in association with the risk of disease recurrence, and to compare the frequentist and Bayesian methods in data analysis.
Methods
Web of Science, Medline, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE were searched. We assessed statistical heterogeneity, and the assumption of consistency was assessed using loop-specific and design-by-treatment interaction methods. The Markov chain Monte Carlo method was used to obtain the pooled estimates of effect size in the Bayesian approach. The random effect model was used to report the pooled Risk Ratios (RR). The results of this study were reported with 95% Confidence Interval (CI), and Credible interval (CrI).
Results
We included 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported the local recurrence of esophageal cancer. The RR of local recurrence for surgery plus paclitaxel, cisplatin, and radiotherapy (SPCRT) compared to surgery alone was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.88). The RR for SPCRT compared with surgery plus cisplatin and vindesine (SCV) was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.12, 1.18). Compared to cisplatin, fluorouracil, and radiotherapy plus surgery (CFRTS), SPCRT was a better treatment (RR=0.46, 95% CI: 0.17, 1.24).
Conclusions
This network meta-analysis indicated that SPCRT compared to surgery alone and other treatments was a better treatment. In terms of ranking, SPCRT and radiotherapy plus surgery (RTS) were the first and second treatments in the network. It seems the precision of frequentist is better than Bayesian approach, however, the results of the ranking of treatments were same in both frequentist and Bayesian approaches."

Factors associated with risk with leaving hospital against medical advice (AMA) in neurology patients is unknown.
Objective
To determine prospectively, the association of gender, age, religion, care type received, economic status and prognosis of the neurology patients, with the discharge AMA (DAMA) and correlate them with the reasons for DAMA cited by the patients or their relatives.
Material and Methods
In-patients who left AMA between the year 2013 and 2016 (n=689), were prospectively included in the study. Determinants of DAMA and the factors associated with DAMA within eight hours of admission (AMAe; n=177) were analysed. A pre-AMA questionnaire was completed by those who left AMA after 8hours (AMAd; n=512).
Results
Higher odds of AMA were associated with female gender (OR:1.48), age beyond 50years (OR:1.35) and admission to intensive care (OR:2.59). Financial constraint was cited as reason of AMAd by the patients with low income (OR:1.72). Higher odds of association of influence of a first degree relative in the decision of AMAd were found in women (OR: 1.33) and persons more than 50years (OR: 2.95).
Discussion
Women and person older than 50years had higher risk of DAMA, mostly due to the influence of a first-degree relative. The risk of leaving AMA was significant in those admitted in the neurological intensive care unit. Of all cited reasons of leaving AMA, financial constraint was most significant.
Conclusion
The study provides an insight into the factors for associated with risk of DAMA from neurology wards."

Successful treatment is an essential aspect of tuberculosis (TB) elimination and prevention against drug resistance. The loss to follow up, and treatment failure is the main causes of poor treatment outcome. To prevent these causes from hindering successful treatment of TB patient and increase adherence to treatment, Community Based Directly Observed Treatment Short course (CB DOTS) program are being promoted. This study aims to compare programmatic treatment outcome for all new TB cases registered in Community Based DOTS and Facility-Based DOTS (FB DOTS) program in districts of Nepal.
Methodology
Analysis of secondary data was carried out to document the outcome of TB patients registered in 2015-16 in terms of success, loss to follow up, treatment failure, and death for CB DOTS in eleven districts of Nepal using publicly available data. Each CB DOTS district was then matched with 11 FB DOTS district to compare the outcomes. The selection was based on pre-decided criteria like districts from similar geographies, population, and same ecology.
Finding
Districts in which community-based DOTS was implemented showed better median treatment success rate (92.88%) than facility-based DOTS implemented districts (89.84%) (p = 0.02). The median loss to follow up the rate of community-based DOTS implemented districts (0.92%) was better than the median loss to follow uprate of facility-based DOTS implemented districts (2.967%) (p = 0.02).
Conclusion
Compared to the Facility-Based DOTS, Community Based DOTS approach was found to be more effective in terms of treatment outcome and adherence to treatment. Community-based treatment is a patient-centered approach for tuberculosis treatment and is found to be more useful to achieve high treatment success rate in countries like Nepal that have rough terrain and limited connectivity to some regions."

Depressed neonates born through meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) are at high risk for developing meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Benefits and risk of endotracheal suctioning in non-vigorous infants at birth, though widely practiced till recent have not been established.
Objectives
To evaluate effect of endotracheal suctioning at birth on incidence of MAS, its severity and outcome among non-vigorous MSAF born infants.
Methods
This randomized open level trial was conducted over one year period at a tertiary care teaching hospital. 155 non-vigorous infants (vigour assessed within 5–10s of birth) were randomized to receive either endotracheal (ET) suctioning just after birth (n=76) or no-endotracheal suction (n=79). Subsequent resuscitation was performed as per neonatal resuscitation guideline. All infants were admitted for subsequent care and monitoring. Antenatal, intrapartum, and neonatal details; respiratory support; complications, hospital stay and outcome were recorded.
Results
Incidence of respiratory distress due to MAS (with consistent chest radiology) was 41.3% and 57.1% [OR=0.53(0.28to 1.01); p=0.052], while non-MAS respiratory distress was 33.3% and 27.3% [OR=1.69(0.81 to 3.54); p=0.17] in ET suction and no-ET suction group, respectively. Severity of MAS in ET suction vs. no-ET suction group were mild:16.1%(5/31)vs15.9%(7/44); moderate:61.3%(19/31)vs65.9%(29/44) and severe:22.6%(7/31)vs18.2% (8/44). Respiratory support requirement including mechanical ventilation; its duration, and mortality were similar in both groups, however, hospital stay was shorter in ET suction group (9.91±3.22vs. 11.17±3.73days; mean diff:−1.26(−3.36 to −0.17); p=0.024).
Conclusions
Endotracheal suctioning at birth in non-vigorous infants born through MSAF tends to decrease the incidence of MAS and duration of hospital stay, however, overall incidence of respiratory distress and mortality remain unchanged."

A randomized clinical trial to examine the levels of body mass index, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure and glycemic control using multi-modality strategies among adults with type 2 diabetes.
Methods
A randomized control trial (RCT), two-arm, prospective, and an interventional was designed with an intervention group (IG) and a control group (CG) using stratified block randomization and triple-blinding. Adults with T2D (N = 200) were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG, n = 100) and a control group (CG, n = 100) in a single site trial. The adults with T2D in the IG were exposed to multi-modality strategies using an animated digital video, motivational interviewing, telephone counseling and the structured diabetes education by the diabetes nurse educator. Adults in the CG were only exposed to the structured diabetes education. Body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood pressure (BP), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured as primary outcomes.
Results
The adults with T2D in the IG had significant improvements in the HbA1c (2.4%), BMI (2.8 kg/m2), and a FBG (1.8 mmol/L); and they achieved lower HbA1c levels compared to the CG.
Conclusion
Multi-modality strategies were effective for lowering HbA1c and reducing BMI among adults with T2D. Implications. Integration of cognitive behavioural educational using multi-modality strategies promoted better primary outcomes among adults with T2D."

Methodology
A prospective intervention study of 12 months duration was conducted among 180 geriatric patients who were on treatment with antibiotics for more than 2 days. The outcome measures were compliance with Gyssens criteria and National guidelines for antimicrobial use 1.0(2016). Reason for inappropriateness and quality indicators were also assessed to optimize the antibiotic use and to develop adult traffic light signal for antibiotics.
Results
The mean stay duration was found to be 7.52 ± 4.47 days, reduced to 4.93 ± 1.72 days in after intervention. Most of indication for antibiotics was respiratory tract infections (30.6%). In the pre intervention, 70% antibiotic therapy proved inappropriate which reduced to 48.8% inappropriateness in the post intervention (p = 0.004). Most common reason given for inappropriateness was wrong drug duration (pre: 41.2%, post: 27.8%). There was a poor compliance with the national guidelines for antibiotic use in the pre intervention (15%) which increased to 25.6% in post intervention. Most of the therapy was given prophylactically and only 30.55% ordered bacteriological test before starting treatment.
Conclusion
The study concluded that prescribing patterns do not comply with the recommended standards of care. Since the intervention has a positive impact on inappropriateness the hospital should develop a system to monitor and regulate the use of antibiotics in geriatrics to promote the rational use of antibiotics."

Methods
A cross-sectional study was used from June to July 2018. We surveyed 300 patients visiting a hospital emergency department in Tehran, Iran. Data were collected via open-ended questionnaire in a face to face interview. We asked them about the maximum amount of money they were willing to pay for improvement of hypothetical health status using contingent valuation method. Determinant factors on willingness to pay was calculated through a regression model. Data were analyzed on STATA version 13.
Results
The mean of willingness to pay increases with worsening health status. The average of private willingness to pay for improvement from first and last health status were $ 101 and $ 714 respectively. The average of altruistic willingness to pay for improvement from first and last health status were $ 74 and $ 231 respectively. The mean of willingness to pay was influenced by household monthly income (P < 0.01). Age, sex, marital status and education don't have significant associations with willingness to pay.
Conclusions
Our study findings show that all people are willing to pay for improvement from health status and The WTP amount is higher for those who have higher incomes. This information may be useful for health policy maker in the decision-making process."

End-stage Renal Disease is considered a health problem due to the high prevalence and economic burden on society and the health system. This study utilizes a cost-utility analysis to evaluate the costs and outcomes of the Iranian End Stage Renal Disease patients.
Methods
A Markov model-based economic evaluation with a societal perspective, and a lifetime horizon performed to quantify the costs and health-related outcomes in terms of QALY. Direct medical costs obtained from hospital billing and medical records and direct non-medical costs, and indirect costs derived from interviews with patients. Three policy options, the hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation were compared. Most of the Transplants from deceased and rest were from Live Related Donors. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to study uncertainty.
Results
Annual average cost of hemodialysis is $13477 cost of peritoneal dialysis is $12865, and cost of Transplantation is $16450.The Transplantation arm gained 9.43 QALY compared with peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis with 6.95 and 6.04 QALY respectively. When Transplantation was compared with peritoneal dialysis, Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio was $1744 per QALY. ICER value suggests that Transplantation is cost-effective compared with peritoneal dialysis at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $12,400, and hemodialysis was dominated.
Conclusion
This study suggests that kidney transplantation is a better option over hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. We conclude that serious efforts ought to be made to foster potential brain-dead donors and altruistic kidney donation and promote peritoneal dialysis as a superior alternative to hemodialysis for eligible patients."

abstract = "Background
Substance use – defined by the consumption of alcohol, smoking, and smokeless tobacco - has been identified as a serious health hazard in India. Understanding the socioeconomic correlates of substance use in Northeast India (NEI) will provide crucial input for public health policies in this region.
Objectives
To examine the socioeconomic correlates of substance consumption among male adults of NEI.
Data and methods
We analyzed nationally representative data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) 2015–2016. We examined the prevalence and frequency of smoking, using smokeless tobacco products, alcohol consumption, and other substance use among 14,555 men in the 15 to 54-year age group. We carried out binary logistic regressions to investigate the socioeconomic correlates of substance use among male adults in NEI.
Results
Substance use was significantly higher among the male adults of NEI than among those from elsewhere in the country (any substance i.e. smoking, smokeless tobacco and alcohol use in India: 50.03% vs. NEI: 70.83%). The frequency of smoking and alcohol consumption is also higher in NEI compared to the rest of the country. In total, there are about 10.2 million substance users, of which 6.7 million are from the state of Assam. About 44.38% of adolescents (aged between 15 and 19) use at least one type of substance. Substance use plateaus in the 25 to 49 age group before beginning to decline among users aged between 50 and 54 years. The likelihood of substance use goes down with increasing education and wealth in NEI. Among social groups, Scheduled Tribe adults have the highest likelihood of using any substance.
Conclusion
The intensity of substance consumption in NEI is very high. These unhealthy behaviors are more prevalent among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. This calls for intensive research to better understand the dynamics of substance availability and use in NEI. Furthermore, strong policy measures are needed to reduce substance use among vulnerable groups."

abstract = "Background
The cephalosporins are a large group of related β-lactam antimicrobial agents with broad spectrum of activity. Drug Utilization and Evaluation (DUE) is an ongoing, structured process to analyse the pattern of drug administration in various practice settings, including hospitals in relation to guidelines or predetermined standards thereby promoting the appropriate and effective use of drugs.
Methods
This prospective interventional study was conducted for a duration of six months among the in-patients of various departments of a multispecialty hospital located in Kerala, India. Cephalosporins were evaluated.
Results
Study conducted over a period of 6 months revealed that most of the therapy was definite 45% (n = 120) followed by empirical 32% (n = 85) and the least type was prophylactic 23% (n = 62) (ᵡ2 = 16.965, d.f = 2, p < 0.0010). Inappropriate use of cephalosporins were noted in 30 out of 267 cases (11.2%). Among these majority 93% (n = 28) were wrong drug selection followed with wrong days of therapy and failure of de-escalation, 3.33% (n = 1) each. In 13% (n = 8) cases, drug was given beyond the actual duration. De-escalation was not done in 4% (n = 3) cases and in 8% (n = 5) cases the treatment was done against the culture and sensitivity pattern. The most common drug used in combination with cephalosporins was metronidazole (36%).
Conclusion
Extensive use of third generation cephalosporin was observed in the study with facts and figures revealing their inappropriate use. This climaxes the need of continuous educational intervention by clinical pharmacist along with the modification of hospital antibiotic policy."

abstract = "Background
The Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) as a major threat to public health is the most important infectious pandemic of the late 20th and the early 21st centuries across the globe. This study aimed to assess the status of health service utilization provided by the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Iran from 1987 to 2016.
Methods
Samples were 30516 patients with HIV/AIDS from 31 Iranian provinces registered in the Iranian health database from 1987 to October 2016. Health care services provided by the MOHME were assessed in terms of age, gender, and the marital status. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis and the significance level was set as P < 0.05.
Results
Out of 30516 patients with HIV/AIDS in the age group of 35–44 years, 83.58% (n = 25506) were male and 41.52% (n = 12670). The highest coverage of health care services provided to these patients included the laboratory test of the cluster of differentiation 4 cells count (CD4), the latest status of tuberculosis (TB), Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) diagnostic test, and treatment using Antiretroviral drug (ARV). However, the coverage other health care services was very low. We found that there was a statistically significant association between gender, age and the marital status, and receiving health care services. There was a strong correlation between the gender of a woman and cut the last TB regime (OR: 2.54 P < 0.001).
Conclusions
While the process of providing health care services to such patients has improved in recent years, it is far from the expected level and the overall coverage is very low. Planning for the appropriate supply and distribution of Health Care Workers (HCWs) and specialized facilities, provision of drugs, continuous education of HCWs, improvement of registration and reporting of HIV/AIDS can enhance the provision of healthcare services to these patients."

Traditional medicines have been used for different ailments in the dominant modern healthcare, and also as a complement to it. Though it serves as an important healthcare services but is often underestimated. Therefore, the potential contribution of traditional medicine in healthcare needs to be explored, harnessed and promoted.
Objectives
First, this paper attempts to assess users’ outcome measures of Euroquol 5 Dimension of traditional medicine using paretian classification of health change. Second, to analyze the determinants and interdependence of disease and type of healthcare.
Methods
Primary data was collected from Dimapur district, Nagaland during March–July 2014 from 540 households and statistical techniques like Bivariate probit analysis was used.
Results
Paretian classification of health change found 27% of the respondents has ‘improved’ their health status after using traditional medicine, but 45% had also ‘mix change’ in health status. Bivariate probit analysis shows significant result among older age groups that are more likely to suffer from non-communicable diseases. The longer the duration of disease, the more likely to use traditional medicine and for non-communicable diseases the probability of using traditional medicine was higher as compared to allopathic medicine.
Conclusion
Demand for traditional medicine is evident and it does contribute in providing healthcare. Thus, from the stakeholders, efforts for proper conservation, validation and documentation is necessary for promotion and development of indigenous medicine. Hence reducing the burden of healthcare expenditure among the communities and also sustain the rich cultural practices of traditional medicine."

Cultural belief and individual's perception play an important role in acceptance of modern family planning method, more so among tribal communities. It is important to understand the prevailing beliefs and practices among tribal as well as their felt and unmet needs to address existing gaps and improve family planning services for them.
Methods
Total 32 in-depth interviews and eight focus group discussions were conducted among service providers and the tribal eligible couples respectively from April to June 2017 in six villages of Anandpur block in Keonjhar district, Odisha to explore about tribals' beliefs and cultural practice on marriage and childbirth, barriers and challenges in adopting family planning methods and their practices to address unwanted pregnancies. Data were analysed thematically using content analysis method.
Results
The most prevalent barriers for accepting permanent family planning method were their cultural practice to ban woman acceptor from worshiping God, fear of unable to provide sexual satisfaction to their partner that may cause remarriage of their spouse. Non availability of contraceptives with front line health workers was an important factor for its non adherence. Low affordability and lack of easy access to public health facilities during any reproductive health related complications make tribal consult local traditional healers.
Conclusions
Round the clock availability of contraceptives with front-line health providers along with continuous behavioural change communication involving male partners and local influential persons will improve family planning service among tribal."

Present study has compared methods of synthesizing the pooled effect estimate under meta-analysis, namely Fixed Effect Method (FEM), Random Effects Method (REM) and a recently proposed Weighted Least Square (WLS) method.
Methods
Three methods of estimating pooled effect estimates under meta-analysis were compared on the basis of coverage probability and width of confidence interval. These methods were compared for seven outcomes with varying heterogeneity and sample size using real data of systematic review comparing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with adjuvant chemotherapy involving ‘hazard ratio’ and ‘risk ratio’ as effect size.
Results
WLS method was found to be superior to FEM having higher coverage probability in case of heterogeneity. Further, WLS with similar coverage probability was found to be superior to REM with more precise confidence interval.
Conclusion
Unrestricted WLS method needs to be preferred unconditionally over fixed effect method and random effects method."

This paper aims to classify the Pima Indians diabetes dataset with better accuracy and other evaluation metrics. The Deep Neural Network (DNN) framework will help to diagnose the patient in an effective way with higher accuracy.
Method
In this approach, we proposed a Deep Neural Network framework for diabetes data classification using stacked autoencoders. Features are extracted from the dataset using stacked autoencoders and the dataset is classified using softmax layer. Also, fine tuning of the network is done using backpropagation in supervised fashion with the training dataset. However, the medical diagnosis involves the risk factors of wrong prediction; hence we have used evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, specificity and F1 - score for the evaluation of our model and have achieved better results.
Results
The proposed framework is experimented on Pima Indians Diabetes data which has 768 patient records with 8 attributes for each record. We achieved classification accuracy of 86.26%.
Conclusion
A stacked autoencoders based Deep Learning framework for classification of Type 2 Diabetes data is proposed in this paper. This approach is experimented on UCI machine learning data and proved the outperformance over various existing classification methods."

The Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) model is a commonly used method to study death as the outcome of therapeutic effect. However, death may occur due to other causes not as the direct therapeutic effect. Death due to other causes is known as competing risks (CR). The conventional strategy is to handle the CR inflated death data with the stratified CPH model. However, it reduces the power of the data analysis. It is important to establish a model that can handle the CR without stratifying the data. This paper is devoted to developing the CR model.
Objective
Develop a statistical model that can handle death data analysis without stratifying in the presence of CR.
Methods
Statistical methodology is established to deal with CR. The Bayesian Inference is considered to overcome the computational difficulties. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was used to run the model. Model is illustrated for lung adenocarcinoma patient's data. The arm wise comparison on adenocarcinoma treated patients is performed. The computation of the competing risk model is performed in open source software OpenBugs.
Results
The proposed method helps to obtain the posterior estimates of different covariates with credible intervals. The posterior mean (SD) estimate helps to decide the best effective treatment through survival analysis in presences of CR.
Conclusions
This work is helped to work with CR data without stratifying it. It provides flexibility to analyze death data with CR by Bayesian."

Exclusive breast feeding (EBF) has important protective effects on the survival of infants and decreasing risk for many early-life diseases of children. The purpose of this study was to find the patterns or factors associated with exclusive breast feeding and its variation among 8 Empowered Action Group (EAG) states and Assam.
Materials and methods
The study utilized a secondary data source namely “Annual Health Survey (AHS) - 3” which covered nearly 4.3 million people from 8 EAG states and Assam. Exploratory factor analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficient were employed to identify the patterns or factors associated with exclusive breast feeding among 8 EAG states and Assam. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine how the factors which are significantly associated with EBF varied across the 9 states.
Results
The Exploratory Factor Analysis identified 5 factors namely demographic characteristics, mortality, age at marriage, population and fertility. Among these, demographic characteristics, mortality and age at marriage were significantly negatively correlated with the variable percentage of children (aged 6–35 months) exclusively breast fed for at least six months. One way analysis of variance showed that these 3 factors varied significantly across the 9 states.
Conclusion
In the light of high child mortality in these states, the finding of this study seems to be highly relevant for the health-care policy makers. The study points out at some indicators relating to demographic characteristics, child mortality and female age at marriage upon whose reduction is likely to bring about an improvement in exclusive breast feeding practice in the 9 concerned socio-economically backward states of India."

Unhealthy dietary scores have been associated with increased risk of Type 2 Diabetes mellitus, which have a significant impact on affected individuals and healthcare services. However, there is lack of published evidence on quality of diet in type 2 diabetic subjects. Therefore, we aimed to assess dietary pattern scores and their relationship with adiposity, glycemic profile, lipid parameters and nutritional biomarkers in T2DM patients.
Methods
We included T2DM patients (n = 203) with age group ranging from 30-70 years. All patients were interviewed for their dietary patterns through a derivative questionnaire of UK Diabetes and Diet Questionnaire (UKDDQ). Patient information including socio-demographic and anthropometric details were obtained. All biochemical parameters were estimated and recorded. The SPSS ver. 21 was used to perform statistical analysis.
Results
The study included 48.8% males and 51.2% females with mean age of 53.92 ± 10.56 years. The mean values of diet scores ranged from healthiest [1.02 ± 0.17(CI = 1.00 to 1.04)] to least healthy [2.65 ± 0.71(CI = 2.55 to 2.74)] respectively. Majority of patients (n = 153) were reported to have a habit of skipping breakfast routinely within 2 h after waking. However, 162 patients were consuming the unnecessary food items between the regular meals. While increasing in diet mean scores i.e. moving from lower quintile Q1(21.86 ± 1.23) to higher quintile Q5(28.94 ± 2.24), a variable relationship was found. The post prandial (PP2)(r = 0.233), fasting blood glucose (FBG) (r = 0.183), HbA1c(r = 0.253) and body mass index (BMI)(r = 0.139) shown a direct association whereas zinc(r = −0.116), vitamin D(r = −0.185) and Albumin(r = −0.043) were inversely correlated between the quintiles.
Conclusions
Increasing dietary scores are supposed to have a provoking effect on disease condition resulting into worse outcomes at higher scores. The findings from nutritional biomarkers suggested that deficiently found nutrients must be supplemented as a part of therapy to enhance the treatment benefits."

The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of self-report diabetes according to sociodemographic characteristics in participants of Ravansar Non-Communicable Diseases (RaNCD) cohort study.
Methods
The study population included 10182 adults (35–65 years old) participating in RaNCD. The ‘gold standard’ for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was taken as a history of relevant medicine use and/or measurement of fasting blood glucose indicating diabetes. Self-report data collected before the clinical examinations through interviews by well-trained staff. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were used to estimate the accuracy of self-report in diabetes.
Results
Of the 10182 individuals invited to participate in the RaNCD, 96 people were not willing to participate in the study (participation rate = 99.06%). The prevalence of diabetes by self-report and gold standard was 10.04% and 8.19% respectively. Among those who said they had diabetes, 389 (38.78%) did not have diabetes.

The negative outcomes like an increased risk of falling, anemia, immune dysregulation, impaired cognitive status, reduced muscle function, increased morbidity and mortality associated with malnutrition are believed to affect the economy of the country in the future years. In this backdrop, this study aims to evaluate the nutritional status and different risk factors associated with malnutrition among elderly patients at a tertiary care public teaching hospital.
Methods
This questionnaire-based study utilized the “Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form” tool to evaluate the nutritional status of elderly inpatients (aged 60 years or more). The data obtained from 235 participants reporting in the medicine department is presented. Based upon MNA-SF tool parameters, a well-determined score was obtained and on the basis of scores, the patients were categorized into “normal” (12–14), “at risk of malnutrition” (8–11 points) and “malnourished” (0–7 points). Multinomial logistic regression was performed to study the influence of different determinants on the nutritional status among elderly inpatients.
Results
The studied sample had a high frequency of 50.2% for the patients who are “at risk of malnutrition” and 46.4% of patients were “malnourished”. Based on the evaluated scores of MNA-SF tool, this study also confirms that the mobility functions, the decline in food intake and weight loss are major risk factors for malnutrition.
Conclusions
A very high prevalence of malnutrition was observed, in consonance with the previous reports. The findings also indicate that malnutrition is a multifactorial condition mostly associated with mobility dysfunction followed by somatic factors and socio-demographic factors. Further studies are required to map the risk factors in order to avoid the associated negative outcomes."

Paying attention to patient safety is a crucial aspect of the healthcare provision delivery. Integrating and coordinating the different parts of the health system can ensure a safe, high-quality and efficient care. Patient safety culture (PSC) is a broad, complex and multi-dimensional conceptual framework. In recent years, several studies have been conducted to evaluate PSC using the “Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture” (HSOPSC) tool. The aim of this study was to examine the level of PSC in Iranian hospitals.
Methods
ISI/Web of Sciences (WoS), PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO and Scopus as well as Iranian databases including MagIran and SID were searched from January 2000 to July 2018. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale checklist was used to assess the quality of the studies. The mean score of the participants' responses for each dimension of the questionnaire was calculated using the DerSimonian-Laird's random model with a 95% confidence interval.
Results
In the current systematic review and meta-analysis, 27 studies conducted between 2012 and 2017 were included. The participants were 9264. Low scores (in the range 37.79–65.43) were found, especially when compared to other countries such as Lebanon, Turkey and the USA.
Conclusion
Our results showed that in Iran the level of PSC is low and requires special attention from healthcare managers and providers. PSC should be a very important priority in Iran's health sector. Health decision- and policy-makers should pay particular attention to offering training programs to promote and develop PSC."

abstract = "Background
Intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) are confirmed as major public health problems, worldwide. Northern Iran is highly endemic area for such infections. This research aimed to study on the prevalence of IPIs among people referred to the health care centers in Mazandaran Province, Northern Iran.
Methods
In this descriptive cross-sectional survey, 984 stool samples were collected during 2015–2016. Fresh stool samples were collected from all individuals and examined by direct slide smear, formalin-ether concentration, trichrome and modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining techniques. The results were analyzed using SPSS version 16 and Chi-square test.
Results
Out of 984 participants, the overall prevalence of IPIs was 12.1% (95 CI, 11.4–12.7; 119/984). The prevalence of protozoa and helminthes infections were 7.9% (95 CI, 7.4–8.3; 109/984) and 5.3% (95 CI, 4.9%–5.5%; 69/984), respectively. The most prevalent protozoan IPs were include Giardia lamblia (3.3%), Entamoeba coli (2%), Blastocystis hominis (1.3%), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (1.1%), Entamoeba hartmanni (1.1%) and Cryptosporidium spp. (0.6%). Also major helminthic infections were include Trichostrongylus spp. (2.6%), Hookworms (1.7%), Strongyloides stercoralis (1.1%), Hymenolepis nana (0.6%) and Dicrocoelium dendriticum (0.6%). The results of the univariate analysis revealed that residence (rural being [P = 0.017]) and occupation (farmers [0.033]) were statistically significant risk factor for IPIs.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have found, despite persistent improvement in sanitary conditions over the recent years in northern part of Iran, IPIs are still among the main public health problems in this area. Moreover, helminths infection in our study were considerable. Thus, effective control programs are essential to reduce the incidence of IPIs."

The study aims to perform a cluster analysis on the mental health of patients at the cardiac rehabilitation (CR) baseline as well as attendance in sessions and to compare the mental health and healthy behaviors of the samples in an 18-month follow-up.
Methods
In the first phase of this longitudinal study, 148 CR patients in western Iran participated from January to April 2016. After completing the standard questionnaires, the participants attended 7–26 exercise sessions on average. Then, the cluster analysis was performed based on anxiety, depression, and the number of attended sessions. During the 18-month phone follow-up, 113 participants answered the other standard instruments. The long-term mental and behavioral consequences were compared among the derived clusters using ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc test.
Results
The average age of participants (69.9% male) was 59.3 ± 9.1. The analysis suggested three clusters: (i) patients with medium distress and weak participation, (ii) patients with mild distress and average participation, and (iii) patients with medium distress and good participation. While there was no significant difference among the clusters with regards to healthy behaviors and mortality rate, the difference was significant with regards to psychological distress, somatic symptoms, duration and quality of sleep, and general quality of life (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
Initial distress and weak participation of outpatients in CR has more severe long-term somatic and psychological consequences. Screening of increased psychological distress and identification of candidates for failure to adhere to CR at the baseline are considered among the most important responsibilities of the CR team."

Chikungunya is a vector-borne infection with high morbidity rate and associated with debilitating prolonged polyarthritis and substantial socioeconomic impact. On 4 January 2010, a chikungunya outbreak was reported in Sukadana Subdistrict, West Kalimantan, Indonesia.
Objective
An epidemiological investigation was conducted to identify the risk factors for the outbreak and recommend control measures.
Method
A case-control study was conducted to identify the risk factors of the outbreak. The cases were residents who had major clinical symptoms of chikungunya that were identified by active case finding through the affected area while controls were neighbor of the cases. Interviews were conducted to collect demographic and clinical data as well as the risk factors of infection. The venous blood from ten patients, selected randomly, were collected and tested for diagnosis confirmation.
Results
During 12 December 2009 and 10 January 2010, a total of 65 chikungunya cases were identified with no death. Seven out of ten blood samples were confirmed as chikungunya cases. All of the patients had fever, rash and arthralgia while headache was reported in 43% of the cases. The attack rate was 17.3% (range 3.9–22.6%) and those aged >44 year old had the highest attack rate. In multivariate model, those farming in the forest and those who had poor practices in eliminating mosquito breeding sites had higher odds of having chikungunya, with adjusted OR: 10.66 (95%CI: 3.95–28.79) and adjusted OR: 3.51 (95%CI: 1.35–9.13), respectively.
Conclusions
Farming in the forest and poor vectors control are two risk factor of chikungunya infection. Therefore, using anti-mosquito repellent when farming and continuous and coordinated mosquito breeding sites elimination are recommended."

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women worldwide as well as in United Arab Emirates (UAE). Improving awareness is an important aspect of BC control. Our study explored whether a community-based educational intervention was an effective approach for improving the awareness of BC and its screening procedures and promoting health behavior change.
Methods
The study was carried out as a pre-post-test design among 250 Arab women. Baseline awareness (pre-intervention) regarding BC and its screening procedures was assessed using a validated structured questionnaire adapted from the Breast Module of Cancer Awareness Measure. Educational intervention on BC was administered after baseline knowledge assessment. The impact of this intervention was evaluated through the post-intervention questionnaire after four weeks.
Results
Statistically significant improvement was observed in all the BC knowledge domains after the educational intervention. Highest percentage change in knowledge (56.4%) between pre- and post-intervention was seen for BC risk factors. Stratified analyses revealed that the intervention proved more beneficial to the women with no formal education as compared to those with formal education (mean difference: 7.27 ± 5.29; p = 0.001). Post-intervention the women were more positive towards medical help-seeking and acknowledged the fact that BC diagnosed early is more treatable (% change: 24.0, p < 0.001).
Conclusion
The community-based educational intervention, aimed at improving the knowledge of Arab women towards BC, proved to be effective in raising awareness of the study population. Further efforts are required to ascertain that this augmented awareness is retained in the long term and translated into required health behavior changes."

The objective of paper is to provide background information about the morbidity and hospitalization pattern in districts Kerala based on secondary data.
Methods
Using data from three rounds (52nd, 60th, and 71st) of National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO), the trend and pattern of self-reported morbidity were analysed across districts of Kerala. Descriptive analysis was carried out to understand the prevalence of self-reported morbidity variation over a period of two decades (1995–2014) and multivariate analysis was performed to identify the significant determinants of various types of self-reported morbidities and hospitalization.
Results
The results indicate that while infectious diseases and NCDs increased by six times, CVDs increased by nearly nine times, and disability increased by five times from 1995 to 2014. Age, sex and location emerged as significant determinant of morbidity, with the elderly, female and urban areas depicting higher levels. Levels of morbidity and hospitalization were higher in the Southern part of Kerala than in Northern Kerala.
Conclusions
The emerging pattern of high morbidity in Kerala warrants treatment and constant medical attention in primary and community level, especially among elderly person. There is a need for widened and sustained public health care system with affordable average cost of treatment for NCDs and CVDs at the primary level."

activity based costing (ABC) is an accounting method that allows organizations such as hospitals to determine costs based on the resources they consume. This method is a new and more effective cost system. In this study, ABC method was used for calculating cost price of radiology services in Beheshti hospital of Hamadan.
Method
This cross-sectional study was performed in 2015. The statistical population was the diagnostic imaging department of Beheshti hospital in Hamadan University of medical sciences. The required data was collected through information forms, and the price was calculated by using Activity-Based Costing model. To apply ABC method, the hospital was divided into several cost centers and five cost categories were defined: wage, equipment, space, material, and overhead costs. Then activity centers were defined.
Results
the highest costs were for human resources (65.2%) and the lowest ones for energy conduits costs (0.4%). According to the obtained results the total cost of the support sector in Beheshti Hospital during the study period was 64,091,093,852 IRR.
Conclusion
By utilizing ABC, hospital managers have a valuable accounting system that provides a true insight into the organizational costs of their department. The results of this study indicated that there are differences between the real price of radiology services and approved tariffs. Suggest until tariff amending, hospital commence to modify financial and personnel structures and repair its costs."

Objective
To assess the effect of alternate nostril breathing exercises (pranayama) on anxiety and pain among patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
Methods
A non-randomized controlled trial was adopted as study design and involved 48 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The experimental group (n = 24) received pranayama study intervention while the control group (n = 24) received routine care of the hospital. Outcomes were state anxiety and pain, measured with the state anxiety inventory and a visual analogue scale respectively. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 20.0. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to test the effect of the intervention.
Results
Study results showed that patients in the experimental group experienced a significant decrease in anxiety (p < 0.05) than the control group. There was a decrease in pain scores but was not statistically significant across different time point measurements at p < 0.05 between the groups.
Conclusion
These findings support the use of pranayama for decreasing anxiety among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, there is a need for randomized controlled trials with higher sample size to confirm this results. Future trials also should focus on the estimation of relevant biomarkers such as endorphins to understand the scientific rationale."

Every day 1374 road traffic accidents (RTAs) and 400 deaths take place in India. The number of deaths in RTAs would increase to 662 persons per day in 2030 and will not begin to decline until 2042, which is a serious public health concern.
Objectives
Present paper attempts to analyse the trends and patterns of RTAs in India during the year 2000–2015, and the patterns in the year 2015 in cities with population size 2 million or more.
Methods
Three years moving average is calculated to nullify the fluctuations in the data, exponential curve drawn to assess the pattern. Simple growth rate is calculated and absolute change found out to assess the difference between the year 2000 and 2015.
Results
The exponential growth rate curve of the number of RTAs shows upward trend during 2000–2015 in India. The spatial analysis of severity shows that there is no direct link between the number of accidents and the severity. The city-wise analysis of RTAs by the vehicle involved, age of the persons, cite, and timing of accidents shows a varying pattern across the cities.
Conclusions
The results suggest for city-based strategies to reduce the RTAs, injuries, and deaths, under the umbrella of national policy."

These outbreaks, along with poor diagnostic facilities, can lead to severe economic losses in a resource-limited country like Nepal. Diseases like avian influenza, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and rabies, that cause heavy socio-economic burden, have received huge attention of Government of Nepal and hence are among the top ten priority diseases. However, until now, scrub typhus is not considered a priority disease in Nepal, despite having severe outbreaks time to time. In order to diagnose and treat scrub typhus infection, low budget diagnostic tests such as Weil Felix are less efficient and poor in screening, and highly advanced & efficient tests are less likely to be available and are expensive. Nepal needs to explore appropriate and applicable test settings in primary health centers and referral laboratories in the country. Moreover, focus should be made on effective surveillance programs and public awareness campaigns, mice/rat control strategies, and improving sanitation, public health and hygiene measures for the people at most risk. In addition, health workers and professionals should be trained on early case detection, personal protection, proactive rodent control strategies, habitat destruction and good sanitation and hygiene practices."

Among consanguineous marriages (66% of the sample), 71% are in Sindh region followed by Baluchistan (70%) and Punjab (65%) in Pakistan and it ranges from 72 to 78% among the socioeconomically disadvantageous groups and in rural (71%) area. Multivariate results shows that the risk of child stunting (UOR = 1.52, CI = 1.31–1.67; AOR = 1.24, CI = 1.02–1.51) and child underweight (UOR = 1.59, CI = 1.34–1.89; AOR = 1.31, CI = 1.04–1.63) are higher among consanguineous marriage than non-consanguineous marriage.
Conclusion
The findings suggest that there is a relationship between consanguineous marriage and under nutrition children including stunting and underweight, even after controlling for other background characteristics of the CMW. Child health interventions for CMW need to provide tailored information on consanguineous marriages related awareness and programme."

Suicide is a conscious act in which the individual deliberately commit and unusual act with the intention of self-harm. The present study aims to examine some epidemiological factors affecting attempted and completed suicide rate during 2012–2016 in NajafAbad, a city in Isfahan province.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study. The subjects are 2138 cases involved in suicide attempt during 2012–2016 that gone to Montazeri and Al-Zahra hospital. Chi-square, logistic regression and Cochran–Armitage test was used for data analysis.
Result
Totally, 1385 (64.8%) patients were female and 47.8% were younger than 24 years of age. The most common method of suicide was medication overdose (91.1%). In multivariable analysis, male gender (OR: 2.67; CI 95% 1.53 to 4.64) was a risk factor for fatal suicide and application of chemical methods (OR: 0.018; CI 95% 0.010 to 0.032) was a protective factor. Results regarding completed suicide trend analysis shows that this trend has had a significant statistical difference in men (p = 0.019) but in women this trend doesn't statistically significant difference. (p = 0.209).
Conclusions
According to the findings of the present study, attempted and completed suicide rate in Najafabad is relatively high compared to other regions in Islamic Republic of Iran. The completed suicide rate was significant in men which achieved its greatest value in 2015. Suicide attempt rate didn't show a significant statistical difference in both men and women."

It is estimated that around 20–25% of world's adult population have metabolic syndrome. Moreover, the prevalence is also high among south Asians and Indians and about one third of the urban population in large cities has varying degrees of Metabolic Syndrome.5
Objectives
To study the prevalence among adults who are at risk of metabolic syndrome, gender difference of the same. To study the association of socio-demographic factors, family history and personal history, biochemical parameters, lifestyle addictions, dietary pattern and adequacy with the risk of metabolic syndrome.
Methodology
A descriptive study was undertaken in Udupi District, Karnataka, India in which a total of 420 adults (aged >20 years) from the general population were studied. Anthropometric measurement like height, weight, waist circumference, BMI waist hip ratio (WHR) was measured. Biochemical parameters like Blood Pressure, Fasting Glucose level, Post Prandial, HDL, LDL, TG, Triglyceride level from the existing records was recorded. Lifestyle addictions/habits like smoking, alcohol, Tobacco chewing and Drugs was assessed. Dietary assessment was done using 24-h recall in the diet software. Chi-square test, Correlation analysis and Paired t-test were used when appropriate using SPSS package.
Results and discussion
On the basis of metabolic syndrome risk assessment score of biochemical parameters, 50% of the samples are at moderate/at risk category, while 46.4% of the samples are at low/no risk and 3.6% of the samples showed the prevalence of metabolic syndrome. On the basis of lifestyle addiction, 73.1% of the samples were at moderate risk of metabolic syndrome while 13.8% were at high risk and 13.1% were at no/low risk of metabolic syndrome. This explains that more than 50% of the samples are at moderate risk group. The statistically significant risk factor for metabolic syndrome were females (p = 0.000), advancing age (p < 0.001, r = 0.270**), low SES class (p < 0.001,r = −0.129**), high Body mass index (BMI) waist hip ratio (WHR) waist circumference(WC) (p < 0.001,r = 0.340**), (p«0.001,r = 0.423**), (p < 0.001,r = 0.573**), Daily non-vegetarian pattern (p = 0.004) and coconut oil consumed (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
With urbanization and economic development, a nutritional transition characterized by improved dietary habits, improvements in socio-economic status and increasingly sedentary lifestyles have been observed which has contributed to the increasing prevalence of risk of metabolic syndrome among the population of Udupi, Karnataka."

Results
Searching keywords as "PEEK" "medical" through Scopus identified 426 research articles and searching “PEEK” “medical” “3D printing” identified ten articles. This study identifies that PEEK is a suitable material that helps innovation and helps to solve different surgical and medical problems. Analysis of the Scopus data depicts an increasing trend in the medical field, especially the application of this material. Much research is done on PEEK in medical, but there is very less work reported on PEEK 3D printing in medical. 3D PEEK implants are preferred in medical for requirements of extensive customisation. This technology caters well to the manufacturing of prosthetics, artificial bone, heart & its parts and other human parts. Finally, twelve important applications areas are identified in medical.
Conclusion
PEEK has somewhat bone like properties. This material can be well used in 3D printing technologies to help fulfil various challenges of the medical. In medical, PEEK materials foresee different surgical application as it can replace titanium and ceramic implants. The need is to explore the use of PEEK in different surgeries of orthopaedic, spine, maxilla-facial, cranial and others 3D printing manufactures complex design implants as per requirement of a patient with an exact match. This material is also applicable for cardiac surgery like manufacturing of heart valve prostheses and leaflet heart valves. PEEK material is hard, lightweight, stiff and is a robust polymer while having satisfactory wear properties that help implants with an extended life. In dentistry, PEEK implants have also the potential for use in tooth replacement.

High Blood Pressure (HBP) is a major health challenge of many around the world. Existing research covers extensively how to treat HBP, but predicting HBP in advance based on biological and psychological parameters of a person is not covered in the literature. The objective of this paper is to predict HBP based on Bio-Psychological factors of a person.
Methods
We proposed an intelligent Rule-based classifier to predict HBP. The proposed model can be used to prevent HBP rather than using medication. In our approach, we considered AAA++ (Age, Anger level, Anxiety level, Obesity level (+), Cholesterol level (+)) of a person for experimental study. The proposed approach uses priority-based apriori rule pruning (PARP) classifier, which works in 3 stages. Stage 1: generate association rules using apriori. Stage 2: it uses the priority of an attribute to prune the association rules generated in stage 1. Step 3: Rules extracted in stage 2 are used to build a rule-based classifier to predict the class label of test instances. The Results of the proposed model are compared with JRip, PART, OneR and, ZeroR.
Results
Experimentation is done on real-time data set using 10 fold cross-validations. In each fold, 90% data is used to train the model and 10% is used to test the model. The proposed approach has shown improved accuracy (86.4%) and reduced mean length of a rule (1.7) compared to existing rule-based algorithms. Although JRip is good at accuracy (86.9%), but the proposed model has outperformed at the mean length of the rule (1.7).
Conclusion
The extracted rules after experimentation are understandable and informative to the technical and nontechnical community to predict HBP."

The aim of this study is to explore the distribution of Legionella pneumophila (serogroups 1–6) in cold water taps across Alborz province, Karaj, Iran. In addition, some other non-fastidious gram-negative bacteria not belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family (GNB-NE) were followed.
Subject
A total of 162 water samples were collected from 6 countries and tested by culture and genus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The L. pneumophila isolates were subsequently analyzed by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for serogroup identification, molecularly by PCR, and sequencing for genetic diversity. The patterns of resistance to antibiotics were determined by disk diffusion.
Results
Fifteen (9.25%) samples were detected as positive for L. pneumophila by PCR and 12 (7.4%) samples yielded growth in culture. All isolates of L. pneumophila were belonged to serogroup 1. Fifteen GNB-NE species were isolated from the samples, including nine isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and six isolates of Acinetobacter spp. Antibiotic resistance was detected in 3 isolates of P. aeruginosa.
Conclusions
Despite the prevalence of L. pneumophila, few clinical cases have been reported, which may be due to underdiagnosis of the disease caused by it. Therefore, the prompt attention should be paid to do clinical diagnosis of legionellosis by the effective diagnostic tests from patients with compatible clinical symptoms."

In the absence of a comprehensive review, we conducted a systematic review on the use of systematic approach in outbreak investigation using reports from India.
Objectives
The primary objective was to estimate the proportion of outbreak reports from India during 2008–16, that reported the steps in outbreak investigation. The secondary objectives were to (1) describe the outbreak reports by selected characteristics (source, investigating agency, disease, time, place and person) (2) estimate the proportion of outbreaks that conducted analytical and additional studies.
Methods
We searched eight electronic databases and grey literature for outbreak investigation reports among humans at community settings from India during 2008–2016. We developed a check-list based on the 10-steps approach used by Field Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP) of ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology (ICMR-NIE), Chennai, India. This checklist was used to independently screen and extract data on general characteristics of the outbreak investigation reports and the steps completed. We adopted The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) check list for prevalence studies to examine the credibility and consistency. The protocol was registered at Prospero (CRD42017065038). We calculated proportion of reports that followed the steps in their investigation and descriptive statistics on selected characteristics.
Results
Of 10,657 articles screened, 136 articles were included for the review. Completion of the ten steps in the outbreak investigations was seen in 16% of reports. The highest level of completion was for drawing conclusion in outbreak investigation (98%) and the lowest completion (29%) was for developing a case definition by time, place and person followed by conducting an analytic study (24%).
Conclusions
Outbreak reports from India either lacked application of systematic steps for investigation or failed to report the actual procedures followed. We recommend improving systematic investigation of outbreaks through training and supervision of outbreak response teams and encouraging publications."

abstract = "Introduction
With a substantial increase in Institutional births in India, the prevalence of C-section section deliveries witnessed a sharp rise, with a highly skewed prevalence among births in private health facilities. The study aims to investigate the dynamics of voluntary C-section across different socio-cultural strata in India, along its major drivers.
Methods
The study used data on 249,949 live births in the five years preceding 2015-16 NFHS-4 covering 699,686 women from 601,000 households across 640 districts in the country. Bivariate and binary logistic regression analysis have been used to analyses the data. The economic inequalities in voluntary C-section have been analyzed using the poor-rich ratio and the concentration index (CI)
Results
Seventeen percent of live births in five years preceding NFHS-4 were delivered by C-section, a sharp rise from 9% in 2005-06. C-section deliveries are common among first births (24%), in private sector health facilities (41% of deliveries), higher educated mothers and those residing in urban areas (28%). The likelihood of C-section deliveries is significantly higher among mother from high-income families. Values of the poor-rich ratio (0.092) and concentration index (0.031) has significantly revealed that voluntary C-section is more concentrated among the affluent class of households in India.
Conclusions
The study concludes that older women, higher educated mothers, residing in urban areas and, belonging to high socio-economic status are the ones who opt for voluntary C-section deliveries and seek private instructional delivery. The government of India should strengthen the regulatory protocol for private health facilities."

abstract = "Background
There exist various studies on the cause and determinants of infant mortality in developing countries. However, to best of our knowledge, none of the studies have seen the effect of institutional delivery and infant's birth size on infant mortality in Bangladesh.
Methods
Data for this study comes from Bangladesh Demographic and Health survey 2014, which is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey. This study uses information on 7,886 infants to analyze the effect of institutional delivery and birth size on infant mortality. Bi-variate and cox regression technique were applied for analyzing the cross-sectional data drawn from representative survey.
Results
Infant mortality was significantly higher in mothers who did not deliver baby at institutions and did not take any antenatal checkups. A significant high infant mortality was found among mothers who belonged to poor wealth status than middle and rich. In addition, infants who had small and very small birth size at the time of delivery had significantly high mortality. The mortality was significantly high in male than female infants.
Conclusion
Infant mortality is low among those who delivers baby at institutions, takes antenatal checkups and have higher wealth status. Infants with average birth size and female have less mortality. To reduce the infant mortality in Bangladesh, institutional delivery, antenatal care, baby birth size, child sex and wealth index are important factors. There is urgent need to focus into these factors to reduce infant mortality in the country."

Breastfeeding is considered to be the best food for infants and plays important role in the formation of growth and development. The factors associated with the initiation and continuation of breastfeeding varies from country to country. The aim of this study was to determine the breastfeeding patterns in the first 24 h of life and its associated factors.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted using multi-stage sampling. The cities of Fars province in Iran were considered as clusters and then samples were taken from hospitals (public and private). Data were collected from 1439 newborns by interviewing the mothers and using a questionnaire. Data were evaluated using descriptive and analytical statistics by SPSS software (version 16.0). Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to determine the variables affecting breastfeeding.
Results
During the first 24 h of life, 96% of mothers started the breastfeeding of their infants, and 1238 newborns (87%) were breastfed exclusively. Breastfeeding rate was significantly higher in mothers with normal vaginal delivery (P < 0.001). Hospital type, family income, parental education and parental job significantly associated with Breastfeeding rate.
Conclusion
The rate of breastfeeding in the first 24 h of life was in a good condition. However, given the high rate of cesarean delivery and its negative impact on breastfeeding, it is necessary to take measures to ensure that this type of delivery is performed only if necessary."

Despite various programmes aiming to improve the nutritional status of children, nearly 38% of children under age five are still stunted in India, and there is huge spatial variation across the states.
Objectives
The present study first examines the spatial clustering of childhood stunting and then investigates the contextual determinants including meteorological factors, poverty and crop production affecting childhood stunting.
Methods
The percentage of stunted children under 5 years of age is taken from the district factsheets of National Family Health Survey 2015–16 (NFHS-4). Other data are taken from Census of India (2011) and Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. To fulfil the set objectives, the spatial analysis including Moran-I index and spatial regressions models are used.
Results
The spatial analysis shows a high degree of clustering (Moran's I: 0.65) in childhood stunting in districts of India. Extreme temperature of districts reveals a positive association with childhood stunting as nearly 40% of children from districts with maximum temperature above 40 °C were stunting. After controlling for socioeconomic factors, spatial regression reveals that a 1 °C increase in average annual temperature would lead to 0.134 increase in the percentage of stunted children. The study reveals a negative effect of district-level per-capita crop production, wealth and education levels on the childhood stunting.
Conclusion
The paper manifests the gigantic variations and clustering in the childhood malnutrition across districts of India. The study recommends to target the districts in hot spot areas, districts with extreme temperature and with low levels of crop production to fight against malnutrition under the umbrella of sustainable development goals."

In India, under-nutrition among the poor children imposes greater burden in rural areas. Particularly rural children are more vulnerable to malnutrition because they receive foods having low nutritional values along with discriminatory distribution of food within the household. Also in early childhood due to lack of appropriate care they suffer from recurrent infections and multiple diseases either causing delayed development or fatal effect. The demographic and socio-economic factors influence the nutritional status and neuro-development of the vulnerable children.
Methods
The aim of present study is to assess the nutritional status of developmentally challenged children of less than five years through Z-scores of height-for-age, weight-for-height and weight-for-age by demographic characteristics in a backward district of the state of West Bengal, India. Indices of nutritional status are calculated based on the WHO Child Growth Standards.
Result & conclusion
It has been observed that there are gender differences and age group variations in the nutritional status of children who are developmentally challenged. Under-nutrition is a major problem with vulnerable children in rural area who suffer from developmental delay."

Nutritional status is influenced by the complex social, biological, environmental and cultural factors that are highly interrelated. Despite being a demographically and economically developed state, Maharashtra has a high prevalence rate of child malnutrition with alarming figures. There is uneven development in different geographical regions.
Aim
This paper assesses the extent of nutritional status and inequalities among children in different regions of Maharashtra.
Data and Methods
This study utilizes data from the fourth Round of the National Family Health Survey (2015–16), the large-scale survey on demography and health recently conducted. Simple chi-square test was conducted to test the association and, further binary logistic regression analysis was done by adjusting various socio-economic and demographic characteristics. Additionally, to deal with the inequality aspect, concentration curve, concentration index, and decomposition analysis techniques were used to access and measure the degree of socio-economic inequality in geographical regions of Maharashtra.
Results
The result shows that household aspect wealth quintile, religion caste/tribe, mother education, child ever born and different regions of Maharashtra were the main factors contributing to poor child malnutrition. Rural area has the highest percentage of underweight (40%) children followed by stunted (38%) and wasted (26%) respectively. Almost half of the children are underweight whose mother has no education, with 45% of stunted and 26% wasted children. Nandurbar district of North-Maharashtra regions has a prevalence of underweight (56.17 per 100) and stunted (47.38 per 100) children while Gadchiroli district of Vidarbha region has highest prevalence of wasted (46.59 per 100) children respectively.
Discussion
Due to lack of proper development, poor awareness about keeping up and improving the dietary benefit of nourishment and absence of cleanliness and sanitation as compared with other social groups.
Conclusions
The aim of this paper was to explore the geographical variations in malnutrition in Maharashtra. The present study plentifully uncovers that, as far as child nutrition is concerned, the Scheduled Tribes groups seems to be socially excluded among all the social classes. Economic growth has played a definite role in reducing child nutrition, but it is not primarily responsible for the significant decline. As per the results, we have seen that among rich and poor inequalities exists and were highly significantly different regions of Maharashtra.
Recommadations
The paper calls for state and regions specific strategies which are needed to be designed and executed on a priority basis, keeping in view the keeping in view the idea of disparity or the nature of inequality in childhood malnutrition in the state and its differential characteristics across the regions."

Anemia is an important risk factor for the health of children as it leads to delayed growth and has long term impacts on neurodevelopment and behavior which causes child morbidity and mortality. Though the rate of severe anemia is almost ignorable in Bangladesh, the overall prevalence of anemia is still very high. Thus this study designed to identify determinants of severity levels of anemia among children aged 6–59 months from the nationally representative 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS).
Method
A total of 2188 children aged 6–59 months with complete information on the selected predictors were finally identified from data of this cross sectional survey. Proportional odds model was applied to assess the impacts of determinant on severity level of anemia.
Results
Among 2188 children sampled, 24.8%, 32.3% and 42.9% were severely or moderately anemic, mildly anemic, and non-anemic, respectively. Out of children who resided in urban areas, 27.1% were mildly anemic, and 21.1% were severely or moderately anemic. Stunting, division, wealth index, mother's anemia status, age of child, water facility and mother's body mass index were found to be statistically significant determinants of severity levels of childhood anemia.

The analysis of factors affecting birth interval helps to reveal the mechanism and dynamics of fertility behavior which changes the population structure of a country. This study aims to examine the association among different socioeconomic and demographic factors with birth intervals and to identify the statistically significant factors of birth intervals.
Material and methods
This study has been used latest Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2014 data based on two stage stratified sample of households. Different birth intervals have been analyzed using various statistical techniques such as Kaplan Meier estimator, log rank test, Cox proportional hazard model and Frailty model.
Results
Among the ever married women, 92.40%, 76.80% and 61.60% have experienced live birth for first, second and third times, and the estimated median duration of birth intervals are 26, 46, and 58 months, respectively. Using the log rank test, this study found that region, place of residence, mothers education, partners education, contraceptive use, and mothers age are significantly associated with birth intervals. This study also considered mothers age and working status at first birth interval; mothers education, age, working status and survival status of previous child at second birth interval; mothers education, sex of household head, working status, mass media exposure, age, contraceptive use, religion, and survival status of previous child at third birth interval are protective factors in next births.
Conclusions
Overall, mothers age, working status and mass media exposure are protective factors in birth intervals. To fulfill the target, government should pay attention to significant protective factors."

To assess the frequency of thyroid dysfunction in subjects with type 1 diabetes.
Methodology
This study was conducted at Baqai Institute of Diabetology and Endocrinology (BIDE), a tertiary care diabetes center of Karachi Pakistan from January 2005 to March 2017. Subject with type 1 diabetes (T1D) of all ages and both genders were included in the study. T1D was diagnosed on the basis of History, physical examination and relevant laboratory tests. The data of all registered patients was entered in a specially designed software. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was used as a screening test to assess thyroid dysfunction in subjects with type 1 diabetes. Further evaluation included FT4, T3 and thyroid antibodies where indicated. The data was analyzed on SPSS version 20.
Results
A total of 153 T1D subjects (67 male and 86 female) were included in the study. Out of 153 subjects, 23 (15.0%) had thyroid dysfunction of which 17 (11.1%) were found to have hypothyroidism (subclinical or clinical), 6 (3.9%) were hyperthyroid while 130(84.96%) subjects were having normal thyroid function. Statistical differences were found in body mass index and serum creatinine level among the different categories of thyroid dysfunction. The required dose of insulin was higher (but not significant) in subjects having hypothyroidism as compared to hyperthyroid or subjects with normal thyroid function.
Conclusion
High frequency of thyroid dysfunction was observed in subjects with T1D. Hypothyroidism was more common than hyperthyroidism. All subjects with T1D should be screened with TSH to evaluate for thyroid dysfunction."

Postpartum depression (PPD) is a major depressive disorder. Its symptoms begin 4 weeks after delivery. Several studies have evaluated the association of the type of delivery with PPD; however, there are controversies regarding this association. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to estimate the overall association between cesarean section (CS) and PPD.
Methods
The international databases of Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, EMBASE and Ovid were searched until May 2017. Quality assessment was done using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The pooled odds ratio in case-control and relative risk in cohort studies were used as the measures of association. A random-effects model was applied for the report of the results with 95% confidence intervals.
Results
Of 989 studies, 32 articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The adjusted OR of the association between CS and PPD was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.34) and the crude odds ratio of this association was 1.36 (1.20, 1.55). The odds ratio of the association of elective and emergency CS and PPD was 1.29 (1.12, 1.49) and 1.36 (1.20, 1.55), respectively. In addition, the pooled relative risk of the association between CS and PPD was 1.22 (0.94, 1.58) in cohort studies.
Conclusions
Based on the results of this meta-analysis, it seems CS, regardless of the type of cesarean, is a risk factor for PPD."

Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a union territory in the Indian sub-continent with a very diverse and large population. There was no existing data regarding the prevalence of communication disorder in this region and hence, this study was taken up. This information was considered essential for creating awareness among the population about communication impairments, for providing rehabilitation and to improve policies and facilities for the affected individuals.
Method
The study was completed in two phases. In the first phase, a door to door survey was carried out by students and staffs of All India Institute of Speech and Hearing, Mysuru, in the islands. During this phase, all individuals with communication disorders were identified and referred for a two-day camp that followed. The second phase involved diagnosis and rehabilitation of these referred individuals in a camp site set in a well accessible point in the capital city of Port Blair.
Results
4.12% of the population that was surveyed got referred for the camp. Amongst the referred individuals who participated in the camp, the prevalence of ear-related problems was estimated to be 47.76%, and that of speech and language disorders came up to 52.24%. It was also noticed that males were more affected by communication disorder than females.
Conclusion
The prevalence values were found to be quite high in city of Port Blair and immediate action is required in terms of facilities and infrastructure in these areas for improving the quality of life of individuals with communication disorders."

The study aimed to explore the pattern of comorbidities among Osteoarthritis (OA) patients attending urban primary care settings and its association with healthcare utilization.
Methods
Age (±3 years) and sex matched (1:1) case-control study was done among randomly selected 514 people (OA + non-OA) attending primary care settings. Information was collected on 18 comorbidities and healthcare utilization was measured by number of hospital visits in last one year and numbers of medicines taken daily. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association with multimorbidity and linear regression analysis was performed for identifying association between healthcare utilization and comorbidities.
Result
There were 260 radiologically confirmed OA cases and 254 matched controls. The mean age of people with OA was 52.7 years compared to 54.5 years in controls. Mean number of comorbidities among OA was 2.5. Leading comorbidities were acid peptic diseases, chronic back pain, hypertension and diabetes. The adjusted odds of having two or more comorbidities among OA patients was 1.8 [95% CI 1.4–2.2]. The adjusted β coefficient for number of medicines taken was 0.5[95% CI 0.2–0.8] in OA patients with two or more comorbidities compared to non-OA with less than two comorbidities. The hospital visits were 0.7 times less among OA patients with two or more comorbidities compared to non-OA with less than two comorbidities after adjusting for other variables.
Conclusion
Osteoarthritis has significant association with multimorbidity, which increases medicines intake and health care utilization. Comorbidities in OA should be considered for designing integrated care approach."

abstract = "Background and objectives
Lymphatic Filariasis, also known as elephantiasis, is a neglected tropical disease causing chronic damage to the lymphatic system. The disease, due to its peculiar morphological manifestations and disfigurations, is associated with severe social stigma and results in severe economic and mental stress for the affected. India's National Health Policy (2002) was aiming at the elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis in the country by 2015 which was extended to 2017. Preventive chemotherapy using yearly one dose of DEC and albendazole through mass drug administration is the key strategy adopted for this. This study aims at assessing the coverage, compliance, and causes for noncompliance towards MDA in Bagalkot district and assessing the rates of directly observed treatment, the source of information on MDA and incidence of side effects related to MDA Programme.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was done in four randomly selected clusters in endemic Talukas of Bagalkot district of Karnataka. A total of 240 households with 1110 beneficiaries were evaluated during the study. The information was collected by directly interviewing one responsible adult member from each house using a structured proforma. The data obtained was then entered to Microsoft Excel 2013 spreadsheet and analyzed using SPSS version 22.
Results
Among the 1110 persons evaluated the coverage was found to be 93.9% and effective coverage rate (compliance) was 83.2%. The coverage compliance gap was 10.7%. The most common reason quoted by the beneficiaries for not consuming the tablet was lack of faith in the tablets. The incidence of adverse drug reactions was 14.68%.
Conclusion
The effective coverage rate of MDA programme in Bagalkot was well below the national target of 85%, recommended by the government of India. The major reason for the high coverage-compliance gap was the failure of effective IEC activities. Intensive IEC activities are needed for educating the beneficiaries against the misconceptions of filariasis and MDA programme."

Measles is a highly contagious and a vaccine-preventable disease. On 14 August 2015, a measles outbreak was reported in Langkat District, North Sumatra province of Indonesia. To investigate the risk factors of the outbreak and to recommend control measures, an epidemiological investigation was undertaken.
Method
A 1:1 matched case-control study was conducted. All suspect and confirmed cases were recruited and included. Controls were healthy neighbors of cases, matched for age and gender. House-to-house search for cases was carried out. Structural interviews were conducted to solicit demographic data, clinical data, as well as the risk factors. A two-step logistic regression was employed to assess the potential risk factors associated with the infection.
Results
During 20 July to 25 September 2015, a total of 28 measles cases were identified with no death. All tested blood samples were positive for measles-specific IgM antibodies confirming the outbreak. All cases presented with fever and rash; cough (80%), coryza (65%), and conjunctivitis (25%). The attack rate (AR) was 14.1% (age ranged between 1 and 14 years old), the highest AR (50.0%) occurred among those aged 1–4 years. In multivariate model, those who have not received measless vaccication and those who had contact with a measles case had higher odds of having infection, with adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.31 (95%CI: 1.22–4.27) and aOR: 1.15 (95%CI: 1.12–3.70), respectively.
Conclusions
Being unvaccinated and having a contact history increased the risk of measles are two risk factors of measles infection. A mass measles immunization to the school children was undertaken and a strict measles surveillance and notification system were recommended to control the transmission in the future."

The linkage between periodontal and systemic diseases although well researched in the scientific area is not universally cognizant among the clinicians. It is critical to bring about the awareness of this inter-relationship as oral health is suggestive of systemic health. The aim of this study was a thorough hemodynamic assessment in patients having periodontal disease.
Settings and design
This is an observational cross sectional study. The patients were selected from Outpatient Department of Cardiology and Periodontology in a tertiary care hospital in urban setting in Nagpur, India.
Methods
The study was conducted on 45 patients aged between 35 and 65 years. Echo-Doppler examination for internal diameter (ID), intima-media thickness (IMT) and blood flow velocity (PSV) measurements was executed in the right and left common carotid artery (CCA) and brachial artery (BA). Periodontal disease status was determined using parameters like Gingival Index, Plaque Index, probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL).
Statistical analysis
Due to multiple comparison groups one-way Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni multiple comparison tests have been performed to conduct all possible pair-wise comparisons of means.
Results
The present study showed that Carotid IMT and ID were high in the patients having cardiovascular disease (CVD) and periodontitis as compared to CVD alone, showing the additional effect caused by the presence of periodontal disease.
Conclusion
The study findings support the proposition that periodontal disease may be associated with endothelial dysfunction which leads to atherosclerosis or hardening of arteries indicating increased cardiovascular risk."

abstract = "Introduction
Sexual violence has severe and manifold consequences for the health issues of women. It affects more than 50% of women across the globe and has a significant impact on their health and wellbeing. Psychologically, it leads to radical changes in the victim as she draws the images of herself, in her relationships with her immediate social circle and beyond in the community as a whole. Therefore, it has a lasting negative impact on the victim's perception of herself, of events, and others. The objective of the study is to explore the mental health status of the women who faced any type sexual violence.
Method and materials
This hospital-based study used criterion sampling in selecting women with mental disorders due to sexual violence for the understanding of the issue. Qualitative method was used to explore the impact of sexual violence on the poor mental health of women. We used a phenomenological approach and conducted in-depth interviews.
Results
Findings show that the women who experienced sexual violence were facing mental disorder like anxiety, sleeping disorder, obsession, acute stress disorder etc. More surprisingly, the women who were facing mental disorders due to sexual violence have been and continue to be exposed to further sexual violence.
Conclusion
Women who faced sexual violence have been and continue to be in the situation of mental disorders. The roles of sexual violence varied; sometimes it predisposed the disorder, while other times it precipitated or maintained the disorder. The findings can be used for further mixed method research to enrich and quantify our understanding."

abstract = "Objectives
Substance abuse affects the quality of sleep and various factors can be effective as mediators of sleep quality. Therefore, the current study carried out in order to predict quality of sleep based on emotion regulation and resiliency among men with substance-related disorders (SRDs).
Methods
the current study was a descriptive correlative study. The statistical population includes men with SRDs referred to maintenance treatment center (MMT) in Kermanshah City, among which 400 participants were selected based on convenient sampling. The obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and the diagnostic analysis model.
Results
the results of the study show that there was a significant relationship between increase in age and education level and the quality of sleep in men with SRDs (P<0.05). However, the relationship between the duration of substance abuse and quality of sleep was not significant (P>0.05). There was a significant relationship between emotion regulation strategies including rumination, self-blame and other-blame, catastrophizing, and acceptance and quality of sleep in men with SRDs, and the difference regarding emotion regulation and resilience between people with and without good quality of sleep was also significant (P<0.05). Moreover, the results indicate that there is a significant relationship between resilience and the component of spirituality and the quality of sleep in men with SRDs. Finally, the two predicting variables of emotion regulation and resiliency were able to explain 69% of the variance in quality of sleep.
Conclusions
using negative and non-adaptive emotion regulation strategies and low resiliency can reduce the quality of sleep among men with SRDs."

abstract = "Background and objective
Recurrent event data analysis is most commonly used in biomedical research. However, the researchers dealing with recurrent events in survival analysis have ignored the assumption that the recurrent events are correlated. There are methods available that takes into account dependency between recurrent events. The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the recurrent event models using upper respiratory infection (URI) among Indian infants.
Methods
The frequency of URI among a birth cohort of 210 babies was evaluated monthly with nasopharyngeal swabbing. Data on 11 potential risk factors were noted. The extended Cox models, such as Andersen-Gill counting process (CP), Prentice-Williams-Peterson (PWP-CP), PWP–Gap time model, Marginal Model and Cox frailty model were applied. The better model was assessed based on Loglikehood test statistics.
Results
Of the four models, PWP-CP model had lower log likelihood value. The URI incidence rate was estimated to be 2.27 (95%CI: 1.70–3.03)times significantly higher in the month of July–October and 1.43 (95%CI: 1.19–1.71) times higher in the month of November–February as compared to March–June (p < 0.001). Nasopharyngeal colonization with S. pneumoniae was also another important risk factor (HR = 1.18, 95%CI:1.01–1.39, p = 0.03).
Conclusion
In the current study, PWP-CP model was found to be better model as compared to other models. Also biologically appropriate as subsequent events depend on the first event of URI. Hence, the choice of an appropriate method for analyzing the recurrent event data should not be decided only on statistical basis but also based on the research question."

The epidemiological survey of chronic diseases on manufacturing employees (ESCOME) was designed to a) assess the prevalence of chronic physical and mental diseases b) investigate socio-demographic, psychological and lifestyle determinants of chronic physical and mental diseases c) investigate job-related determinants of chronic physical and mental diseases among a large sample of Esfahan steel company (ESCO) employees.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted at 2015 in two main phases among employees of ESCO, Isfahan, Iran. In the first phase, validated self-administered questionnaires were used to assess quality of life, mental health, lifestyle and job-related variables. In the second phase, clinical, biomedical and anthropometric indices were evaluated in the occupational medicine center of ESCO. Furthermore, a self-report questionnaire was used to collect comprehensive information about socio-demographic factors, smoking habits and chronic physical diseases.
Results
Totally, 3063 employees from various departments of ESCO were recruited in the current study. The participants’ mean age was 36.74 years (SD = 7.30, ranged from 21 to 64) and 91.5% of them were male. The participants predominantly worked in rotational shifts (55%) and 63.5% were low-level blue-collar employees. Hyperlipidemia (29.7%) and anxiety (8.9%) were the most prevalent physical and mental diseases respectively.
Conclusions
The ESCOME provided an opportunity to enhance our knowledge about the epidemiology and determinants of chronic physical and mental diseases among Iranian manufacturing employees."

Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a rare post-infectious peripheral polyneuropathy. Following the Zika virus epidemic in 2016, the WHO called for understanding Zika associated GBS through epidemiological studies. However, the incubation period of GBS remains little known and its characterisation is needed.
Methods
Articles reporting the data of lag time between the symptom onset of Chikungunya or Zika and GBS were included for pooled analysis. Maximum likelihood estimation was adopted to estimate the incubation period distribution of GBS conditioned to that of the antecedent infection.
Results
A total of 89 Chikungunya- and Zika-related GBS cases from 23 articles were identified. The incubation period distribution of GBS is lognormal distributed with the median of 13–14 days and does not depend on the antecedent infection.
Conclusions
The incubation period of GBS follows Sartwell's model. It should be useful in confirming the association between infection and GBS in epidemiologic studies as well as to assist diagnosis and prognosis such as clinically assessing respiratory failure. It is also found that viral symptoms can occur prior to neurological symptoms, suggesting that GBS may be a parainfectious disease."

abstract = "Background
Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) or hydatid cyst is one of the most common diseases between humans and livestock that is caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus. The disease is a major health and also economic concern in Iran. Most of the studies on CE in different areas of Iran have been conducted in adults and there is little information about the prevalence of the disease in children.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted to find out the seroprevalence of hydatid cyst in children in a rural community in Fars province, southern Iran. Children sera samples were evaluated for anti-hydatid cyst antibodies; using a recombinant B8/1 antigen of E. graunlosus in an ELISA system.
Subjects
Blood samples were taken from 578 children living in three villages in Sarmashhad district in Fars province, southern Iran.
Results
Of the 578 recruited children, 298 (51.6%) were boys and 280 (48.4%) were girls. The mean age of the children studied was 6.8 (±3.7) years. Anti-hydatid cyst antibodies were detected in sera of 39 out of 578 children, corresponding to a seroprevalence rate of 6.7%. While age, educational level, keeping dogs in the household, and residential areas had no significant influence on the risk of CE infection (p > 0.05), the correlation between sex and seropositivity to CE was significant (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Findings of this study showed that the rate of seroprevalence of hydatid cyst in children in the rural community is high. The study suggests that preventive measurements including the education of the population should begin in early childhood as a large percentage of the adult CE patients are resulted from childhood infection."

Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of mortality among respiratory diseases, Legionella pneumophila (L.pneumophila) is an important cause of pneumonia in the world. Despite the evidences of favorable epidemiological conditions and the presence of the pathogen in Ahvaz, this disease has not been investigated properly.
Objective
The aim of this research project was to determine the frequency of L.pneumophila with urinary antigen test in hospitalized patients with Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) in need and non-need intensive care in Ahvaz.
Materials and methods
In this case-control study, two groups of 70 patients with CAP need Intensive-Care Unit (ICU) as cases, and non-need ICU as controls who were hospitalized in teaching hospitals of Ahvaz were selected and tested for urinary antigen by a commercial kit (Legionella Kit, 2016٫ Belgium). Data were analyzed using SPSS 15 software by descriptive statistics.
Results
According to the data analysis, 140 patients, 5 patients (3.6%) were positive for the Legionella urinary antigen٫ 3 (4.3%) were in case and 2 (2.9%) in control group. Although cases in compare with controls were more likely to be smokers, having serum sodium less than 130(meq/lit) and less than 1500(cell/ml) lymphocytes in cell blood count, but statistically were not significant. In the region of study, L.pneumophila can cause respiratory infection but is an uncommon cause of pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
Conclusion
This disease primarily involves smokers and people with immunodeficiency; especially those with low lymphocyte early in admission. Therefore, in patients with a history of smoking and severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization in ICU, Legionella should be kept in mind."

Early and accurate diagnosis of many diseases is critical to their treatment. Today, the classification models based on fuzzy intelligent systems help the uncertainty conditions in medicine, as well as the classification of diseases. The main goal of this study is to diagnose the most common thyroid disorders, hypothyroidism, using a fuzzy rule-based expert system.
Methods
In this study, the data from patients who referred to Imam Khomeini Clinic and Shahid Beheshti Hospital in Hamadan west of Iran were collected. The data contain 305 subjects in three classes which are normal, subclinical hypothyroidism and hypothyroidism. Collected variables include demographic, symptoms as well as laboratory tests. In order to the diagnosis of Thyroid disorders, a fuzzy rule-based classifier was designed. Predictive performance of this model was compared with a multinomial logistic regression model in terms of the accuracy and the area under a ROC curve (AUC) as well as sensitivity and specificity.
Results
The results showed that designed fuzzy rule-based system works well in thyroid disorder prediction with about 97% accuracy. Also, the fuzzy classifier has a better performance than the logistic regression model, especially for the subclinical hypothyroidism class.
Conclusions
Fuzzy rule-based classifier by utilizing overlapping sets has improved the efficiency of classification and decision-making systems. Also, by providing the possibility of using linguistic variables in the decision-making process, easier interpretation, can be used by doctors who are not familiar with modeling concepts."

Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 201 patients with established heart disease in a hospital in the west of Iran. The participants were randomly selected during January–May 2017. The self-report checklist for demographics and cardiovascular risk factors, the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP-II), and the NSESSS-PTSD were the measurement tools. The results were analyzed using two-stage cluster analysis (TSCA), one-way ANOVA, and Bonferroni post hoc test.
Results
The mean age of patients (50.2% female) was 53.4 ± 11.9 years old. TSCA provided the three clusters: (A) samples with poor lifestyle/high PTSD (36.3%); (B) samples with a relatively poor lifestyle/moderate PTSD (20.9%); and (C) samples with a relatively good lifestyle/mild PTSD (42.8%). In most variables, there is a significant difference between clusters A and C (p < 0.05).

Osteonecrosis of femoral head (ONFH) is a common cause of destruction of hip joint in young patients and is one of the commonest indications of total hip replacement in India and other Asian countries. Data on risk factors for avascular necrosis and their relation to clinical and radiological outcomes is scarce. This study will help to understand the epidemiology of the condition and quantitatively define risk of disease with exposure to various known risk factors.
Materials and methods
100 patients diagnosed to have ONFH and 100 matched controls were included in this prospective study. Details regarding alcohol consumption and steroid use were taken. Association between Harris hip score & Visual analogue scale for pain and Ficat staging and area of femoral head involvement on MRI was studied. Association between amounts of alcohol and steroid consumed (average and cumulative doses) and clinical and radiological variables was also studied.
Results
Corticosteroid exposure was present in 44%, alcohol in 30% patients and 22% cases were idiopathic. There was a statistically significant difference between average weekly alcohol consumption, drink-years, average daily dose of steroid and cumulative doses of steroids between the cases and the controls. Odds-ratio for steroid exposure in cases with ONFH was 134.5, 0.0006, and odds-ratio for alcohol exposure was 32.7, 0.0001. There was a significant correlation between the amount of alcohol (r = −0.348, p = 0.02) and steroid (r = −0.334, p = 0.001) consumption and HHS, and between amount of alcohol (r = 0.312, p = 0.035) and steroid (r = 0.546, p = 0.001) consumption and area of femoral head involvement. There was a strong positive correlation between clinical and radiological parameters (area of femoral head involved and HHS, r = −0.70, p = 0.000).
Conclusion
Risk factors such as steroid intake and alcohol intake are important and accounts for majority of the cases of ONFH. The quantity of these exposures is directly related to the severity of disease on clinico-radiological scales."

The purpose of the study was to compare the pain perception during the administration of local anaesthesia with the computerized delivery system (Wand) and conventional injection technique in paediatric dental procedures using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).
Methods
One hundred and six children from the OPD of Department of Pedodontics, Yerla Medical Trust Dental College, Navi Mumbai were included in the study. They were divided in to three groups: Group A-six years (5 years 6 months- 6 years 6 months), Group B- nine years (8 years 6 months–9 years 6 month), and Group C- twelve years (11 years 6 months–12 years 6 months). In each group, children received two interventions: the conventional local anaesthesia administration and WAND. Based on randomization by flip of the coin, the technique to be administered first was chosen. Palatal infiltration was always given first followed by the buccal infiltration irrespective of whether the WAND or the conventional technique was used.
Result
There was no significant difference between the mean pain perception (VAS scores) for the Wand and conventional injection technique in the 6 and 9 year old age groups. However there was significant difference between the two, among children in the 12 year age group.
Conclusion
there was no difference in the pain perception measured as VAS score with reference to the two techniques compared: the Wand and conventional, in all and in 6 and 9 year old children. However, the Wand technique was found to be superior in terms of lower pain for the 12 year olds. Also, among girls, the Wand technique was found to be superior."

The objective of this study was to identify the magnitude of various risk behaviours related to Hepatitis B (HepB) and to characterize the relationship between socio-demographic determinants and these risk factors among adults in Malaysia.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study in nine districts in the state of Selangor in 2016. A two-stage cluster sampling design was used and adults aged 20 years or above who were living in the selected living quarters were interviewed face-to-face. A multivariable linear regression model analysed the association between sociodemographic predictors and eleven outcomes (different HepB risk behaviours).
Results
A total of 728 respondents were included in the final analysis. Sharing nail cutters, body-piercing, and alcohol use were the most prevalent risk behaviours among respondents. Males, married couples, adult respondents (between 27 and 40 years old), and individuals with low educational attainment were more likely to be exposed to HepB risk behaviours.
Conclusion
HepB risk behaviours are relatively high among Malaysians and particularly among certain groups. Therefore, specific programs such as forums, seminars and continuous education on preventive measures for HepB should be tailored to these groups. These programs could be conducted by government authorities such as the Ministry of Women, Family and Community of Malaysia."

The review was conducted to collate the evidence on the current status of “Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health” (RMNCAH) and related Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) interventions in RMNCAH in South Asia, particularly Bangladesh, Nepal and India.
Methods
Literature search was conducted on multiple databases and websites in March 2019. The search was limited to English language publications. The data on health indicators for the eight South Asian countries are compared in the review. This review narratively summarises the key RMNCAH and related BCC initiatives undertaken in Bangladesh, Nepal and India.
Results
The South Asian countries have achieved significant progress in socio-economic indicators related to health aligned with the Millennium Development Goals but face a number of challenges. There has been a significant development in financial incentives, programmes and policies framed for improving indicators of maternal and child health. Various RMNCAH initiatives which impact positively on maternal and child health indicators were identified.
Conclusion
Bangladesh, Nepal and India have made substantial improvement in maternal and child health indicators but at a slower pace than other countries of South Asia, in relation to which consistent disparities still exist. There are a number of BCC initiatives targeting RMNCAH. The improvement in RMNCAH indicators can be attributed to multiple initiatives wherein the contribution of BCC is relevant, because of their wide community outreach and effectiveness among all age-groups."

Materials and methods
This literature-based study understands the creation of innovation in the medical field and its different areas to address upcoming challenges. Thus, relevant research papers from the Scopus database are identified and purposefully analysed.
Result
Studied the main components of additive manufacturing as required for tissue and organ printing and process used to create tissue/organ by using this technology. We have further identified different materials based requirements for tissue and organ printing and how this technology can fulfil this requirement to save the life of the patient. Finally, this paper identifies eight significant advancements of AM in the medical field with a brief description and limitations when additive manufacturing is used for tissue and organ printing.
Conclusion
In the current scenario, tissue engineering and cell therapy employ an innovative approach to reduce the mortality rate. However, the main challenge for this is customisation, which is somewhat taken up by AM technologies. This technology has already addressed different challenges in the medical field. For tissue and organ printing, this technique seems better as compared to 2D conventional cell technique. With the help of scanned data, 3D printing allows us to create intricate internal structures. Thus, it can be used to develop bone tissues, which are required for clinical applications towards the treatment of bone defects. It also plays an outstanding role in cardiac masses, heart disease, physiology, electrophysiology, tested for diagnosis and better treatment of valvular heart disease. Doctors and surgeon easily understand the aortic valve of the patient. It improves post-surgery, blood flow and helps proper selection of devices including stents. AM is to take up the challenge for the development of artificial bone with biomechanical properties as similar to bone. It uses the material in the form of powder, wire and ceramic. It has promising applications to print liver tissue and liver cell and fulfils the requirement of customisation in different fields."

The prevalence of CVDs was increased during 2004-05 to 2011-12 (26–50 per 1000 population). The mean HCE on CVDs also increased (INR 8,483 and INR 14,380) over the same period. The HCE increased with an increase in income, age, and education. Females were significantly less expending on health care than males. The HCE was more in private health facility than public ones. As many as 18.3% of CVD cases attributed due to diabetes, ~17% each having no-education and 6–12 years of education, and almost 8.4% cases attributed to overweight.
Conclusion
CVDs increased in 7 years period. At the same time HCE has also increased nearly by 80% (percent change); relatively more among outpatient treatment. There is need to develop multipronged strategies to reduce pace of increasing CVD and also the cost of treatment to avoid people falling into the trap of poverty due to HCE."

Choices in healthcare utilization are affected by a variety of factors related to both individuals and healthcare. There are many factors affecting health care utilization including physical, socio-economic, cultural, and political factors. One of the most critical factors that is affecting the health care utilization is gender differential. The objective is to assess the gender differential in health care utilization and the gender differential in health seeking behaviour for selected chronic diseases among tobacco and alcohol users in India.
Methods
The study involves Study on global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE) WAVE I data source for analysis. The method consists of bivariate analysis and multivariate regression. The diseases have been categorised on the basis of alcohol and tobacco consumption.
Results
The study found that males and females both are preferring private hospital over pubic hospital for inpatient as well as outpatient care. Males are more satisfied than females with the quality of care they received in the hospital. One of the important findings of the study is that men are covering more distance to reach hospital than women implies that women are not allowed to go faraway for their treatment.
Conclusion
To tackle the gender related discrimination in health care utilization and bring in the equity, it is essential to incorporate more women friendly measures. Women empowerment and their involvement in decision making power is imperative since these are the vital components of equity in health care services."

Population growth has been a part of India's concern since a long time which resulted into formulation of many policies and programme. Expansion of access to contraception and reduction of the unmet need for family planning are key components to improve reproductive health. The study aims to access the effect of family planning advice and maternal health care utilization on contraceptive usage in Bihar.
Methods
The study used the data from the National Family Health Survey, round 4, (2015–16). Bivariate and multivariate analyses have been employed to examine the factors affecting the contraceptive use among women in Bihar.
Results
Majority of the women preferred modern contraceptive methods with female sterilization being the most common among all. More than half of married women received advice on family planning methods but were found to be inconsistent in influencing the contraceptive use. Women who have received proper maternal health care were found to have more likelihood in adopting family planning methods. Age, residence, religion and wealth index are the significant predictors of contraception use. Age and wealth of the women depicted a positive relationship with the contraception use. Interestingly, results suggest that advice on family planning didn't have much effect on birth control in Bihar.
Conclusion
The study concludes that more needs to be done to support the need for adequate maternal health care utilization to increase the use of contraception. Efforts are required to ensure that currently married women across socio-economic backgrounds have an equal opportunity to received maternal health services."

Blastocystis is the most common parasite in humans and animals. Molecular studies based on the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU-rRNA) have shown that Blastocystis isolates have 17 subtypes and nine of these subtypes have been reported in human. The objective of the present study was to identify the subtype of Blastocystis. isolated from human in Shiraz city, southern Iran.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted from March to August 2019. A total of 802 fecal samples from persons who were referred to health centers of Shiraz University of medical sciences were collected and tested by wet mount method to find Blastocystis. Genomic DNA was extracted from the fecal samples to be positive for Blastocystis. SSU-rRNA gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The amplicons were sequenced and compared with published sequences in GenBank using BLAST system. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the maximum likelihood method in the MEGA 5.0 software.
Results
The microscopy method showed that 39 out of the 802 fecal samples were positive to Blastocystis. A 500 bp fragment of SSU-rRNA was amplified from isolates after the PCR. Sequence analysis identified four subtypes (STs) of Blastocystis consisted of ST1 (32.43%), ST2 (24.32%), ST3 (35.14%) and ST7 (8.11%).
Conclusions
Four subtypes (STs) of Blastocystis in human was identified in our study and subtype 3 was the most prevalent subtype. The common subtype (ST3) in this study was identical to the reports from other regions of Iran. For identification of the more subtypes of Blastocystis, comprehensive molecular studies with a large number of Blastocystis isolates are suggested."

Pupillometry is a simple, non-invasive method capable of measuring static and dynamic pupil response in several physiological and clinical conditions. The latest digital camera can be slightly modified to obtain real time pupil response under infrared videography and analyzed by image analysis. So the current study has undertaken to confirm characterization of the system by comparing with manual measurements in healthy volunteers.
Methods
This study was conducted in 40 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 25 years. The system was calibrated by measuring the known length of 3 different lines for reliability. Later real time static pupil pictures were measured and compared with the manual examination of pupil determined by a ruled scale with 0.5 mm accuracy.
Results
The Image J software was precalibrated with known length and estimated 5 mm, 10 mm and 15 mm lines respectively. The results are 5.01 ± 0.14 mm, 10.01 ± 0.36 mm and 15.02 ± 0.23 mm. There were no significant differences observed between the values analyzed by two examiners. Later the results were compared between manual examination and real time image analysis.
Conclusion
The present study suggested that the static and dynamic pupil measurements with real time pupillometer are accurate and probably as reliable as those obtained by manual examination of the pupil using the flashlight test. This system is cost-effective, portable in nature which can produce authentic results of the pupil."

Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a union territory in the Indian sub-continent. Though housing a highly diverse and large population, there is very limited data regarding the prevalence of communication disorder in this region. This information would play a crucial role in creating awareness amongst the people of the islands regarding communication impairments, providing rehabilitation services, and improving policies and facilities for the affected individuals.
Method
The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase involved a door to door survey. The survey was carried out across towns in North and Middle Andaman by NSS student volunteers and staffs of All India Institute of Speech and Hearing, Mysuru. During this phase, individuals with communication disorders were identified and referred for a two-day camp. The second phase involved diagnosis and rehabilitation of these referred individuals in a campsite set in a well accessible point in the city of Mayabunder.
Results
3.38% of the surveyed population was referred for the camp. Hearing impairment was found to be more prevalent than language and speech disorders. It was also found that delayed birth cry, low-birth weight and pre-mature delivery were the major risk factors of communication disorders in the region. Amongst the referred individuals who attended the camp, 46.8% of ear-related issues and 53.2% of speech and language disorders was estimated. It was also observed that males were more affected by communication disorder than females.
Conclusion
The high prevalence values indicate the need for immediate action in terms of facilities and infrastructure in these regions for enabling a better quality of life of individuals with communication disorders."

Cystic echinococcosis is a parasitic disease of major public health concern in many countries. Infection is generally acquired during childhood and symptoms may appear later in adulthood. The study aimed to determine the pattern and characteristics of cystic echinococcosis in adults from an endemic area (Morocco), where a control and prevention program has been implemented.
Methods
Adult patients diagnosed and operated for echinococcosis between 2010 and 2016 were investigated. Reports containing details regarding each patient were established and completed.
Results
Over the study period, 260 patients were investigated with a decreasing trend in patients' numbers. Adults from rural areas were significantly predominant (74.2%) (p < 0.01). Females were more infected (55.8%) than males (44.2%). Adults aged 18–43 years were the most affected (52.3%) (p < 0.01). All of the patients had single organ involvement. Liver location was preponderant (63.8%) and patients with uncommon locations were rare (6.9%). Cysts’ distribution varied by gender, age group and origin. Mean length of hospital stay was 5.5 days, with relatively higher periods in patients aged 57–82 years and in patients with unusual locations of cysts.
Conclusion
Active transmission of cystic echinococcosis can still occur in areas where surveillance programs have been implemented. Many factors affect features of the disease and should be considered in prevention and control programs in endemic areas."

Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional face-to-face questionnaire was developed. It included a 41 item dietary assessment, reporting semi-quantitative food frequency, dietary behavior and questions on self-rated health status. Donors were regular repeat blood donors, eligible to donate.
Results
Of the 2468 blood donors enrolled between July 2017 and January 2018, 1390 were repeat donors. Only 205 agreed to respond to the questionnaire. Data showed that donors followed mainly a Mediterranean diet and had more awareness to lifestyle, women more than men, in comparison with general population. The prevalence of overweight was found 50.7% in men and 16.9% in women.
Conclusions
Overweight and obesity are common among regular blood donors and it is more frequent in men than women. The female blood donors seem to be characterized by better knowledge on the relationship between lifestyle and health, and by a better “putting into practice” of the information possessed."

A nested case-control study was carried out as analysis of subset data with subjects enrolled for a randomized controlled trial(CTRI Trial no.2018/04/013096)in government facilities of Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, affiliated to Manipal Academy of Higher Education from May to August 2018. Eighty-eight newborns born to malnourished primigravidae by vaginal delivery were included. Neonatal anthropometry and cord blood ferritin along with maternal hemoglobin and ferritin was measured. The maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and weight gain in pregnancy were calculated using documented pre-pregnancy weight, height, and present weight.
Results
The average birth weight was 2.6 kg. (95% CI, SD = 0.5). Fifty-eight percent of babies were appropriate for gestational age(AGA). The number of AGA babies born to mothers who had weight gain 7 kg, and above was significantly higher.[Correlation:0.41,p = 0.0001]. Nine babies had depleted iron stores, three babies being small for gestational age(SGA). (RR:0.77,95% CI = 0.29–2.05,p = 0.72). Thirty-four percent mothers were anemic who had higher chance of having SGA babies.[RR = 1.47,95% CI 0.91–2.38,p = 0.12].Thirteen mothers had low ferritin levels and 5 of them had SGA babies[RR = 1.51,95% CI = 0.68–3.4,p = 0.33]. Fifty mothers had pre-pregnancy BMI <18.5, out of which 19 had SGA babies. [RR:0.80,95% CI = 0.49–1.31,p = 0.38].
Conclusion
Adequate weight gain in pregnancy can help achieve desired fetal growth in malnourished and anemic mothers."

abstract = "Background
The medical expenditure among the public in malabar region have been skyrocketing. The increased tendency to let the medicines unused ultimately leads to medicine wastage and huge economic loss. The purpose of this study was to assess the sheer bulk of unused medicines, factors responsible for their generation, and the cost bound to the wasted resource. The study also ventures further to identify the storage, handling and disposal practices of such unused medicines among the general public.
Methodology
A community based cross sectional descriptive study was carried out among 350 households of viiith ward & nearby wards. The self prepared questionnaire was incorporated. Questionnaire comprised of questions on medication taking behaviour, medication handling techniques including storage and disposal. The data collection form recorded the details of leftover medicines.
Results
The total economic burden of the population was computed to be rs.72,195.38, which sums up to rs.260 per household the major method of disposal was dumping (70.6%). Solid dosage formulations were the most abundant dosage forms found unused (92%). Storage conditions in households were satisfactory.
Conclusion
The evaluation of economic burden of unused medicines, utilization of medicines describes low medication adherence, high drug storage, higher leftover medicines and inappropriate use of medicines which suggests the need to educate the patients about proper and rational use of medicines. The fact that there are no proper disposal techniques for medicines points out the need of public awareness class on safe handling, storage and disposal of drugs in the households."

Almost every day, 800 women die from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications around the world. The risks and costs associated with C-section deliveries are significant, mainly where there was no medical indication. Past research has shown a positive and significant association with C-section and maternal death.
Objective
The paper attempts to throw light on the pattern of C-section delivery in India at district levels as the increasing use of medical technologies during childbirth is a matter of concern.
Methods
Bivariate, logistic regression and spatial analyses techniques have been used for analysis purpose, using the fourth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) data conducted in 2015–16.
Results
C-section have shown variability across all the states, and shifting from public to private is associated with an increase in the number of deliveries. Variables like the educational status of women, wealth, ANC, and OOPE were significantly associated with C-section.
Conclusions
There should be the provision of maternity benefits given to women who belong to below poverty line (BPL). Routine monitoring and evaluation of emergency obstetric services should be carried out. Further research to improve the quality of care in public health institutions should be made."

Toxocariasis is one of the most important pathogens transmitted to humans through the soil. Temperature 12–37 °C provides the best conditions for infecting eggs to be transmitted to humans, dogs, and other hosts. This study is preliminary in order to detect Toxocara eggs in public park soils and to study the correlation between seasons and climate variation with contamination rate.
Methodology
A total of 1132 soil samples were collected over the course of the year, from 11 major parks. A centrifugal-floatation technique with the utilization of saturated sodium nitrate solution was used to examine the soil samples to recover Toxocara spp eggs.
Results
Out of 1132 samples collected from public park soils, 129 (11.39%) samples were positive for Toxocara spp eggs, Laleh Park in south part showed the highest contamination rate. Contamination rate varied according to the site of parks, location with the highest rate in the south followed by center and the prevalence of eggs is high in spring and autumn without significant association. The prevalence of Toxocara spp eggs in soil associated significantly with Average temperature and rainfall (P = 0.04, 0.001 respectively).
Conclusion
According to our study findings, soils of the public parks in Tehran showed as one of the main sites for contamination with Toxocara spp eggs.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) and bronchial asthma (AS) are two related clinical types of allergic respiratory diseases, and there is a necessity to define both allergies in terms of the associated allergens. Accordingly, a cross-sectional observational study was conducted to examine the allergen profile in AR and AS of Iraqi patients, in whom the data are not well-elaborated.
Methods
During January 2014–April 2017, 653 AR and 521 AS patients were ascertained and their sera were assessed for total and specific IgE.
Results
The 16–45 years was the most encountered age group in AR and AS patients (79.1 and 75.1%, respectively). For total IgE, AS patients at all age groups had a significantly higher level than in AR cases of both genders. However, total IgE level showed no significant variation between age groups with the exception of total AS patients in the age group >45 years who had the lowest IgE level (338 ± 269 IU/ml). Screening the sera for eight allergen types (animal dander, grasses, house dust, insects, mites, molds, trees and weeds) depicted that molds were the most frequent allergen in AR and AS patients (8.7 and 19.6%, respectively), but mixed sources of allergens were much more frequently encountered.
Conclusion
The age range 16–45 years is an important target for AR and AS. Molds (Alternaria alternate spores) as well as mixed allergens were the mostly encountered types in Iraqi AR and AS patients."

Low birth weight (LBW), defined as a live birth weighing less than 2500 g, is a significant public health problem in India. The complex nature of this problem is not fully understood. Moreover, significant disparities in LBW prevalence not only documented across various socio economic groups but across states and districts as well. The identification of spatial patterns of LBW and its determinants is important for understanding epidemiology of this public health challenge.
Objective
This paper examines the determinants and spatial patterns of Low birth weight prevalence spatial pattern of LBW and its determinants in India.
Methods
Using fourth round of National Family Health Survey data, regression and spatial analysis have been performed through STATA, ArcGIS and GeoDa software.
Results
The result indicates lower odds of LBW prevalence among educated mothers, mothers who have more than 4 ANC visit, mothers who took IFA tablets during pregnancy, mothers with normal BMI and mothers with age above 20 years. The Moran's I for LBW is 0.543. It indicates high spatial autocorrelation in LBW over the districts of India The bivariate LISA maps obtained indicate spatial distribution of LBW and independent variables systematically contrasts the districts of central and eastern India (e.g. in Uttar Pradesh) with those of the extreme south (e.g. in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, etc.).
Conclusion
Our findings reveal greater attention towards maternal and child health care especially for the backward districts in the states of Uttar Pradesh (UP), Madhya Pradesh (MP), Bihar and Rajasthan are needed. Several maternal and social factors leads to the occurrence of low birth weight. Emphasis should be placed on improving the nutritional status of the mothers."

Evidence suggests that the way of enduring emotional distress plays a role in the tendency of people to abuse drugs. Accordingly, the present study aims to compare the distress tolerance in metamphetamines and drug abusers with non-drug abusers.
Methodology
The current study is an analytical study. The statistical population includes all the patients abusing methamphetamine and opium as well as non-drug abuser individuals visiting Farabi Hospital of Kermanshah in western Iran in 2018. Among the population, 202 individuals (50 individuals abusing methamphetamine, 52 individuals abusing opium, and 100 non-addicted individuals) were selected using convenient sampling, and then they were approximately matched based on demographic variables. The data were collected using the Distress Tolerance Scale developed by Simons and Gaher and were analyzed using multi-variate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and one-way analysis of variance in SPSS20 statistical software application.
Results
The finding analysis showed that the score of the concept of absorption by negative emotions (The subscale of distress tolerance) was significantly different between non-drug abusers and methamphetamine abusers (P < 0.05). The mean scores of distress mental evaluation and the overall score of emotional distress tolerance were also statistically significant between non-drug abusers and methamphetamine abusers as well as non-drug abusers and opium abusers. However, this difference was not significant between methamphetamine abusers and opioid abusers (P > 0.05).
Conclusion
The findings of the current study show that patients abusing opium and methamphetamine are less capable of tolerating distress compared to non-drug abuser."

Dengue infection causes significant morbidity and mortality in over 125 countries worldwide, and its incidence is on the rise. Currently, no therapy is available beyond supportive care. In fact, corticosteroids are used therapeutically for a broad spectrum of diseases including autoimmune, allergic, inflammatory diseases and organ transplant rejection. However, only a few studies were done to evaluate the effectiveness of corticosteroids in dengue infection, although the immune pathology of dengue is similar to other diseases treated effectively by corticosteroids for several decades.
Objectives
This review is aimed at identifying biological actions of steroids at molecular and receptor level in dengue immune pathology after reviewing pharmacological and immunological research findings of corticosteroids and dengue.
Methods
We searched medline/pubmed and Google scholar for publications with the search terms ‘dengue’ and ‘steroid’, ‘corticosteroid’, ‘prednisolone’, ‘methylprednisolone’ or ‘dexamethasone’ in the title and abstract. Then the publications were analyzed according the action of steroids in dengue pathology under different subheadings.
Results
The results are presented under four categories and it shows that corticosteroids can suppress cells involved in innate immunity, T cells, B cells and antibodies,complements and heamatological manifestations in dengue pathology.
Conclusion
This article explains strong supportive evidence for actions of corticosteroids in dengue pathology at receptors and molecular levels. Therefore it is suggested that a gold standard steroid protocol for each phase of dengue pathology that can be tested further with a double blind control trial study."

In the management of recycling waste, separation of the wastes from source is crucially important. A successful source separation plan requires good participation of the community.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of an educational intervention based on the Integrated Behavior Model (IBM) on the behavior change of housewives in Sanandaj City, west of Iran, towards the waste separation at source.
Methods
This is a quasi-experimental and community trail study. The population study was the households living in Sanandaj. The total number of 144 households were selected and divided into two groups (72 each). For each selected household, only the housewife was interviewed. To evaluate the behavior change towards the dry and wet waste separation, a training program based on the IBM was conducted for one group (training or intervention group) and the second group served as the control and received no training. The length of the intervention was two months with eight sessions. After a month, participants were asked to fill in a validated questionnaire based on the IBM, before and at the end of study. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon and McNemar tests.

This study comprises DHS data of 15 developing countries. A Meta-analysis, sub-group analysis, and meta-regression are used by the researcher to reach a valid conclusion keeping the study purposes in mind.
Results
This study has found that for the marriage age 18 and above, pooled OR is 0.47 [0.40; 0.56] which is statistically significant for 15 DHS data. A large amount of heterogeneity was found for meta-analysis with I2 = 98%. For Asian countries, the combined OR is 0.3828 [0.27, 0.54] on the contrary Non-Asian countries holds the pooled OR to be 0.4567 [0.39, 0.54]. Also, the variation among different countries fertility performance for age at first marriage is largely explainable by the moderator variable per capita health expenditure (PCHE). PCHE alone is responsible for 57.14% of the heterogeneity among the overall explainable heterogeneity.
Conclusion
In summary, our analysis highlights the effect of female age at first marriage on fertility in developing countries. This study explores the effective strategies to the developing countries that are suffering from high fertility."

abstract = "Background
Many people suffer from ligamentous laxity even in the absence of other diseases. This is called the benign generalized ligamentous laxity. It can be a predisposing factor for musculoskeletal and joint injuries. We did this research to determine the prevalence of generalized ligamentous laxity in different ethnic groups of Hamadan province as a pilot study for a future national investigation.
Materials and methods
In this descriptive-analytical study, 378 people were selected by simple sampling in 2017 from a province in northwest of Iran. We looked for the ligamentous laxity in them with clinical examination according to Beighton's score criteria using goniometer for measuring the joint movement's angle. The population included people between 17 and 40 years old. They were from various Iranian ethnic backgrounds who were living in this province.
Results
Eighty-six participants (22.8%) had generalized ligamentous laxity. Generalized ligamentous laxity was more prevalent in women (31.5% compared to 14.7% in men). The most common ligament laxity was on the fingers. Most participants with generalized ligamentous laxity (78 of 86 participants) had no knowledge of their problem and its importance in choosing the appropriate sports activities; 12 of 86 participants (14%) had a history of sports-related injuries, and 31 of 86 participants (36.5%) had a musculoskeletal disease.
Conclusion
The prevalence of generalized ligamentous laxity is considerably higher in women regardless of their ethnicity. Most people are unaware of their problem. Also, the history of musculoskeletal diseases is significantly higher in people with this problem compared to those without it."

This study assessed the impact of the diameter and length of different brands on the amount of tobacco in cigarettes and measured the effect of each millimeter length of cigarette filter on the absorption of chemical components in cigarette smoke.
Methods
We selected 11 common brands of domestic and foreign cigarettes, including Bahman-L, Bahman-S, Sater, Montana, Magna, Kent, Marlboro, Winston, Cima, Bistoon, and G1. We measured the length and diameter of each cigarette using a digital caliper with the sensitivity of 0.01 mm and the amount of tobacco using a digital weighing scale with the sensitivity of 0.0001 gm. We assessed the effect of each millimeter length of cigarette filter on the absorption of five known human carcinogens in cigarette smoke, including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, benzene, and formaldehyde.
Results
The volume of cigarettes and the amount of tobacco was much more dependent on the diameter of cigarettes than their length. Only 1–2 mm reduction in the diameter of cigarettes can reduce the amount of tobacco in cigarettes by 20%–40%, respectively. Moreover, each incremental increase of 1 mm of the length of cigarette filter increased the absorption of benzene, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and formaldehyde by 1.5%, 1.3%, 1.9%, 2.0%, and 0.7%, respectively.
Conclusion
A minor reduction in the diameter of cigarettes had a substantial impact on the amount of tobacco in each cigarette stick. Furthermore, the length of the cigarette filter had a significant effect on the absorption of the hazardous chemical components of cigarettes."

Stunting is a result of chronic under nutrition and a major public health issue in Ethiopia. This study aimed to calculate the prevalence of stunting, and associated factors among children younger than five years.
Methods
A total of 9588 children in Ethiopia were included. Proportional Odds Model was used to identify determinants of stunting. The score test and plots were used to see the proportional odds model assumptions.
Results
The prevalence of stunting was 38% (21% moderately, 17% severely). Children with illiterate mothers were 2 times more likely to be moderately and severely stunted compared with their counterparts with secondary education. The odds of being stunted for children whose age group 24–35 months respectively as compared to children 0–5 months of age were 4.71 times higher. Being female children were 9.66 times more likely to be in normal nutrition status as compared to male. Children of families in the highest wealth quintile were 7.92 times more likely to have normal stature compared with children from poorest ones.
Conclusions
Child age, child sex, birth interval, mother's educational status, wealth index, were the important determinants of stunting. Addressing these factors will help to prevent future injury of physical and mental development in children and will assist in alleviating malnutrition and refining their quality of life. Moreover, in a DHS data set, complex sampling design should be incorporated in order to make a valid statistical inference."

Despite being identified as one of the top neglected parasitic infections, Toxoplasma gondii has received little recognition in Australia with no previously published prevalence data from the general human population. The objectives of the current study were to: determine the prevalence of evidence of exposure to T. gondii infection in an Australian community dwelling population, and: identify associated risk factors.
Methods
Sera from 75 males and 75 age-matched females living in Busselton, Western Australia were tested for the presence of anti-T. gondii IgG and IgM antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Survey derived data were also analysed to evaluate risk factors.
Results
IgG and IgM antibodies were detected in 99 (66.0%) and 15 (10.0%) of subjects, respectively. IgG seroprevalence increased from 44.4% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 18.9–73.3%) in the 18–34 year-old age group to 81.0% (95% CI: 60.0–92.3%) in the 75–84 age group. The observed IgG seroprevalence increased at a rate of 0.8% with each year of age. No risk factors were identified.
Conclusions
The first study of its kind in Australia found T. gondii infection to be highly prevalent. Toxoplasma gondii infection has been neglected in Australian notifiable disease programs therefore Australian public health authorities should focus on improving education to raise awareness and commence longitudinal epidemiological data collection to supplement public health models targeting T. gondii transmission control."

This study was undertaken to find out the usefulness of Absolute eosinophil count as a biomarker for sepsis, especially in Indian settings where cost constraints are the rule.
Methods
A prospective observational study was carried out over a period of one year in KIMS Al Shifa Super Speciality Hospital which is a tertiary care referral hospital in Malabar region of Kerala. Patients admitted in the ICU with a diagnosis of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) were included except those with hematological cancer, HIV infection, previous eosinophilia due to any cause, trauma patients or those on long term systemic steroids. Absolute eosinophil count estimation at time of admission, and on fifth day, were done manually using Neubauer counting chamber and confirmed using 5 part hematology analyzers ADVIA 2120 (Peroxidase method). The statistical analysis was carried out using the software, Statistical Software for Social Sciences 20.0.
Results
The mean value of AEC in different categories of sepsis group was found to be significantly low in septic shock and refractory septic shock patients compared to other categories (p = 0.04), whereas CRP levels were significantly higher in all sepsis groups (p < 0.001). When the diagnostic performance of AEC, CRP and PCT were evaluated, Procalcitonin showed maximum sensitivity (89.5%) on day 1 with a cut off value of 0.5 micogm/L in diagnosing sepsis from SIRS patients. AEC shows maximum specificity (95.65%).
Conclusion
It is concluded that Absolute eosinophil count below 50 cells/mm3 is a very specific but poorly sensitive indicator to differentiate sepsis from SIRS.A low value of eosinophil in SIRS patients should alert the physician regarding the possibility of severe sepsis and should direct treatment plan accordingly."

Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies are innovative and are being applied successfully in the medical field as they provide the extensive capability of customisation. Here in this study, we have identified research papers on AM applications, specifically 3D printing in stem cells.
Aim of work
This study provides information to health professionals and helps them to solve different medical challenges in an effective manner which is not possible with the traditional method of stem cells fabrication.
Materials and methods
Undertook the study through good research papers published on Stem cells on the applications of 3D printing which are also helpful to sort out different medical problems and their solution.
Result
This paper studies 3D printing technology in the context of stem cells fabrications, brief about the stem cells, its functions and its superior capabilities in the medical field. Paper identified thirteen significant stem cells applications achievable through the practical applications of 3D printing. Finally, the paper provides a brief discussion on the future potential of this technology for the printing of stem cells.
Conclusions
3D printed stem cells seem to have extensive applications in regenerative medicine for the treatment of various diseases. These cells help seed decellularisation of complete organs for regenerative medicine. This technology also applies to the reconstruction of heart valves and has excellent potential in valvular disease. These cells have higher capabilities to fulfil different medical requirements, but it is challenging to steer its growth as per the need of human kind. Scientists created 3D printed stem cells structure which can grow, and they have performed tissue regeneration experiments on them. Traditionally researchers produce 2D sheets of cells. Now, this technology introduces the fabrications in 3D with stem cells which can also be developed in the human body. 3D printing approach creates uniform building blocks of stem cells with precise and controlled growth and seems helpful to the human body for consistent tissue growth. Nevertheless, this is just a starting, and there is a long way to go for commercial printing of human body parts."

The present study was aimed to determine the prevalence of MetS and its components and present results according to the major demographic characteristics of the participants in a population-based study.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 10663 subjects aged 40–70 years who participated in phase one of PERSIAN Kharameh cohort carried out between 2014 and 2017.
Result
According to IDF, ATP III, and an Iranian definition, the prevalence of MetS were reported as 37.00%(36.08–37.92), 33.82% (32.93–34.73), and 33.13% (32.24–34.03), respectively. The most prevalent component of MetS was abdominal obesity (73.59), followed by reduced HDL cholesterol levels (44.83), elevated triglyceride (28.3), fasting glucose (35.34), and high blood pressure (32.64). In addition, the prevalence of MetS were 50.3, 70.4, 68.2, 65.7, and 60.8 among individuals with abdominal obesity, high triglyceride levels, hypertension, impaired fasting glucose, and low HDL-C levels, respectively. Results showed that 90% of the subjects displayed at least one component of MetS, and all MetS components were associated with major demographic characteristics of the study subjects.
Conclusions
The findings of this study indicate high prevalence of metabolic risk factors among study population. This study with a large sample size would contribute to establishment of efficient interventions and programs aimed at reducing the prevalence of MetS by health staff, supervisors and policymakers."

abstract = "Introduction
Assessment of the basal body temperature (BBT) is generally used to predict the fertile period. On the other hand, it is well documented that the fern pattern appears before ovulation due to increased estrogen level from the cervical mucus. However, the collection of cervical smear is cumbersome. Delta change in the BBT serves as ovulatory indicator whereas fern pattern has a temporal specificity from 11th to the 16th day. Since the saliva also mirrors the cervical fern pattern and easy to collect, it can be used to assess the fertile status. So the present study was done to compare the BBL with salivary smear for fern pattern to determine the fertile period.
Method
ology: The present study was carried out in 23 healthy female volunteers in the age group of 18–21 years with regular menstrual cycles of 28 days. Ethical clearance was obtained from the institute ethics committee. The basal body temperatures were measured and salivary smears were observed under low power objective (10X) for fern pattern analysis from 11th to 16th day of the menstrual cycle.
Result
On any given day from 11th to 16th day fern pattern appeared with an average of 53.7% as a fertility indicator in all the subjects. The delta change in basal body temperature varied from 0.2 to 1.4° Fahrenheit over a span of 6 days.
Conclusion
Salivary fern pattern and basal body temperature together might serve as better indicators of fertility status than anyone individually taken which is a non-invasive and cost-effective method to increase the chances of conception."

Methods
A register based cross sectional study was done by retrieving data from the family health register of the rural health centre. Data on age, gender and all the morbidities, were collected. The most prevalent morbidities were presented as frequency and percentages, prevalence of multimorbidity were presented as dyads and triads. Multiple Logistic regression was done to find the age adjusted risk of gender on multimorbidity.
Results
The prevalence of multimorbidity was 16.2% (13.05–19.35).The most prevalent morbidities were hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, visual impairment and thyroid in both males and females and most common dyad was hypertension and diabetes.
Conclusion
In the context of lack of studies from this area, the findings of the study may help the health care providers to plan interventions. Further research has to be done to identify the risk factors of multimorbidity."

The patient safety incidence reporting in Indonesia has still not been generally practised. We suggest that the culture of patient safety incident reporting in hospitals has a correlation with the self-efficacy of nurses. A nurse with strong self-efficacy may be able to convince herself that incident reporting is a good practice to maintain and to improve the quality and safety of patients in hospitals. Incident reporting can promote the importance of reporting errors and become the beginning of the learning process to prevent the occurrence of the same incident in the future. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship of self-efficacy with the culture of patient safety incident reporting in hospitals.
Methods
This study was a descriptive correlation study which involved 100 nurses from a District General Hospital in South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. General Self-Efficacy was used to measure the respondent self-efficacy and Hospital Survey of Patient Safety Culture instrument was used to measure the culture of patient safety incident reporting among respondents. Data were analyzed using computer statistical software.
Results
Self-efficacy was not statistically correlated with the culture of patient safety incident reporting (p = 0.116).
Conclusion
Patient safety incident reporting is important to improve the hospital service system. The support from top leaders and hospital management by implementing the no blame policy and giving rewards and constructive feedback on patient safety incident reporting can help and facilitate nurses in applying the culture of patient safety incident reporting."

The workplace is one of the important sites where substance use problems occur; very few studies identify the relationship between work and substance use in India. The current research was performed in a rural area where mining mostly occurs, to study the association of some of the risk factors of substance use.
Objective
This study examines the prevalence and pattern of substance use among mineworkers in Karauli district of Rajasthan, India.
Methods
The cross-sectional study included individuals over the age of 15 years, 218 mineworkers and 203 non-mine workers used for comparison purpose. Ten villages were selected using probability proportional to size sampling technique and participants were recruited using non-random sampling from each village from May 2014 to September 2014. Descriptive and analytical methods were used to estimate the prevalence and to identify the associated risk factors.
Results
Logistic regression analysis showed that mineworkers were at a higher risk of substance abuse as compared to the non-mine workers. Prevalence of consumption of khaini, bidi, alcohol, and gutkha was higher among mineworkers while the use of hookah smoking was among non-mine workers. Association analyses identified that factors such as age at starting work, awareness of work, associated risks, injury at a workplace, respiratory illness, periodontal problems or gum pain, and being in debt were significantly associated with uses of such hazardous substances among the mineworkers.
Conclusion
This may be the first study reporting on substance use among mine workers. The prevalence of substance use among mineworkers in this study was higher than the comparison group. Moreover, it correlates with multiple health problems suggesting a need to promote specific interventions to prevent mine workers towards substance use."

Early detection of anemia and subsequent measures to prevent anemia can help children grow healthily. There is considerable attention given to the impact of individual-level factors on Anaemia, but less is known about how community characteristics affect Anaemia among children. The present study was focused at estimating the prevalence and associated risk factors at individual and community level in India among children aged 6–59 months in India.
Methods
Descriptive statistics and the chi-square test were applied using fourth round of National Family Health Survey dataset. Later, to explore the association of child anemia and some potential risk factors regarding hierarchy (individual and community level) of data, a multilevel logistic regression model was conducted using STATA-SE 14 software.
Results
The results indicate that some aspects of the community influence the anemia risks of children. For instance, a 1% increase in the proportion of mother education in the community decreased the likelihood of anemia by 9% among children. Northeast region was the only region at lesser risk of anemia. Higher community level ethnic and religious homogeneity is associated with decreased odds of anemia among children. Children aged 12–35 months, girl child, children having diarrhoea, mothers of age group 15–24, high parity and low exposure to mass-media were the high risk individual factors of anemia among children.
Conclusions
Overall, the present study indicated the requirement to include community-level factors beyond the individual level factors by policymakers to eradicate the burden of anemia in the country and the high prevalence states."

abstract = "Background
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, and myocardial infarction is one of the common manifestations of these diseases. The goal of this study was to compare the survival rate of patients treated with thrombolysis and PPCI in patients with STEMI.
Method
This was a survival analysis study performed on 354 patients in Shiraz, Iran. Admission time was considered as the starting point and the time of death or the last follow-up time as the endpoint. All cases of STEMI patients were reviewed from the beginning to the end of 2018. Data were collected using a checklist and telephone call and they were analyzed using the Log Rank test, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models.
Results
The overall survival rate of patients in the PPCI group (92.4%) was significantly higher than that of the thrombolysis group (83.9%). The variables such as age, gender, diabetes history and type of treatment had an impact on the risk of death. After controlling the confounding factors, only the patients’ age had a significant effect on death (HR: 1.05, P = 0.001, 95% CI: 1.02–1.09).
Conclusions
The survival rate of the PPCI group was higher than thrombolysis group. However, the difference in the criteria used to select the type of treatment may have a distorting effect on the subject. Therefore, it seems necessary to carry out studies with a more appropriate design."

Methods
The present study collected demographic, epidemiologic and clinical information of women of aged group 20–60 years with gynaecological abnormalities who attended the gynaecology and cancer OPD at a tertiary care health center.
Results
Majority of the study participants were young married ladies and did not have any formal education (85.5%). Mean (SD) age at the time of first pregnancy among the study subjects was 16.8 (2.7) years. Majority of the study participants were below poverty line (88.2%). A total of 68.6% of the study subjects had an HPV infection. Among those that had an HPV infection, majority had HPV 16 infection (95.4%). In the remaining 4.6%, HPV 18 was present. Findings show that with increasing age, HPV prevalence increases. Also, early age at marriage, lack of education, increased parity, early age at first pregnancy, poor sanitation, use of tobacco and belonging to below poverty line were significant risk factors for HPV infection in this cohort.
Conclusion
The study reported a high prevalence of HPV infection in rural women attending the Gynaecology and Cancer OPD of a tertiary care hospital. Several important risk factors for the HPV infection were also identified. These were early age at marriage, lack of education, increased parity, early age at first pregnancy, poor sanitation, use of tobacco and belonging to below poverty line. These findings call for more efforts to increase awareness pertaining to HPV infection and cervical cancer among rural women."

A considerable proportion of the population remain unvaccinated due to multiple reasons including vaccine hesitancy. To study the factors responsible for the incomplete immunization of under-5 children from the perspectives of the communities, a vaccine hesitancy survey was done in two districts of Odisha. In addition, the survey aimed to elucidate the reasons for differential vaccine hesitancy.
Methods
This community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the rural areas of Balangir and Nuapada districts in Odisha. We adapted the vaccine hesitancy survey questionnaire (core closed questions) developed by SAGE working group. We used this questionnaire in a sample of 260 households, selected from 30 clusters. The questions were categorized into three main dimensions, namely, awareness about vaccine efficacy, accessibility to obtain vaccine, and acceptability of the vaccines at the individual and community level. We used bivariate and multivariate regression analysis to determine the predictors for refusal or hesitancy of the vaccine.
Results
Long distances and time are the two prime factors of accessibility linked with the refusal or hesitancy of the vaccine. We found that there is a high level of acceptance of vaccines at the level of parents and more than three-fourths took their children for vaccination despite hearing negative information about them. Pentavalent and measles were more commonly refused or hesitated vaccines by the parents compared to BCG or polio.
Conclusion
In the current scenario of increasing immunization coverage in India, vaccine hesitancy acts as a missing link in action for the policymakers to achieve cent percent target."

Electroencephalography based brain-computer interface techniques are widely used these days as they bring human intentions into reality. Various researchers have proposed different approaches to decode EEG signals for applications like spellers, emotion recognition, lie detection, brain games etc. The ability to analyze concealed behavior is very important for legal and security purposes.
Method
This research aims to identify the concealed behavior of an individual. This paper presents a three-stage “Concealed Information Test” using wavelet transform, k-means clustering and multi-layer feed-forward neural network. The test has been developed by analyzing ERP component (P300) of EEG data during a mock crime scene. The wavelet transforms extracts time and frequency information from raw EEG data. K-means clustering clusters the wavelet coefficients into three clusters. As, neural network models the nonlinear time series data viz EEG, hence it has been utilized for classification of clustered data.
Results
A hybrid 3-stage classification approach is proposed by combining the advantages of all above-mentioned approaches. EEG data is recorded for a “Concealed Information Test”, for implementing the proposed framework.
Conclusion
The performance of the proposed system is improved from existing approaches, by providing an accuracy of 83.1%."

abstract = "Objective
Despite the continuous global and national effort, India is far away from achieving universal immunization coverage. The primary objective of this paper is to find the spatial pattern and correlates of the full immunization coverage gap in the districts of India.
Data and methods
We used data from the fourth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) conducted in 2015–16. Moran's I, univariate and bivariate Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis had been used to assess the spatial autocorrelation, clustering, and risk factors of the full immunization coverage gap in the districts of India.
Results
The full immunization coverage gap among children has reduced by 33% over 2005–15. Around half of the children in 163 districts of India were deprived of full immunization. The spatial pattern of immunization coverage identified 99 districts as hot spots, whereas 111 as cold spots. Results from the bivariate LISA map signifies that the districts with higher coverage gap in full immunization also had higher deficit in pre-natal and post-natal care and skilled birth attendant. The spatial regression model revealed that female literacy, female-headed households, antenatal, and post-natal care have a significant association with full immunization coverage in India.
Conclusion
The existence of clusters indicates the presence of unevenness in immunization coverage and has several implications that should be addressed for better health of the population. Efforts are to be made to ensure the universalization of education, along with accessible and affordable healthcare for all ensuring universal health coverage in India."

abstract = "Introduction
Assessing the possibility of patient discharge based on data-mining models is one of the common, user-friendly approaches to optimally exploit the limited capacity of hospital beds.
Objective
The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of length of stay (LOS) in cardiologic care wards developed and carried out based on data-mining approaches.
Methods
Data from 136 patient records were evaluated using data-mining analysis approaches including the Multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN),Quick unbiased and efficient statistical tree (QUEST), support vector machines (SVM), classification and regression tree (CRT), Advanced decision tree (C5.0), Auto Classifier (AC) and Logistic Regression models.
Results
The median and mean LOS was 4 and 4.15 days (95% CI [3.99, 4.30]), respectively. Predictors are associated with increase in LOS (more than 4 days) were: the ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) diagnosis at the time of referral, being in the 50–70 years old group, history of smoking, high blood lipids, history of hypertension, hypertension at the time of admission, and high serum troponin levels.
Conclusion
Using classical models to explain the predictors of aoutcome is inefficient when the number of predictors is high and sample size is low. Therefore, the analysis based on new data-mining approaches is a desirable alternative solution. Behavioral factors, especially smoking, are among the important factors in determining the long-term stay in the heart care ward."

Basic life support (BLS) performed by general population improves outcomes in cardiorespiratory collapse. This community-based study aims to measure the general population's eagerness in learning BLS, knowledge regarding early recognition, and use an automated external defibrillator.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional community-based study in Jakarta using questionnaire. Numerous questions asked through a questionnaire in order to evaluate the general population's eagerness and knowledge about basic life support.
Results
There were 303 respondents in this study. Most respondents stated that knowledge about BLS is important and was eager to learn; however, only 39.6% of respondents have ever done BLS training. 59.4% of respondents have ever looked for information or read about BLS. 63.6% of respondents chose to call an ambulance for the first reaction, while 36,5% of respondents preferred to look for a pulse. Most of the respondents know to check the carotid pulse in the neck. 77.4% of respondents know that chest compression was done on mid-chest. 81.5% of respondents agreed that CPR was preferably done repeatedly in a specific rhythm, but giving one despite the method is better than none. Only 49.5% of respondents wanted to give mouth-to-mouth ventilation. Most respondents thought that they are not allowed to use AED, and only a small proportion had seen AED in public.
Conclusion
Most of the respondents agreed that BLS is important. Respondents have satisfying knowledge about how to react while encountering an unconscious person. Most respondents have not seen AED and most likely didn't know how to use it."

Usage of substances like alcohol, tobacco and other addictives leads to major socio-economic problems along with many harmful health effects. In India, 14.6% of population use alcohol and 28.6% of the population use tobacco products. This study attempts to assess the prevalence of alcohol, tobacco and substance use and to assess the awareness of ill effects of these substances, among a rural community in Chamrajnagara District, Karnataka.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in a village in Chamarajanagara district by house to house survey. The sample size was estimated to be 244. Data regarding substance use habits and awareness was collected using a pre-validated, semi-structured questionnaire by interview method and was analysed using SPSS Version 23.
Results
The total prevalence of substance use was found to be 27%. Among the study participants, 22% have used tobacco at least once in a lifetime and prevalence of alcohol use was 8.2%. A minority of 1.2% have used other substances also. The most common reasons for initiating and continuing substance use were peer pressure and time pass or leisure. Among the total study population, 80.7% and 77.7% were aware of the health problems related to tobacco and alcohol respectively.
Conclusion
Regardless of the high awareness of health problems related to alcohol and tobacco use, the usage was high among the rural population. So more effective behavioural change communication strategies should be designed and implemented in the area to improve the practice among the rural population."

Study design
Compares life expectancy of disabled and overall population by seven type of disability.
Objective
This study examines the gender differential and regional disparity of disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and Life lived with disability (LWD) among disabled in India.
Methods
Data from Census of India, 2011 and abridged life table from Sample Registration System 2011 has been used. Disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) was estimated using Sullivan method. Life lived with disability was calculated for all major states included in the study by the types of disabilities.
Results
In 2011, the DFLE in India was 58.1 years for males and 60.78 years for females compared to life expectancy of 66.87 years for males and 70 years for females. On average, females in India had lived more years with disability than males. Similarly, the DFLE of rural areas was 58.6 compared to 62.3 in urban areas. The DFLE was 59.26 years movement, 58.88 for mental retardation and 58.81 for mental illness. The age pattern of DFLE decreases with increasing age for both males and females. The regional variation in DFLE is large. The DFLE of males in the state of Jammu and Kashmir was 62.4 compared to 56.4 in Assam. Similarly, for females, the DFLE was 61.8 years in Gujarat and 63.1 years in Tamil Nadu.
Conclusion
Though the overall life expectancy and DFLE were higher for females than for males, females lived with disability for more years than males. The DFLE was lowest for mental retardation followed by mental illness. The poorer states of India has lower DFLE compared to richer states."

Antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) is used in women at risk of preterm births to reduce mortality and morbidity of the neonate born. However it's effect may not always be beneficial especially in the women with risk factors for sepsis which is quiet high in developing countries.
Methods
Neonates (26–35 weeks gestational age) delivered to mothers who received 2–4 doses of ACS (group1) or 0–1 dose (group 2) were compared for incidence, severity of Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and death. Various morbidities of prematurity were also compared among the two groups.
Results
Less number of neonates developed RDS in group1 (28.1%) than group 2(37.8%) (p = 0.011). Few babies needed CPAP in group 1 (34.1% vs 53.9%; 0.006), however more babies needed mechanical ventilation (MV) (62.2% vs 41.7%; 0.005) in group 1. Mortality was similar (20.5% vs 20.1%; p = 0.71). Group 1 neonates with 2–4 doses of ACS had less Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (0.3% vs 2.6%; p = 0.04) but sepsis rates (12% vs 6.2%; 0.02) were increased. Other morbidities of prematurity were comparable.
Conclusion
Similar to the previous literature, decrease in incidence of RDS and IVH was found in neonates with higher (2–4) doses of ACS. However more cases of culture positive sepsis and severe RDS occurred in these neonates."

Methods
The cross sectional study was undertaken during April–September 2016 involving 339 students studying medical, dental and nursing health sciences in KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, India. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect all relevant information. Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and Headache Attributed Lost Time (HALT) index were used to assess subjective perception regarding intensity of pain over the previous 24 h and disability burden over the last 3 months respectively.
Results
The one year prevalence of headache was 73.1%, of which migraine and tension type headache were 33.3% and 19.2% respectively. In majority (93.2%) of the students, the intensity of pain was mild to moderate. More than one third (37.1%) of students reported that headache was affecting their family, social and leisure activities with moderate-severe impact indicating high need of medical care. Logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender (adjusted OR: 2.67), problem in falling asleep (adjusted OR: 2.86), problem in staying asleep (adjusted OR: 11.11), soft drink consumption (adjusted OR: 2.22) and self dissatisfaction with own health (adjusted OR: 1.89) were significantly associated with headache.

The aim of this study was to estimate the health endpoint of Ahvaz Megacity Criteria Air Pollutants (MCAP) in humans during 2010–2013. Criteria Air Pollutants (CAP) were monitored by Ahvaz Environmental Protection Agency (AEPA).
Methods
This study, evaluated the health effects which are related to particle mater (PM10), Ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfide dioxide (SO2) by descriptive analysis and AirQ model. Sampling according to EPA guideline was done and baseline incidence (BI) and relative risk (RR) measures by the World Health Organization (WHO) for Middle East region were used in order to estimate the health endpoint association of CAP.
Results
Result of this study is useful for better understanding of relationship between exposure to criteria air pollution and health effects. Hospital Admission (HA) were Hospital Admission Respiratory Disease (HARD), Hospital Admission for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (HACOPD), Hospital Admission Cardiovascular Disease (HACD). According to the result of this study, the annual cases of hospital admission during 2010–2013 were (PM10: 3116, 3246, 3026 and 2895; O3: 37, 42, 51 and 72; NO2: 10, 13, 21 and 25; SO2: 25, 31, 35 and 42), the average annual level of CAP in the same period were (PM10: 281.98, 288.38, 278.12 and 242.29; O3: 66.52, 72.67, 102.27 and 223; NO2: 28.7, 31, 37 and 41; SO2: 78.92, 91.07, 92.75 and 112.3 μg/m3), respectively. Based on the results, the average of 4-year study was higher than NAAQS and WHO values. The concentration of exposure to criteria air pollutants can increased morbidity and mortality between residential in Ahvaz megacity.
Conclusion
Results of our study can be very important for government, medical, public health and scientific. Also, this study can help to government for adoption of laws which are related to air pollution and achieve international air quality standards. Hence, it is necessary to reduce emission of criteria air pollution sat national management level."

Evidences showed that the incidence of catastrophic health expenditure is unequally distributed among disadvantaged populations. The present study has tried to explain the contributors of this unfair inequality in Hamadan, Iran.
Methods
The target population was households that utilized inpatient services in hospitals of Hamadan. A proportional stratified random sampling method was used to determine study sample (N = 770). The associated factors of catastrophic health expenditure were estimated using logistic regression analysis. The inequality of catastrophic health expenditure was measured by concentration index and explained by decomposition analysis. The data were analyzed by using STATA version 12.
Results
The key determinants of catastrophic health expenditure were poor economic status, lower household size, lack of supplementary insurance and the number of hospitalizations. The overall concentration index of catastrophic health expenditure in Hamadan was −0.163 (95% CI: −0.242 to −0.083). Household economic status (63.60%) and household size (39.90%) were considered as the first and the second largest contributors of catastrophic health expenditure inequality, respectively.
Conclusion
It is demonstrated that catastrophic health expenditure inequality in Iran could be explained by the factors beyond the health sector scope. Hence, future policy efforts need to consider both health system factors and the factors beyond the health system to eliminate catastrophic health spending burden and its inequality."

Toxocariasis is an infection caused by larvae of a group of animal nematodes named Toxocara in human tissues. The disease often affects children under the age of 10 years. In this research, we decided to determine the prevalence of infection in schoolchildren of Bushehr city as a first study in the region.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, the samples were selected randomly among Bushehr primary school students between September 2011 and June 2012. ELISA method was used to measure anti-Toxocara canis IgG antibodies. Data were collected by questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS 18.0 software and Chi square test.
Results
Of the 400 students studied, 48 (12%) were positive for anti-Toxocara IgG antibodies. Results showed that there is no a statistically significant relationship between infection and some of the analyzed variables such as sex, abdominal pain, anorexia, chronic cough, diffuse pain, itching and skin sensitivity. However, with the habit of playing with soil, this relationship was significant.
Conclusion
Considering the importance of the disease in children and influence of harmful effects on their health, it is suggested that the methods for diagnosis be trained for clinicians in the area and periodically tests as well as teaching the prevention and control strategies should be considered to the educational staff and parents."

Background
Tobacco is one of the leading causes of premature death around the world. In Nepal, tobacco kills 15,000 people every year. Men are also the primary users of tobacco. This study aimed to discern the prevalence and associated factors of tobacco use among Nepalese men aged 15–49 years.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study. This study used data from the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2016. A total of 4059 study participants aged 15–49 years were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome of interest in this study was ‘tobacco use’, which was further categorized into smoked and smokeless tobacco use. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify determinants of tobacco use, smoking, and smokeless tobacco use.
Results
The prevalence of overall tobacco, smoked tobacco, and smokeless tobacco use were 52.3% (95% CI: 50.0–54.6), 27.3% (95% CI: 24.5–30.3), and 40.2% (95% CI: 38.0–42.4), respectively. The prevalence of tobacco use was significantly higher among the elderly, manual workers, those of lower educational status, those of lower economic status, and residents of Province No. 2. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, older age, poor education, poor economic status, and residence in the Terai region were each found to be significantly associated with tobacco use.
Conclusion
As one out of every two Nepalese men is a tobacco consumer, pertinent public health programs need to increase advocacy against tobacco use among the mass population. Tobacco control programs should also target high-risk groups when designing interventions."

Methods
A total of 115 differently-managed i.e. public, private and public-private partnerships (PPP) health facilities in Ganjam and Kandhamal districts of Odisha were selected to undertake this study. Three women each having given childbirth in the last six months preceding the survey in the sampled 115 health facilities were selected randomly to participate in the study.
Results
The result presented a distinct picture wherein provision of respectful maternity care is not uniform for all the respondents included in the study. Management of the health facility remained as the major transpiring factor to providing respectful maternity care. Public health facility (ATT: 5.503) - which happened to be the largest service provider in the study population, affects respectful maternity care adversely. Contrary to this, women having accessed delivery care from the PPP facilities received more respectful maternity care. The private facilities whose number is mushrooming alarmingly at the present time also fails to provide the needed respectful maternity care to women during their difficult phase like childbirth.
Conclusion
Women's memory of birth experience including any disrespectful and abusive care stays with her lifetime and affects her physical and emotional health. It may also discourage her to have institutional delivery – by which, opportunities may be lost to diagnose morbidities early that are associated with pregnancy and childbirth."

Osteopenia is commonly seen in people over age 50 that have lower than average bone density but do not have osteoporosis. The diagnostic difference between osteopenia and osteoporosis is the measure of bone mineral density. Tenofovir is an antiviral drug that is approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and to prevent and treat Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV) infection. It may cause to reduce Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in some patients.
Objective
This study aimed Comparing the Frequency of Osteoporosis and Osteopenia in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients with and without Tenofovir treatment.
Materials and methods
This study was conducted in 2018 as a cohort study on 209 patients with chronic hepatitis B, who referred to Imam Khomeini Hospital and the Gastroenterologist's Office in Ahvaz. Patients evaluated in two groups including Tenofovir group (receiving Tenofovir for more than 12 months) (n = 139) and control group (candidates for Tenofovir and had no history of taking Tenofovir or other anti-inflammatory drugs) (n = 70). BMD was evaluated in all patients by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and compared in the two groups.
Results
The frequency percentage of patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis in the Tenofovir group (60.43%) was significantly more than that of the control group (21.43%) (P < 0.05). Among Tenofovir group, 51.02% of males and 42.22% of females had osteopenia. Also, 14.28% of males and 15.56% of females had osteoporosis. In the patients who had consumed more time, incidence of osteoporosis and osteopenia were reported more often (P > 0.05). Among patients with osteopenia, 85.71% of the patients in the hip region and 44.44% of them in the lumber area had decreased bone density. Also, osteoporosis was more reported in hip (90.48%), lumbar (90.48%) and femoral neck (80.95%) respectively.
Conclusion
A significant reduction in bone density was observed in patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving Tenofovir for more than 12 months in comparison with the control group. Also, the patients who had been taking Tenofovir in longer time, osteoporosis and osteopenia were more reported."

abstract = "Background
In India according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data 1, 31,666 people committed suicide and out of this 12,360 were farmers committed in 2014. When the suicide rate increases in a particular group in society, it is often an indicator that there are factors in the general environment which are placing selective pressure on the group in question. The present study examines the mental health status of Farmers in Maharashtra, India.
Methods
The cross-sectional study design was adopted to conduct this study. Three hundred (300) Household were selected for this study. The sample size was distributed proportionately in each village using Probability Proportional to size (PPS) sampling method. Households were stratified based on the loan amount to ensure that all types of borrower-farmers were included in the sample. The loan amounts were classified into three categories: up to Rs. 30,000, Rs. 31,000 to Rs. 60,000, and more than Rs. 60,000. Univariate, Bivariate and logistic regression analysis have been conducted.
Results
More than half 58%of farmers have reported distress of mental health and 41.7% farmers were reported no distress of mental health in last two weeks. Mean of the mental health status of farmers is 0.58, and standard deviation (SD) is 0.49.The most commonly reported symptoms of mental health relate to anxiety and insomnia, with 55% of farmers suffering from this symptoms. The second highest ranking prevalence of symptoms is somatic problems (34.7%).
Conclusion
The immediate clinical and non-clinical interventions should be initiated to mitigate the suicides among the farmers."

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease of iron regulation associated with iron overload and failure of several organs. Whether mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene increase cardiovascular disease risk is still undetermined. In the present study, we aimed to analyse the influence of HFE C282Y gene mutation on the risk of development of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the north Indian population.
Materials and method
The study included hundred CAD patients who showed presence of greater than 50% luminal stenosis in at least one major coronary artery in angiography. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of CAD patients using a DNA extraction kit (Gene Aid, India) following the manufacturer's protocol. The HFE C282Y gene mutation was investigated by AS-PCR.
Results
The results showed that out of 100 CAD patients 19 patients were positive for HFE C282Y mutation and 81 patients were negative for mutation. We also evaluated HFE C282Y gene mutation frequency in CAD patients with respect to disease severity and we found there was no significant difference of mutation frequency observed with respect to disease severity in CAD patients cohort i e, those with single coronary artery or those with 2/3 coronary arteries involvement.
Conclusion
This study concludes that C282Y mutation plays no significant role in coronary artery disease development or its severity. Thus, there is a need to study this mutation in a large cohort of samples so as to elucidate the exact role of C282Y mutation in CAD."

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) magnifies the role of preoperative imaging for detailed inner and middle ear anatomical information and enhances more efforts for better dependent correlation and measurements of round window (RW).
Objectives
The aim of this study was to find an appropriate way by HRCT imaging for the prediction of the visibility of the round window during cochlear implant (CI) surgery.
Methods
The study was conducted using hospital information from patients referring the Khuzestan Cochlear Implant Center (2017–2018). 87 patients underwent cochlear implant surgery, 56 patients with high resolution CT scans were included in the study. All patients underwent surgical treatment via posterior tympanotomy approach.
Results
56 patients were examined. Patients were divided into three groups: children (0–12 years) and adolescence (18-13 years) and adults (19–59 years), of whom 45 patients (80.4%) were children, and 3 patients were adolescence (5.4%) and 8 patients (14.3%) were adults. 22 patients (39.3%) were fully visible and 13 patients (23.2%) were partially visible and 21 (37.5%) patients were difficult to visualize. In high-resolution imaging studies, mastoid 2 cases (3.6%) were poorly aerated and 8 cases (14.3%) were moderately aerated and 46 (86.1%) were well aerated. The amount of round window overhanging in 43 patients (76.8%) was 4.4 and in 12 patients (21.4%) was 3.4%.
Conclusion
The presence of the air cell around the facial recess may provide easier access to the facial recess. There was a significant relationship between the RW in the operation and the angle between the RW and the facial nerve and the coronal axis. There is no significant relationship between the visibility of the RW and the facial recess, Vertical height RW and facial nerve (FN), the distance between the FN and the posterior canal in the axial, the angle between the FN and inner margin of RW, and the angle between the FN and the tympanic annulus with the inner margin RW in the Axial and FRL was not found."

Few recent studies have demonstrated that in India diabetes prevalence varies geographically. Differences in individual-level factors and socioeconomic status are common explanations for this variation. However, we have not come across any study on diabetes spatial clusters at the district-level among reproductive-age women in southern India. Therefore, the study was carried out to understand the spatial clustering of diabetes prevalence among reproductive-age women and its spatial determinants in southern India.
Methods
National Family Health Survey (2015–16) data was used to estimate High Blood Glucose (HBG) and Very High Blood Glucose (VHBG) prevalence for women aged 15–49 years in 99 districts of southern India. We adopted advanced spatial statistical analysis such as Moran's Index and spatial regression techniques to address the study objectives.
Results
Remarkable variations were found in HBG and VHBG prevalence among 99 districts in southern India. Spatial association of HBG was found in 4 districts, and VHBG was found in 7 districts, which were hotspots. The value of the bivariate Moran's I statistics confirmed the spatial dependence between HBG and VHBG with a set of independent variables. District-level prevalence of HBG and VHBG have shown significant spatial clustering across southern Indian districts. The adjusted coefficients from the spatial error model confirmed that district-level proportion of tobacco use, overweight, obese, and general caste had significant associations with HBG and VHBG prevalence.
Conclusion
The study suggests that there is need for targeted intervention programs to address diabetes among reproductive-age women in high priority districts in southern India."

The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between Gastro-esophageal reflux diseases (GERD) related symptoms and psychological symptomatology, as well as clinically diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or panic disorder (PD) and effectiveness of Sertraline and benzodiazepines in controlling these conditions.
Methodology
A 6 months prospective study was conducted in gastroenterology outpatient department of a tertiary care referral hospital. Refractory GERD was diagnosed by assessing proton pump inhibitor failure over 4 week trial of standard doses of PPIs. Therapy with Benzodiazepines and Sertraline was initiated in patients with refractory GERD having panic and anxiety symptoms associated with refractory GERD. Effectiveness of the therapy was measured using panic and agoraphobia scale and Hamilton anxiety scale. Reduction in the severity of GERD symptoms was assessed using GERD – Health related quality of life scale.
Results
The occurrence of PD or GAD in patients with refractory GERD in our sample was found to be 68% and 32% respectively. There was a significant decrease in the score of GERD HRQOL after the administration of sertraline and benzodiazepines when compared to the score of GERD HRQOL before administration of interventional drugs (p = 0.001).
Conclusion
Our study investigated the role of anxiety and panic in refractory GERD and their effect on quality of life. The results indicated that quality of life of patients were highly improved as indicated by severity scores after administration with sertraline and benzodiazepines. The novel therapy of sertraline and benzodiazepines are highly effective in controlling reflux like symptoms and coexisting anxiety and panic disorder in refractory GERD."

Sensation Seeking is one of the complex behaviors among novice drivers, which leads to road traffic injuries. Globally, road traffic crashes are a leading cause of death among young people, the main cause of death among those who fall in the age group of 15–29 years. Road traffic injuries are currently estimated to be the ninth leading cause of death across all age groups globally and are predicted to become the seventh leading cause of death by 2030. As per the World Health Organization (WHO) report, low and middle-income countries lose approximately 3% of GDP as a result of road traffic crashes.
Objective
To assess the sensation-seeking behavior among novice drivers in Udupi Taluk.
Methodology
The cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the sensation-seeking behavior among novice drivers with an estimated sample size of 150. The study participants were selected by using the Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS) form V questionnaire developed by Zuckerman. The questionnaire includes 40 questions which are divided into four sub-scales which include boredom susceptibility, disinhibition, experience-seeking, thrill and adventure-seeking. Each sub-scale contains ten items and scoring is given with two options as High and Low. Data collected is analyzed by using Microsoft Excel, SPSS and presented as descriptives i.e., frequency and percentage.
Results
The results were examined according to the levels of sensation seeking scale. Sensation seeking for boredom susceptibility is 22.3% (High), disinhibition is 27.27% (High), experience seeking is 28.6% (High), thrill and adventure-seeking is 60.6% (High). Cross-tabulating the questions with age, gender, education was statistically significant (p < 0.05) associated with risky driving behavior among novice drivers.
Conclusion
Thus, this study reveals that most of the participants are showing a high percentage of thrill and adventure-seeking compared to the remaining three sub-scales, which calls for localized intervention targeting it."
