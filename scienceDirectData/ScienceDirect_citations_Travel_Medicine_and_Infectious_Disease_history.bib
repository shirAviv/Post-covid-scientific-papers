abstract = "Background
Travelers to international mass gatherings may be exposed to conditions which increase their risk of acquiring infectious diseases. Most existing data come from single clinical sites seeing returning travelers, or relate to single events.
Methods
Investigators evaluated ill travelers returning from a mass gathering, and presenting to a GeoSentinel site between August 2015 and April 2019, and collected data on the nature of the event and the relation between final diagnoses and the mass gathering.
Results
Of 296 ill travelers, 51% were female and the median age was 54 years (range: 1–88). Over 82% returned from a religious mass gathering, most frequently Umrah or Hajj. Only 3% returned from the Olympics in Brazil or South Korea. Other mass gatherings included other sporting events, cultural or entertainment events, and conferences. Respiratory diseases accounted for almost 80% of all diagnoses, with vaccine preventable illnesses such as influenza and pneumonia accounting for 26% and 20% of all diagnoses respectively. This was followed by gastrointestinal illnesses, accounting for 4.5%. Sixty-three percent of travelers reported having a pre-travel encounter with a healthcare provider.
Conclusions
Despite this surveillance being limited to patients presenting to GeoSentinel sites, our findings highlight the importance of respiratory diseases at mass gatherings, the need for pre-travel consultations before mass gatherings, and consideration of vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal disease."

abstract = "Background
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is currently being examined for COVID-19. No previous meta-analysis has evaluated its side effects versus placebo. We conducted this meta-analysis to compare the safety of HCQ versus placebo.
Methods
Two authors independently searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults comparing the adverse events (AEs) of HCQ versus placebo for any indication. Peto odds ratios (Peto ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based on random-effects models. The heterogeneity (I2) was assessed using Cochran's Q test.
Results
Nine RCTs (eight were double-blind) with a total of 916 patients were included. HCQ caused significantly more skin pigmentation than placebo (Peto OR, 4.64; 95% CI, 1.13 to 19.00; P-value = 0.033; I2 = 0%). The increase in other AEs did not reach statistical significance: rash (Peto OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.3 to 3.77; P-value = 0.03; I2 = 0%); gastrointestinal AEs (Peto OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.55 to 3.72; P-value = 0.46; I2 = 15.17%); headache (Peto OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.65 to 5.78; P-value = 0.23; I2 = 9.99%); dizziness (Peto OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.49 to 3.52; P-value = 0.58; I2 = 0%); fatigue (Peto OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 0.76 to 5.98; P-value = 0.15; I2 = 0%); and visual AEs (Peto OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.76 to 3.41; P-value = 0.22; I2 = 0%). Cardiac toxicity was not reported.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis of RCTs found a significantly higher risk of skin pigmentation in HCQ users versus placebo. More data are needed to evaluate HCQ in the context of COVID-19 treatment."

Toxoplasmosis is a zoonosis caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. In immunocompetent patients the infection is usually benign. However, cases of severe and even lethal primo-infections are regularly reported in South America. In contrast, data from tropical Africa are fragmentary.
Methods
Data for French cases of severe toxoplasmosis acquired between 2013 and 2018, in tropical Africa and among immunocompetent patients were collected retrospectively in 2018.
Results
Four male patients with a mean age of 34-years were identified. All infections originated in West or Central Africa. The clinical presentations were heterogeneous: two patients had severe disseminated toxoplasmosis, of which one presented with chorioretinitis associated with myositis and the other with febrile pneumopathy; one patient presented with post-infectious acute cerebellar ataxia and the final case had general symptoms and skin manifestations. The diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis was confirmed by serology in four patients. Molecular diagnosis confirmed T. gondii infection in three patients with Africa 1 as the dominant genotype. The infection was cured with anti-infective treatment in all four patients. Ocular sequelae were reported in the two patients with chorioretinitis.
Conclusions
Imported cases of severe toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent patients are rare in France. However, this aetiology should be evoked rapidly in a patient with a severe infectious syndrome who has recently visited or originated from tropical Africa."

Typhoid fever usually manifests as an acute disease. However, asymptomatic carriage with Salmonella Typhi may occur. This study investigated a family setting of severe typhoid fever in Switzerland months after return from Bangladesh.
Method
Standard microbiological procedures were performed. Testing for S. Typhi IgM antibodies was done using a novel immunochromographic lateral flow assay. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) followed by comparative core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) was performed on the S. Typhi isolates.
Results
Four months after returning from a visit to Bangladesh sibling 1 (9 months) was diagnosed with a S. Typhi meningitis and sibling 3 (8 years) was identified as asymptomatic S. Typhi carrier. Sibling 2 (2 years) was retrospectively diagnosed with typhoid fever by IgM serology at the time point of admission to the hospital. Parents were asymptomatic and culture-negative. WGS analysis of family S. Typhi isolates showed clonality and strongest homology with S. Typhi strains occurring in Bangladesh. The S. Typhi strain showed resistance against fluoroquinolones. A 4-week course of ceftriaxone resulted in full recovery of sibling 1. S. Typhi was eradicated from sibling 3 following azithromycin treatment for 14 days.
Conclusion
S. Typhi, acquired from a visit to Bangladesh, was most likely transmitted within the family from one brother as asymptomatic shedder to his 9-month-old brother who manifested S. Typhi meningitis as a very rare and life-threatening presentation of typhoid fever. S. Typhi infection should be considered even in case of uncommon manifestations and irrespective of the interval between disease presentation and travel to an endemic area."

abstract = "Background
An ongoing epidemic of respiratory diseases caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID 2019, SARS-CoV2) started in Wuhan, Hubei, in China at the end of December 2019. The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We decided to test them all for SARS-Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the population and decision-makers.
Methods
We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using several real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays.
Results
We tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative. By optimising the sampling process, sending samples sequentially and reducing the time-scale for biological analysis, we were able to test the samples within 5 h (including sampling, shipment and biological tests).
Conclusion
Optimising our procedures reduces anxiety and reassures the population and decision makers."

Spain is the European country with the highest number of Trypanosoma cruzi infected patients. Due to the cardiac complications that these patients can develop, it is of paramount importance to evaluate the value of the different heart diagnostic tools.
Method
In this observational study, we describe the main characteristics and data from electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 141 patients with Chagas’ disease attended in a tertiary university hospital in Madrid from 2009 to 2018.
Results
A total of 50 patients (35.4%) had at least one abnormal cardiac test: 34.2% altered electrocardiogram (40/117), 24.5% altered echocardiogram (27/110) and 9.2% abnormal cardiac MRI (13/41). Of those 13 with a pathological MRI, 53.8% had normal results for any other test. The most frequent alterations observed were hypokinesia with decreased LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction), dilatation of cavities and cardiac fibrosis. Two thirds of patients with abnormal cardiac test were asymptomatic. Altered echocardiogram was found in 43.8% of patients ≥50 years compared to 16.6% under 50 years (p = 0.003).
Conclusions
A transthoracic echocardiogram and a MRI of the heart added a 23.8% increment in diagnosing cardiac pathological findings."

abstract = "Background
Routine vaccination for children drastically reduces measles cases. Nonetheless, the global resurgence of measles since 2018 highlights the need for evaluating vaccine-induced immunity in an era of high vaccination coverage, especially in international travelers. This study aims to identify high-risk persons via analyzing the impact of age and different vaccination schedules on seroprevalence of measles in a country with high vaccination coverage, attempting to provide suggestions regarding pre-travel measles vaccination in highly immunized countries.
Method
We retrospectively collected serological results of measles from Taiwanese travelers during 2008–2017 and middle-aged subjects from community during 2007–2009. Participants were classified by age groups and cohort based on the national immunization program: cohort I (pre-mass vaccination), cohort II (suboptimal measles vaccination), and cohort III (2-dose MMR in childhood). The effects of age group on seropositivity was shown by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) in a logistic regression model.
Results
The overall measles seroprevalence was 74.5% (N = 1096, mean age = 31.7 ± 12.3 years), with adolescents having the lowest seropositivity (65.9%) and participants ≥50 years having the highest (89.4%). Seropositivity was significantly higher in cohort I (pre-mass vaccination) compared with the other 2 cohorts (P < 0.0001). The effect of aging on seropositivity was only significant in cohort II (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.13–2.99, P = 0.014 for 30–39 years vs. 20–29 years).
Conclusions
Waning immunity to measles in adolescents and young adults is a dominant issue in highly vaccinated cohorts. Enhancing pre-travel vaccination against measles can effectively fill the immunity gaps in highly immunized countries."

Between January 24, 2020 and February 15, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred among 335 passengers on a flight from Singapore to Hangzhou in China. This study aimed to investigate the source of the outbreak and assess the risk of transmission of COVID-19 during the flight.
Method
Using a standardized questionnaire, we collected information on the travelers’ demographic characteristics and illness before, during, and after the flight. We also collected data on factors potentially associated with COVID-19 transmission during the flight.
Results
A total of 16 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed among all passengers; the overall attack rate was 4.8%. The attack rate among passengers who had departed from Wuhan was significantly higher than that among those who had departed from other places. One passenger without an epidemiological history of exposure before boarding developed COVID-19. During the flight, he was seated near four infected passengers from Wuhan for approximately an hour and did not wear his facemask correctly during the flight.
Conclusions
COVID-19 transmission may have occurred during the flight. However, the majority of the cases in the flight-associated outbreak could not be attributed to transmission on the flight but were associated with exposure to the virus in Wuhan or to infected members in a single tour group."

Travelers’ diarrhea (TD) is the most common illness experienced by travelers to developing regions of the world and may be caused by bacterial, parasitic or viral pathogens. The available diagnostic tests include stool microscopy for parasitic infections, culture-dependent methods for bacterial infections and molecular methods for bacterial, parasitic and viral infections.
Method
We retrospectively evaluated demographic, clinical and microbiological data of patients presenting with TD at our travel clinic between 2009 and 2017.
Results
Among 676 patients with TD included in our study, at least one etiologic agent was found in 21% (n = 145) of cases. In total, 195 enteropathogens were detected of which 110 were bacteria, 70 protozoa and 15 helminths. Bacterial infections were significantly more common when symptoms were present less than 14 days and travel duration did not exceed 29 days. Protozoa and helminths were predominantly detected in patients with longer lasting complaints. After stool culture was replaced by a multiplex-PCR gastrointestinal pathogen panel (GPP) at our center, significantly more intestinal bacterial pathogens were detected.
Conclusions
Our results support an individualized approach in the diagnostic workup of patients with TD taking host and travel characteristics into account to avoid unnecessary diagnostic testing. Molecular culture-independent diagnostic stool tests provide better coverage of the variety of etiological agents than traditional stool culture and have the benefit of rapid detection. However, the high sensitivity bears challenges differentiating colonization from infection."

A novel coronavirus emerged in China in December 2019, and human-to-human transmission was previously identified. This study aimed to compare the epidemiological characteristics in Jiangsu Province and assess whether so-called wartime control measures changed the trend of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the province.
Methods
Epidemiological data were obtained from the websites of China's Bureau of Health and the People's Government of Jiangsu Province and informal online sources from January 22 to February 20, 2020.
Results
The cumulative number of patients in Jiangsu Province (over 79 million people) was 613. The number of daily confirmed new cases reached the inflection point on January 31 with the maximum of 39 cases. The temporal number of patients peaked from January 29 to February 9. The proportion of confirmed cases who were residents or travelers to Hubei Province was 100.0%–58.8% before January 31 and then gradually declined. The proportion of close contacts increased gradually from January 27 to February 17. The geographical distribution of COVID-2019 cases showed that all 13 cites reported confirmed new cases after only five days of the first confirmed new case in Suzhou. The cases were concentrated in Nanjing, Suzhou, and Xuzhou with a high population density (over eight million people). The epidemiological features of COVID-2019 cases in Wuxi, Jiangsu showed that seven confirmed cases were tourists from others areas beyond Hubei Province. The longest incubation period of COVID-2019 was 19 days based on the onset of laboratory-confirmed cases.
Conclusion
The number of daily confirmed new cases in Jiangsu Province peaked around January 31 and then declined. This result emphasized that wartime control measures, such as putting cities on lockdown to limit population mobility in Jiangsu Province, resulted in dramatic reductions in COVID-19 cases."

Medical problems are prevalent among young travellers. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to investigate the impact of country-specific pre-departure preparation in the occurrence of medical and psychological problems among Australian gap year.
Methods
Participants were recruited during two periods, 2013-14 and 2017-18 from an organisation that specialises in gap year placements. Based on results of our previous study of the 2013-14 cohort, improvements in the pre-departure preparation were introduced. Demographic, placement, and pre-departure preparation characteristics as well as psychological stressors, coping mechanisms, and medical problems were collected and compared between the two cohorts.
Results
Demographic and placement characteristics were similar between the two cohorts. There was a significant increase in the proportion of travellers that read the briefing material (from 80% to 100%; p-value<0.001), carried a first aid kit (from 26% to 62%; p-value<0.001), and accessed information on how to deal with common health problems (from 46% to 61%; p-value = 0.047). All psychological stressors decreased, except for feeling home sick that remained high (72%). Medical problems remained prevalent; half of the gap year travellers sought medical attention, yet there was a significant reduction in sunburn (from 59% to 37%; p-value = 0.040), diarrhoea/food poisoning (from 44% to 21%; p-value = 0.015), weight change (from 41% to 16%; p-value = 0.006), and skin infections (from 38% to 9%; p-value<0.001).

Of 4,125 immigrants observed in the study period, 3,839 (93.0%) agreed to be screened: 381 (9.9%) resulted HBsAg-positive, 136 (3.5%) anti-HCV, 62 (1.6%) anti-HIV and 1,448 (37.7%) HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc-positive. Ongoing or previous HBV infection was observed more frequently in males (p = 0.02 and p < 0.001, respectively), whereas HIV infection in females (p = 0.01). Immigrants from western Africa showed a higher rate of HBsAg positivity (p < 0.0001), HBsAg negativity/anti-HBc positivity (p < 0.0001) and anti-HIV positivity (p = 0.004) compared with those from other geographical areas. At multivariate analysis, ongoing HBV infection was associated with male sex (OR 1.49, 95% CI: 1.04–2.14) and origin from western Africa (OR 4.67, 95% CI: 1.70–12.80) and eastern Europe (OR 3.44, 95% CI: 1.17–10.08). HCV infection showed the tendency to be more frequent among males (OR 1.84, 95% CI: 0.99–3.42). HIV infection was associated with an older age (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.06), origin from western Africa (OR 4.09, 95% CI: 1.26–13.29) and female sex (OR 2.38, 95% CI: 1.29–4,39; p = 0.006).
Conclusions
The high prevalence of HBV, HCV and HIV infections in our large cohort of immigrants should definitively prompt Italian Healthcare Authorities to develop adequate cost-effective screening policies."

abstract = "Background
The Preparedness Plan for Surveillance and Interventions on Emerging Vector-Borne Diseases (VBDs) in Southern Switzerland outlines the strategy for preventing and managing potential outbreaks, as well as the surveillance and control activities with a specific focus on Aedes-borne diseases transmitted by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The objective of the plan is to provide Public Health Authorities with a framework of preventive and control measures according to the situation and level of epidemic risks.
Material and methods
The plan is divided into various phases representing the different steps for all potential situations, ranging from no vectors and no transmission risk to epidemic levels with multiple autochthonous/local cases of hospitalization (and deaths) until the end of the epidemic. An algorithm presents how decisions are taken to move from one phase of the plan to another, with detailed activities for different partners and strategies for each specific phase.
Results
The different phases of the plan include activities on disease surveillance and clinical case management, on vector surveillance and control, communication and coordination of activities. The plan is divided into 5 phases of activities and decision levels. From phase 0 (no cases) to phase 1 (low number of local cases, less than 5), phase 2 (small outbreak with more than 5 local cases), phase 3 (epidemic) and phase 4 (return to no more cases).
Conclusion
The plan has been approved by the cantonal authorities and will be submitted to federal authorities. The required implementation tests will begin shortly."

Chronic schistosomiasis silently leads to severe organ-specific disorders, such as hydroureter, bladder cancer or portal hypertension in around 10% of infected people in endemic zones. However, in non-endemic areas, information on schistosomiasis' severe complications and their actual prevalence is scarce because diagnosis is usually reached when such complications are well established.
Methods
Retrospective observational study of data obtained from a screening protocol designed for sub-Saharan migrants including search for stool parasites and schistosoma serology. After screening 3090 sub-Saharans, 326 (10.5%) confirmed cases of schistosomiasis were found, based on detection of ova in feces, urine or in biopsy samples. Another 830 patients (26.9%) were diagnosed of probable schistosomiasis (positive serology and/or suggestive imaging findings).
Results
Only patients with confirmed schistosomiasis were included in the final analysis. Among them, 13 (4%) presented severe complications at the time of diagnosis. Depending on the location, they account for 5% of patients with hepatointestinal schistosomiasis and 3.5% of patients with urogenital infection.
Conclusions
Targeted systematic screening could reduce the prevalence of severe complications by enabling early diagnosis and treatment. Having indigenous transmission been demonstrated in southern Europe, prevention of future cases in non-endemic countries might be another sound reason supporting such screening."

Intercontinental travel contributes to the spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-PE). We assessed risk factors for intestinal ESBL-PE colonization in people travelling to low and middle income countries in the tropics and subtropics to better understand how travel affects ESBL-PE spread.
Method
This prospective cohort study in travellers attending a travel clinic in Leipzig, Germany was conducted in 2016–2017. Information on risk factors related to travel, symptoms, antibiotic use, health care usage, accommodation, destination, diet and hygiene was collected by questionnaire after travel. Stools were phenotypically tested for ESBL-PE before and after travel. Risk factors for ESBL-PE colonization were identified using logistic regression.
Results
Of the 230 travellers that were ESBL-PE negative before travelling, 23% (n = 53) travellers returned positive. Multivariable analyses showed that age, type of accommodation and travelling to Asia were associated with ESBL-PE colonization.
Conclusions
Given that a considerable amount of travellers returned with ESBL-PE, we recommend raising awareness in returning high-risk travellers, e.g. those returning from high-risk areas. They should be aware that they may carry antimicrobial-resistant bacteria after travel, and how they can prevent its spread. The role of the type of accommodation as a factor favouring intestinal colonization with ESBL-PE requires further investigation."

An epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 in China leading to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date.
Methods
We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed separately. For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5–92.9%), cough (57.6%, 95%CI 40.8–74.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 95%CI 10.9–80.4%) were the most prevalent manifestations. Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0–30.6%) required intensive care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95%CI 13.7–51.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1–9.3) with shock. Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.2–21.5%) of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR).
Conclusion
COVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in patients with comorbidities. ICU was required for approximately 20% of polymorbid, COVID-19 infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a CFR of >13%. As this virus spreads globally, countries need to urgently prepare human resources, infrastructure and facilities to treat severe COVID-19."

The Italian and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines both recommend a systematic serological screening for strongyloidiasis in sub-Saharan migrants (SSA), however, studies on clinical and economic impact of this strategy in the Italian and European settings are lacking.
Methods
A population of 100,000 migrants from SSA to Italy was considered and a Markov decision tree model was developed to assess the clinical and economic impact of two interventions for strongyloidiasis compared with the current practice (passive diagnosis of symptomatic cases): a) universal serological screening and treatment with ivermectin in case of positive test b) universal presumptive treatment with ivermectin. One and 10-year time horizon in the health-care perspective were considered.
Results
In the one and 10-year time horizon respectively the costs for passive diagnosis was €1,164,169 and €9,735,908, those for screening option was € 2,856,011 and € 4,959,638 and those for presumptive treatment was €3,538,474 and € 4,883,272. Considering the cost per cured subject in the one-year time horizon, screening appears more favorable (€209.53), than the other two options (€232.55 per presumptive treatment and €10,197.29 per current strategy). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICERs) of screening strategy and presumptive treatment were respectively 265.27 and 333.19. The sensitivity analysis identified strongyloidiasis’ prevalence as the main driver of ICER.
Conclusions
Compared to the current practice (passive diagnosis) both screening and presumptive treatment strategies are more favorable from a cost-effectiveness point of view, with a slight advantage of the screening strategy in a one-year time horizon."

In our institute in Marseille, France, we initiated early and massive screening for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hospitalization and early treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (HCQ-AZ) was proposed for the positive cases.
Methods
We retrospectively report the clinical management of 3,737 screened patients, including 3,119 (83.5%) treated with HCQ-AZ (200 mg of oral HCQ, three times daily for ten days and 500 mg of oral AZ on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days, respectively) for at least three days and 618 (16.5%) patients treated with other regimen (“others”). Outcomes were death, transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), ≥10 days of hospitalization and viral shedding.
Results
The patients’ mean age was 45 (sd 17) years, 45% were male, and the case fatality rate was 0.9%. We performed 2,065 low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans highlighting lung lesions in 592 of the 991 (59.7%) patients with minimal clinical symptoms (NEWS score = 0). A discrepancy between spontaneous dyspnoea, hypoxemia and lung lesions was observed. Clinical factors (age, comorbidities, NEWS-2 score), biological factors (lymphocytopenia; eosinopenia; decrease in blood zinc; and increase in D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine phosphokinase, and C-reactive protein) and moderate and severe lesions detected in low-dose CT scans were associated with poor clinical outcome. Treatment with HCQ-AZ was associated with a decreased risk of transfer to ICU or death (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.18 0.11–0.27), decreased risk of hospitalization ≥10 days (odds ratios 95% CI 0.38 0.27–0.54) and shorter duration of viral shedding (time to negative PCR: HR 1.29 1.17–1.42). QTc prolongation (>60 ms) was observed in 25 patients (0.67%) leading to the cessation of treatment in 12 cases including 3 cases with QTc> 500 ms. No cases of torsade de pointe or sudden death were observed.
Conclusion
Although this is a retrospective analysis, results suggest that early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment of COVID-19 patients, with at least 3 days of HCQ-AZ lead to a significantly better clinical outcome and a faster viral load reduction than other treatments."

Sixty cases of rabies in international travellers from 1990 to 2012 were previously reviewed. We present here an update of rabies cases in international travellers from 2013 to 2019.
Methods
We systematically reviewed the existing literature and collected 23 cases of rabies in individuals who crossed an international border between the time of infection and diagnosis, or who were infected following expatriation or migration.
Results
Most cases were in male adult travellers and diagnosed in Europe and the Middle East, with most exposures in Asia or in Africa. Migrants originating from rabies-endemic low-and-middle income countries and their descendants accounted for two thirds of cases. Other cases were in tourists, business travellers and expatriates. Median travel duration (excluding migration trip) was 60 days (range 7–240 days). Most cases were due to dog bites and most common clinical presentation was furious rabies. In most patients (74%), no rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (RPEP) was administered before rabies symptoms appeared. Other patients received incomplete RPEP series.
Conclusion
Rabies should be suspected in any patient with encephalitis or paralysis who travelled to, or migrated from a rabies-endemic country. Comprehensive information about a rabies risk should be given to travellers to rabies endemic countries, notably migrants visiting friends and relatives."

Methods
For this observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study, information was obtained from the Hospitals and the Ministry of Health for the cases that were laboratory-diagnosed and related, during March 2020. rRT-PCR was used for the detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 following the protocol Charité, Berlin, Germany, from nasopharyngeal swabs.
Results
Among 152 suspected cases investigated, 12 (7.9%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infected by rRT-PCR. The median age was 39 years (IQR 25–43), six of them male. Two cases proceed from Italy and three from Spain. Nine patients presented fever, and cough, five sore throat, and myalgia, among other symptoms. Only a 60 y-old woman with hypertension was hospitalized. None of the patients required ICU nor fatalities occurred in this group.

Here, we present a case of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in a patient who suffers from advanced Takayasu-Arteritis, requiring TNF-α inhibition with infliximab. The primary CL lesions in this 47-year-old, female patient were caused by Leishmania panamensis and occurred after a touristic trip to Panama on her right foot. The lesions first resolved under treatment with liposomal amphotericin B. However, ten months later, the patient returned with relapsing lesions requiring further treatment. We discuss the challenges and risks of leishmaniasis in patients with TNF-α inhibition and the rare phenomenon of relapsing CL and the management hereof. We review published cases of CL associated with TNF-α inhibition. A growing body of evidence now suggests that especially CL (and visceral leishmaniasis (VL)) can be associated with TNF-α inhibition. The host response to leishmaniasis is of the Th1-type and TNF-α and interferon-gamma expression are crucial for disease control. Inversely, TNF-α inhibition can lead to complicated and relapsing progression of leishmanial infection. Therefore, we propose that CL and VL should be considered in at-risk patients receiving immunosuppressants."

Annual malaria cases steadily increased in the last decade, reaching 428 in 2017 (all species). An estimated 15% of P.falciparum cases were severe. Between 2014 and 2017, 727 P.falciparum cases were reported and six non-immune travellers presented late recurrence. Five had hyperparasitaemia and/or signs of severe malaria at initial consultation. No mutations in ACT drug resistance markers were detected, although pfcrt-pfmdr1 haplotypes associated with lumefantrine tolerance were common.
Conclusions
The upward trend in imported malaria, the substantial proportion of severe cases and the emergence of ACT failures are sources of concern, although late failures were infrequent. Genetic analysis did not support parasitological resistance to ACT, suggesting prospective pharmacokinetic studies should assess adequacy of partner drug dosage and duration of treatment in non-immune populations."

abstract = "Background
Malaria is one of the most life-threatening vector-borne diseases globally. Recent autochthonous cases registered in several European countries have raised awareness regarding the threat of malaria reintroduction to Europe. An increasing number of imported malaria cases today occur due to international travel and migrant flows from malaria-endemic countries. The cumulative factors of the presence of competent vectors, favourable climatic conditions and evidence of increasing temperatures might lead to the re-emergence of malaria in countries where the infection was previously eliminated.
Methods
We performed a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines. We searched for original articles focusing on rising temperature and the receptivity to malaria transmission in Europe. We evaluated the quality of the selected studies using a standardised tool.
Results
The search resulted in 1′999 articles of possible relevance and after screening we included 10 original research papers in the quantitative analysis for the systematic review. With further increasing temperatures studies predicted a northward spread of the occurrence of Anopheles mosquitoes and an extension of seasonality, enabling malaria transmission for annual periods up to 6 months in the years 2051–2080. Highest vector stability and receptivity were predicted in Southern and South-Eastern European areas. Anopheles atroparvus, the main potential malaria vector in Europe, might play an important role under changing conditions favouring malaria transmission.
Conclusion
The receptivity of Europe for malaria transmission will increase as a result of rising temperature unless socioeconomic factors remain favourable and appropriate public health measures are implemented. Our systematic review serves as an evidence base for future preventive measures."

The extremely rapid international spread of the disease with significant morbidity and mortality made finding possible therapeutic interventions a global priority. While approved specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 are still lacking, a large number of existing drugs are being explored as a possible treatment for COVID-19 infected patients. Recent publications have re-examined the use of Chloroquine (CQ) and/or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential therapeutic option for these patients. In an attempt to explore the evidence that supports their use in COVID-19 patients, we comprehensively reviewed the previous studies which used CQ or HCQ as an antiviral treatment. Both CQ and HCQ demonstrated promising in vitro results, however, such data have not yet been translated into meaningful in vivo studies. While few clinical trials have suggested some beneficial effects of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 patients, most of the reported data are still preliminary. Given the current uncertainty, it is worth being mindful of the potential risks and strictly rationalise the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients until further high quality randomized clinical trials are available to clarify their role in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19."

abstract = "Background
No large-scale Zika epidemic has been observed to date in Southeast Asia following the 2015-16 Latin American and the Caribbean epidemic. One hypothesis is Southeast Asian populations’ partial immunity to Zika.
Method
We estimated the two conditions for a Zika outbreak emergence in Southeast Asia: (i) the risk of Zika introduction from Latin America and the Caribbean and, (ii) the risk of autochthonous transmission under varying assumptions on population immunity. We also validated the model used to estimate the risk of introduction by comparing the estimated number of Zika seeds introduced into the United States with case counts reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Results
There was good agreement between our estimates and case counts reported by the CDC. We thus applied the model to Southeast Asia and estimated that, on average, 1–10 seeds were introduced into Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. We also found increasing population immunity levels from 0 to 90% reduced probability of autochthonous transmission by 40% and increasing individual variation in transmission further reduced the outbreak probability.
Conclusions
Population immunity, combined with heterogeneity in transmission, can explain why no large-scale outbreak was observed in Southeast Asia during the 2015-16 epidemic."

Zika virus (ZIKV) was initially responsible for a limited number of punctual epidemics throughout Africa and Asia. Recently, large epidemics occurred in French Polynesia, Brazil and Pan-America. These outbreaks were associated with severe outcomes such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome and microcephaly of in-utero infected newborns. Previous studies demonstrated that ZIKV was introduced in Brazil from French Polynesia but failed to identify a founding event.
Method
All publicly available ZIKV full-genome sequences (n = 182) were phylogenetically analyzed, using Bayesian method, to estimate the introduction date of ZIKV into Brazil.
Results
Introduction date into Brazil was estimated between 8th of July 2013 and 4th of November 2013, encompassing the Beach Soccer World Cup held in French Polynesia, in September 2013, which gathered Brazilian athletes and supporters. We also observed that ZIKV sequences from travelers infected in South-East Asia or in Pacific islands were closely related to viruses identified prior to the French Polynesian epidemic, underlining an endemic circulation of ZIKV in those countries since 2007, at least.
Conclusion
This work provides a narrower estimation of ZIKV introduction into Brazil and illustrates the need for a better exploration of ZIKV circulation and endemicity in South-East Asia, while epidemiological and prevention efforts have been mainly focused on the Pan-American epidemic."

Air travel has never been easier, cheaper or faster, with large volumes of people travelling around the world. These factors increase the risk of the spread of infectious diseases by air travel. Little is known, however, about the extent to which airlines provide information to passengers on infection control and measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. This study examined the websites of the global commercial passenger airlines to see if they contained information about infection control and prevention of infectious diseases and appraised the clinical usefulness of that information.
Method
A cross-sectional text-based analysis of the 73 airline websites from the six global commercial passenger airline conglomerates was performed to identify information about infection control and prevention of infectious between July and August 2019.
Results
Of the 73 airline websites, less than half (n = 35, 28.6%) contained information deemed useful for passengers. While there was a range of general health advice within the websites, there was limited information about infection control and preventing infectious diseases. A minority of websites contained information about vaccination status prior to travel, and to a lesser extent handwashing and hand hygiene, with very few including disease-specific advice or preventive measures.
Conclusions
Airline websites are an underutilised source of information for infection control and the prevention of infectious diseases. Providing passengers with information on basic infection control and prevention measures may support the global efforts against the spread of infectious diseases."

We need an effective treatment to cure COVID-19 patients and to decrease virus carriage duration.
Methods
We conducted an uncontrolled, non-comparative, observational study in a cohort of 80 relatively mildly infected inpatients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least three days, with three main measurements: clinical outcome, contagiousness as assessed by PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU).
Results
All patients improved clinically except one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74 year-old patient still in intensive care. A rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load was noted, with 83% negative at Day7, and 93% at Day8. Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples were negative in 97.5% of patients at Day5. Consequently patients were able to be rapidly discharged from IDU with a mean length of stay of five days.
Conclusion
We believe there is urgency to evaluate the effectiveness of this potentially-life saving therapeutic strategy at a larger scale, both to treat and cure patients at an early stage before irreversible severe respiratory complications take hold and to decrease duration of carriage and avoid the spread of the disease. Furthermore, the cost of treatment is negligible."

The main aim of this study was to investigate the percentage of individuals who developed long-term disabilities after chikungunya virus (CHIKV) disease on the basis of follow up time interval and its associated risk factors.
Method
In this meta-analysis, electronic databases PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar were searched to identify cohort studies of CHIKV disease from January 2000 to June 2018. Total 28 eligible studies were selected for analysis. The pooled prevalence rate (PR), risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for both effect measures were calculated using a random effects model.
Result
Among 28 studies, 24 studies were used for PR calculation and the PR for the long-term disabilities of CHIKV disease patients were found 39.70%, [95% CI: (31.77–47.64), p < 0.01] for follow up time between 6 and 12 months, 35.85%, [95% CI: (24.09–47.61), p < 0.01] for follow up time between 12 and 18 months and 28.20%, [95% CI: (19.74–36.66), p < 0.01] for greater than 18 months respectively.

In 2003 an emerging mammarenavirus (formerly arenaviruses) was discovered in Bolivia and named Chapare (CHAPV). It was associated with severe and fatal hemorrhagic fever, being similar in clinical features to Machupo (MACV). In mid-2019, CHAPV was the cause of a cluster of five cases, two of them laboratory confirmed, three of them fatal. Here, we report the main clinical findings, epidemiological features and the potential ecological aspects, of that cluster of cases in rural La Paz, Bolivia.
Methods
For this observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study, information was obtained from the Hospitals and the Ministry of Health for the cases that were laboratory-diagnosed and related, during 2019. RT-PCR was used for the detection of the RNA of CHAPV in the blood samples.
Results
Two cases were RT-PCR + for CHAPV. The median age of patients was 42 y-old (IQR 25–45), four out of five were male. All patients were hospitalized, admitted to the ICU and had fever, upper digestive hemorrhage, with two of them, presenting ARDS, and requiring mechanical ventilation. Three patients died (case fatality rate, CFR 60%).
Conclusions
Mammarenaviruses led to a high fatality rate. These cases occurred in areas with suitable ecoepidemiological conditions for rodent-borne diseases, including CHAPV infection. Socioenvironmental and occupational factors in rural areas of Bolivia may contribute with the risk of zoonotic spillover and transmission to humans."

Cipargamin (KAE609) is a novel spiroindolone class drug for the treatment of malaria, currently undergoing phase 2 clinical development. This review provides an overview and interpretation of the pre-clinical and clinical data of this possible next-generation antimalarial drug published to date.
Methods
We systematically searched the literature for studies on the preclinical and clinical development of cipargamin. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched using the terms ‘cipargamin’, ‘KAE609ʹ or ‘NITD609’ in the English language; one additional article was identified during revision. Nineteen of these in total 43 papers identified reported original studies; 13 of those articles were on pre-clinical studies and 6 reported clinical trials.
Results
A total of 20 studies addressing its preclinical and clinical development have been published on this compound at the time of writing. Cipargamin acts on the PfATP4, which is a P-type Na + ATPase disrupting the Na + homeostasis in the parasite. Cipargamin is a very fast-acting antimalarial, it is active against all intra-erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite and exerts gametocytocidal activity, with transmission-blocking potential. It is currently undergoing phase 2 clinical trial to assess safety and efficacy, with a special focus on hepatic safety.
Conclusion
In the search for novel antimalarial drugs, cipargamin exhibits promising properties, exerting activity against multiple intra-erythrocytic stages of plasmodia, including gametocytes. It exhibits a favourable pharmacokinetic profile, possibly allowing for single-dose treatment with a suitable combination partner. According to the clinical results of the first studies in Asian malaria patients, a possible safety concern is hepatotoxicity."

Methods
YouTube was searched using the terms ‘2019 novel coronavirus’, ‘Wuhan virus’ and ‘武汉病毒’ (Mandarin for Wuhan virus) on 1st and 2nd February 2020. First 50 videos in each group were analyzed. Videos in other languages, duplicate videos, those without an audio and duration >15 min were excluded .72 videos in English and 42 in Mandarin were reviewed. 2 reviewers classified the videos as useful, misleading or news based on pre specified criterion. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated with kappa coefficient. Modified DISCERN index for reliability and medical information and content index (MICI) score were used for content analysis.
Results
These videos attracted cumulative 21,288,856 views. 67% of English and 50% Mandarin videos had useful information. The viewership of misleading Mandarin videos was higher than the useful ones. WHO accounted for only 4% of useful videos. Mean DISCERN score for reliability was 3.12/5 and 3.25/5 for English and Mandarin videos respectively. Mean cumulative MICI score of useful videos was low (6.71/25 for English and 6.28/25 for Mandarin).

Lassa Fever (LF), is a severe viral disease prevalent in Western Africa. It is classified as a priority disease by the World Health Organization (WHO). Ribavirin is the recommended therapy despite weak evidence of its efficacy. Promising therapeutic agents are becoming available for evaluation in human. Before launching therapeutic trials, we need data on the evolution of the disease under the best possible conditions of care.
Methods
We have initiated a prospective study in Nigeria to better understand the clinical course and prognostic factors of LF while implementing high quality standardized care. Inclusion criteria are: suspected or confirmed LF and informed consent. Participants are followed 60 days from admission and receive free of charge standardized supportive care and biological monitoring, as well as intravenous ribavirin for those with confirmed LF. Data are collected using standardized case report forms (CRF). Primary and secondary outcomes are fatality and severe morbidity, with special focus on acute kidney dysfunction and pregnancy complications. Factors associated with outcomes will be investigated.
Results
The cohort is planned for 3 years. Inclusions started in April 2018 at the Federal Medical Center Owo in Ondo State. A second site will open in Nigeria in 2020 and discussions are underway to open a site in Benin. 150 to 200 new participants are expected per year.
Conclusions
This cohort will: provide evidence to standardize LF case management; provide key inputs to design future clinical trials of novel therapeutics; and establish clinical research teams capable of conducting such trials in LF-endemic areas.

These cases were compared with the 99 cases, previously published in Lancet, from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from January 1 to January 20, 2020.
Results
Guangzhou patients were younger and had better prognosis than Wuhan patients. The Wuhan patients were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (23% vs 5%) and had a higher mortality rate (11% vs 0%). Cases in Guangzhou tended to be more community clustered. Diarrhea and vomiting were more common among Guangzhou patients and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in feces. Fecal SARA-CoV-2 RNA remained positive when nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative in some patients.
Conclusions
This study indicates possible diminishing virulence of the virus in the process of transmission. Yet persistent positive RNA in feces after negative nasopharyngeal swabs suggests a possible prolonged transmission period that challenges current quarantine practices."

abstract = "Background
Mobile phones have become an integral part of modern society. As possible breeding grounds for microbial organisms, these constitute a potential global public health risk for microbial transmission.
Objective
Scoping review of literature examining microbial's presence on mobile phones in both health care (HC) and community settings.
Methods
A search (PubMed&GoogleScholar) was conducted from January 2005–December 2019 to identify English language studies. Studies were included if samples from mobile phones were tested for bacteria, fungi, and/or viruses; and if the sampling was carried out in any HC setting, and/or within the general community. Any other studies exploring mobile phones that did not identify specific microorganisms were excluded.
Results
A total of 56 studies were included (from 24 countries). Most studies identified the presence of bacteria (54/56), while 16 studies reported the presence of fungi. One study focused solely on RNA viruses. Staphylococcus aureus, and Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci were the most numerous identified organisms present on mobile phones. These two species and Escherichia coli were present in over a third of studies both in HC and community samples. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter sp., and Bacillus sp. were present in over a third of the studies in HC settings.
Conclusions
While this scoping review of literature regarding microbial identification on mobile phones in HC and community settings did not directly address the issue of SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19, this work exposes the possible role of mobile phones as a ‘Trojan horse’ contributing to the transmission of microbial infections in epidemics and pandemics."

Oman has an annual TB incidence rate of 5.7 per 100000 and transmission from migrants with activated latent TB infection (LTBI) to nationals is a concern. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of migrants to the Sultanate of Oman with LTBI. The study used an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) to assess previous exposure to TB, defining LTBI and a positive IGRA with a normal chest X-ray. 1049 subjects were surveyed. Six participants were excluded from the analysis as they had been recently vaccinated and 1 had an indeterminate result, thus 1042 subjects were included. The overall IGRA-positive rate was 22.4% (234/1042), 30.9% and 21.2% of African and Asian migrants, respectively, were IGRA-positive. Fifty-eight of the participants had a strong IGRA reactivity defined as more than 4 IU/ml. The study shows the proportion of migrants from Asia and Africa with LTBI and 24.7% (58/234) of IGRA-positive migrants had an IGRA of >4 IU/ml, defining a subpopulation with a high risk of developing active TB in the first two years of arrival to the country."

Travellers’ diarrhoea (TD) is the most common health problem in international travellers. Besides being bothersome for the individual and a considerable economic burden for the public, TD is also known to be associated with becoming colonized with extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriacea. Despite the high frequency of TD cases, easy and effective preventive measures are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of using hand gel sanitizer on the incidence of TD and colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
Method
A multicentre randomized intervention trial studying the effect of hand gel sanitizer on the incidence of TD and colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in travellers to Southeast Asia was performed.
Results
The intention to treat analysis showed a reduction in the incidence of WHO TD in the intervention group (OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.30–0.97), p = 0.04). No effect was seen or the incidence of becoming colonized with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
Conclusion
Using hand gel sanitizer might have a protective effect on the occurrence of TD. Based on the current data, education on the proper use appears to play a key role for its effectiveness."

abstract = "Background
We investigated prevalence and predictive factors for ESBL-E carriage in a population of mostly travellers prior to their travel (n = 2216). In addition, we examined ESBL genotype before travel and compared these to returning travellers.
Method
A questionnaire and faecal sample were collected before travel, and a second faecal sample was collected immediately after travel. Faecal samples were analysed for ESBL-E, with genotypic characterization by PCR and sequencing. Risk factors for ESBL-E carriage prior to travel were identified by logistic regression analyses.
Results
Before travel, 136 participants (6.1%) were colonized with ESBL-E. Antibiotic use in the past three months (ORadjusted 2.57; 95% CI 1.59–4.16) and travel outside of Europe in the past year (1.92, 1.28–2.87) were risk factors for ESBL-E colonisation prior to travel. Travel outside of Europe carried the largest attributable risk (39.8%). Prior to travel 31.3% (40/128) of participants carried blaCTX-M 15 and 21.9% (28/128) blaCTX-M 14/18. In returning travellers 633 acquired ESBL-E of who 53.4% (338/633) acquired blaCTX-M 15 and 17.7% (112/633) blaCTX-M 14/18.
Conclusion
In our population of Dutch travellers we found a pre-travel ESBL-E prevalence of 6.1%. Prior to travel, previous antibiotic use and travel outside of Europe were the strongest independent predictors for ESBL-E carriage, with travel outside of Europe carrying the largest attributable risk. Our molecular results suggest ESBL genes found in our study population prior to travel were in large part travel related."

This Dutch travel Vaccination Study (DiVeST) aimed to study adherence or compliance to Dutch travel health guidelines in travelling families and to identify risk groups to provide better advice and protection for international travellers.
Methods
Between 2016 and 2018, family members who travelled to Eastern Europe or outside Europe during the preceding year were recruited via Dutch secondary schools. The vaccination status of the travellers was assessed using questionnaires and vaccination records and hepatitis A virus antibody concentrations in dried blood spot (DBS) eluates. Subgroups of travellers with lower adherence to guidelines were identified.
Results
Of the 246 travellers that participated in this study, 155 (63%) travelled to destinations for which the HAV vaccination was recommended. Of these 155 travellers, 56 (36%) said they visited a pre-travel clinic, and 64 of them (41%) showed a valid HAV vaccination in their vaccination records. Of the 145 travellers with available DBS eluates, anti-HAV antibodies were detected in 98 (68%) of them.
Conclusions
We found that adherence to travel health guidelines, in terms of HAV vaccination, was suboptimal. According to our results, specific attention should be paid to children, persons visiting friends and relatives and those who travel relatively short distances."

To investigate to what extent early Lyme borreliosis patients with erythema migrans are infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilum.
Methods
Three hundred ten patients from Poland with erythema migrans were included in the study. One hundred and eighty-three patients (59%) agreed to have both skin biopsy and blood samples analysed for Borrelia burgdorferi, A. phagocytophilum and ‘Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis’, with PCR. Positive samples were confirmed with sequencing.
Results
B. burgdorferi DNA was detected in 49.7% of the skin samples and in 1.1% of the blood samples. A. phagocytophilum DNA was found in 7.1% blood samples, and in 8.2% of the skin biopsies. In four patients, A. phagocytophilum DNA was detected only in blood; in one case A. phagocytophilum DNA was found simultaneously in blood and skin, and additionally in this patients’ blood Borrelia DNA was detected. In four skin samples B. burgdorferi DNA was detected simultaneously with A. phagocytophilum DNA, indicative of a co-infection.
Conclusions
A. phagocytophilum may be present in early Lyme borreliosis characterized by erythema migrans and should always be considered as a differential diagnostic following a tick bite and considered in treatment schemes, as these differs (in early stage of Lyme borreliosis doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil and azithromycin are recommended, while in anaplasmosis the most effective courses of treatment are doxycycline, rifampin and levofloxacin). Consequently, the role of A. phagocytophilum in erythema migrans should be further studied."

Chloroquine (CQ) and primaquine (PQ) remain the frontline drugs for radical cure of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS). Recent reports of decreased susceptibility of P. vivax to CQ in many parts of the GMS raise concerns.
Methods
From April 2014 to September 2016, 281 patients with uncomplicated P. vivax infection attending clinics in border settlements for internally displaced people in northeast Myanmar were recruited into this study. Patients were treated with standard regimen of 3-day CQ and concurrent 14-day PQ (3.5 mg/kg total dose) as directly observed therapy, and followed for recurrent parasitemia within 28 days post-patency.
Results
Within the 28-day follow-up period, seven patients developed recurrent parasitemia, resulting in a cumulative rate of parasite recurrence of 2.6%. Five of the seven parasitemias recurred within two weeks, and two of those failed to clear within seven days, indicating high-grade resistance.
Conclusion
Although failure of CQ/PQ treatment of P. vivax was relatively infrequent in northeast Myanmar, this study nonetheless confirms that CQ/PQ-resistant strains do circulate in this area, some of them of a highly resistant phenotype. It is thus recommended that patients who acquire vivax malaria in Myanmar be treated an artemisinin-combination therapy along with hypnozoitocidal primaquine therapy to achieve radical cure."

abstract = "Background
Air travel contributes to the global spread of vectors and vector-borne infections. Although WHO provides guidance on methods for disinsection of aircraft, there is currently no harmonized or standardized decision-making process to decide when disinsection of an aircraft should be conducted. It is however compulsory for flights arriving in certain countries. Concerns have been expressed about the usefulness of disinsection for preventing the international spread of vectors and vector-borne diseases via air travel and possible toxicity for passengers and flight crew.
Methods
We performed a systematic literature review using the databases PubMed, Embase, Medline, Scopus and CINAHL to evaluate all research findings about the applicability and safety of chemical-based, aircraft disinsection. Official reports from the WHO were also screened. This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. The literature search strategy included “disinsection, airplane/plane/aviation/aircraft” and several other search items including d-phenothrin, permethrin, insecticide. Papers in English, French and German were reviewed. Reports of adverse events attributed to the disinsection of aircraft were also searched. AMP and PS screened all papers of relevance and agreed on a final selection.
Results
Our search resulted in 440 papers of possible relevance. After screening, we included a total of 25 papers in this systematic review. Ten papers reported possible human toxicity and 17 papers addressed the applicability of disinsection and 2 papers addressed both topics. Chemical disinsection at recommended insecticide concentrations was found to be highly effective against a broad range of arthropods. Three papers reported passenger or crew illness possibly associated with insecticide spraying in passenger cabins – one describing a single passenger, the other two papers describing occupational illness of 12 and 33 aircrew members respectively, possibly due to aircraft disinsection. Another paper evaluating exposure of flight attendants to permethrin found higher levels of urinary metabolites in those working in planes that had recently been sprayed but this could not be linked to adverse health outcomes.
Conclusion
Our analysis confirmed that disease vectors are carried on international flights and can pose a threat particularly to island populations and certain airport hub areas. Disinsection with permethrin or d-phenothrin was shown to be highly effective against vectors. Despite several hundred million passenger and crew exposures to chemical disinsection, very few proven cases of toxicity have been reported. There is limited evidence linking exposure to insecticide spraying with negative health impact."

However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens. The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation. It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics. Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics. As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease data come from KSA, the cancellation of Umrah by the KSA authorities, prior to emergence of cases, provide the best opportunity to develop mathematical models to quantify event cancellations related mitigation of COVID-19 transmission in KSA and to the home countries of pilgrims. COVID-19 has already provided examples of both clearly planned event cancellations such as the Umrah suspension in KSA, and where outbreaks and events were continued."

Among the positive samples, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the bacterium most frequently tested positive (57.1%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.0%) and Haemophilus influenzae (7.1%). 32.9% positive samples tested positive for rhinovirus and 1.4% for coronavirus. Surfaces with the highest rates of positive samples were kitchen tables (100%), water fountain faucet (73.3%) and edge of water coolers lid (84.6%). Samples collected in Mina were the most frequently contaminated with 68.8% being positive for at least one pathogen and 18.8% positive for a combination of multiple pathogens.
Conclusion
These preliminary results indicate that respiratory pathogens are common in environmental surfaces from areas frequented by Hajj pilgrims. Further larger-scale studies are needed to better assess the possible role of environmental respiratory pathogens in respiratory infections in Hajj pilgrims."

abstract = "Background
In France, no previous studies have focused specifically on health problems among medical students during internships abroad including the clinical symptoms suggestive of infectious diseases and the acquisition of pathogen carriage.
Methods
Clinical follow up and qPCR based respiratory, gastrointestinal and vaginal pathogen carriage before and after travel were prospectively assessed in a cohort of medical students departing from Marseille, France.
Results
134 students were included. 73.9%, 38.8% and 5.0% of students reported gastrointestinal, respiratory and vaginal symptoms, respectively. The acquisition rate of Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) and Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) was 53% and 41%, respectively. The acquisition of respiratory viruses was low but associated with persisting symptoms, while bacterial acquisition ranged from 3.3% for Streptococcus pyogenes to 15.0% for Haemophilus influenzae. Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae acquisition rates were 7.7% and 14.3% respectively. Five students (5.1%) had molecular quantification criteria for bacterial vaginosis on return.
Conclusion
This preliminary study demonstrates that besides the known risk of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections and associated changes in intestinal and respiratory microbiota, medical students abroad may also experience changes in vaginal microbiota leading, in some cases, to clinical symptoms or the acquisition of bacterial vaginosis, which may be asymptomatic."

The emergence of antimicrobial resistance of many bacteria is a significant drawback of antimicrobial use. A key measure to assess antimicrobial use is point prevalence study.
Methods
This was a point prevalence study of all hospitalized patients at Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare, a 350-bed hospital, and was conducted at two-points from January 2017 to January 2019. We recorded systemic antibiotic use and the indications as prophylactic, empiric, and definite therapy.
Result
Of the 489 hospitalized patients whom were included, 200 (40%) were on systemic antibiotics. Of the total antibiotic indications, 144 (72%) were empiric, 17 (8.5) were prophylactic antibiotics, and 39 (19.5%) were definite therapy, according to hospital guidelines. Most commonly used antibiotics were meropenem (18%), cefazolin (10%), and ceftriaxone (8%). Of included patients, 29.4% were on a single antibiotic, 10% recieved two antibiotics, and 1.4% were on three antibiotics. Of the patients receiving an antibiotic that could be given orally, only 41.4% received oral therapy.
Conclusion
A large percentage of patients were on empiric antimicrobial therapy and areas for further improvements in antimicrobial stewardship includes intravenous to oral switch, evaluating the need for combination therapy, restrictions, education and putting appropriate use guidelines."

Pandemic COVID-19 has become a seriously public health priority worldwide. Comprehensive strategies including travel restrictions and mask-wearing have been implemented to mitigate the virus circulation. However, detail information on community transmission is unavailable yet.
Methods
From January 23 to March 1, 2020, 127 patients (median age: 46 years; range: 11–80) with 71 male and 56 female, were confirmed to be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 in Taizhou, Zhejiang, China. Epidemiological trajectory and clinical features of these COVID-19 cases were retrospectively retrieved from electronic medical records and valid individual questionnaire.
Results
The disease onset was between January 9 to February 14, 2020. Among them, 64 patients are local residents, and 63 patients were back home from Wuhan from January 10 to 24, 2020 before travel restriction. 197 local residents had definite close-contact with 41 pre-symptomatic patients back from Wuhan. 123 and 74 of them contact with mask-wearing or with no mask-wearing pre-symptomatic patients back from Wuhan, respectively. Data showed that incidence of COVID-19 was significantly higher for local residents close-contact with no mask-wearing Wuhan returned pre-symptomatic patients (19.0% vs. 8.1%, p < 0.001). Among 57 close-contact individuals, 21 sequential local COVID-19 patients originated from a pre-symptomatic Wuhan returned couple, indicated dense gathering in congested spaces is a high risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Conclusions
Our findings provided valuable details of pre-symptomatic patient mask-wearing and restriction of mass gathering in congested spaces particularly, are important interventions to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 transmission."

abstract = "Background
Chagas disease (CD), is a parasitic disease endemic in Latin America. Presentation in non-endemic areas is either in the asymptomatic indeterminate phase or the chronic phase with cardiac and/or gastrointestinal complications.
Methods
The Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD) based in central London, provides tertiary care for the management of CD. We reviewed all cases managed at this centre between 1995 and 2018.
Results
Sixty patients with serologically proven CD were identified. Most were female (70%), with a median age at diagnosis of 41 years. Three quarters of the patients were originally from Bolivia. 62% of all patients were referred to the HTD by their GP. Nearly half of the patients were asymptomatic (47%). Twelve patients had signs of cardiac involvement secondary to CD. Evidence of gastrointestinal damage was established in three patients. Treatment was provided at HTD for 31 patients (47%). Most patients (29) received benznidazole, five of them did not tolerate the course and were switched to nifurtimox. Of the seven patients receiving this second line drug, five completed treatment, whilst two interrupted it due to side effects.
Conclusions
Despite the UK health system having all the resources required to diagnose, treat and follow up cases, there is lack of awareness of CD, such that the vast majority of cases remain undiagnosed and therefore do not receive treatment. We propose key interventions to improve the detection and management of this condition in the UK, especially in pregnant women and neonates."

Currently, the main travel health surveillance system relies on ill-returned travelers data and has been mainly designed for countries of origin in developed regions. This study aims to develop an integrated travel health surveillance and information system for destination sites in Bali.
Methods
The first stage of the project included mapping and geo-tagging of health hazards and risks as well as travel health facilities, involving 197 tourist attractions in 8 regencies and 1 city in Bali. Hazard identifications were performed and risk levels were assessed using a qualitative risk assessment matrix.
Results
Health and safety hazards, risk levels, and travel health services with their geographical positions were mapped. Based on types of tourist attractions, 59 (29.9%) were beaches, 28 (14.2%) were temples, and 25 (12.7%) were waterfalls. Of the 197 tourist attractions, 107 (54.3%) were categorized as low-risk areas, 77 (39.1%) medium-risk areas, and 13 (6.6%) high-risk areas. The most common hazards included lack of proper access, risks of slips, trips, and falls, risks posed by water-based activities, mosquitoes as vectors of diseases, risks of bites or scratches from rabid animal, mixed brews containing methanol, and hyperbaric condition in diving sites.
Conclusions
The opportunity of providing site-specific preventive measures to travelers was highlighted in this study."

Dengue fever (DF) is a vector-bore infectious disease that can infect humans, and has been recognized as a global public health threat, with significant morbidity and mortality rates.
Method
To describe the epidemiological profile of DF in China during 2004–2016, the morbidity data of DF by age-group, season (different months) and geographic location (different provinces) were obtained from the public health science data center of China for subsequent epidemiological analysis.
Results
The results showed that the incidence of DF shows striking annual variations, and two large outbreaks occurred in 2006–2007 and during 2012–2015. The results of the average morbidity rates (cases/100,000 population) for human DF indicated that among all dengue fever cases, Guangdong in southern area of China had the highest rates (3.8160 cases/100,000 population), followed by Yunnan (0.6614 cases/100,000 population), Fujian (0.3463 cases/100,000 population) and Guangxi (0.1474 cases/100,000 population). Epidemic peaks occurred in late June and early November, and the incidence rate among middle-aged people (30–45 years old) was relatively high, followed by rates among 15–29 and 45–59 age groups.
Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrated the epidemiological profile of DF circulating in China and revealed the geographic distribution, dynamic transmission, seasonal asymmetries and age distribution, which will provide guidelines on the prevention and control of DF in China. The present investigation is useful in the risk assessment of DF transmission, to predict DF outbreaks and the prevention and control strategies should be used along with surveillance to reduce the spread of DF in China."

abstract = "Background
Patients with leprosy can present with systemic inflammatory complications called leprosy reactions (LR), which can be severe and cause a loss of nerve function. The treatment of choice is prolonged corticosteroid therapy, frequently associated with severe side effects. We have used methotrexate as a corticosteroid-sparing regimen with good results.
Methods
To evaluate the role of methotrexate in managing LR, we performed a systematic review of the literature including our cases. We evaluated studies, prospective and retrospective, in both adults and children, which included any dose/regimen of methotrexate for the treatment of LR type 1 or 2.
Results
The systematic search revealed 261 records that yield 21 patients including our 3 cases (19 adults/two children), who were treated with methotrexate for LR type 1 and 2. There were 14 males. Median age was 35 years (P25–P75 28 to 52). Patients showed lepromatous (7), borderline lepromatous (9) or borderline tuberculoid (3) leprosy, among the 19 cases in which the type of leprosy was specified. As for the type of LR, 15 patients showed erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), five showed LR type 1 and one showed polyarthritis and previous ENL. Methotrexate at weekly doses ranging from 7.5 mg to 20 mg (median 15 mg per week), typically administered with low-dose corticosteroids, was effective and safe as a corticosteroid-sparing agent.
Conclusions
Methotrexate could be a suitable ancillary treatment or alternative to corticosteroids, especially in populations who are more prone to its adverse events. However, this evidence is based only on case reports and short clinical series."

Infectious and non-infectious risks associated with international travel can be reduced with adherence to pre-travel advice from practitioners trained in travel medicine.
Methods
A prospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care children's hospital to assess adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis, safe water and food consumption, mosquito bite protection, motor vehicle safety and travel vaccines using structured questionnaires. High risk groups assessed included child travelers and those visiting friends and relatives (VFRs).
Results
In total, 290 participants (133 children and 157 adults) were enrolled and completed at least one study questionnaire. In general, with the exception of vaccines, adherence to recommendations was sub-optimal. Among children and adults, adherence to malaria prophylaxis recommendations was lower in VFRs than in non-VFRs. The proportion of children VFRs (cVFRs) and adult VFRs (aVFRs) who adhered to the following recommendations were malaria chemoprophylaxis (47%, 33%), safe water (71%, 74%) and food recommendations (18%, 6%), insect bite avoidance (21%, 12%), and motor vehicle safety (13%, 11%) respectively. Adherence to recommended vaccines uptake was greater than 90% in all groups.
Conclusion

After serious epidemics of chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) in the Americas, dengue (DENV) have reemerged in most countries. We analyzed the incidence, incidence rates, and evolution of DENV cases in Honduras from 2015 to 2018 and the ongoing 2019 epidemic.
Methods
Using epidemiological weeks (EW) surveillance data on the DENV in Honduras, we estimated incidence rates (cases/100,000 population), and developed maps at national, departmental, and municipal levels.
Results
From January 1, 2016 to July 21, 2019, a total of 109,557 cases of DENV were reported, 28,603 in 2019, with an incidence rate of 312.32 cases/100,000 population this year; 0.13% laboratory-confirmed. The highest peak was reached on the EW 28°, 2019 (5299 cases; 57.89 cases/100,000 population). The department with the highest number of cases and incidence rate was Cortes (8404 cases, 479.68 cases/100,000 population in 2019).
Discussion
The pattern and evolution of DENV epidemic in 2019 in Honduras has been similar to that which occurred for in 2015. As previously reported, this epidemic involved the north and central areas of the country predominantly, reaching municipality incidences there >1000 cases/100,000 population (or 1%). Studies using geographical information systems linked with clinical disease characteristics are necessary to obtain accurate epidemiological data for public health systems. Such information is also useful for assessment of risk for travelers who visit specific areas in a destination country."

Schistosoma japonicum is endemic in the Philippines, China, and Indonesia, and is the third-most common schistosoma species. The infection can be asymptomatic for years but, if left untreated, can lead to irreversible complications.
Method
We report the results of a systematic review of the literature on imported S. japonicum infection and describe two previously unpublished cases diagnosed in Filipino migrants in Italy.
Results
Twenty-five imported cases of S. japonicum schistosomiasis were retrieved. All patients but one were migrants. Most subjects acquired the infection in Philippines (n = 18, 72%). Median age at diagnosis was 46 years. Median period of residence in non-endemic countries before diagnosis was 14.5 years. Cases of prevalent hepatosplenic involvement were 10 (40%), those with prevalent intestinal involvement were 10 (40%), whereas five (20%) had overlapping manifestations. Ten patients suffered from cirrhosis; two underwent liver transplantation. Three patients presented with acute abdomen due to intestinal complications, leading to explorative laparotomy. In all cases, but one, the diagnosis was based on a histological examination of biopsy specimen, revealing S. japonicum ova. Seventeen patients were treated with praziquantel, and in three of them, possible treatment failures occurred.
Conclusions
S. japonicum infection is uncommonly reported in non-endemic areas, but is probably underestimated because of a low threshold awareness of clinicians and unavailability of specific diagnostic tools. Viable S. japonicum adults may persist for decades, indicating that migrants or travellers previously exposed in areas with high-risk areas can harbour viable worms and deserve treatment."

abstract = "Introduction
Inactivated hepatitis A (HepA) vaccines are very immunogenic in healthy individuals; however, it remains unclear how different immunosuppressive regimens affect HepA vaccine immunogenicity. Our objective was to summarise the current evidence on immunogenicity of HepA vaccination in patients using immunosuppressive drugs.
Methods
We systematically searched the literature for studies on immunogenicity of inactivated HepA vaccines in adults using immunosuppressive drugs. Studies reporting seroconversion rates (SCR) 4–8 weeks after 1 and 2 doses of HepA vaccine in organ transplant recipients and patients with chronic inflammatory conditions were included in a meta-analysis.
Results
We included 17 studies, comprising 1,332 individuals. In healthy controls (2 studies), SCRs were 90–94% after the first dose and 100% after the second dose. In organ transplant recipients, SCRs ranged from 0 to 67% after the first dose of vaccine and 0–97% after the second dose. In patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, SCRs ranged from 6% to 100% after the first dose and from 48 to 100% after the second dose of vaccine. Patients using a TNF-alpha inhibitor versus conventional immune-modulators (e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine, corticosteroids) were more likely to seroconvert after the first dose of vaccine (OR12.1 [2.14–68.2]) but not after the second dose of vaccine (OR 0.78 [0.21–2.92]) in a meta-analysis.
Conclusion
Studies evaluating HepA vaccine immunogenicity in immunosuppressive agents are heterogeneous. Overall, there is an impaired immune response following HepA vaccination in patients using immunosuppressive drugs, especially after only one dose of vaccine and in organ transplant recipients. HepA vaccination should therefore be considered before immunosuppressive therapy. Future research should focus on alternative vaccination regimens and long-term immunogenicity.

From the first Zika virus (ZIKV) description, it has progressively widespread worldwide. We analyzed demographic, clinical, microbiologic and travel-related characteristic from returned patients from a ZIKV endemic country in a referral Tropical Medicine Unit.
Method
A prospective cohort study performed in a Spanish referral center with the aim of determining the significant factors associated with confirmed Zika virus (ZIKV) infection.
Results
817 patients, (56% women, median age 36 [IQR, Interquartile Range: 32–42]) were enrolled. Most had returned from Latin America (n = 486; 59.4%), travelled for tourism (n = 404; 49.4%) and stayed a median of 18 days (IQR: 10–30). 602 (73.6%) presented symptoms, but only 25 (4%) were finally diagnosed with confirmed ZIKV infection (including two pregnant women, without adverse fetal outcomes), 88% (n:22) presented with fever and 92% (n:23) with rash. 56% (n:14) arthralgia and/or myalgia and 28% (n:7) conjunctivitis. The presence of conjunctivitis, fever and rash were associated with an 8.9 (95% CI: 2.2–34.9), 6.4 (95% CI: 1.2–33.3) and 72.3 (95% CI: 9.2–563.5) times greater probability of confirmed ZIKV infection, respectively.
Conclusion
Travel characteristics and clinical presentation may help clinicians to optimize requests for microbiological testing. Diagnosis of arboviriasis in travellers arriving form endemic areas remains a challenge for clinicians, but must be detected for the possible transmission outside endemic areas, where the vector is present."

Little comprehensive analysis combining epidemiological and clinical data has been done with mosquito-borne diseases imported into Guangzhou by air travelers.
Methods
We screened international travelers (body temperature >36.5 °C) arriving at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, and recorded their epidemiological and clinical information. Whole-blood samples were collected for laboratory diagnosis of dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), zika virus (ZIKV) infections and malaria.
Results
Between March 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017, 155 (6.6%) cases (100 of DENV, 21 of CHIKV, 1 of ZIKV, 34 of malaria, including one co-infection of DENV and CHIKV) were identified among 2350 febrile travelers. DENV (90.0%) and CHIKV (100.0%) cases mainly came from Southern and Southeast Asia. Malaria cases (91.2%) mainly came from sub-Saharan Africa. Traveling abroad (28/74, 37.8%) and living/working abroad (11/22, 50.0%) were the most common causes of DENV infection and malaria for Chinese, respectively. Cases with these four mosquito-borne diseases were more likely to have nervous, musculoskeletal and skin symptoms and signs than other febrile diseases (P < 0.001).
Conclusions
It is important to strengthen the surveillance of mosquito-borne diseases among tourists and workers returning from Southeast Asia, Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, especially those with nervous, musculoskeletal and skin symptoms and signs."

Mass gathering for religious and spiritual purposes are common in India. However, mass gathering health and travel medicine is still in its infancy in India.
Objectives
The study explored bio-medical, environmental and psycho-social dimensions of mass gathering in Sabarimala pilgrimage, which is annually attended by 25 million pilgrims.
Methods
In a cross sectional design, the investigators travelled the pilgrim trail and stayed in the shrine area to conduct the interviews (sample = 1259), to observe the practices as well as to assess the environmental conditions including sanitation. We did in-depth interviews of a subset of samples of the pilgrims, laboratory tests for water quality and secondary analysis of health services data.
Result
43.4% pilgrims reported at least one health problem. Leg pain, joint/muscle pain, breathlessness, were the common symptoms. Pilgrims expressed concern about drinking water and food safety and majority of them felt the crowd management as unsatisfactory. Untreated sewage and solid waste were found to pollute the water downstream. Average patient presentation rate for 2014–2017 was 4999.6 per 100,000 pilgrims and referral to Hospital Rate was 19 per 100,000 pilgrims. Mortality rate ranged from 18.5 to 21 per 100,000 pilgrims among those who attended the health centers for ailments. Death due to Coronary Artery Heart Disease (CAHD) has slightly decreased over the period of 3 years from 97.6% to 85.1%.
Conclusion
Data with respect to safety, health and environment at the pilgrim sites need to be continuously assessed to understand changes and trends and to develop an effective mass gathering and safe pilgrimage policy (MGSPP)."

Rapid virological diagnosis is needed to limit the length of isolation for suspected COVID-19 cases.
Method
We managed the first 280 patients suspected to have COVID-19 through a rapid care circuit and virological diagnosis in our infectious disease reference hospital in Marseille, France. Rapid viral detection was performed on sputum and nasopharyngeal samples.
Results
Over our study period, no SARS-CoV-2 was detected. Results were obtained within approximately 3 h of the arrival of patient samples at the laboratory. Other viral infections were identified in 49% of the patients, with most common pathogens being influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus and common coronaviruses, notably HKU1 and NL63.
Conclusion
Early recognition of COVID-19 is critical to isolate confirmed cases and prevent further transmission. Early rule-out of COVID-19 allows public health containment measures to be adjusted by reducing the time spent in isolation."

Bats are considered as the reservoir host, and the search of a probable intermediate host is still going on. The severe form of the infection is associated with death is mainly reported in older and immune-compromised patients with pre-existing disease history. Death in severe cases is attributed to respiratory failure associated with hyperinflammation. Cytokine storm syndrome associated with inflammation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is considered as the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients have thus higher levels of many proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The blood laboratory profile of the COVID-19 patients exhibits lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and RNAaemia, along with increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase. SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women does not lead to fetus mortality, unlike other zoonotic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and there is, to date, no evidence of intrauterine transmission to neonates. Rapid diagnostics have been developed, and significant efforts are being made to develop effective vaccines and therapeutics. In the absence of any virus-specific therapy, internationally, health care authorities are recommending the adoption of effective community mitigation measures to counter and contain this pandemic virus. This paper is an overview of this virus and the disease with a particular focus on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 clinical pathology, pathogenesis, and immunopathology, along with recent research developments."

Changes and stresses experienced during travel have the potential to impact the gut microbiome, with travel implicated in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes across continents. The possibility of gut microbiome-mediated negative impacts arising from travel, and consequences for peak performance, would be of particular concern for elite athletes.
Methods
Faecal samples were collected from male (N = 14) and female (N = 7) cricket players during the build-up to the 2016 Cricket World Cup. Baseline and post-travel samples were collected from all participants and subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Samples from a subset of participants (N = 4) were also analysed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing.
Results
Analysis revealed a single travel time point as having the potential to have an impact on the gut microbiome. Reductions in alpha diversity following travel were observed, accompanied by shifts in the taxonomic profile of the gut microbiome. Antibiotic resistance and virulence genes were also identified as undergoing changes following travel.
Conclusions
This study reveals that periods of travel, in particular following gastrointestinal distress, may result in gut microbiome disruption. While this analysis was completed in athletes, the findings are applicable to all travelling individuals and considerations should be made surrounding travel in an attempt to reduce these changes."

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause intermittent community and nosocomial outbreaks. Obtaining data on specific source(s) and transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV during nosocomial outbreaks has been challenging. We performed a clinical, epidemiological and phylogenetic investigation of an outbreak of MERS-CoV at a University Hospital in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Methods
Clinical, epidemiological and infection control data were obtained from patients and Healthcare workers (HCWs). Full genome sequencing was conducted on nucleic acid extracted directly from MERS-CoV PCR-confirmed clinical samples and phylogenetic analysis performed. Phylogenetic analysis combined with published MERS-CoV genomes was performed. HCWs compliance with infection control practices was also assessed.
Results
Of 235 persons investigated, there were 23 laboratory confirmed MERS cases, 10 were inpatients and 13 HCWs. Eight of 10 MERS inpatients died (80% mortality). There were no deaths among HCWs. The primary index case assumed from epidemiological investigation was not substantiated phylogenetically. 17/18 of MERS cases were linked both phylogenetically and epidemiologically. One asymptomatic HCW yielded a MERS-CoV genome not directly linked to any other case in the investigation. Five HCWs with mild symptoms yielded >75% full MERS-CoV genome sequences. HCW compliance with use of gowns was 62.1%, gloves 69.7%, and masks 57.6%.
Conclusions
Several factors and sources, including a HCW MERS-CoV ‘carrier phenomenon’, occur during nosocomial MERS-CoV outbreaks. Phylogenetic analyses of MERS-CoV linked to clinical and epidemiological information is essential for outbreak investigation. The specific role of apparently healthy HCWs in causing nosocomial outbreaks requires further definition."

abstract = "Background
Double-dose 2-visit intradermal rabies schedules (22ID) have recently been accepted by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). The aim of this study is to determine which factors influence the levels of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNA) after a 22ID rabies vaccination schedule.
Methods
This is a retrospective study based on electronic health record vaccination data of subjects from the Belgian Armed Forces who received the 22ID rabies PrEP. An antibody titer ≥0.5 IU/mL, measured by rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test, is defined by the WHO as an adequate immune response after PrEP. Logistic regression was performed in order to identify predictive factors of RVNA level ≥3.0 IU/ml and >10 IU/ml.
Results
301 subjects were included. 297 (98,6%) seroconverted with a RVNA ≥ 0.5 IU/ml. Multivariate analysis shows a significant better immune response in the subjects where the second dose was administered later on than on day 7 (RVNA >10 IU/ml (OR: 3.01 [1.36–6.67])). Postponing the timing of the serology control also influenced significantly the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RVNA ≥ 3.0 IU/ml (OR: 0.12 [0.06–0.24]) and RVNA > 10 IU/ml (OR: 0.14 [0.06–0.29])).
Conclusion
A 22ID rabies PrEP vaccination schedule is highly effective and provides an adequate immune response in most subjects in a real live setting. Timing of the second vaccine dose significantly influences the response to ID rabies vaccine. Timing of RVNA determination is important in order to correctly assess the response to vaccination."

Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus Virus (MERS-CoV) first emerged from Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since been recognized as a significant human respiratory pathogen on a global level.
Methods
In this narrative review, we focus on the prevention of MERS-CoV. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus, and Google Scholar, using the following terms: ‘MERS’, ‘MERS-CoV’, ‘Middle East respiratory syndrome’ in combination with ‘prevention’ or ‘infection control’. We also reviewed the references of each article to further include other studies or reports not identified by the search.
Results
As of Nov 2019, a total of 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were diagnosed mostly from Middle Eastern regions with a mortality rate of at least 35%. A major outbreak that occurred outside the Middle East (in South Korea) and infections reported from 27 countries. MERS-CoV has gained recognition as a pathogen of global significance. Prevention of MERS-CoV infection is a global public health priority. Healthcare facility transmission and by extension community transmission, the main amplifier of persistent outbreaks, can be prevented through early identification and isolation of infected humans. While MERS-CoV vaccine studies were initially hindered by multiple challenges, recent vaccine development for MERS-CoV is showing promise.
Conclusions
The main factors leading to sustainability of MERS-CoV infection in high risk courtiers is healthcare facility transmission. MERS-CoV transmission in healthcare facility mainly results from laps in infection control measures and late isolation of suspected cases. Preventive measures for MERS-CoV include disease control in camels, prevention of camel to human transmission."

This is the first quantitative examination of risk factors for, and symptoms of, infectious disease among Arbaeen participants.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted of a convenience sample of 191 Arbaeen participants in 2017. Interviewers administered a structured questionnaire. Questions included food sources, preventive measures used and symptoms of infectious diseases during the procession.
Results
Data were collected for 191 participants (143 males, 58 females). The most prevalent symptoms were respiratory (runny nose: 22.6%, cough: 22.5%). Diarrhoea was reported by 12.6% of participants, with a strong association with high-income country origin and eating (commercial) street food (odds ratios 6.1 and 4.1, respectively, p < 0.05). All symptoms investigated, except breathlessness, were more prevalent in high-income country participants (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Street food and high-income country origin were independent risk factors for respiratory or gastrointestinal infection symptoms in this sample of Arbaeen participants. However, these results cannot be generalised due to possible selection bias. Further studies are required to inform policy development and health system preparedness to reduce Arbaeen-associated health risks."

There are currently no satisfactory methods for predicting the outcome of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study is to establish a model for predicting the prognosis of the disease.
Methods
The laboratory results were collected from 54 deceased COVID-19 patients on admission and before death. Another 54 recovered COVID-19 patients were enrolled as control cases.
Results
Many laboratory indicators, such as neutrophils, AST, γ-GT, ALP, LDH, NT-proBNP, Hs-cTnT, PT, APTT, D-dimer, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, CRP, ferritin and procalcitonin, were all significantly increased in deceased patients compared with recovered patients on admission. In contrast, other indicators such as lymphocytes, platelets, total protein and albumin were significantly decreased in deceased patients on admission. Some indicators such as neutrophils and procalcitonin, others such as lymphocytes and platelets, continuously increased or decreased from admission to death in deceased patients respectively. Using these indicators alone had moderate performance in differentiating between recovered and deceased COVID-19 patients. A model based on combination of four indicators (P = 1/[1 + e−(−2.658+0.587×neutrophils – 2.087×lymphocytes – 0.01×platelets+0.004×IL−2R)]) showed good performance in predicting the death of COVID-19 patients. When cutoff value of 0.572 was used, the sensitivity and specificity of the prediction model were 90.74% and 94.44%, respectively.
Conclusions
Using the current indicators alone is of modest value in differentiating between recovered and deceased COVID-19 patients. A prediction model based on combination of neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets and IL-2R shows good performance in predicting the outcome of COVID-19."

Background
The transmission of COVID-19 is about to come under control within China, however, an emerging challenge to the Chinese authorities is reverse transmission due to COVID-19 patients/carriers evacuating from overseas to China.
Methods
We analysed the epidemiological characteristics of 311 Chinese citizens evacuated from Iran. All confirmed COVID-19 cases amongst the returnees were displayed by the spatial distribution pattern of the extent of COVID-19 infection.
Results
Characteristics that differed significantly amongst these returnees compared to the original infected cohorts in Gansu were mean age, occupation and sex. Differences observed between infected patients and non-patients amongst returnees were age, sex, race, occupation, the use of facemasks, and residential situation in Iran. The clinical features that were significantly related to infection were chill, shortness of breath, chest pain and nausea. Spatial distribution pattern analysis indicated that infected returnees had resided within Iranian provinces that had experienced high levels of COVID-19. The spatial distribution of the original homes of these returnees before departure for Iran demonstrated that returnees will largely return to northwest China, to regions that have only experienced low levels of infection within China.
Conclusion
Blocking the reverse transmission of COVID-19 is critical in preventing a secondary outbreak of COVID-19."

abstract = "Background
On the April 25, 2015, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal. Soon-after, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) dispatched a tertiary field-hospital to Kathmandu. The field-hospital was equipped with a clinical laboratory with microbiology capabilities. Limited data exists regarding the spectrum of bacteria isolated from earthquake casualties. We aimed to identify the spectrum of bacteria and their mechanisms of resistance in-order to allow preparedness of antibiotic treatment protocols for future disaster scenarios.
Methods
– The field-laboratory phenotypically processed cultures from sterile and non-sterile sites as needed clinically. Later-on, the isolates were brought to Israel for quality control, definite identification and molecular characterization including mechanisms of resistance.
Results
A total of 82 clinical pathogens were isolated from 56 patients; 68% of them were Gram negative bacilli. The most common isolates were Enterobacteriaceae (55%) −36% carried bla-NDM and 33% produced Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), mostly blaCTX-M-15. Enterococcus spp were the main Gram positive bacteria isolated (22 isolates), yet, none were vancomycin resistant. The overall level of resistance was 27% MDR and 23% extensively drug resistant (XDR) bacteria.
Conclusions
– Gram negative bacteria were the predominant organism cultured from the casualties, of them 77% were MDR or XDR. NDM was the most common resistance mechanism. The Antibiotic inventory of a field-hospital should be set to cover a wide and unexpected spectrum of bacteria, including resistant organisms. This report adds important information to the scarce reports of bacterial resistance in Nepal."

Traveller's diarrhea (TD) is the leading cause of morbidity among travelers. Recently, molecular methods have been developed to detect the causative pathogens of TD. The aim of this study was to test a multiplex-PCR approach in patients with TD and asymptomatic controls.
Methods
In total, 91 travelers (61 TD cases, 30 asymptomatic controls) prospectively collected stool samples during travel and documented gastrointestinal symptoms. Samples were analyzed using the BioFire® FilmArray® Gastrointestinal Panel, which covers 13 enteric bacteria (e.g. diarrheagenic Escherichia coli), 4 protozoan parasites and 5 viruses.
Results
TD cases had more likely a positive test (46/61, 75%) compared to controls (17/30, 57%, p = 0.07). The most common enteric pathogens were enteroaggregative E. coli (36/91, 40%), followed by enterotoxigenic E. coli (31/91, 34%) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC, 29/91, 32%). The only pathogens significantly associated with TD were EPEC (p = 0.01) and ETEC (p = 0.047). Protozoan parasites were not detected.
Conclusion
Our results challenge the widespread use of multiplex-approaches covering numerous enteric pathogens in the diagnostic workup of TD because only few (i.e. diarrheagenic E. coli) were related to symptoms of TD."

Transmission occurs secondary to contamination of food or beverages by triatomine (kissing bug) feces containing infective Trypanosoma cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes. Orally transmitted infections are acute and potentially fatal. Oral Chagas transmission carries important clinical implications from management to public health policies compared to vector-borne transmission. This review aims to discuss the contemporary situation of orally acquired Chagas disease, and its eco-epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical management. We also propose preventive public health interventions to reduce the burden of disease and provide important perspectives for travel medicine. Travel health advisors need to counsel intending travellers to South America on avoidance of “deadly feasts” - risky beverages such as fruit juices including guava juice, bacaba, babaçu and palm wine (vino de palma), açai pulp, sugar cane juice and foodstuffs such as wild animal meats that may be contaminated with T. cruzi."

Medical schools offer students the opportunity to perform international electives. This study aimed to assess health risks among medical students, to tailor institutional guidelines.
Methods
Multicenter study at Dutch and Belgian universities, among medical students who visited low- or middle-income countries. Students completed four questionnaires: once before the elective and two weeks, three- and six months after return.
Results
Data was complete for 479 students (follow-up rate 84%). Most traveled to Surinam (29%) and South-Africa (14%). Half of the students encountered difficulties in adapting to local culture. Almost 40% visited malaria endemic countries. Nearly all (87%) used chemoprophylaxis as prescribed. Definite needle-stick or splash injuries were reported by 7%. All were dealt with adequately in accordance with national guidelines. However, less than half of 24 possible incidents were handled adequately. Two-and-a-half percent had unprotected sex with a new partner. The incidence of travelers’ diarrhea (TD) was 46%. In those with TD, the incidence of post-travel new-onset abdominal complaints was 3%. Three percent were involved in a minor traffic accident, 18% were injured during leisure activities, 5% were threatened or experienced physical violence. Only half of the students visiting a highly endemic country were screened for tuberculosis post-travel. For schistosomiasis this was 6%.
Conclusions
Students abroad are exposed to medical and non-medical challenges, which should be addressed during pre-travel counseling. Contact details of a professional back home should be provided, so students can confer in case of problems while abroad. Lastly, we recommend a centrally organized post-travel health check."

In France, the combination hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZ) is used in the treatment of COVID-19.
Methods
We retrospectively report on 1061 SARS-CoV-2 positive tested patients treated for at least three days with the following regimen: HCQ (200 mg three times daily for ten days) + AZ (500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days). Outcomes were death, clinical worsening (transfer to ICU, and >10 day hospitalization) and viral shedding persistence (>10 days).
Results
A total of 1061 patients were included in this analysis (46.4% male, mean age 43.6 years – range 14–95 years). Good clinical outcome and virological cure were obtained in 973 patients within 10 days (91.7%). Prolonged viral carriage was observed in 47 patients (4.4%) and was associated to a higher viral load at diagnosis (p < .001) but viral culture was negative at day 10. All but one, were PCR-cleared at day 15. A poor clinical outcome (PClinO) was observed for 46 patients (4.3%) and 8 died (0.75%) (74–95 years old). All deaths resulted from respiratory failure and not from cardiac toxicity. Five patients are still hospitalized (98.7% of patients cured so far). PClinO was associated with older age (OR 1.11), severity of illness at admission (OR 10.05) and low HCQ serum concentration. PClinO was independently associated with the use of selective beta-blocking agents and angiotensin II receptor blockers (p < .05). A total of 2.3% of patients reported mild adverse events (gastrointestinal or skin symptoms, headache, insomnia and transient blurred vision).
Conclusion
Administration of the HCQ+AZ combination before COVID-19 complications occur is safe and associated with a very low fatality rate in patients."

abstract = "Background
Patients with chronic conditions travel around the world more than ever. Only few studies have examined travel patterns and health outcomes of patients with rheumatic diseases during international travel.
Method
We conducted a multi-centre prospective cohort study in Switzerland, in which we studied the immunogenicity and safety of vaccinations in patients with rheumatic diseases and travellers without rheumatic diseases (controls). Participants who travelled internationally received questionnaires 1 and 13 weeks post-travel. We compared travel patterns, risk behaviours, and travel-associated problems during and after the trips in both groups.
Results
274 participants returned post-travel questionnaires (65 rheumatic patients, 209 controls). Controls more frequently travelled to subtropical/tropical destinations and stayed longer abroad. 64% of all participants experienced health problems during travel (74% rheumatic patients vs. 62% controls, P = 0.11). Pre-travel, patients reported a higher susceptibility to gastrointestinal infections. During travel, a higher percentage of rheumatic patients cancelled the day programme due to health problems (13% vs. 4%, P = 0.024). The main problems in rheumatic patients occurred due to the underlying rheumatic diseases, or were of psychological nature. Although not statistically significant, infectious disease symptoms (rhinitis, cough) occurred more frequently in controls. When only considering subtropical/tropical destinations, rheumatic patients more frequently had gastrointestinal problems during travel - and skin infections after the trip.
Conclusions
This study does not support the notion that patients with rheumatic diseases should avoid international travel for an increased risk of infections. In patients with subtropical/tropical destinations, however, gastrointestinal problems may be increased during travel - and skin infections post-travel."

Asymptomatic infection of SARS-CoV-2 has become a concern worldwide. This study aims to compare the epidemiology and the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals.
Methods
A total of 511 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases, including 100 asymptomatic (by the time of the pathogenic tests) and 411 symptomatic individuals were consecutively enrolled from January 25 to February 20, 2020 from hospitals in 21 cities and 47 counties or districts in Sichuan Province. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics were compared.
Results
Compared to the symptomatic patients, the asymptomatic cases were younger (P < 0.001), had similar co-morbidity percentages (P = 0.609), and came from higher altitude areas with lower population mobility (P < 0.001) with better defined epidemiological history (P < 0.001). 27.4% of well-documented asymptomatic cases developed delayed symptoms after the pathogenic diagnosis. 60% of asymptomatic cases demonstrated findings of pneumonia on the initial chest CT, including well-recognized features of coronavirus disease-19. None of the asymptomatic individuals died. Two elderly individuals with initially asymptomatic infection developed severe symptoms during hospitalization. One case of possible virus transmission by a patient during the incubation period was highly suspected.
Conclusions
The epidemiological and clinical findings highlight the significance of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. Inspecting the epidemiological history would facilitate the identification of asymptomatic cases. Evidence supports the chest CT scans for confirmed asymptomatic cases to evaluate the extent of lung involvement."

In most countries in the world, the outbreak of the disease has been serious and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has increased daily, while, fortunately the recovered COVID-19 cases have also increased. Clearly, forecasting the “confirmed” and “recovered” COVID-19 cases helps planning to control the disease and plan for utilization of health care resources. Time series models based on statistical methodology are useful to model time-indexed data and for forecasting. Autoregressive time series models based on two-piece scale mixture normal distributions, called TP–SMN–AR models, is a flexible family of models involving many classical symmetric/asymmetric and light/heavy tailed autoregressive models.

This study aimed to document changes in serological response before and after treatment of Schistosoma infection in resettled refugee children from endemic countries in Australia. Current Australian guidelines recommend serological screening for Schistosoma infection in children and adults from endemic countries. Data on the utility of follow-up serology after treatment is limited.
Methods
We undertook a retrospective audit of Schistosoma serology in refugee-background children presenting to a specialist paediatric refugee health clinic in Melbourne, Australia, between January 2005 and December 2014. Patients were included with positive Schistosoma serology, documented treatment with praziquantel; clinical and serological followup data after treatment, and no return to endemic areas.
Results
Fifty-one refugee-background children were included. Overall, 40/51 (78.4%) children had serology that decreased after treatment, 25/51 (49.0%) had a greater than twofold decrease and 22/51 (43.1%) reverted to negative serology. Six (11.8%) children showed an increasing serology titre and 5/51 (9.8%) had unchanged serology after treatment.
Conclusions
This is the first study describing the changes in Schistosoma serological titres following treatment in immigrant children in a non-endemic country. We observed a majority downward trend in antibody titres after praziquantel treatment, suggesting follow-up serological testing may be useful in children to monitor treatment response."

Malaria in pregnancy can cause severe maternal and fetal complications. Chloroquine (CQ) and mefloquine (MQ) are recommended for chemoprophylaxis in pregnancy, but are not always suitable. Atovaquone-proguanil (AP) might be a viable option for malaria prevention in pregnancy, but more safety data are needed.
Methods
Data for pregnancies and live births among active duty military women, 2003–2014, from the Department of Defense Birth and Infant Health Research program were linked with pharmacy data to determine antimalarial exposure. Multivariable Cox and logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship of antimalarial exposure with fetal and infant outcomes, respectively.
Results
Among 198,164 pregnancies, 50 were exposed to AP, 156 to MQ, and 131 to CQ. Overall, 17.6% of unexposed pregnancies and 28.0%, 16.0%, and 6.1% of pregnancies exposed to AP, MQ, and CQ, respectively, ended in fetal loss (spontaneous abortion or stillbirth) (adjusted hazard ratios [aHR] = 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87–2.46; aHR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.72–1.57; and aHR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.24–0.94, respectively).
Conclusions
The small number of AP exposed pregnancies highlights the difficulty in assessing safety. While definitive conclusions are not possible, these data suggest further research of AP exposure in pregnancy and fetal loss is warranted.

More research on fetal loss following atovaquone-proguanil exposure in pregnancy is warranted."

Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) significantly affected Latin America in the period 2015–2017. Most studies were reported from urban areas of Brazil and Colombia. In this paper we estimate Incidence rates for CHIKV and ZIKV in Caqueta, the Amazonian gateway area of Colombia, from 2015 to 2018.
Methods
Using surveillance data of CHIKV and ZIKV in Caqueta, Colombia, incidence rates were estimated (cases/100,000 population). Sixteen geographical information systems (GIS)-based municipal maps were developed. GIS software used was Kosmo 3.0®.
Results
From 1st of January 2015 to the 24th of November 2018, 825 cases of CHIK and 1079 of ZIKV were reported, yielding cumulated incidence rates of 169.42 and 221.59 cases/100,000 population respectively. In 2016, 48.7% of the CHIKV cases (402) and 96.6% of the ZIKV cases (1042) were reported. The highest number of both arboviral diseases occurred at Florencia (capital department city), 225 cases for CHIKV (127.17 cases/100,000 pop.) and 611 for ZIKV (345.34 cases/100,000 pop.).
Discussion
The temporo-spatial distribution of CHIKV and ZIKV infections in Caquetá reflected the pattern of concurrent epidemics, especially in 2016. Studies using GIS-linked maps are necessary to attain accurate epidemiological analyses for public health decisions. That is also useful for an epidemiologically based assessment of traveler risks when visiting specific areas in destination countries."

abstract = "Background
Aim of our study was to identify conditions under which malaria transmission caused by imported infectious mosquitoes or travellers could occur at large central European airports, and if such transmission could be sustained by indigenous mosquitoes.
Methods
We developed a deterministic and a stochastic compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (humans)/Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious (mosquitoes) model with two mosquito (imported Anopheles gambiae, indigenous A. plumbeus) and three human (travellers, airport personnel exposed/not exposed to imported A. gambiae) populations. We assessed various scenarios to identify combinations of model parameters leading to ongoing malaria transmission at the airport.
Results
The number of infected airport personnel was low (five infected employees/six months) under assumptions reflecting possible future climatic conditions, current passenger mobility and no desinsection of airports/aircraft. Almost all infections among airport personnel were directly due to bites by imported A. gambiae. Indigenous mosquitoes would need to have comparable transmission parameters to A. gambiae to sustain disease transmission. Incoming infectious passengers play only a minor role in malaria transmission. Use of aircraft/airport desinsection led to no transmission events in the model.
Conclusion
Our study shows that sustainable air travel-induced malaria transmission in central Europe is unlikely under current conditions or conditions which might become realistic in the next century."

Retrospective case series of NCC patients registered in the +REDIVI Network from October 1, 2009 to July 2018. A specific questionnaire, including clinical and diagnostic characteristics, was created and sent to the collaborator centers.
Results
46 cases were included in the analysis. 55% were male, mean age of 40 years. 95.6% were migrants. The median duration since migration from an endemic area was 10 years. Predominant nationalities were Ecuadorians (50%) and Bolivians (30.4%). Frequent locations were parenchymal (87%), subarachnoid (26.1%) and intraventricular cysts (10.9%). Serological analysis was performed in 91.3%, being 54.8% positive. Most prevalent clinical manifestations were persistent headache (60.9%), epilepsy (43.5%) and visual changes (13%). Patients were mainly treated with albendazole (76.1%), corticosteroids (67.4%), and anticonvulsionants (52.2%). 82.5% had a favorable clinical outcome.
Conclusions
Most NCC cases were long-standing migrants. Few clinical differences were observed depending on the cysticerci location. The treatment was often not according to current recommendations, and no uniform criteria were followed when it came to the therapeutic regimen. NCC case management in Spain (including clinician awareness and laboratory capacity improvements) needs to be strengthened."

abstract = "Background
Screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in migrants is important for elimination of tuberculosis in low-incidence countries, alongside the need to detect blood-borne infections to align with new guidelines on migrant screening for multiple infections in European countries. However, feasibility needs to be better understood.
Methods
We did a feasibility study to test an innovative screening model offering combined testing for LTBI (QuantiFERON), HIV, hepatitis B/C in a UK emergency department, with two year follow-up.
Results
96 economic migrants, asylum seekers and refugees from 43 countries were screened (46 [47.9%] women; mean age 35.2 years [SD 11.7; range 18–73]; mean time in the UK 4.8 years [SD 3.2; range 0–10]). 14 migrants (14.6%) tested positive for LTBI alongside HIV [1], hepatitis B [2], and hepatitis C [1] Of migrants with LTBI, 5 (35.7%) were successfully engaged in treatment. 74 (77.1%) migrants reported no previous screening since migrating to the UK.
Conclusion
Multi-disease screening in this setting is feasible and merits being further tested in larger-scale studies. However, greater emphasis must be placed on ensuring successful treatment outcomes. We identified major gaps in current screening provision; most migrants had been offered no prior screening despite several years since migration, which holds relevance to policy and practice in the UK and other European countries."

No research has been conducted on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of homeless patients (HP) hospitalized in Infectious Disease Units (IDU).
Methods
We conducted a retrospective survey among 98 HP and 98 non-HP admitted between 2017 and 2018 in several IDUs in Marseille, France.
Results
HP were more likely to be migrant, to report frequent alcohol consumption or illicit drug use, and to present with respiratory symptoms at admission compared to controls. The most common final diagnoses in HP were respiratory tract infections (other than pulmonary tuberculosis [PTB], 35.7%), sexually transmitted infections (20.4%), cutaneous and mucosal infections (19.4%) and tuberculosis (12.2%). Sexually transmitted infections and ectoparasite infestations were significantly more frequent in HP compared to controls. One HP died from pleural effusion as a complication of PTB. The surviving HP had a longer length of stay (LOS, average 11.6 ± 13.6 days, p < 0.0001) than controls; independent factors of increased LOS were tobacco use (p = 0.009), tuberculosis infection (p < 0.0001), urinary tract infection (p = 0.018) and bacteraemia (p = 0.018). After hospital discharge, attendance at subsequent planned consultations was significantly lower in HP (0.72 ± 1.25 times/persons) compared to controls (2.03 ± 2.2).
Conclusions
We suggest that HP present specific demographic characteristics and patterns of infectious diseases compared to other patients and therefore require adapted management."

abstract = "Background
Plasmodium vivax is a frequent cause of recurring malaria in endemic areas as in its latent stage it resides in liver, and is responsible for relapse. Treatment with 8 aminoquinoline Primaquine is given for 14 days, however studies have shown dismal results with adherence to therapy. A new long acting 8 aminoquinoline, Tafenoquine was introduced that showed efficacy and safety almost similar to Primaquine in a single dose regimen, hence giving hopes for improved compliance and help in eradicating malaria.
Methods
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy of Tafenoquine with Primaquine or placebo. Our primary outcome was the recurrence of Plasmodium vivax parasitemia at 6 months and our safety outcomes included total number of adverse events as well as serious adverse events. We performed pooled data analysis by the random effects model and I2 was used to assess heterogeneity.
Results
4 RCTs were included. Our pooled analysis showed that the number of episodes of recurrence at 6 months between Tafenoquine and Primaquine (RR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.74–1.59), and between Tafenoquine and placebo (RR = 0.17, 95%CI = 0.03–1.11) was statistically insignificant. Comparison of serious adverse events did not show any significant risk associated with the use of Tafenoquine as compared to Primaquine when analyzed till day 29, which was the time period considered to show most probable drug associated events.
Conclusion
Tafenoquine as a single dose is an effective alternative to Primaquine for prevention of recurrence of P vivax malaria, with a reasonable safety profile."

The experience of previous sizable outbreaks may affect travelers’ decisions to travel to an area with an ongoing outbreak.
Methods
We estimated changes in monthly numbers of visitors to the Republic of Korea (ROK) in 2015 compared to projected values by selected areas. We tested whether areas’ experience of a previous SARS outbreak of ≥100 cases or distance to the ROK had a significant effect on travel to the ROK during the MERS outbreak using t-tests and regression models.
Results
The percentage changes in visitors from areas with a previous SARS outbreak of ≥100 cases decreased more than the percentage changes in visitors from their counterparts in June (52.4% vs. 23.3%) and July (60.0% vs. 31.4%) during the 2015 MERS outbreak. The percentage changes in visitors from the close and intermediate categories decreased more than the far category. The results from regression models and sensitivity analyses demonstrated that areas with ≥100 SARS cases and closer proximity to the ROK had significantly larger percentage decreases in traveler volumes during the outbreak.
Conclusions
During the 2015 MERS outbreak, areas with a previous sizable SARS outbreak and areas near the ROK showed greater decreases in percentage changes in visitors to the ROK."

abstract = "Background
Melioidosis, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is an opportunistic infection across the tropics. Here, we provide a systematic overview of imported human cases in a non-endemic country over a 25-year period.
Methods
All 55 Dutch microbiology laboratories were contacted in order to identify all B. pseudomallei positive cultures from 1990 to 2018. A response rate of 100% was achieved. Additionally, a systematic literature search was performed, medical-charts reviewed, and tissue/autopsy specimens were re-assessed.
Results
Thirty-three travelers with melioidosis were identified: 70% male with a median-age of 54 years. Risk factors were present in most patients (n = 23, 70%), most notably diabetes (n = 8, 24%) and cystic fibrosis (n = 3, 9%). Countries of acquisition included Thailand, Brazil, Indonesia, Panama, and The Gambia. Disease manifestations included pneumonia, intra-abdominal abscesses, otitis externa, genitourinary, skin-, CNS-, and thyroid gland infections. Twelve (36%) patients developed sepsis and/or septic shock. Repeat episodes of active infection were observed in five (15%) and mortality in four (12%) patients. Post-mortem analysis showed extensive metastatic (micro)abscesses amongst other sites in the adrenal gland and bone marrow.
Conclusions
The number of imported melioidosis is likely to increase, given rising numbers of (immunocompromised) travelers, and increased vigilance of the condition. This first systematic retrospective surveillance study in a non-endemic melioidosis country shows that imported cases can serve as sentinels to provide information about disease activity in areas visited and inform pre-travel advice and post-travel clinical management."

abstract = "After an outbreak in Wuhan, China, a growing number of countries are now suffering from an epidemic by SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Undoubtedly, reports of the skyrocketing global spread of COVID-19 has shocked people globally, from Japan to the United States. Presently, the World Health Organization indicates that the fatality rate due to COVID-19 is about 2%, inferring that many positive subjects may potentially overcome the illness with mild influenza-like symptoms and no need for hospitalization at intensive-care units. Because COVID-19 is completely new to the human immune system, many throughout the world are likely vulnerable to becoming sick after their initial exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Besides hospitalized cases, many individuals are likely asymptomatic but potentially carry the virus. While our knowledge about carriers and their virus shedding is deficient, some studies modelling the viral transmission have considered the potential contribution of the asymptomatic carriers. Protocols for managing asymptomatic cases, for example for controlling them to restrict their contact with healthy people at public places or private residences, have not been established. In-house quarantine may as well be applicable to asymptomatic cases if they could be identified and diagnosed. Presumably now, the asymptomatic subjects potentially contribute to the transmission of COVID-19 without their knowledge, intention, or being diagnosed as carriers. Thus, managing the asymptomatic subjects, who can carry and likely transmit the virus, is a major healthcare challenge while the pandemic is looming."

abstract = "Background
Expatriates (expats) from European countries regularly migrate to low-income countries where infectious diseases are more prevalent. Little evidence exists however on pediatric expatriates’ compliance with preventive measures related to infectious diseases. This study aims to evaluate compliance in Belgian expat-children.
Methods
Data of 135 Belgian expat-children, visiting the Institute of Tropical Medicine (Antwerp, Belgium), were collected from clinical notes, laboratory results and from a web-based immunization-register. Information on routine vaccinations, yellow fever, hepatitis A, rabies, typhoid fever, meningococcal ACW135Y, Japanese encephalitis, BCG vaccine and anti-malaria chemoprophylaxis was collected.
Results
Overall, 87% of expat-children were up-to-date with their routine vaccinations. Although all children were eligible for hepatitis A, typhoid and rabies vaccination, only 8–21% were fully vaccinated. Only 29 and 61% of eligible children were vaccinated against meningococcal (ACW135Y) or yellow fever respectively. Finally, only 10% of children who lived in malaria-endemic-areas, reported chemoprophylaxis-use.
Conclusion
Although routine vaccination coverage in expat-children seems adequate, additional preventive measures are often needed. Whether this is due to lack of high-quality health care-access, fear of side-effects or insufficient knowledge about the risks/available preventive measures, remains elusive. Nevertheless, expats seem to constitute a separate risk-group for infectious diseases and destination-related health issues."

To evaluate the occurrence and determinants associated with antibiotic use for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) among Hajj pilgrims.
Methods
Prospective cohort surveys were conducted among French pilgrims from 2012 to 2017. We also conducted a systematic review about available evidence for antibiotic consumption in relation with RTIs during the Hajj.
Results
783 pilgrims were included in the survey. During the Hajj, 85.3% presented respiratory symptoms and 47.6% used antibiotics. Pilgrims with productive cough or fever were three times and twice as likely to have used antibiotics. Dry cough, sore throat and voice failure were also associated with increased antibiotic use. 26.3% of pilgrims presented symptoms compatible with a lower tract respiratory infection. According to the French recommendations, only 39.6% of pilgrims who used an antibiotic actually had an indication for it. Antibiotic intake was associated with an increased frequency of persistent symptoms post-Hajj (aRR = 1.31, 95%CI [1.04–1.66]). The review included 14 articles. The use of antibiotic for respiratory tract infections during the Hajj varied from 7% to 58.5%. In 9 studies, the antibiotic consumption rate was >30%.
Conclusion
Respiratory tract infections are common during the Hajj, leading to high prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic intake."

Two commercial PCR assays were assessed in a retrospective study to determine their reliability as tools for the differentiation of Plasmodium species in human blood.
Methods
A total of 1022 blood samples from 817 patients with suspected or confirmed malaria submitted to the German National Reference Centre for Tropical Pathogens were subjected to malaria microscopy using thick and thin blood films as well as to a genus-specific malaria real-time PCR. Parasite-positive samples were analysed by RealStar Malaria S&T PCR Kit 1.0 (altona Diagnostics) and FTD Malaria Differentiation (Fast Track Diagnostics) multiplex real-time PCR assays targeting species-specific Plasmodium DNA.
Results
Out of the 1022 blood samples, 247 (24.2%) tested positive for Plasmodium spp. The two multiplex assays showed rather similar performance characteristics and provided concordant species information in 98.9% of samples positive by malaria microscopy and in 95.1% (RealStar) and 96.8% (FTD) of samples positive by genus-specific PCR. Compared to FTD, RealStar revealed slightly reduced sensitivity for submicroscopic, low-level P. falciparum infections, while FTD was unable to detect P. knowlesi.
Conclusions
The two commercial malaria PCR assays assessed are suitable for discriminating Plasmodium species in clinical samples, and can provide additional information in cases of microscopically uncertain findings."

Millions of tourists visit Malaysia annually while a large number of Malaysians travel overseas. Taking care of travellers’ healthcare needs is important aspect of the healthcare system. Community pharmacies are ideally positioned to provide travel health-related services. However, studies are lacking in this area. Therefore, this study aims to explore the nature and type of travel health-related services provided by Malaysian community pharmacies.
Methods
A survey was carried out at 135 community pharmacies in nine districts of Selangor, Malaysia, from November 2017 to February 2018, using a self-administered standardized questionnaire.
Results
The majority (n = 95, 85%) of community pharmacies reported to have provided services to both international travellers and outbound Malaysian travellers. The common healthcare services provided to international travellers were monitoring of chronic diseases including hypertension and diabetes, and advice on minor ailments, supplements and medical devices. The key health services provided to outbound Malaysian travellers were advice on vaccination requirements, better management of chronic diseases and necessary medications to manage illness during travel. Most of the respondents supported the provision of travel health-related services through the community pharmacies.
Conclusion
The study findings showed that Malaysian community pharmacies provided several travel health-related services to both international and Malaysian outbound travellers. Pharmacists in Malaysia are ideally positioned to have an increased role in travel medicine. They have the training to advise on complex medication issues especially with regard to interactions and polypharmacy. However, further training and courses should be provided that are tailored specifically for the needs of this professional group."

In Europe, the prevalence rates of schistosomiasis and HBV infection in migrants from sub-Saharan Africa are high. The co-infection schistosomiasis-HBV has been scarcely studied.
Methods
This is a retrospective study assessing differences in clinical presentation, laboratory and ultrasound findings in a cohort of migrants admitted at the Department of Infectious - Tropical Diseases and Microbiology IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital of Negrar (Northeast Italy) with schistosomiasis, HBV infection or both.
Results
Of the 227 migrants, 175 (77.1%) with a diagnosis of schistosomiasis were classified as SCHISTO group, 35 (15.4%) with schistosomiasis and hepatitis B were classified as SCHISTO/HBV group, and 17 (7.5%) patients with a diagnosis of HBV infection were classified as HBV group. S. mansoni was found in 47 patients, classified in MANSONI (38/175, 21.7%) or MANSONI/HBV (9/35, 25.7%) group depending on HBsAg status. Mean transaminases and APRI index values were higher in SCHISTO/HBV compared to SCHISTO group (p < 0.01). AST differed between MANSONI/HBV and MANSONI group (p = 0.038). No differences were found between SCHISTO/HBV and HBV group. Eosinophil count and total IgE differed only between MANSONI/HBV and HBV group (p = 0,049).
Conclusions
Schistosomiasis seems not to increase the liver damage in people with HBV infection. Conversely, finding elevated transaminases in patients with schistosomiasis should alert for presence of HBV."

abstract = "Background
Dengue fever control in the tropical island of Bali in Indonesia carries important significance both nationally and globally, as it is one of the most endemic islands in Indonesia and a worldwide popular travel destination. Despite its importance, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in dengue risk and factors associated with its variation in risk across the island has not been not well explored. This study was aimed to analyze for the first time the geographical and temporal patterns of the incidence of dengue and to quantify the role of environmental and social factors on the spatial heterogeneity of dengue incidence in Bali.
Methods
We analyzed retrospective dengue notification data at the sub-district level (Kecamatan) from January 2012 to December 2017 which obtained from the Indonesian Ministry of Health. Seasonality in notified dengue incidence was assessed by seasonal trend decomposition analysis with Loess (STL) smoothing. Crude standardized morbidity rates (SMRs) of dengue were calculated. Moran's I and local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) analysis were employed to assess spatial clustering and high-risk areas over the period studied. Bayesian spatial and temporal conditional autoregressive (CAR) modeling was performed to quantify the effects of rainfall, temperature, elevation, and population density on the spatial distribution of risk of dengue in Bali.
Results
Strong seasonality of dengue incidence was observed with most cases notified during January to May. Dengue incidence was spatially clustered during the period studied with high-risk kecamatans concentrated in the south of the island, but since 2014, the high-risk areas expanded toward the eastern part of the island. The best-fitted CAR model showed increased dengue risk in kecamatans with high total annual rainfall (relative risk (RR): 1.16 for each 1-mm increase in rainfall; 95% Credible interval (CrI): 1.03–1.31) and high population density (RR: 7.90 per 1000 people/sq.km increase; 95% CrI: 3.01–20.40). The RR of dengue was decreased in kecamatans with higher elevation (RR: 0.73 for each 1-m increase in elevation; 95% CrI: 0.55–0.98). No significant association was observed between dengue RR and year except in 2014, where the dengue RR was significantly lower (RR: 0.53; 95% CrI: 0.30–0.92) relative to 2012.
Conclusions
Dengue incidence was strongly seasonal and spatially clustered in Bali. High-risk areas were spread from kecamatans in Badung and Denpasar toward Karangasem and Klungkung. The spatial heterogeneity of dengue risk across Bali was influenced by rainfall, elevation, and population density. Surveillance and targeted intervention strategies should be prioritized in the high-risk kecamatans identified in this study to better control dengue transmission in this most touristic island in Indonesia. Local health authorities should recommend travelers to use personal protective measures, especially during the peak epidemic period, before visiting Bali."

Scrub typhus is the leading cause of treatable unidentified febrile illnesses in Southeast Asia. This study was conducted to document the epidemiological characteristics of scrub typhus and its change in Zhejiang, one of traditional epidemic provinces in China.
Methods
Scrub typhus surveillance data in Zhejiang province during 1957–1989 and 2006–2012 were obtained. Descriptive analysis was conducted to characterize the epidemiology of scrub typhus. The spatial distributions over the periods were explored using spatial autocorrelation analysis and spatiotemporal cluster analysis.
Results
A total of 4104 cases and 7 deaths were reported from 1957 to 1989 and 2006 to 2017. The incidence declined since 1959, remained low from 1967 to 1989, and then exponentially increased after 2006. The seasonality changed from a summer pattern between 1957 and 1989 to a bimodal peak pattern in July to August and October to November from 2006 to 2017. One primary and three secondary high-risk clusters were affirmed in both periods from 1980 to 1989 and 2006 to 2017. The primary cluster expanded southwestward and the time span of the secondary clusters extended in the later period compared to the clusters in the previous time frame.
Conclusion
Zhejiang recently underwent a seasonality change, geographic extension, and incidence increase in scrub typhus. More attention should be paid to controlling scrub typhus."

To document the management of drug-sensitive TB patients during the Hajj and assess compliance with the Saudi TB management guidelines.
Method
The study was conducted in hospitals in Makkah during the 2016 and 2017 Hajj seasons. Structured questionnaire was used to collect data on relevant indices on TB management and a scoring system was developed to assess compliance with guidelines.
Results
Data was collected from 31 TB cases, 65.4% (17/26) were Saudi residents. Sputum culture was the only diagnostic test applied in 67.7% (21/31) of patients. Most (96.8%, 30/31) confirmed TB cases were isolated, but only 12.9% (4/28) were tested for HIV and merely 37% (10/27) received the recommended four 1st-line anti-TB drugs. Guideline compliance scores were highest for infection prevention and control and surveillance (9.6/10) and identifying TB suspects (7.2/10). The least scores were obtained for treating TB (5.0/10) and diagnosing TB (3.0/10).
Conclusions
Healthcare providers training and supervision are paramount to improve their knowledge and skill and ensure their compliance with existing TB management guidelines. However, there may be a need for the introduction of an international policy/guideline for TB control and management during mass gatherings such as the Hajj to guide providers’ choices and facilitate monitoring."

Four databases were searched for articles reporting plasmid-mediated colistin resistance between bacteria isolated from countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Abstract books of scientific events realized in each region were also examined. After search and selection, 48 studies that included 18,705 isolates recovered between 2000 and 2018 were evaluated. The overall frequency of mcr genes in Latin America was 2.9% (550/18,705), with IncX4 plasmids shown to be the key vectors responsible for the dissemination of genes within the continent. Brazil, Bolivia and Argentina were the countries with the highest number of mcr-positive isolates, and only Colombia (mcr-5) and Brazil (mcr-3) presented mcr genes other than type 1. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were mainly found to carry the gene within the continent and these microorganisms showed high susceptibility to ertapenem, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, fosfomycin and tigecycline. This review showed that the mcr gene is circulating in several countries of Latin America. Thus, it is important to encourage microbiological and molecular surveillance programs to avoid the spread of these genes within and outside the continent."

The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first described in 2012 and attracted a great international attention due to multiple healthcare associated outbreaks. The disease carries a high case fatality rate of 34.5%, and there is no internationally or nationally recommended therapy.
Method
We searched MEDLINE, Science Direct, Embase and Scopus databases for relevant papers published till March 2019 describing in vitro, in vivo or human therapy of MERS.
Results
Initial search identified 62 articles: 52 articles were from Medline, 6 from Embase, and 4 from Science Direct. Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 30 articles were included in the final review and comprised: 22 in vitro studies, 8 studies utilizing animal models, 13 studies in humans, and one study included both in vitro and animal model. There are a few promising therapeutic agents on the horizon. The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b showed excellent results in common marmosets and currently is in a randomized control trial. Ribavirin and interferon were the most widely used combination and experience comes from a number of observational studies. Although, the data are heterogenous, this combination might be of potential benefit and deserve further investigation. There were no randomized clinical trials to recommend specific therapy for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection. Only one such study is planned for randomization and is pending completion. The study is based on a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b. A fully human polyclonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) was safe and well tolerated in healthy individuals and this agent may deserve further testing for efficacy.
Conclusion
Despite multiple studies in humans there is no consensus on the optimal therapy for MERS-CoV. Randomized clinical trials are needed and potential therapies should be evaluated only in such clinical trials. In order to further enhance the therapeutic aroma for MERS-CoV infection, repurposing old drugs against MERS-CoV is an interesting strategy and deserves further consideration and use in clinical settings."

We study the association between prior yellow fever immunization and clinical outcomes of dengue infections in individuals of varying sexes and ages. Serological interactions between dengue virus and other flaviviruses could drive antibody dependent enhancement, which is associated with disease severity in dengue infections. This effect may influence disease severity in individuals subsequently affected by related flaviviruses, such as dengue. We compare the severity of dengue episodes between patients vaccinated and non-vaccinated against yellow fever.
Methods
We evaluated the severity of 11,448 lab-confirmed dengue cases reported in São José do Rio Preto, Brazil, in 7370 YF vaccinated patients compared to 4043 unvaccinated patients. We regressed dengue severity against YF vaccine status and a number of demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables as controls. We also evaluated the association between YF vaccination status and the clinical and laboratory symptoms of dengue patients.
Results
We did not find any evidence of increased risk for severe dengue in patients vaccinated against YF (odds ratio = 1.00; 95% confidence interval = 0.87–1.14). Most of the variables analyzed did not have a statistically significant association with YF vaccination status.
Conclusions
We found no evidence that YF vaccination in dengue-endemic areas increases the risk of severe dengue fever."

An Online search of the PubMed, CINAHL and Google databases of English language literature was conducted June 2016, October 2017, June 2018 and April 2019 using the terms children and travel, air travel, travel health, disabled child, children with special healthcare needs, parents of disabled children, vacations, recreation, international, wheelchairs, planning techniques, asthma, diabetes, altitude, cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, sickle cell disease, depression, food allergies, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and seizures. The search was limited to years 2000-2019. A secondary search of relevant articles was conducted using the reference sections of articles identified in the primary search.
Results
185 papers were examined for travel health related outcomes for children and adults with chronic diseases. Articles were excluded if they addressed the educational needs of students with disabilities traveling abroad, did not directly address travel health (e.g travel skills, travel itineraries), contained outdated policy statements, or were case reports of a single patient. The remaining 84 papers were organized and reviewed by organ systems. The articles were primarily descriptive and did not lend themselves to a systematic review.
Conclusion
Children traveling with chronic and complex health conditions are a heterogeneous group of vulnerable travelers. Closing the knowledge gap about how to best help these travelers requires a multipronged approach. Research is urgently needed to identify best practices for five of the most common chronic childhood diseases: asthma, depression, ADHD, food allergies and autism. For less common illnesses, ones typically cared for in specialty clinics, expert consensus opinion and multi-center studies are needed. Families and disease advocacy societies should be included in the research as they may have already identified the most pressing travel-related health concerns and solutions for these problems."

abstract = "COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) is a kind of acute severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV (2019-nCoV) infection. Since December 2019, it has been found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spread to the whole country. Some parts of the world also showed an outbreak trend [1–3]. Real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction,RT-PCR) and viral gene sequencing are the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. At present, upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal swabs are mostly used as nucleic acid detection samples in China, but the positive rate is low. However, there are few reports on clinical application of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in other biological samples.
Methods
| The East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. This observation study included 132 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the infectious disease areas of the East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from 2020.1.31 to 2020.2.29. COVID-19 diagnostic criteria: according to China's ⟪pneumonia diagnosis and treatment Program of novel coronavirus infection (trial version 7) ⟫, in accordance with the relevant epidemiological and clinical manifestations, nasopharyngeal swabs real-time fluorescence RT-PCR detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive, COVID-19 cases were divided into mild, ordinary, severe and severe [1]. The nasopharyngeal swabs of 132 cases of COVID-19 were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid on admission, including 72 males and 60 females, with an average age of 66.7 ± 9.1 years, including 80 cases of common type, 44 cases of severe type and 8 cases of critical type. During the period of admission, under the condition of tertiary protection, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, blood, feces and anal swabs of COVID-19 cases were collected many times in the isolation ward for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection. All biological samples are sealed and transferred to the laboratory in strict accordance with the standard process. The RT-PCR test kits (BioGerm) were recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The same technician and brand of test kit was used for all RT-PCR testing reported; both internal controls and negative controls were routinely performed with each batch of tests.
Results
| 132 the results of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of various biological samples during the treatment of confirmed COVID-19 cases are as follows: the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of nasopharyngeal swab is 38.13% (180/472 times), the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of sputum is 48.68% (148/304 times), the positive rate of blood 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test is 3.03% (4/132 times), and the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of feces is 9.83% (24/244 times). The positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in anal swabs is 10.00% (12/120 times).
Discussion|
In this study, it was found that the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in sputum of 132 patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of nasopharyngeal swabs, and viral nucleic acids were also detected in blood and digestive tract (fecal/anal swabs). Simple detection of nasopharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection positive rate is not high, multi-sample 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection can improve the accuracy, reduce the false negative rate, better guide clinical treatment and evaluate the therapeutic effect."

There will be a total of 62 sport disciplines. This event poses specific challenges, given its size and the diversity of attendees. Such gatherings also have potential for the transmission of imported or endemic communicable diseases, including measles in view of the global outbreak situation, but also tropical endemic diseases. In anticipation of increased travel, a panel of experts from the Latin American Society for Travel Medicine (SLAMVI) developed the current recommendations taking into consideration the epidemiology and risks of the main communicable diseases at potential destinations in Peru, recommended immunizations and other preventives measures. These recommendations can be used as a basis for advice for travelers and travel medicine practitioners. Mosquito-borne infections also pose a challenge. Although Lima is malaria free, travelers visiting Peruvian high-risk areas for malaria should be assessed regarding the need for chemoprophylaxis. Advice on the correct timing and use of repellents and other personal protection measures is key to preventing vector-borne infections. Other important recommendations for travelers should focus on preventing water- and food-borne diseases including travelers’ diarrhea. This paper addresses pre-travel, preventive strategies to reduce the risk of acquiring communicable diseases during the Pan American Games and also reviews the spectrum of endemic infections in Lima and Peru to facilitate the recognition and management of infectious diseases in travelers returning to their countries of origin."

The Grand Magal of Touba is the largest Muslim pilgrimage in Senegal with a potential for infectious disease transmission.
Methods
Clinical follow-up, adherence to preventive measures and qPCR-based respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens carriage pre- and post-Magal, were assessed.
Results
110 pilgrims from South Senegal were included. The duration of stay in Touba was 3 days. 41.8% and 14.5% pilgrims reported respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Most individuals having the onset of symptoms during their stay in Touba, or soon after returning. The acquisition of rhinoviruses, coronaviruses and adenovirus was 13.0, 16.7 and 4.6% respectively and that of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae was 3.7% and 26.9%. Acquisition of gastrointestinal viruses and parasites was low, while bacterial acquisition ranged from 2.2% for Campylobacter jejuni to 33.0% for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli.
Conclusion
This preliminary study confirms that Grand Magal pilgrims are likely to be exposed to communicable disease risk as observed in other pilgrimage settings. Further study including larger numbers of pilgrims are needed to investigate potential risk factors for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections at the Grand Magal."

Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. We analysed active and latent TB infections (LTBI) from the Spanish Network for the Study of Imported Infectious Diseases by Travellers and Immigrants (+REDIVI).
Methods
Observational, retrospective, multicentre study of TB and LTBI registered in the +REDIVI network from October 2009 to December 2016.
Results
Of 1008 cases of LTBI, 884 (87.7%) were immigrants; 93 (4.5%), immigrants visiting friends and relatives (VFR); 2 (0.9%), VFR-travellers; and 29 (1.1%), travellers. Absolute (N = 157 vs. N = 75) and relative (12.5% vs. 5.9%) frequency decreased over the study period (p = 0.003). Median time to diagnosis was 24.6 months (females 50.3 vs males 11.9; p < 0.001). Of 448 TB cases, 405 (90.4%) were in immigrants; 30 (6.7%), VFR-immigrants; 6 (1.3%), VFR-travellers; and 7 (1.6%), travellers. Median time to diagnosis was 62.5 months (females 86.6 vs males 70.1; p = 0.0075). There were 8 multidrug resistant TB cases and 1 extensively drug resistant case of TB, all in immigrants.
Conclusion
TB was frequently diagnosed more than 5 years after arrival in Spain. Screening programmes for TB and LTBI in immigrants should be considered beyond this time point. Women showed a higher diagnostic delay for both latent and active TB."

A number of factors can lead to differences in infectious disease morbidity in children versus adults after a trip abroad. We aimed to investigate the epidemiological and etiological features of infectious diseases in children after international travel. Methods: we analyzed the medical records of 2135 patients (416 children) who were hospitalized during the period 2009–2017 after return from international travel.
Results
Hospitalized children were under the age of 1 year in 8.7% of cases, 1–3 years - 39.4%, 4–6 years – 17.3%, 7–11 years – 16.8%, 12–17 years – 17.8%. Children were hospitalized after visiting the following main destinations: Turkey (15%), Egypt (12%), Central Asia microregion [11%] and Thailand (9%). Hospitalizations among children occurred mainly in summer (38.0%; CI 33.3–42.4). In adults there were no significant seasonal differences. Children were more likely to have acute diarrhea (18.3 vs 11.1%), acute respiratory tract infections (51.2 vs 41.2%) and enterovirus infections (8.2 vs 3.1%). Among the non-endemic infections for Russia, 8 children were diagnosed with dengue fever, 1 with typhoid, 1 with malaria, and 1 with wild-poliovirus excretion.
Conclusion
children were mainly hospitalized during summer. Among hospitalized children, almost half was under 3 years old. In children acute respiratory infection and intestinal infections predominated, while in adults, vector-borne diseases were more frequently observed."

abstract = "Background
Malaria prevention in travellers can be complex and requires consideration of a number of factors. UK healthcare professionals providing pre-travel malaria advice can access specialist support from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) telephone advice line. The aim of this study is to characterise queries to the NaTHNaC telephone advice line regarding pre-travel malaria advice.
Method
Telephone calls received to NaTHNaC's advice line are recorded using an online data capture form. All calls relating to malaria advice during 2016 were selected and data extracted. Analysis was undertaken using Microsoft Excel and STATA.
Results
During 2016, 1803 malaria-related calls were received; the majority from general practice and calls were from across the UK. The most common type of pre-travel malaria query was country-specific followed by travellers with special health needs. Many queries related to pregnant and breastfeeding travellers, children under 5 years and travellers over 60 years.
Conclusions
This review presents a large and exceptional dataset and reflects the ambiguity amongst some healthcare professionals regarding malaria advice. We have identified potential knowledge gaps, and as a result will strengthen future guidance, enhance existing malaria maps, and inform the development of future clinical educational activity."

abstract = "Background
Dengue virus importation from abroad is still the main driver of dengue incidence in China. Using global flight data to model importation may improve our understanding and prediction of dengue virus importation and onward transmission.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was performed of surveillance cases of dengue infections imported to China and volume of air traffic to China for the years 2005 through 2014, inclusive. The data were aggregated by year, destination province, and source country. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and a random effects negative binomial model was created to predict the number of imported cases based on the volume of travelers from dengue-endemic countries.
Results
There were 1,822 cases of imported dengue infections over the study period. Most imported cases are from a small number of high-incidence countries with a large volume of travel to China, most notably Myanmar (22% of cases). The number of imported cases of dengue infections increased by 5.9% for every 10% increase in travel volume from dengue-endemic countries.
Conclusion
Patterns of air travel have a measurable impact on the importation of dengue to China. Modelling dengue importation risk may be a useful strategy to direct public health surveillance and interventions."

Typhoid fever was rare in Taiwan but approximately two-thirds of the cases were indigenous. The transmission source of the indigenous cases and the relatedness to the imported cases remained unknown.
Methods
Patients with any site culture positive for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi were identified in a teaching hospital during 2001–2014. The isolates were determined for antibiotic susceptibilities, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) types.
Results
A total of 64 typhoid episodes were identified in 63 patients. Seventeen episodes (26.6%) were imported and a majority (10, 58.8%) of them were from Indonesia. The clinical manifestations, outcomes of patients and antibiograms of isolates were similar between indigenous and imported cases. 63.3% of the isolates were ciprofloxacin-resistant. The distributions of PFGE and SNP types did not differ significantly between indigenous and imported isolates, either (P = 0.191 and 0.124, respectively). Identical PFGE pattern could be identified in indigenous isolates appearing at certain time frames, indicating outbreaks due to local transmission of certain Typhi strains.
Conclusions
The imported cases of typhoid fever from Southeast Asia were the major sources of indigenous S. Typhi infections in Taiwan. Small-scale outbreaks occurred due to local transmission of the strains after their importation."

abstract = "Background
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has significantly affected Latin America in 2015–2017. Most studies have been reported from Brazil and Colombia, and only a few from Central America. For these reasons, we analyzed the incidence, incidence rates and evolution of cases in Honduras from 2016 to 2017.
Methods
Using epidemiological weeks (EW) surveillance data on the ZIKV epidemics in Honduras, we estimated incidence rates (cases/100,000 population), and developed maps at national, departmental and municipal levels.
Results
From 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017, a total of 32,607 cases of ZIKV were reported (98.5% in 2016 for an incidence rate of 36.85 cases/100,000 pop; 1% confirmed by RT-PCR). The highest peak was reached on the EW 6°, 2016 (2559 cases; 29.34 cases/100,000 pop). The department with the highest number of cases and incidence rate was Cortés (13,128 cases, 791.08 cases/100,000 pop in 2016).
Discussion
The pattern and evolution of ZIKV infection in Honduras have been similar to that which occurred for chikungunya in 2015. As previously reported, infection with chikungunya involved predominantly the central and capital area of the country, reaching incidences there >750 cases/100,000 pop. Studies using geographical information systems linked with clinical disease characteristics are necessary to attain accurate epidemiological data for public health systems. Such information is also useful for assessment of risk for travelers who visit specific areas in a destination country."

abstract = "Background
Literature on health events in HIV-infected travellers is scarce, particularly in sub-Saharan African (SSA) migrants.
Methods
We investigated health events in HIV-infected SSA migrants living in France during and after travel to their native country. All had a pre-travel plasma viral load (pVL) below 200 copies/mL and were on stable combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Logistic regression models were used to assess the risk factors for at least one adverse health event or febrile event.
Results
Among 264 HIV migrants, pre-travel median CD4 count was 439/mm3 and 27 migrants (6%) experienced a low-level viremia between 50 and 200 copies/mL. One hundred (38%) experienced at least one event (13 experienced two events). The most common events were gastrointestinal, including diarrhoea (n = 29, 26%), respiratory events (n = 20, 18%), and malaria (n = 17, 15%; 1 death). In multivariable analysis, a pre-travel low-level viremia and a lack of pre-travel medical advice significantly increased the risk for any event (OR 4.31, 95% CI, 1.41–13.1; and OR 3.62, 95% CI, 1.38–9.47; respectively). A lack of pre-travel advice significantly increased the risk for febrile event.
Conclusions
Early and tailored counselling on pre-travel medical advice regarding diarrhoea and vector-borne diseases prophylactic measures in HIV-infected SSA migrants should be emphasised before travel to Africa."

The study investigates the diagnoses of inpatients (tourists and Nepali workers) of Kunde Hospital (Mt.Everest region) over 15 years.
Methods
Records from January 1996 to September 2011 were analyzed concerning date, gender, age group, nationality, purpose of visit, diagnosis, length of treatment, and condition at discharge. Diagnoses were coded according to ICD-10-WHO 2010. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests. P < 0.05 was defined as significant.
Results
479 inpatients were included: 363 (75.8%) males (202 trekkers (42.2%), 277 Nepalese workers (57.8%)). Most suffered from altitude sickness (45.5%), acute gastroenteritis (10.4%) or acute respiratory infection (8.4%). Severe cases of altitude sickness amongst trekkers decreased but increased amongst workers. Severe cases of acute gastroenteritis amongst trekkers increased. Mean length of inpatient treatment was 4.6 days ±2.7 days. 573/2030 days of treatment were caused by altitude sickness. 70 patients were evacuated, 9 died.
Conclusion
Altitude illness caused the majority of inpatient treatment and acute gastroenteritis may be an underestimated risk for both groups. Other severe problems were mostly illnesses, not trauma. Improved prevention strategies are needed for both groups. For tourists who often show pre-existing diseases this includes an individual pre-travel expert advice. Nepali workers should be instructed concerning acclimatization."

In recent years Europe has experienced a dramatic increase in migration flows. Nevertheless, limited data is available about the occurrence of neglected parasitic diseases among migrant population. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of intestinal and urinary parasites in newly arrived asylum seekers.
Methods
A total of 364 newly arrived migrants hosted at the Asylum Seekers Centre of Castelnuovo di Porto (Italy) were screened during 8 months period for intestinal and urinary parasites. Each enrolled subject was interviewed using a standardized questionnaire, with focus on socio-demographical data and risk factors of parasitic infections.
Results
Stool analysis showed a prevalence of intestinal parasites of 20.6%. The travel route did not affect the prevalence of intestinal parasites (p = 0.096), while a significant negative correlation was found between the length of travel and the prevalence of parasite infection (p = 0.019). No statistically significant correlation between gastrointestinal symptoms and the presence of intestinal parasites was detected.
Conclusion
The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis reported in asylum seekers does not necessarily reflect the prevalence of the parasitosis in the motherland. An anamnestic and syndromic approach may not be sufficient to highlight the problem of intestinal parasitic infestations in a screening setting."

Diarrhea is one of the most common causes of child morbidity and mortality in refugee camps, aggravated by inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene services, and malnutrition, particularly in developing countries.
Methodology
A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted to assess acute diarrhea and associated risk factors among under-five children in refugee and host communities in Gambella Region, Ethiopia. Descriptive statistics were used, and bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify variables associated with diarrhea.
Results
A total of 1667 under-five children was included in this study, and prevalence of diarrhea differed between the refugee (38%) and host (33%) communities [OR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.04, 1.8]. Refugee camp households using uncovered water containers, consuming low quantities of water, and lacking hand washing setups were more likely to report children with diarrhea. Within host communities, households were more likely to report acute childhood diarrhea if they consumed surface water or did not have a latrine.
Conclusion
The two-week prevalence of diarrhea was significantly higher among children in the refugee camps than those in the host communities. Therefore, further collaboration between government and non-government organizations is required to identify persisting factors of diarrhea transmission in various communities in the region."

abstract = "Background
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection a concern to travellers because of potential sexual transmission and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Objective
To describe our experience in diagnosing ZIKV in travellers returning from endemic territories.
Method
Travellers were evaluated for ZIKV at our clinic in a 12-month period during the outbreak, using ZIKV-specific RT-PCR and anti-ZIKV Immunoglobulin M/G ELISA when symptomatic, and ELISA only for asymptomatic travellers, preferably from 20 days after the last exposure. All positive ELISA results were subject to confirmation by Virus Neutralization Testing. We estimated post-test probabilities of ZIKV in asymptomatic travellers.
Results
Of 462 travellers, 227 reported symptoms and 235 did not. Asymptomatic travellers had similar baseline characteristics, but were younger (median age 31 vs. 33 years, p = 0.01) and had reproductive concerns more often (75.8% vs. 24.2%). ZIKV infection was confirmed in 49 cases: 46/227 (20.3%) were symptomatic and 3/235 (1.3%) asymptomatic. Rash (positive likelihood ratio (LRP) 5.6) and conjunctivitis (LRP 10.8) predicted ZIKV infection. The post-test probability of a negative ELISA-result at 20–25 days was below 0.1%.
Conclusion
ZIKV infection was frequent in symptomatic, but not in asymptomatic travellers. We consider negative ELISA results at 20–25 days after exposure a safe strategy to rule out ZIKV infection. Testing for ZIKV-specific antibodies within this timeframe could be particularly valuable in the management of returning travellers who wish to conceive."

Epidemiological data on pediatric travelers are lacking, especially from Oceania. We aimed to evaluate travelers presenting to a pediatric emergency department in Sydney during a time of heightened travel surveillance.
Method
Cases between December 2014 and February 2015 were ascertained by screening medical records for key terms and visa status, as well as laboratory data for malaria testing. Cases were restricted to communicable diseases and evidence of travel within 21 days.
Results
104 children were identified. 82 children were Australian-resident travelers returning from abroad, 11 were visitors to Australia, 8 were recent migrants/refugees and 3 were medical transfers. Travel and behavioral patterns were characterized by exposures to low-income countries in the Asia-Pacific, visiting families and relatives, prolonged exposure periods and limited uptake of prophylaxis. Intrinsic vulnerabilities included extremes of age (median: 3.3 years) and pre-existing co-morbidities (6.7%). Common syndromes were respiratory (38.5%), systemic febrile illness (19.2%), acute diarrhea (17.3%) and dermatological conditions (9.6%). A minority were diagnosed with tropical infections: four typhoid or paratyphoid fever, two dengue and one tropical ulcer.
Conclusions
Young travelers are a heterogeneous group who present with a broad spectrum of diseases, from the benign to the life-threatening. Our data may be used to inform diagnostic approaches, empiric therapies and contribute towards public health strategies."

Results
Of 559 participants in 2010, 23.4% reported receipt of the 2009H1N1 vaccine. Of 1423 participants in 2012, 33.7% received the 2011–2012 influenza vaccine. Both years, those crossing the border ≥8 times per month had lower vaccination coverage than those crossing less frequently. US-border residents had lower H1N1 coverage than those in other locations. Vaccination coverage was higher for persons age ≥65 years and, in 2010 only, those with less than high school education. Although most participants believed it is important to get vaccinated, only half believed the influenza vaccine was safe and effective. The main reasons for not receiving the influenza vaccine were beliefs of low risk of disease, time constraints, and concerns about vaccine safety (in 2010) or efficacy (in 2012).
Conclusions
International land border crossers are a large and unique category of travelers that require targeted binational strategies for influenza vaccination and education."

We studied geographic distribution of diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli virulence genes (DEC VGs) acquisition in travellers and investigated if they acquired highly virulent EAEC/STEC hybrid strains.
Methods
From the prospective, multicentre COMBAT study among 2001 Dutch travellers, 491 travellers were selected based on travel destination to 7 subregions. Faecal samples taken directly before and after travel were screened for nine DEC VGs with real-time PCR. Incidence proportions and rates were calculated for each gene and subregion.
Results
479 travellers were analysed. 21.8% acquired aggR (EAEC), with highest acquisition rates in Northern and Western Africa and 15.3% acquired eae (STEC/EPEC) with highest rates in travellers to Western and Eastern Africa. ETEC (elt or est gene) was acquired by 4.2% of travellers and acquisition of est was associated with traveller's diarrhoea. Overall, the risk of acquiring DEC VGs was low in Southern Africa and South America. Although the combination of aggR (EAEC) and stx1/2 (STEC) was acquired by 3 travellers, these genes could not be detected together in a single E. coli strain.
Conclusions
The risk of acquisition of DEC VGs strongly depends on the travel destination, with those travelling to Africa - except Southern Africa - having a higher risk."

The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012 and attracted an international attention as the virus caused multiple healthcare associated outbreaks. There are reports of the role of asymptomatic individuals in the transmission of MERS-CoV, however, the exact role is not known.
Method
The MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for relevant papers published till August 2018 describing asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection.
Results
A total of 10 papers were retrieved and included in the final analysis and review. The extent of asymptomatic MERS infection had increased with change in the policy of testing asymptomatic contacts. In early cases in April 2012–October 2013, 12.5% were asymptomatic among 144 PCR laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases while in 2014 the proportion rose to 25.1% among 255 confirmed cases. The proportion of asymptomatic cases reported among pediatric confirmed MERS-CoV cases were higher (41.9%–81.8%). Overall, the detection rate of MERS infection among asymptomatic contacts was 1-3.9% in studies included in this review. Asymptomatic individuals were less likely to have underlying condition compared to fatal cases. Of particular interest is that most of the identified pediatric cases were asymptomatic with no clear explanation.
Conclusions
The proportion of asymptomatic MERS cases were detected with increasing frequency as the disease progressed overtime. Those patients were less likely to have comorbid disease and may contribute to the transmission of the virus."

Most DF research focuses on Latin America and Asia, where burdens are highest. There is a critical need for studies in other regions where DF is an important public health problem but less well-characterized and can differ, such as the Middle East. The first documented case of DF in Saudi Arabia occurred in 1993. After a decade of sporadic outbreaks, the disease was declared endemic in 2004 and this designation persists. Climate, sociodemographic factors, and increasing urbanization impact the spread of DF in Saudi Arabia, as in other areas. However, DF transmission in Saudi Arabia is also affected by several unique factors, including large numbers of migrant workers and religious pilgrims from other dengue endemic areas across the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia. Important knowledge gaps relate to the role of climatic factors as drivers of DF in Saudi Arabia and the role of foreign workers and pilgrims in the original and continuous importation of dengue virus. Filling these gaps would improve health system preparedness."

Estimate inpatient hospitalization costs for patients with microcephaly, and predict cost increases due to a potential Zika virus outbreak.
Methods
We identified Texas-wide inpatient hospitalization discharge records (2008–2015), for newborns and non-newborns with microcephaly. We estimated the cost of each hospitalization by applying cost-to-charge ratios on the actual hospitalization charge. For comparison, newborn visits for patients without microcephaly were also identified, and hospital costs were compared between patients with and without microcephaly. We estimated costs for microcephaly during the first year of life following a Zika outbreak (possible 1–50% increase in birth prevalence) in Texas.
Results
There were 8005 microcephaly hospitalizations ($203,899,042; total cost). The median admission cost for newborns with microcephaly (N = 1393) was higher compared to those without microcephaly ($6751 vs $725, p < 0.001). Microcephaly hospitalizations of newborns had a lower median cost compared to non-newborns ($6751 vs $9754, p < 0.001). Based on these observed hospitalization costs, we estimated that a potential Zika virus outbreak in Texas could result in an additional $1–6 million per year for hospitalizations.
Conclusion
Hospitalizations of patients with microcephaly are associated with high costs. An increase in microcephaly prevalence due to a Zika outbreak in Texas could have a considerable impact on health care costs."

The World Health Organization conditionally recommends systematic screening of tuberculosis (TB) and Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) among asylum seekers (AS) from high-burden countries, but the effectiveness of different screening approaches is controversial.
Methods
We report the results of a retrospective cohort analysis of TB and LTBI screening among consecutive AS in Brescia, Italy during 2015–2016. TB screening was based on symptoms, LTBI screening on the tuberculin skin test (TST). Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with screening uptake.
Results
Of 2904 registered AS 2567 (88.4%) were evaluated for TB, 62 (2.4%) had symptoms and active TB yield was 155/100,000. Prevalence and incidence TB rates were 545/100,000 persons and 220/100,000 person-years. Questionnaire screening identified 28.6% (4/14) prevalent cases. Of 2303 (89.7%) AS with TST result, the positivity rate was 36.6% (843/2303). Of the 843 candidates for LTBI treatment 413 (49.0%) completed the screening. LTBI treatment was prescribed to 190 (47.9%) of 397 eligible individuals, 10.8% (91) completed treatment.
Conclusions
TB prevalence and incidence rates were high in this AS population, but symptom-based screening performed poorly. LTBI cascade losses were significant and mainly attributable to the defragmentation of the health care system."

Prevention of arthropod-borne infections hinges on bite prevention. We aimed to investigate travellers’ use of repellents.
Methods
We measured the amount of applied repellent with a spray containing 30% DEET and 20% Icaridin versus a lotion with 20% Icaridin alone. We calculated the concentration of active ingredient reached on the skin and evaluated formulation acceptability. The travellers completed a questionnaire evaluating Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice (KAP) to anti-vectorial protective measures (AVPM).
Results
Some 200 volunteers travelling to mosquito borne infection endemic areas were recruited. The mean concentration of active substance achieved on the skin of the left arm was 0.52 mg/cm2 of DEET/Icaridin spray versus 0.21 mg/cm2 of Icaridin lotion. These levels are below the recommended protective dose (1 mg/cm2) for each formulation. Women were significantly more likely to apply a higher, protective dose of repellent. Travellers to Africa, women and older participants showed higher projected adherence to AVPM.
Conclusions
Only 2.5% of recruited travellers applied the recommended protective dose of repellent. Women and older travellers are the most adherent users of repellents. The pre-travel health consultation should provide more information on the application quantity and correct use of repellents."

Ehrlichia canis was detected in 2 Rh. e. evertsi pools and in one of them Anaplasma bovis was amplified. An Am. hebraeum pool showed infection with Anaplasma ovis and another with Coxiella burnetii.
Conclusion
South African donkeys are involved in the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens and other associated agents such as C. burnetii with Health importance. A potential new Rickettsia species, with unknown pathogenic potential, has been detected in the anthropophilic Rh. simus."

abstract = "Background
The Islamic Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca is one of the world's largest annual mass gatherings. Inevitable overcrowding during the pilgrims' stay greatly increases the risk of acquiring and spreading infectious diseases, especially respiratory diseases.
Method
The MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for all relevant papers published prior to February 2018 that evaluated the prevalence of clinical symptoms of respiratory infections, including pneumonia, among Hajj pilgrims, as well as their influenza and pneumococcal vaccination status.
Results
A total of 61 papers were included in the review. Both cohort- and hospital-based studies provide complementary data, and both are therefore necessary to provide a complete picture of the total burden of respiratory diseases during the Hajj. Respiratory symptoms have been common among Hajj pilgrims over the last 15 years. In cohorts of pilgrims, cough ranged from 1.9% to 91.5%. However, the prevalence rates of the most common symptoms (cough, sore throat, and subjective fever) of influenza-like illness (ILI) varied widely across the included studies. These studies have shown variable results, with overall rates of ILI ranging from 8% to 78.2%. These differences might result from differences in study design, study period, and rates of vaccination against seasonal influenza that ranged from 1.1% to 100% among study participants. Moreover, the definition of ILI was inconsistent across studies. In hospitalized Hajj pilgrims, the prevalence of pneumonia, that remains a major concern in critically ill patients, ranged from 0.2% to 54.8%.
Conclusions
Large multinational follow-up studies are recommended for clinic-based syndromic surveillance, in conjunction with microbiological surveillance. Matched cohorts ensure better comparability across studies. However, study design and data collection procedures should be standardized to facilitate reporting and to achieve comparability between studies. Furthermore, the definition of ILI, and of most common symptoms used to define respiratory infections (e.g., upper respiratory tract infection), need to be precisely defined and consistently used. Future studies need to address potential effect of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine in the context of the Hajj pilgrimage."

Travelers to India are often colonized with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) or Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). The aim of this study was to investigate if the probiotic species Lactobacillus Rhamnosus GG (LGG) could prevent the colonization of the gut with multi-drug resistant bacteria.
Methods
Adult Danish travelers traveling to India for 10–28 days were randomized to receive either LGG or no probiotics during travel. Rectal swabs and questionnaires were obtained before travel, immediately after and six months after return. Swaps were screened for the presence of ESBL-E and CPE.
Results
31 travelers were randomized to the LGG group and 30 to the control group. Before traveling, 6/50 (12.0%) were colonized with ESBL-E. After return, 41/44 (93.2%) of those not colonized before travel were colonized and 11/36 (30.6%) were still colonized after six months. There was no statistically significant difference in the colonization rate between the group receiving LGG and the control group. No CPE was detected in any cases.
Conclusions
The study confirms the very high incidence of colonization with ESBL-E associated with travel to India with >90% colonized upon return and one third were intestinal carriers for at least six months. Use of LGG did not have any effect on the risk of colonization with ESBL-E."

Migrants may be underimmunised and at higher risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, yet there has been no comprehensive examination of what policies are currently implemented across Europe targeting child and adult migrants. We analysed vaccination policies for migrants in 32 EU/EEA countries and Switzerland.
Methods
Using framework analysis, we did a comparative analysis of national policies and guidelines pertaining to vaccination in recently arrived migrants through a systematic guideline and literature review and by approaching national experts.
Results
Six (18.8%) of 32 countries had comprehensive policies specific to the vaccination of migrants (two focused only on child migrants, four on both adults and children). Nineteen (59.4%) countries applied their national vaccination schedule for migrant vaccinations, predominantly focusing on children; and five (15.6%) countries had circulated additional migrant-specific resources to relevant health-care providers. In six (18.8%) countries, policies on migrant vaccination focused on outbreak-specific vaccines only. In ten (31.3%) countries, policies focused on priority vaccinations, with polio being the vaccine most commonly administered and heterogeneity noted in vaccines recommended to adults, adolescents, and children. Eighteen (56.3%) countries recommended that an individual should be considered as unvaccinated where vaccination records were missing, and vaccines re-administered. Nine (28.1%) countries reported that specific vaccinations were mandatory.
Conclusion
There is considerable variation in policies across Europe regarding approaches to vaccination in adult and child migrants, and a lack of clarity on optimum ways forward, what vaccines to offer, with a need for robust research in this area. More emphasis must be placed on ensuring migrant-specific guidance is disseminated to front-line healthcare professionals to improve vaccine delivery and uptake in diverse migration populations across the region."

In 2016, Zika virus (ZIKV) spread rapidly throughout the Americas and Caribbean in an explosive outbreak. In the UK, testing for ZIKV infection is performed at Public Health England's Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. Here we present the UK's experience of imported ZIKV during the epidemic.
Method
A retrospective review was performed on the laboratory computer system searching by orders for ZIKV PCR and/or ELISA serology tests between 1st January 2016 and 31st December 2017. Each individual request form and result was reviewed.
Results
Of 6333 symptomatic patients tested for ZIKV, 374 (6%) had molecular or serological evidence consistent with recent infection; most of these had travelled to the Caribbean in 2016. On follow-up of PCR-confirmed cases, ZIKV IgM disappeared within 6 weeks and often didn't appear in patients with previous dengue infection. Rash was the commonest symptom in PCR-confirmed infection (93%). There were only single cases of presumed sexual transmission and of in-utero transmission.
Conclusions
The rise and fall in numbers of imported ZIKV cases largely reflected the temporal course of the outbreak in the Caribbean. ZIKV serology is difficult to interpret but the absence of antibodies to ZIKV 14 days after symptom onset makes infection very unlikely."

Updated data regarding the epidemiology of imported malaria in Italy are needed. The aim of this study is to evaluate trends in incidence and associated lethality of malaria episodes and to consider if there has been an increase in paediatric cases in the region of Tuscany.
Methods
All malaria cases diagnosed from 2000 to 2017 in 31 Tuscan hospitals were retrospectively identified. Epidemiological data regarding hospitalization rates and lethality for malaria in paediatric and adult population were described.
Results
Among the 1102 retrieved cases of malaria (134 children and 968 adults). Plasmodium falciparum was the most commonly reported species (67%). The overall hospitalization rate was of 1.69 cases per 100,000 population/year. Hospitalization rate in the total population decreased from 2000 to 2009 (p < 0.01) and increased from 2009 to 2017 (p < 0.01), similar trends were observed in adults and children. However, in 2010–2017, the cumulative child group incidence of 1.78 per 100,000 surpassed that of the adult group of 1.53 per 100,000 (p < 0.01). Fifteen deaths occurred, all of them in adults, giving a crude lethality rate of 1.36%.
Conclusions
In Tuscany, malaria is still a health concern in terms of both morbidity and mortality. Educational actions and pre-travel advice must be promoted."

Malaria infection poses a significant risk in pregnancy, yet chemoprophylaxis for pregnant women is limited. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the incidence of adverse outcomes after atovaquone-proguanil (AP) exposure during pregnancy.
Methods
Following PRISMA guidelines, the authors searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Malaria in Pregnancy Consortium Library to identify relevant literature including infant outcomes after exposure to atovaquone, proguanil, or AP in pregnancy. Two authors independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts, and extracted data into an EpiInfo database. Overall proportions and 95% confidence intervals of adverse outcomes were determined by pooling data across studies.
Results
Of 455 records identified, 16 studies were included: ten AP studies and six proguanil studies. The overall proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of adverse outcomes reported for the 446 women exposed to AP include miscarriage (8.08% CI: 5.07, 12.08%), stillbirth (1.05% CI: 0.03, 5.73%), early neonatal death (0% CI: 0, 7.4%), and congenital anomalies (2.56% CI: 1.28, 4.53%).
Conclusions
The limited available data suggest that outcomes following AP exposure during pregnancy are similar to expected rates in similar populations. AP may be a promising option for pregnant women, but further data are needed on its safety in pregnancy."

Yellow Fever (YF) is a high fatality rate disease (30–50%) caused by Flavivirus, present in some African and South American countries. In order to determine the magnitude and epidemiological distribution of YF cases, vaccination coverage and most affected regions in Brazil, a descriptive epidemiological study monitoring the last outbreak was undertaken in Portugal.
Method
The Brazilian database “Portal da Saude” was used to collect data on cases of YF. We used Microsoft Excel on a weekly basis to update the suspected, confirmed and mortality cases as well as the case fatality rate and epizootics in non-human primates.
Results
Case Fatality Rate was 33.6%. A total and 82% of confirmed cases were males. The outbreak predominantly affected two south-eastern states, Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, both with a very low vaccination coverage.
Conclusions
The last outbreak of YF was by far the largest observed over the last few decades! Until the emergence of this outbreak, Espírito Santo, Bahia and Rio de Janeiro were states of low risk for YF and the vaccine not previously recommended. The World Health Organization's “Global Strategy to Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic” (EYE) should be on the way, to prevent YF outbreaks in Brazil and other countries in Africa and South America."

Gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis (GIB) is a rare mycosis affecting almost exclusively immunocompetent subjects.
Methods
We describe a case of GIB caused by Basidiobolus ranarum in a 25-year-old Italian immunocompetent man resident in Ireland who presented a 2-month history of epigastric pain. Suspecting colon cancer he underwent a right hemicolectomy subsequently leading to a diagnosis of GIB by means of molecular biology. After surgery a 9-month therapy with itraconazole was employed with a good outcome. A review of medical literature regarding GIB cases published in the period 1964–2017 is presented.
Results
One-hundred and two cases of GIB were included in this analysis. The disease was observed predominantly in male gender (74.5%) and children (41.2%). Abdominal pain was the single most common complaint (86.3%) followed by fever (40.2%) and evidence of an abdominal mass (30.4%). Peripheral blood eosinophilia was detected in 85.7% of cases. Most of the patients were diagnosed in Saudi Arabia (37.2%) followed by USA (21.6%) and Iran (20.6%). Surgery plus antifungal therapy was employed in the majority of patients (77.5%).

Recently, the number of HIV-infected travellers to (sub)tropical areas has increased substantially. In the Netherlands, HIV-positive travellers with CD4-cells of <500/mm3 are advised to carry stand-by antibiotic treatment against travellers’ diarrhoea. Our aim was to determine whether HIV infection is associated with travel-related symptomatic diseases.
Methods
A prospective study was performed among HIV-infected travellers and age-matched HIV-uninfected travel companions serving as controls, attending two travel clinics in Amsterdam. Participants filled out daily questionnaires before, during, and after their trip.
Results
Overall, 52 pairs were included. All participants were male, and 91.3% were born in a Western country. Prevalence of travel-related diarrhoea was 50% among HIV-positive travellers and 40% among controls. No significant differences were observed for incident travel-related diarrhoea (incidence rate ratio = 1.60, 95%CI = 0.79–3.27) or duration of symptoms (odds ratio = 1.49, 95%CI = 0.65–3.45).

Only 6.3% of HIV-positive travellers with CD4-cells of <500/mm3 and diarrhoea used their stand-by antibiotic treatment as recommended.
Conclusion
Travel-related symptoms were not significantly more frequent or longer lasting among HIV-infected travellers compared to controls. Most HIV-infected travellers with CD4-cells of <500/mm3 and diarrhoea did not take stand-by antibiotic treatment. These results may question the need for routine prescription of stand-by antibiotics among this specific risk group. Further research, especially among HIV infected VFR travellers and in larger study groups is needed."

There has been a marked increase in the reporting of confirmed vivax malaria cases in certain geographical areas. This study investigated cases of severe vivax malaria in the Republic of Korea.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of adult patients diagnosed with vivax malaria in the Republic of Korea during the period 2000 to 2016. Diagnosis was made using the World Health Organization criteria, with the exception of parasite density.
Results
Among 1366 malaria cases, 255 (18.7%) were classified as severe vivax malaria, and 46 (3.4%) required intensive care. None of patients died of malaria. Patients with severe vivax malaria were older and had more comorbidity. The enrollment periods were classified into three groups, 2000 to 2005 (506 cases), 2006 to 2010 (696 cases), and 2011 to 2016 (304 cases). Malaria cases decreased from 2011 to 2016, but severe malaria cases increased significantly over time (14.3%, 20.1%, and 22.8%, p = 0.003). Common severe manifestations were shock (45.6%) and jaundice (43.1%).
Conclusions
Cases of severe malaria increased, and shock and jaundice were the predominant findings of severe vivax malaria in the Republic of Korea."

. Diarrhea is a well-established problem in travellers, with military personnel at especially high risk. This study aimed to characterise the spectrum of pathogens causing diarrhea in UK military personnel in South Sudan, and assess the utility of culture-independent testing for etiology and antimicrobial resistance in a logistically challenging and austere environment.
Methods
. All military personnel presenting with diarrhea were admitted to the UK Level 2 Medical Treatment Facility in Bentiu, South Sudan. Samples were tested for etiology utilising multiplex PCR-based diagnostics (BioFire FilmArray). In addition, the presence of carbapenemase resistance genes was determined using the geneXpert Carba-R platform.
Results
. Over 5 months, 127 samples were tested. The vast majority of pathogens detected were diarrheagenic Escherichia coli. The presence of either enterotoxigenic (ETEC) or enteropathogenic (EPEC) E. coli was a significant predictor of the other being present. In this study patients presenting with vomiting were 32 times more likely to have norovirus than not (p < 0.001). No carbapenem resistance was detected.
Conclusions
. Diarrhea in UK military personnel in South Sudan was determined to be predominantly bacterial, with norovirus presenting a distinct clinical and epidemiological pattern. Multiplex PCR and molecular resistance point of care testing were robust and effective in this environment."

abstract = "Background
Viral respiratory tract infections are frequent among Hajj pilgrims. However, it is still not known whether viruses are responsible for the symptoms observed in sick pilgrims or whether they only colonize sick and asymptomatic pilgrims.
Patients and methods
A prospective cohort study was conducted among French Hajj pilgrims in 2016. Medical follow-up and systematic nasal swabbing were performed pre- and post-Hajj. Additional samples were obtained per-Hajj, at symptom onset in ill pilgrims. Viruses were identified using the BioFire FilmArray® Respiratory multiplex qualitative PCR panel.
Results
109 pilgrims were included. 83.5% presented respiratory symptoms during Hajj and 39.5% were still symptomatic on return. 5.5% of pre-Hajj, 95.2% of per-Hajj (at symptom onset) and 46.5% of post-Hajj samples tested positive (p < 0.0001). Acquisition rates of rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus 229E and influenza A virus were respectively 38.6%, 19.8% and 2.0%. Although rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus 229E and influenza A clearance were respectively 70.6%, 71.4% and 100% on return, overall virus carriage proportion on return was 75.0% in pilgrims with influenza-like illness and 44.0% in those who have never experienced this symptoms or resolved it (OR = 4.05, 95% CI [1.02–16.02]).
Conclusions
Viruses likely play some role in the pathogenesis of the respiratory tract infections at the Hajj. Point of care-rapid multiplex PCR assays are valuable diagnosis tools in this context when used at respiratory symptom onset or soon after."

abstract = "Background
Since the emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, the virus had caused a high case fatality rate. The clinical presentation of MERS varied from asymptomatic to severe bilateral pneumonia, depending on the case definition and surveillance strategies. There are few studies examining the mortality predictors in this disease. In this study, we examined clinical predictors of mortality of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection.
Methods
This is a retrospective analysis of symptomatic admitted patients to a large tertiary MERS-CoV center in Saudi Arabia over the period from April 2014 to March 2018. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analysis was done using a binary regression model.
Results
A total of 314 symptomatic MERS-CoV patients were included in the analysis, with a mean age of 48 (±17.3) years. Of these cases, 78 (24.8%) died. The following parameters were associated with increased mortality, age, WBC, neutrophil count, serum albumin level, use of a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and corticosteroid use. The odd ratio for mortality was highest for CRRT and corticosteroid use (4.95 and 3.85, respectively). The use of interferon-ribavirin was not associated with mortality in this cohort.
Conclusion
Several factors contributed to increased mortality in this cohort of MERS-CoV patients. Of these factors, the use of corticosteroid and CRRT were the most significant. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these factors were a mark of severe disease or actual contributors to higher mortality."

abstract = "Background
Travellers’ diarrhea (TD) impacts annually over 20 million tourists, business travellers and military troops on a worldwide basis. Reliance on antibiotic prophylaxis and educational programs has not lead to a significant reduction in TD rates. Previous reviews of probiotics for TD have not accounted for the strain-specificity of probiotic efficacy nor have investigated prebiotics for the prevention of TD.
Methods
Standard literature databases were searched from 1977 to June 2018 unrestricted by language. Inclusion criteria included: Probiotic, probiotic or symbiotic interventions, randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and ≥2 RCTs with the same probiotic strain or mixture.
Results
Of 158 screened articles, 12 RCT were included in the systematic review and 6 RCTs (with nine treatment different arms) were included in the meta-analysis. Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 showed a significant reduction in TD incidence (RR = 0.79, 95% C.I. 0.72–0.87, p < 0.001), while L. rhamnosus GG showed a trend (p = 0.08) and L. acidophilus showed no significant (p = 0.16) reduction of TD.
Conclusions
The number of trials using probiotics or prebiotics for the prevention of TD continues to be limited in number. Only one of three probiotics showed significant efficacy for the prevention of TD. More research is needed for other probiotics strains and prebiotics to determine if they could also prevent TD."

However, the dynamics of the microbiota changes during ESC-R-Ent colonization and whether there is a particular bacterial composition which is associated with subsequent colonization is unknown.
Methods
Forty healthy volunteers living in Switzerland underwent screening before and after a trip to India, and also 3, 6 and 12 months after traveling. Culture-based ESC-R-Ent screening and microbiota analysis based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were performed at all time points.
Results
Prevalence of ESC-R-Ent colonization before traveling was 10% (n = 4), whereas it increased to 76% (n = 31) after the trip. Based on bacterial diversity analyses of the gut microbiota, there were few but significant differences for colonized versus non-colonized individuals. However, an alternative, cluster based analysis revealed that individuals remained in the same cluster over time indicating that neither traveling nor ESC-R-Ent colonization significantly influences bacterial composition. Moreover, none of the found microbiota clusters were significantly associated with subsequent risk of ESC-R-Ent colonization.
Conclusion
Based on their microbiota patterns, every volunteer was at the same risk of ESC-R-Ent colonization while traveling to India. Therefore, other risk factors for ESC-R-Ent colonization are responsible for this phenomenon."

abstract = "Background
In Algeria, Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF), caused by Rickettsia conorii conorii and transmitted by Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks, is endemic. However, the documentation of cases is rare due to a lack of laboratory facilities. Our aim was to screen for rickettsioses in patients with fever, rash and a possible inoculation eschar.
Materials and methods
Between 2013 and 2015, patients with a fever and a rash presenting at hospitals in the Tizi-Ouzou region were prospectively included in our study. Sera were screened using Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) and qPCR was performed on swab samples from eschars.
Results
One hundred and sixty-six patients were included. For 57 patients, MSF due to R. conorii conorii was diagnosed by serology and qPCR on a swab eschar sample. Three patients were diagnosed with murine typhus, a flea borne rickettsiosis. In addition, two patients had a positive serology in IgM for R. felis. For nine patients, serology for rickettsiosis was positive, but the specific rickettsia involved could not be determined. Nine patients had a severe disease with neurological involvement or multi-organ failure.
Conclusion
Clinicians should routinely screen for rickettsioses in patients and travellers presenting with a rash upon return from Algeria. Doxycycline treatment must be given promptly because the prognosis can be severe."

keywords = "Viral hepatitis, Immigrants, Travellers",
abstract = "Background
Continuous growth of mobile populations has influenced the global epidemiology of infectious diseases, including chronic and acute viral hepatitis.
Method
A prospective observational multicentre study was performed in a Spanish network of imported infections. Viral hepatitis cases from January 2009 to September 2017 were included.
Results
Of 14,546 records, 723 (4.97%) had imported viral hepatitis, including 48 (6.64%) acute cases and 675 (93.36%) chronic cases. Of the 48 acute cases, 31 were travellers and immigrants returning from visiting friends or relatives (VFR), while 19 (61%) were acute Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. Only 18.2% of VFR immigrants and 35% of travellers received pre-travel advice. Acute hepatitis was more frequent in VFR immigrants (AOR 2.59, CI95% 1.20–5.60) and travellers (AOR 2.83, CI95% 1.46–5.50) than immigrants. Of the 675 Chronic cases, 570 were immigrants, and 439 (77%) had chronic Hepatitis B. Chronic hepatitis was more frequent in immigrants (AOR 20.22, CI95% 11.64–35.13) and VFR immigrants (AOR 11.12, CI95% 6.20–19.94) than travellers.
Conclusions
Chronic viral hepatitis was typical of immigrants, acute viral hepatitis was common among travellers, and VFR immigrants had mixed risk. Improving pre-travel consultation and screening of immigrants may contribute to preventing new cases of viral hepatitis and avoiding community transmission."

Point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) urine cassette testing has become a popular approach to screen for Schistosoma infection. Since the test is also increasingly used for following-up of treatment success, we assessed the assay's diagnostic accuracy after praziquantel treatment of S. mansoni infection among Eritrean refugees in Switzerland.
Methods
In our preceding study, 107 asymptomatic Eritrean refugees in Switzerland were screened for schistosomiasis by stool microscopy, serology, and POC-CCA urine testing. Individuals screened positive by any method were treated with praziquantel and invited for a follow-up visit, repeating the same diagnostic procedures one year after treatment. The POC-CCA baseline and follow-up results were analyzed against the ‘baseline microscopy positive cases’ (= the most reliably true positive cases) and the ‘baseline microscopy plus serology negative cases at baseline and follow-up’ (= the most reliably true negative cases).
Results
Complete diagnostic baseline and follow-up sampling was available from 48 participants. Compared to most reliably true positive cases at baseline, POC-CCA testing had a sensitivity of 90%. Compared to most reliably true negative cases, POC-CCA testing had a specificity of 73.9%.
Conclusion
We conclude that the POC-CCA urine test is valuable for screening but its use is not suitable for routine follow-up after treatment."

Viral respiratory tract infections are known to be common in Hajj pilgrims while the role of bacteria is less studied.
Methods
Clinical follow-up, adherence to preventive measures and PCR-based pharyngeal bacterial carriage pre- and post-Hajj, were assessed in a cohort of 119 French Hajj pilgrims.
Results
55% had an indication for pneumococcal vaccination. Occurrence of respiratory symptoms was 76.5%, with cough (70.6%) and sore throat (44.5%) being the most frequent; fever was reported by 38.7% pilgrims and 42.0% took antibiotics. Respiratory symptoms, fever and antibiotic intake were significantly more frequent in pilgrims with indication for vaccination against pneumococcal infection. The prevalence of S. pneumoniae carriage (1.8% pre-, 9.8% post-Hajj), H. influenzae carriage (0.9%, 45.4%) and K. pneumoniae (2.8%, 9.8%) significantly increased post-Hajj. Pilgrims vaccinated with conjugate pneumococcal vaccine were seven time less likely to present S. pneumoniae carriage post-Hajj compared to those not vaccinated (3.2% vs. 18.0%, OR = 0.15; 95% CI [0.03–0.74], p = 0.02).
Conclusions
Pilgrims at risk for pneumococcal disease are more likely to suffer from febrile respiratory symptoms at the Hajj despite being immunized against pneumococcal disease and despite lowered S. pneumoniae carriage and should be targeted for reinforced prevention against respiratory infections."

The absolute number of travel-related Chlamydia cases in Sweden has consistently increased between 2000 and 2013. Given the growth in international travel, we aimed to study the trends of travel-related Chlamydia incidence to determine differences and identify high-risk groups and destinations.
Methods
For 2000–2013 we calculated annual Chlamydia incidence per 100,000 travels by dividing the number of notified travel-related cases by the number of travels; the latter were collected from a yearly survey among Swedish residents. For specific destinations 95% confidence intervals were calculated and monotonic yearly trends tested.
Results
The overall median annual travel-related Chlamydia incidence was higher for women than for men, but the opposite was true in age groups >25 years. For men, Thailand had the highest incidence, which was 3–7 times higher than the next highest destination in each age group. Spain, Turkey and Thailand had the highest incidence among women, but differences between countries were smaller than for men. For most destinations the yearly trends were stable.
Conclusions
We showed different profiles for men and women and age groups in terms of high incidence destinations. This specific information could allow to better tailor safe sex messages and advocate post-travel Chlamydia testing to target groups travelling to certain destinations."

The Research Group on Chemotherapy of Tropical Diseases, Japan, introduced artemether–lumefantrine (AL) in late 2002, mainly for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Because AL was on the market in Japan in March 2017, the effectiveness and safety of AL were analyzed to help medical personnel use AL optimally.
Methods
Case report forms submitted by the attending physicians were analyzed. When necessary, direct contact with the attending physicians was made to obtain detailed information.
Results
Effectiveness analysis was performed for 62 cases and safety analysis was performed for 66 cases. In P. falciparum malaria, the overall cure rate was 91.1% (51/56), of which the cure rates for Japanese and non-Japanese patients were 82.1% (23/28) and 100% (28/28), respectively. The successfully treated cases included severe P. falciparum malaria, with parasite densities exceeding 500,000/μL. Adverse events were reported in 14 patients, including delayed hemolytic anemia which occurred in the top four highest parasitemic cases.
Conclusions
AL treatment failure in P. falciparum malaria may not be rare among non-immune individuals, including Japanese. The possibility of delayed hemolytic anemia, which occurs preferentially in high parasitemic cases, should be considered following AL treatment."

Recent advances in genetic testing have improved understanding of novel genetic causes of congenital microcephaly. The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Latin America has highlighted the need for a better understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms of microcephaly including both infectious and non-infectious causes. The diagnostic approach to microcephaly needs to include potential infectious and genetic etiologies, as well as environmental in-utero exposures such as alcohol, toxins, and medications. Emerging genetic alterations linked to microcephaly include abnormal mitotic microtubule spindle structure and abnormal function of centrosomes. We discuss the diagnostic challenge of congenital microcephaly in the context of understanding the links with ZIKV emergence as a new etiological factor involved in this birth defect."

abstract = "Background
We evaluated existing data on the prophylactic efficacy of atovaquone-proguanil (AP) in order to determine whether prophylaxis in travellers can be discontinued on the day of return from a malaria-endemic area instead of seven days after return as per currently recommended post-travel schedule.
Methods
PubMed and Embase databases were searched to identify relevant studies. This PROSPERO-registered systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines. The search strategy included terms or synonyms relevant to AP combined with terms to identify articles relating to prophylactic use of AP and inhibitory and half-life properties of AP. Studies considered for inclusion were: randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, quasi-experimental studies, open-label trials, patient-control studies, cross-sectional studies; as well as case-series and non-clinical studies. Data on study design, characteristics of participants, interventions, and outcomes were extracted. Primary outcomes considered relevant were prophylactic efficacy and prolonged inhibitory activity and half-life properties of AP.
Results
The initial search identified 1,482 publications, of which 40 were selected based on screening. Following full text review, 32 studies were included and categorized into two groups, namely studies in support of the current post-travel regimen (with a total of 2,866 subjects) and studies in support of an alternative regimen (with a total of 533 subjects).
Conclusion
There is limited direct and indirect evidence to suggest that an abbreviated post-travel regimen for AP may be effective. Proguanil, however, has a short half-life and is essential for the synergistic effect of the combination. Stopping AP early may result in mono-prophylaxis with atovaquone and possibly select for atovaquone-resistant parasites. Furthermore, the quality of the studies in support of the current post-travel regimen outweighs the quality of the studies in support of an alternative short, post-travel regimen, and the total sample size of the studies to support stopping AP early comprises a small percentage of the total sample size of the studies performed to establish the efficacy of the current AP regimen. Additional research is required — especially from studies evaluating impact on malaria parasitaemia and clinical illness and conducted among travellers in high malaria risk settings — before an abbreviated regimen can be recommended in current practice.

abstract = "Background
In the developing world, only a small minority of patients have access to radiological services. Over the past decade, technological developments of ultrasound equipment have led to the emergence of point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS), which is widely used by healthcare professionals of nearly all specialties. We hypothesized that physicians with only basic POCUS training, but with telemedicine support, can use POCUS successfully in rural hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa.
Method
During a 14-day voluntary clinical work session in a rural hospital in central Uganda, bedside ultrasound scans were performed by use of a pocket-size portable machine by a physician who underwent a five-day training period. All the POCUS studies were reviewed by radiologists and cardiologists abroad with the use of telemedicine.
Results
During the study period, 30% of patients received a POCUS-augmented physical examination. 16 out of 23 patients (70%) had positive findings; in 20 of them (87%), the management was changed. The technique was successfully used on trauma casualties, patients suffering from shock, patients with cardiorespiratory symptoms, and patients undergoing invasive procedures.
Conclusions
In a very resource-limited environment, POCUS conducted by basically trained primary care physicians with telemedicine support is a powerful diagnostic tool in a variety of medical conditions."

The implementation of strict preventative measures including mandatory meningococcal vaccination with the quadrivalent (A,C,Y,W) vaccine has prevented pilgrimage-associated meningococcal outbreaks and significantly reduced the incidence of the disease at these events. However, meningococcal disease remains an important public health threat at the Hajj and Umrah due in part to the evolving nature of the disease, characterized with diverse and varying geographic trends, fluctuations in incidence and shifts in serogroups and genotypes. In addition, the current Hajj and Umrah meningococcal disease preventative measure do not protect against all invasive serogroups and do not necessarily affect carriage and transmission as the polysaccharide vaccine is still widely used. As a consequence, these events are still susceptible to outbreaks of the disease including those due to serogroups not included in the required vaccines such as serogroups B and X. In this context, despite the global decline in incidence of meningococcal disease, including that cause by serogroup B, the increased predominance of serogroup B disease in many countries, including countries with large Muslim populations, and the emergence of serogroup X in the African meningitis belt, are particularly concerning. Continued and strict surveillance of meningococcal diseases nationally and globally, especially in Muslim countries, is essential in detecting, understanding, and predicting the changes in the epidemiology of the disease and informing appropriate prevention and control strategies during these events. The current meningococcal disease preventative measures for Hajj and Umrah should continue to be strictly implemented, reviewed regularly and updated in accordance with changes in the epidemiology of meningococcal disease and availability of new preventative tools including new vaccines."

In Alberta, Canada, authorized pharmacists may prescribe medications and vaccines and administer injections. Some have implemented travel clinics to meet the growing demand for pre-travel consultations. As a new service, the outcomes of independent pharmacist-performed pre-travel consultations is unknown.
Methods
Chart review and post-travel surveys were performed among a convenience sample of patients presenting to a pharmacist-managed travel clinic for consultation. Data collected included patients' travel plans, recommendations for vaccines and other prescription and non-prescription drugs and adherence to these recommendations, satisfaction with the service, and health issues experienced during travel.
Results
103 patients participated in the study. The overwhelming majority (79%) of recommended vaccinations were administered in clinic. The post-travel questionnaire was completed by 76% of patients, with 94% of these reporting being satisfied or very satisfied with the care received. Health issues during travel were infrequent, with gastrointestinal illness most common. Of those patients who experienced any health issue during their trip, 93% felt adequately prepared to manage the condition.
Conclusions
This study reports positive patient satisfaction and health status while travelling following a pharmacist-performed pre-travel consultation including authorization to prescribe and to administer vaccines. These results support the continued expansion of pharmacists' scope in this area."

Most of internationally adopted children (IAC) come from countries in which tuberculosis (TB) is endemic. Interpretation of discordant Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) and Quantiferon-Gold In Tube (QFT) results is under debate.
Methods
Children consecutively referred to our IAC Center between 2009-2017 were prospectively evaluated and screened with protocol recommended by the America Academy of Pediatrics, including TST and QFT. TB infection prevalence was evaluated and possible risk factors associated with discordant TST/QFT results were investigated.
Results
1775 IAC were enrolled (median age: 5.8; IQR:3.3–8.2; 1065 [60.0%] males). Most of the children came from a European country (715; 40.3%) and, among them, 428 (59.9%) from Russia. Active pulmonary TB was diagnosed in 7 (0.4%) children while LTBI was diagnosed in 255 (14.4%) children. Concordant TST-/QFT-result was observed in 1520 (85.6%) children, concordant TST+/QFT + result in 63 children (3.5%), while 169 children (9.5%) displayed TST+/QFT-result and the remaining 23 children (1.3%) TST-/QFT+. Factor significantly associated with discordant TST+/QFT-result was BCG vaccination (aOR:2.62; 95%CI. 1.12–6.12; P = 0.026) and age <5 years (aOR: 5.59; 95%CI:2.27–12.18; P < 0001). . No significant association was evidenced with, continent of origin, eosinophilia or gender.
Conclusions
Our data suggest that QFT might be used as unique screening assay in IAC, but further studies are needed at this regard."

Rabies is a lethal, but vaccine preventable disease. Vaccination uptake is however hampered by the time-consuming three-dose, 21/28-day schedule. The aim of this study was to examine whether adequate rabies antibody titers are reached after two intradermal (ID) doses of rabies vaccine, with a seven-day window.
Method
We conducted an observational cohort study with military personnel. A titer was assessed by RFFIT, on the day of the third vaccination, to ensure an adequate rabies antibody response after ID immunization.
Results
After this abbreviated two-dose, seven-day ID schedule, seroconversion was reached in 99.3% (427/430) with a geometric mean titer of 7.59 IU/mL (95% CI 7.04–8.17).
Conclusions
Implementation of this two-dose schedule will protect more people against Rabies. Travelers and military personnel under time constraints, who otherwise would remain unvaccinated, can be considered adequately protected after this two-dose schedule. For populations in endemic areas, local application of a two-dose schedule could provide an opportunity to vaccinate more people with less vaccine. Given the paucity of published data, this study adds relevant evidence in support of the new policy (2017) of WHO, concerning a two-dose, seven-day schedule is approved for all healthy individuals."

The proportion of newly diagnosed HIV and STI cases among men who have sex with men (MSM) that were contracted abroad has been increasing in Sweden. The present study explored factors associated with casual unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) and travelling abroad among MSM.
Methods
A cross-sectional stratified survey with 2751 MSM was conducted. The frequency of sexual practices among men who had casual UAI abroad (<12 months) with that of men who had casual UAI only in Sweden were compared and factors associated with casual UAI abroad were identified through regression analysis.
Results
Factors associated with casual UAI abroad within the previous 12 months were: visit a gay sauna (OR 6.15, 95% CI 3.43–11.06), visit gay café/bar/pub (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.62–6.48), experience of UAI with a foreign visitor (OR 4.80, 95% CI 2.37–9.75), living with HIV (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.15–6.48), reporting poor overall health (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.13–4.44), being born outside Sweden (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.08–4.53), and being vaccinated against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, or both (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.13–3.27).
Conclusion
MSM who engage in casual UAI abroad need to increase their understanding of related risks and that risk varies with place and practice. Health care professionals should address the preventive needs of traveling MSM and offer counselling and STI-preventive measures."

abstract = "Background
‘Filth flies’ feed and develop in excrement and decaying matter and can transmit enteric pathogens to humans and animals, leading to colonization and infection. Considering these characteristics, ‘filth flies’ are potential vectors for the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This review defines the role of flies in the spread of AMR and identifies knowledge gaps.
Methods
The literature search (original articles, reviews indexed for PubMed) was restricted to the English language. References of identified studies were screened for additional sources.
Results
‘Filth flies’ are colonized with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria of clinical relevance. This includes extended spectrum beta-lactamase-, carbapenemase-producing and colistin-resistant (mcr-1 positive) bacteria. Resistant bacteria in flies often share the same genotypes with bacteria from humans and animals when their habitat overlap. The risk of transmission is most likely highest for enteric bacteria as they are shed in high concentration in excrements and are easily picked up by flies. ‘Filth flies’ can ‘bio-enhance’ the transmission of AMR as bacteria multiply in the digestive tract, mouthparts and regurgitation spots.
Conclusion
To better understand the medical importance of AMR in flies, quantitative risk assessment models should be refined and fed with additional data (e.g. vectorial capacity, colonization dose). This requires targeted ecological, epidemiological and in vivo experimental studies."

Furthermore, we present a detailed clinical case series of all travellers with leptospirosis who presented at the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in the same period.
Method
We extracted data from the records of the Dutch Leptospirosis Reference Center (NRL) of all cases of leptospirosis in travellers in the Netherlands from 2009 to 2016. Patients who presented at the AMC were identified and clinical data were extracted from the hospital records.
Results
224 cases of travel-related leptospirosis were included. An increase of cases was observed from 2014 onwards. The majority of cases were male (78.1%), and had travelled to South-East Asia (62.1%). Of 41 AMC cases, 53.7% were hospitalised, but most patients had a relatively mild disease course, with no fatalities. A longer delay in diagnosis and treatment initiation existed in hospitalised compared to non-hospitalised patients, suggesting a benefit of early recognition and treatment.
Conclusions
Leptospirosis was increasingly observed in returning travellers in the Netherlands, and is a diagnosis that should be considered in any returning febrile traveller."

In Colombia, taeniasis and cysticercosis have been significantly reduced over the past decades, however still reported with implications for public health and travel medicine.
Methods
An observational, retrospective study, in which the incidence of taeniasis and cysticercosis (ICD-10 codes B68s/B69s) in Colombia, 2009–2013, was estimated based on data extracted from the Individual Health Records System (Registro Individual de Prestación de Servicios, RIPS) was performed. The Geographic Information System (GIS) generated national maps showing the distribution of taeniasis and cysticercosis by department by year.
Results
During the period, 3626 cases were reported (median 796/year), for a cumulative crude national rate of 7.7 cases/100,000pop; 58.2% corresponded to male; 57% were <40 year-old (10.2% < 9.9 year-old). Cases were 57.6% neurocysticercosis, the rest were taeniasis due to T. solium, T. saginata, ocular cysticercosis and cysticerci in other organs. Bolivar, a touristic department, had the highest cumulated incidence rate (16.17 cases/100,000pop), as also evident across the map series developed in this study.
Conclusion
Despite the limitations of this study, data presented provide recent estimates of national taeniasis and cysticercosis incidence in the country useful in public health and for travel medicine practitioners, as some highly touristic areas presented higher disease incidence. Improved control, particularly of taeniasis, should be an attainable goal, which among other strategies would require improved sanitation and health education to prevent transmission, but also enhanced surveillance."

Patients hospitalized in the infectious diseases department of Bégin Military Hospital (France) from May 2012 to November 2015, who had traveled abroad over the past two months, were screened for intestinal colonization with ESBL-E.
Results
Forty-one out of 166 travelers (24.7%) had ESBL-E colonization, predominantly Escherichia coli. The risk factors for ESBL-E colonization in the univariate analysis were a treatment with any antibiotic in the last two months (OR 4.19, 95% CI 1.91–9.16) or with a beta-lactam in the same period (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.44–7.82), and an hospitalization in the last two months (OR 3.96, 95% CI 1.91–9.16). The military status, military mission or military accommodation were not associated with an increased risk of ESBL-E colonization. In the multivariate analysis, a treatment with any antibiotic in the last two months was significantly associated with ESBL-E colonization (OR 6.71, 95% CI 3.36–19.08).
Conclusion
Antibiotic treatment in the two previous months is strongly predictive of ESBL-E colonization in international travelers, while the military status and its specific living conditions are not."

abstract = "Background
Hepatitis A (HA) incidence declined in most European countries in the past decades. We analysed HA notification data for Switzerland of 29 years looking for disease- and notification system-related factors possibly contributing to observed trends.
Method
Notification data were descriptively analysed using five time intervals (1988–1993, 1994–1999, 2000–2005, 2006–2011, 2012–2016); and notification rates were calculated.
Results
From 1988 to 2016, the HA notification rate decreased from 9.5 to 0.5 per 100′000 population in Switzerland. Median age and the proportion of hospitalised cases increased over time. In the 1988–1993-time period, intravenous drug use was the most frequently mentioned risk exposure while consumption of contaminated food/beverages was most frequently mentioned in the 2012–2016-time period.
Conclusions
Notification data does not allow reliably identifying current risk groups (e.g. travellers) due to low case numbers, limited availability and reliability of information. It is important to document changes in the surveillance system for later analyses and interpretation of long-term trends. Population susceptibility likely increases underlining the importance of continued and continuous surveillance and prevention efforts despite decreasing case numbers. Operational research is recommended to further investigate observed trends of HA and to enhance the abilities for decision making from Swiss HA surveillance data."

This paper provides a starting point for further discussion and research into this neglected traveller population. In contrast, tourism research has explored travel with a disability for some time in order to understand the travellers' needs and to improve services accordingly. The contemporary bio-psycho-social understanding of disability serves as the framework for exploring motivations to travel as well as barriers, such as inter and intrapersonal, economic, structural and attitudinal obstacles. The demands of complex travel planning are acknowledged. Attention is also drawn to the particular issue of acquired disability. The theoretical discussion is complemented by travellers' own accounts using as examples mobility impairment on aeroplanes, sensory impairments, and obesity. These insights should inform high quality travel health care starting with an exploration of the health professionals' own views on such endeavours. Important are appropriate communication skills, an understanding of the travellers'/carers' views, wishes and judgment of abilities, as well as the appreciation of the reason for the trip, destination and planned activities. Challenging may be the need to accept that the traveller/carer will be more knowledgeable about the disability, needs, potential problems and solutions than the health professional. Finally, medical requirements for destination and activity need to be combined with the medical requirements for the dis-abling condition. Scarce literature and increasing numbers of travellers with disabilities should make this field a research priority in travel medicine. Unless there is an absolute medical contraindication, travel health professionals should encourage and support travellers for whom travel is a challenge."

New world cutaneous leishmaniasis (NWCL) can be found in French Guiana as well as in several other parts of Central and South America. Leishmania guyanensis accounts for nearly 90% of cases in French Guiana and is treated with pentamidine isethionate, given by either intramuscular or intravenous injection. The military population is particularly exposed due to repeated missions in the rainforest. The purpose of the present study was to identify the factors associated with pentamidine isethionate treatment failure in a series of service members with L. guyanensis NWCL acquired in French Guiana.
Method
All the French service members reported as having acquired leishmaniasis in French Guiana from December 2013 to June 2016 were included.
Results
Seventy-three patients infected with L. guyanensis were included in the final analysis. Patients treated with IV pentamidine isethionate had better response rates than those treated with IM pentamidine isethionate (p = 0.002, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.15, 95% CI [0.04–0.50]). The rate of treatment success was 85.3% (95% CI [68.9–95.0]) for IV pentamidine isethionate and 51.3% (95% CI [34.8–67.6]) for IM pentamidine isethionate.
Conclusions
The use of intramuscular pentamidine isethionate in the treatment of Leishmania guyanensis cutaneous leishmaniasis is associated with more treatment failures than intravenous pentamidine isethionate."

Immunocompromised travellers (ICTs) are at increased risk of travel-related health problems. Therefore, they are advised to attend specialised pre-travel clinics for advice on vaccination, malaria chemoprophylaxis and on-demand antibiotics. However, studies yield conflicting data regarding travel-related health problems encountered by ICTs; questioning the rationale for certain advices, and particularly the advice of on-demand antibiotics.
Objective
To evaluate self-reported travel-related health problems, antibiotic use, medical visits and risk behaviours in ICTs and controls.
Methods
We conducted a questionnaire-based observational study with pilot character. We recruited participants from a (medical) pre-travel clinic. Telephone interviews were conducted 2–4 weeks post-travelling, applying a structured questionnaire.
Results
We included 30 ICTs and 30 controls. More ICTs than controls reported travel-related health problems, antibiotic use and medical visits, although not statistically significant. Travellers' diarrhoea appeared to be more severe in ICTs. Furthermore one ICT was hospitalized post-travel due to pneumonia. Of ICTs, 2/30 (7%) used on demand antibiotics while not indicated (according to the protocol of the Dutch national coordinating centre for travel advice or prescribed by a physician). Reversely, 6/30 (20%) did not use on demand antibiotics while actually indicated according to this protocol.
Discussion
Our findings substantiate the recommendation of on demand antibiotics. However, ICTs did often not use on demand antibiotics correctly; they therefore need very careful instructions."

Leptospirosis is an important zoonosis worldwide, nevertheless is often poor recognized in non tropical settings. In Thailand is becoming an emerging disease and Chiang Mai could become a popular spot to acquire the disease amongst travelers.
Methods
We describe three cases of imported leptospirosis undifferentiated fever after travelling to Thailand during the summer of 2015 diagnosed at two Spanish hospitals.
Results
Our three patients probably acquired leptospirosis while swimming in freshwater around Chiang Mai, a Thailand's northern region with moderate incidence of leptopirosis. Travelers had normal white blood cell counts and low platelets, suggesting leptospirosis after ruling out other imported diseases such as malaria, dengue or typhoid.
Conclusion
As recent findings point out, low platelets and normal white blood cell counts are clinical features that could help the clinician to suspect Leptospirosis infection. It should be always considered as a cause of fever, particularly if travelers come from a tropical country and have had contact with water or flooding, especially during rainy season."

abstract = "Background
Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, with immunocompromised patients (ICPs) at particular risk. Therefore, guidelines recommend pneumococcal vaccination for these patients. However, guidelines are scarcely underpinned with references to incidence studies of IPD in this population. This, potentially results in unawareness of the importance of vaccination and low vaccination rates. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the incidence of IPD in ICPs.
Methods
We systematically searched PubMed and Embase to identify studies in English published before December 6th, 2017 that included terms related to ‘incidence’, ‘rate’, ‘pneumococcal’, ‘pneumoniae’, ‘meningitis’, ‘septicemia’, or ‘bacteremia’. We focused on patients with HIV, transplantation and chronic inflammatory diseases.
Results
We included 45 studies in the systematic review reporting an incidence or rate of IPD, defined as isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from a normally sterile site. Random effects meta-analysis of 38 studies showed a pooled IPD incidence of 331/100,000 person years in patients with HIV in the late-antiretroviral treatment era in non-African countries, and 318/100,000 in African countries; 696 and 812/100,000 in patients who underwent an autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, respectively; 465/100,000 in patients with a solid organ transplantation; and 65/100,000 in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. In healthy control cohorts, the pooled incidence was 10/100,000.
Discussion
ICPs are at increased risk of contracting IPD, especially those with HIV, and those who underwent transplantation. Based on our findings, we recommend pneumococcal vaccination in immunocompromised patients.

As antibiotics predispose travelers to acquiring multidrug-resistant intestinal bacteria, they should no longer be considered a mainstay for treating travelers' diarrhea. It has been claimed that stand-by antibiotics are justified as a means to avoid visits to local healthcare providers which often lead to polypharmacy.
Method
We revisited the traveler data of 316 prospectively recruited volunteers with travelers' diarrhea by retrieving from questionnaires and health diaries information on antibiotic use, stand-by antibiotic carriage, and visits with local healthcare. Multivariable analysis was applied to identify factors associated with antibiotic use.
Results
Among our 316 volunteers with travelers' diarrhea, however, carrying stand-by antibiotics seemed not to reduce the rate of healthcare-seeking; on the contrary, antibiotic use was more frequent among stand-by antibiotic carriers (34%) than non-carriers (11%). Antibiotics were equally taken for severe and incapacitating travelers' diarrhea, but compared to non-carriers, stand-by antibiotic carriers resorted to medication also for mild/moderate (38% vs. 4%) and non-incapacitating disease (29% vs. 5%). Antibiotic use was associated with stand-by antibiotic carriage (OR 7.2; 95%CI 2.8–18.8), vomiting (OR 3.5; 95%CI 1.3–9.5), incapacitating diarrhea (OR 3.6; 95%CI 1.3–9.8), age (OR 1.03; 95%CI 1.00–1.05), and healthcare visit for diarrhea (OR 465.3; 95%CI 22.5–9633.6).
Conclusions
Carriage of stand-by antibiotics encouraged less cautious use of antibiotics. Recommendations involving prescription of antibiotics for all travelers require urgent revision."

Skin infections are among the leading causes of diseases in travelers. Diagnosing pathogens could be difficult.
Method
We applied molecular assays for the diagnostic of a large collection of skin biopsies and swabs from travelers with suspected skin infections. All samples were tested by qPCR for Coxiella burnetti, Bartonella sp., Rickettsia sp., Borrelia sp., Ehrlichia sp., Tropheryma whipplei, Francisella tularensis, Mycobacteria sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Leishmania spp., Ortho poxvirus and Para poxvirus and then screened for the presence of bacteria by PCR amplification and sequencing, targeting the 16S rRNA gene.
Results
From January 2009 to January 2017, 100 international travelers presenting with a suspected skin infection were enrolled. We detected 51 patients with an identified pathogen on skin samples. Travelers presenting with eschars were more likely to have a positive PCR sample (n = 44/76, 57.9%) compared to other patients (n = 7/24, 29.2%). Spotted fever group Rickettsia (n = 28) was the most frequently detected pathogens (19 R. africae, 6 R. conorii, 3 R. mongolitimonae); S. aureus were detected in 11 patients; S. pyogenes in 3; Leishmania sp.; M. leprae and B. henselae in 1 patient, respectively.

Diarrhea can be frequent among Hajj pilgrims; however, data on its etiology are very limited.
Patients and methods
A prospective cohort study was conducted among Hajj pilgrims in 2016. Medical follow-up and systematic rectal swabing were performed before leaving France and before leaving Saudi Arabia. Potential pathogens were identified using the BioFire FilmArray® Gastrointestinal multiplex qualitative PCR panel.
Results
117 pilgrims were included and 13.7% experienced diarrhea during Hajj. Of the pre-Hajj samples, 32.5% were positive for at least one pathogen compared to 50% of post-Hajj samples (p = 0.0033). Diarrhea associated Escherichia coli strains, notably enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), and Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli, were acquired by 29.9%, 10.2%, and 6.5% pilgrims, respectively. Pilgrims with resolved diarrhea were significantly more likely to have post-Hajj EAEC positive samples, compared with those who did not suffer diarrhea (55.6% vs 16.5%). We found a lower prevalence of EPEC (22.5%) in pilgrims who declared washing their hands more frequently at the Hajj than usually as compared to others (40.0%).
Conclusion
The acquisition of diarrhea associated E coli by Hajj pilgrims is of major concern given the high prevalence rate of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in Saudi Arabia."

The population flow dynamics of Hajj increases the probability of pneumococcal acquisition and amplification among Hajis. This multi-site longitudinal molecular surveillance study was designed to assess the impact and potential variations of pneumococcal carriage in a single cohort of pre and post-Hajj pilgrims from India.
Method
A total of 3228 pre and post-Hajj, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 807 pilgrims with an interval of 40 ± 5 days. The carriage was detected by culture and qmPCR. Quellung test, mPCR-FAF, PCRseqTyping, and MLST was used for typing. Antibiogram was performed by MIC method.
Results
An increased incidence of pneumococcal carriage was detected in post Hajj cohort by qmPCR (19% vs 21.8%) (p-value = 0.0487) and culture (6.5% vs 8.2%) (p-value = 0.0645). Fragment analysis could identify multiple serotype carriage in 76 pilgrims. Increase in drug resistance was also observed in post-hajj cohort for Tetracycline (29% vs 51%), Erythromycin (26% vs 46%) and Levofloxacin (6% vs 17%). Multidrug resistant strains in post Hajj group was 32% compared to 11% in pre Hajj group (p-value = 0.0002).
Conclusion
Our results confirm high acquisition rate of multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae in Hajj pilgrims and highlight its potential spread to home countries upon their return. Surveillance studies are needed to evaluate modifiable factors associated with carriage."

Objective
We studied knowledge, attitude and behaviour of Palestine refugees attending UNRWA health centers in Jordan regarding antibiotic use in order to plan public health interventions accordingly.
Methods
A cross-sectional, interviewer-administered survey among 250 adult Palestine refugees at four different health centers was conducted.
Results
Irrational antibiotic use was widespread: 63% of patients share antibiotics at home, 38% use left-over antibiotics and 60% purchase antibiotics directly from the pharmacy without prescription (OTC) .1 At the same time, knowledge about antibiotics side effects, resistance, and target agent was low. 90% of patients trust their doctor, however long waiting hours prevent them from seeking medical advice, which significantly increased self-medication.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest a strong need for public education about antibiotics. In addition, health institutional level improvements such as shorter waiting hours and strict regulations prohibiting dispensing without prescription are necessary to combat growing bacterial resistance."

Elevated serum D-dimer levels may reflect endothelial activation, which in malaria may correlate with parasite biomass and disease severity.
Methods
We performed a retrospective chart review of all non-immune travelers hospitalized with malaria during 01/2000–12/2014 at the Sheba Medical Center, Israel. Admission and peak D-dimer levels were compared among malaria patients, according to Plasmodium species and severity.
Results
Complete laboratory data was available for 94/168 travelers hospitalized with malaria, with 68.1% caused by P. falciparum. Admission D-dimer levels were significantly higher in P. falciparum malaria compared to non-falciparum malaria cases (3585 ± 7045 and 802 ± 1248 ng/dL respectively, p = 0.04). Admission D-dimer levels were higher in patients with severe compared to non-severe P. falciparum malaria (4058 ± 3544 & 3490 ± 7549 ng/dL), however the difference was short of statistical significance (P = 0.06). Peak D-dimer levels were also significantly higher in severe and non-severe P. falciparum than in non-falciparum cases.
Conclusions
In most non-immune travelers with malaria, D-dimer levels are elevated, are higher in P. falciparum malaria compared to non-falciparum malaria, and appear to increase with disease severity, probably reflecting the level of endothelial damage."

Methods
We reviewed ships' varicella case and outbreak reports from January 2010 through December 2015.
Results
DGMQ received 967 reports of varicella and 13 reports of herpes zoster. Most varicella case-patients were 20–49 years of age (84.7%, 472/557) and were cruise ship crew members (78.4%, 758/967). Most often, cruise ship crew member case-patients were born in or held passports from Indonesia (21.7%, 80/369), Philippines (17.6%, 65/369), or India (17.3%, 64/369). Ninety-nine varicella outbreaks were reported, including 439 varicella cases and one herpes zoster case; 97 (98.0%) outbreaks occurred on cruise ships, and 90.2% of associated cases were among crew members (397/440). Most varicella cases were in crew members, who are adults often from tropical regions where varicella immunity is acquired later in childhood or young adulthood or without varicella vaccination programs.
Conclusion
Varicella vaccination as appropriate for susceptible travelers, particularly crew members, before maritime travel may decrease risk of varicella infection and prevent outbreaks on ships."

Overuse and misuse of antibiotics have been reported in Hajj. However, little is known about Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) of pilgrims themselves in relation to these agents.
Methods
Adult pilgrims from seven countries attending the 2015 Hajj were interviewed using a structured KAP questionnaire.
Results
KAP information was collected from 1476 pilgrims. Misconceptions regarding antibiotics included that they: cure all diseases (24.6%); cure common cold and flu (63.0%); are used to stop fever (47.3%); have no side effects (43.2%). Negative attitudes included prophylactic use (50%), self-medication (43.2%), non-compliance with therapy (63.5%) and storage of left-overs for future use (54.1%). In practice, 87.3% of pilgrims admitted to using non-prescribed antibiotics, only 19.3% use antibiotic as directed by their doctor and 54% do not usually check the expiry date of antibiotics before use. Over 60% brought antibiotics from their home country to KSA and 39.2% acquired non-prescribed antibiotics in Saudi Arabia. KAP scores were higher among the younger age group (≤43 years old) and among those with healthcare-related work or education and increased with increasing levels of education.
Conclusions
Multifaceted and multidisciplinary approaches, both in KSA and in pilgrims' countries of origin, are needed to address antibiotic misuse during Hajj."

abstract = "Background
Travellers' diarrhoea (TD) is a common health problem among visitors to the (sub)tropics. Much research deals with aetiology, prevention, and post-infection sequalae, yet the data may not allow comparisons due to incompatible definitions of TD and No TD control groups.
Method
The impact of defining TD and No TD control groups was explored by revisiting our recent data. We set up two TD groups: classical TD i.e. ≥3 loose or liquid stools/day and WHO TD (diarrhoea as defined by the WHO) i.e. any diarrhoea, and four No TD groups by TD definition and timing (no classical/WHO TD during travel, no ongoing classical/WHO TD).
Results
TD was recorded for 37% versus 65% of subjects when using classical versus WHO definitions, respectively; the proportions of the various pathogens proved similar. The strictest criterion for the No TD control group (no WHO TD during travel) yielded pathogens among 61% and the least strict (no ongoing classical TD) among 73% of the travellers; the differences were greatest for enteroaggregative Escherichia coli and Campylobacter.
Conclusions
Definition of TD and control group design substantially impact on TD study results. The WHO definition yields more cases, but the pathogen selection is similar by both definitions. Design of the No TD control group was found critical: only those remaining asymptomatic throughout the journey should be included."

Rickettsial diseases present as acute febrile illnesses, sometimes with inoculation eschars.
Methods
We performed a systematic review of studies published between 1997 and 2017 to assess the underestimation of non-eschar rickettsial disease (NERD) relative to eschar rickettsial disease (ERD), as a cause of acute fever in patients with rickettsial diseases that commonly present with eschar(s): scrub typhus (ST), Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF), and African tick-bite fever. We compared ERD/NERD ratios according to study design: ‘complete approach’ studies, with testing performed in all patients with ‘unspecified febrile illness’; versus ‘clinical judgement’ studies, with testing performed if patients presented with specific symptoms.
Results
In ‘complete approach’ studies, ERD/NERD ratios were significantly lower, suggesting a considerable under-diagnosis of NERD in ‘clinical judgement’ studies. Based on these results, we estimate that the diagnosis of rickettsial disease was missed in 66.5% of patients with ST, and in 57.9% of patients with MSF.
Conclusions
Study design influences the reported eschar rates in ST and MSF significantly. NERD is likely to be a vastly underdiagnosed entity, and clinicians should consider and test for the disease more often.

International travel facilitates global spread of sexually transmitted infections (STI). Travellers could contribute to onward transmission of pathogens rarely encountered at home and export new strains to the destination. The aim was to systematically examine evidence regarding determinants of travel-related sexual risk-taking and identify knowledge gaps and areas for targeted interventions.
Method
Articles published in peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to 2017 were screened in 6 databases and assessed for relevance against criteria. Data was extracted for factors associated with travel-related STI or proxies. Meta-analyses estimated pooled prevalence of casual sex and non-condom use. Adjusted odds ratios of predictors were pooled to generate a combined estimate.
Result
Forty-nine articles qualified for inclusion. A heterogeneity test indicated variation across studies. The pooled prevalence of casual travel sex was 35% and prevalence of non-condom use 17%. Expectations of casual sex strongly predicted sex with a new partner when travelling abroad. Planning to have sex indicated condom use.
Conclusion
The studies largely represented sub-groups of risk-taking populations from a European context, indicating substantial knowledge gaps. Studies investigating migrants travelling to visit friends and relatives, older travellers, and female travelers are needed. Post–travel harm reduction activities may serve as a focus for future interventions."

In an influenza pandemic, arrival times of cases are a proxy of the epidemic size and disease transmissibility. Because of intense surveillance of travelers from infected countries, detection is more rapid and complete than on local surveillance. Travel information can provide a more reliable estimation of transmission parameters.
Method
We developed an Approximate Bayesian Computation algorithm to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) in addition to the reporting rate and unobserved epidemic start time, utilizing travel, and routine surveillance data in an influenza pandemic. A simulation was conducted to assess the sampling uncertainty. The estimation approach was further applied to the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in Mexico as a case study.
Results
In the simulations, we showed that the estimation approach was valid and reliable in different simulation settings. We also found estimates of R0 and the reporting rate to be 1.37 (95% Credible Interval [CI]: 1.26–1.42) and 4.9% (95% CI: 0.1%–18%), respectively, in the 2009 influenza pandemic in Mexico, which were robust to variations in the fixed parameters. The estimated R0 was consistent with that in the literature.
Conclusions
This method is useful for officials to obtain reliable estimates of disease transmissibility for strategic planning. We suggest that improvements to the flow of reporting for confirmed cases among patients arriving at different countries are required."

to assess the health seeking practices and their determinants among Umrah pilgrims departing from Assiut international Airport.
Methods
We interviewed 300 pilgrims departing from Assiut International Airport while they were in the departure lounge, using a semi-structured questionnaire.
Results
Only 60%, 46.3% and 46.3% of Umrah pilgrims believed in importance of pre-travel vaccination, seeking health information, and health examination, respectively. The most frequently practiced pre-travel health related behaviour was getting vaccinated (56.3%), as compared to much lower frequencies of seeking health information (24%) or having a clinical health examination (26.7%). Private clinics, internet and the tourism companies were the main sources of health information of the pilgrims. Positive attitude of pilgrims about health seeking practices, the perception of health risk of travelling to Hajj/Umrah and having a chronic disease were the predictors of pre-travel health practices.
Conclusion
Raising awareness among Hajj/Umrah pilgrims about the importance of seeking professional pre-travel health advice and communicating the risk of exposure to travel-related diseases to pilgrims could be important strategies to improve the uptake of preventive measures. Training of general practitioners in the public health sector about the travel health information would promote the travel health services."

abstract = "Introduction
A lack of prospective and longitudinal data on pre- and post-travel carriage of Blastocystis spp. complicates interpretation of a positive test post-travel. Therefore we studied dynamics of Blastocystis carriage in a cohort of Dutch travellers.
Methods
From the prospective, multicentre COMBAT study among 2001 Dutch travellers, a subset of 491 travellers was selected based on travel destination to 7 subregions (70 or 71 travellers each). Faecal samples taken directly before and after travel were screened for Blastocystis with qPCR, followed, when positive, by sequence analysis to determine subtypes.
Results
After exclusion of 12 samples with missing samples or inhibited qPCR-reactions, stool samples of 479 travellers were analysed. Before travel, 174 of them (36.3%) carried Blastocystis and in most of these, the same subtype was persistently carried. However, in 48/174 of those travellers (27.6%; CI95 20.8–36.6%) no Blastocystis or a different subtype was detected in the post-travel sample, indicating loss of Blastocystis during travel. Only 26 (5.4%; CI95 3.7%–8.0%) of all travellers acquired Blastocystis, including two individuals that were already positive for Blastocystis before travel but acquired a different subtype during travel.
Discussion
This study shows that Blastocystis carriage in travellers is highly dynamic. The observed acquisition and loss of Blastocystis could either be travel-related or reflect the natural course of Blastocystis carriage. We demonstrate that the majority of Blastocystis detected in post-travel samples were already carried before travel."

In Romania, after a major outbreak in 1996, West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND) was reported only in a limited number of cases annually. During 2016–2017, a significant increase in the number of WNND cases was reported at the national level, associated with high mortality rates.
Methods
A retrospective analysis of all cases confirmed with WNND, hospitalized during 2012–2017 in a single tertiary facility from Bucharest was performed in order to determine the annual prevalence and mortality rate and the risk factors associated with a severe outcome.
Results
47 cases were confirmed as WNND. The mortality rate was 25.5%, all death occurred during 2016–2017. Coma, confusion, obtundation, sleepiness and depressed deep tendon reflexes were symptoms predicting a severe outcome. In a univariate analysis age (p < 0.001), associated cancers (p = 0.012) and low levels of chloride in the CSF (p = 0.008) were risk factors for mortality. In a multinomial logistic analysis, age older than 75 years remained the only independent predictor of death in WNND.
Conclusions
The increase in both the number and the mortality rate of WNND cases suggest a changing pattern of WNV infection in Romania. Public health authorities and clinicians should be aware of the risk of severe WNV infection in travelers returning from Romania."

The annual Hajj to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia attracts millions of pilgrims from around the world. International health community's attention goes towards this mass gathering and the possibility of the development of any respiratory tract infections due to the high risk of acquisition of respiratory viruses.
Method
We searched MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases for relevant papers describing the prevalence of respiratory viruses among Hajj pilgrims.
Results
The retrieved articles were summarized based on the methodology of testing for these viruses. A total of 31 studies were included in the quantitative/qualitative analyses. The main methods used for the diagnosis of most common respiratory viruses were polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Influenza, rhinovirus and parainfluenza were the most common viruses detected among pilgrims. Coronaviruses other than MERS-CoV were also detected among pilgrims. The acquisition of MERS-CoV remains very limited and systematic screening of pilgrims showed no infections.
Conclusions
Well conducted multinational follow-up studies using the same methodology of testing are necessary for accurate surveillance of respiratory viral infections among Hajj pilgrims. Post-Hajj cohort studies would further evaluate the impact of the Hajj on the acquisition of respiratory viruses."

We reviewed Jetlag, particularly in view of its effects on sleep and how it can be managed.
Methods
The Proquest Central database of Kırıkkale University, PubMed and Google scholar were used while searching for the following key words: “Jetlag”, “symptoms”, “sleep”, “melatonin” and “treatment”.
Results
Flight dysrhythmia, otherwise known as jetlag, is caused by flying globally over various time zones. Most passengers who fly over six or more different time zones generally require 4–6 days after travelling to resume their usual sleep patterns and to feel less lethargic during the day. Signs of jet lag can vary between debilitated awareness, insomnia, feeling tired during the day and frequent waking during the night. During the night our pineal glands excrete a hormone called melatonin; dim lights cause the continuation of excretion of these hormones whereas any exposure to bright lights stems the flow of release. Common precautionary measures are specific diets, bright lights and melatonin agonists (Ramelteon, Agomelatine).
Conclusion
Sleep issues derived from jetlag were found to be most common in passengers who flew through various time belts. Melatonin assumes a critical part in adjusting the body's circadian rhythms and has been utilized restoratively to re-establish irritated circadian rhythms."

Mediterranean Spotted Fever (MSF) is a tick-borne zoonosis caused by Rickettsia conorii which is endemic in Malta, an island in the South Mediterranean that is a popular tourist destination. Diagnosis is frequently based on clinical manifestations as laboratory results are often limited to a retrospective diagnosis. We describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of children <16 years who presented with MSF from 2011 to 2016.
Method
The demographics, clinical findings, laboratory results, management and outcome of all children hospitalised with suspected MSF based on the presence of fever and an eschar, were retrieved from their case notes.
Results
Over the five-year study period six children, aged between 17 months and 15 years, were diagnosed with MSF. All children had contact with ticks and the majority presented in summer. Laboratory results were non-specific and included elevated inflammatory markers, lymphocytosis/lymphopenia and hyponatraemia. Serological and molecular techniques were used for diagnosis. Response to clarithromycin or doxycycline was immediate.
Conclusion
MSF should be included in the differential diagnosis of fever, rash and an eschar in children who travel to Malta. Despite advances in molecular diagnostics, clinical diagnosis remains important in the management of children with suspected MSF."

abstract = "Background
Among visitors to the (sub)tropics, 20–50% contract travellers' diarrhoea (TD) and 5–30% take antibiotics. While shortening the duration of illness, antimicrobials predispose to acquisition of multi-drug resistant bacteria. Therefore, liberal use is no longer advocated. Although antibiotics kill pathogens, no data support the view that they could prevent post-infectious sequelae. We investigated how antibiotic use for TD abroad impacts the pathogen findings at return.
Materials and methods
We revisited 456 travellers' clinical data and stool pathogens examined by qPCR for Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Shigella, Vibrio cholerae and enteroaggregative (EAEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) and enteroinvasive (EIEC) Escherichia coli.
Results
Among travellers with TD, antibiotic users had pathogen-positive samples less frequently than non-users (50% versus 83%). The difference was significant for EPEC (23% versus 47%) and EAEC (27% versus 54%), but not ETEC (17% versus 26%) or the other pathogens. Shigella/EIEC was found more often among antibiotic users than non-users (4% versus 1%).
Conclusion
Despite antibiotic treatment of TD, half of the users still had stool pathogens at return, reflecting either antibiotic resistance of pathogens or recolonisation/reinfection while abroad. Treatment of TD with antibiotics during travel should not be interpreted to indicate eradication of pathogens."

Despite growth in the number of cruises worldwide, evidence about diarrhea experienced by cruise ship passengers remains sparse. We investigated rates of diarrhea and related factors among passengers on world cruises departing from Japan.
Methods
Targeting passengers on five world cruises (n = 4180) from 2012 to 2013 (85–103 travel days), we calculated rates of health seeking behavior for diarrhea by sex, age group, and number of roommates for each cruise. We estimated rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals, using the group aged 20–39 years, women, and 2–4 roommates as referent categories.
Results
We found 5.04–6.00 cases per 10,000 person-days in the five cruises, with an elevated number after calling at ports. Older passengers (>60 years) and passengers with fewer roommates had an elevated risk of health seeking behavior for diarrhea, although passengers aged <20 years had an elevated risk on one cruise. After controlling for covariates (including cruise), significant associations remained for passengers aged >60 years and without roommates.
Conclusions
Older passengers and passengers with fewer roommates may be more likely to seek medical treatment for diarrhea during travel on a world cruise, and should take preventive measures."

Dengue and chikungunya co-infections are an emerging threat to public health in tropical and sub-tropical areas. This study investigates acute and long-term clinical presentation patterns of chikungunya against a backdrop of preceding dengue infection and determines predicting factors for long-term chikungunya sequelae.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was performed in 2015, including 299 previously confirmed chikungunya cases, of which 162 subjects were assessed for dengue serology at disease onset.
Results
Those with previous dengue infection (35.2% of the examined population) had a similar acute disease presentation, and suffered (not statistically significantly) more frequently from long-term musculoskeletal and neuropsychological symptoms compared to chikungunya-only patients. Patients with a preceding dengue infection (vs. those without) (OR = 4.17; p = 0.004), female sex (OR = 3.17; p = 0.034) and pre-existing joint disease (OR = 2.95; p = 0.031) had a higher risk of developing aggravated long-term chikungunya.

Pneumococcal vaccines are available and recommended in many countries for at-risk populations including young children, the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions. The Hajj and Umrah mass gatherings attract millions of Muslim pilgrims to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia each year. These events increase the risk of pneumococcal disease especially among the large number of elderly pilgrims with co-morbidities. However, there is no unified official policy for vaccination against pneumococcal disease for pilgrims attending Hajj and Umrah, largely due to the lack of a strong evidence-base in the context of these events. Here we review knowledge gaps regarding pneumococcal disease during Hajj and Umrah and highlight important research agendas to strengthen the evidence-base to inform pneumococcal vaccination policy for pilgrims. Available data indicates that the true clinical and financial burdens of pneumococcal disease at Hajj and Umrah are still not determined. There is limited information on antimicrobial resistance among S. pneumoniae isolated from diseased pilgrims and no information on the serotypes involved. Finally, the efficacy and effectiveness of the current vaccines in the context of Hajj and Umrah have not been studied. Research agendas proposed in this article would help fill knowledge gaps regarding pneumococcal disease at Hajj and Umrah and would constitute a strong basis for an informed and potentially unified policy regarding pneumococcal vaccination for these events."

Civil air travel is increasingly recognized as an important potential source for the rapid spread of infectious diseases that were geographically confined in the past, creating international epidemics with great health and socio-economic impact.
Objective
The objective of this systematic review is to elucidate the correlations of materials surfaces (composition, structure, properties) and microbial dependences on them in aircraft.
Methods
The review was prepared according to PRISMA guidelines. Based on a systematic search for studies published before 30 June 2018 in English, we selected and reviewed the contamination, tenacity, and transmission of microorganisms related to specific surfaces within the aircraft cabin. We also reviewed the chemical composition and properties of these surface materials applied within aircraft.
Results
From a total of 828 records 15 articles were included for further analysis in this systematic review, indicating that the aircraft interior surfaces in seat areas (tray tables, armrests, seat covers) and lavatories (door knob handles, toilet flush buttons) are generally colonized by various types of potentially hazardous microorganisms.
Conclusions
The interior surfaces in seat and lavatory areas could pose higher health risks by causing infections due to their relatively high microbial contamination compared with other interior surfaces. The classification, chemical composition, surface structures and physicochemical properties of materials surfaces have a varied effect on the adhesion, colonization, tenacity and potential transmission of microorganisms within the aircraft cabin. Strategies are proposed for the interruption of surface-related infection chains in the aircraft field."

We assessed a commercial loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) platform for its reliability as a screening tool for malaria parasite detection.
Methods
A total of 1000 blood samples from patients with suspected or confirmed malaria submitted to the German National Reference Center for Tropical Pathogens were subjected to LAMP using the Meridian illumigene Malaria platform. Results were compared with microscopy from thick and thin blood films in all cases. In case of discordant results between LAMP and microscopy (n = 60), confirmation testing was performed with real-time PCR. Persistence of circulating parasite DNA was analyzed by serial assessments of blood samples following malaria treatment.
Results
Out of 1000 blood samples analyzed, 238 were positive for malaria parasites according to microscopy (n = 181/1000) or PCR (additional n = 57/60). LAMP demonstrated sensitivity of 98.7% (235/238), specificity of 99.6% (759/762), positive predictive value (PPV) of 98.7% (235/238) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.6% (759/762), respectively. For first slides of patients with malaria and for follow-up slides, sensitivity values were 99.1% (106/107) and 98.5% (129/131), respectively.
Conclusions

abstract = "Background
In the past decade, a large influx of migrants presented in Europe. Their country of origin was mainly either Syria or Eritrea. Public health institutions in host countries in Europe are challenged to screen and care for migrant populations with regard to infectious diseases.
Methods
We performed a systematic literature review (according to PRISMA guidelines) to define the infectious disease profile of migrants originating in Syria and Eritrea.
Results
The search resulted in 825 papers of possible relevance for infectious diseases in migrants from Syria, of which, after screening, we included 35 in the systematic review. A further 265 papers of possible relevance for infectious diseases in Eritrean migrants were screened, of which we included 27 in the systematic review. In migrants from Syria, leishmaniasis was the most frequently reported infectious disease. In addition, colonisation with drug resistant, Gram-negativ bacteria was reported. In the Eritrean migrants the infectious disease most described in the selected papers was louse-borne relapsing fever. Other frequently reported infectious diseases were scabies and Plasmodium vivax malaria.
Conclusion
Our systematic analysis defines the profiles of infectious diseases for migrants from Syria and Eritrea and serves as an evidence base for public health screening and care of presenting migrants."

Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has emerged as a significant threat for pregnant women and newborns in populations living in or visiting Latin America. We previously reported a preliminary analysis in Sucre, Colombia, as the first group of pregnant women with RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV (ZIKa en Embarazadas y Recién Nacidos en COLombia, ZIKERNCOL).
Methods
In this second report, findings of the first 86 pregnant women from La Virginia and Dosquebradas (municipalities), Risaralda, Colombia, with RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infection are reported. Clinical, demographical and obstetrical findings are described.
Results
All women reported ZIKV symptoms during pregnancy: 79.1% rash, 55.8% fever, among others. In addition to ZIKV, RT-PCR was positive for dengue in 18.6%; 45.3% Dengue IgM+; 5.8% RT-PCR positive for chikungunya; 3.6% Chikungunya IgM+. STORCH screening in mother: 11.6% IgG + anti-Toxoplasma gondii, 6% IgG + anti-rubella, 4.7% IgG + CMV. The rest of STORCH tests were negative. Microcephaly was observed in 2.4% of the newborns. No calcifications or other CNS alterations were detected. One newborn had cleft palate and one had bilateral renal ectopy.
Conclusions
The rate of microcephaly in our cohort was consistent with other studies. Pregnant women in endemic areas should be followed and tested according to standard protocols, and asymptomatic ZIKV infection should be considered. Long-term follow-up of children is required in the congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) assessment."

Slovakia is well-known for tick-borne encephalitis alimentary (TBE) outbreaks in Europe for a long time. Since the first known and largest TBE alimentary outbreak in 1951 (at territory of Slovakia) until today, none of the European countries report a comparable number of TBE alimentary outbreaks with probable and laboratory confirmed food transmission factor as Slovakia.
Methods
We analyzed TBE outbreak confirmed cases reported in Slovakia from web-based Epidemiological Information System (EPIS) during the period 2007–2016.
Results
During years 2007–2016 we recorded 26 TBE alimentary outbreaks. In most outbreaks (22 out of 26) the probable transmission factor of TBE virus was identified within epidemiological context. In 4 outbreaks the transmission factor was laboratory confirmed. The most common probable and confirmed transmission factor of alimentary TBE outbreaks was milk and milk products of goat origin.
Conclusion
There should be more effort of laboratory clarification of TBE transmission factor in Slovakia. It is important to be aware of the issue of Slovakia from the point of tourism and prevention, but also due to potential risks of consumption of raw milk and its products that became popular in recent years not only in Slovakia."

The epidemiology of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria is fast evolving with increasing global trend towards community-acquired infections. Limited information available about ESBLs therapy outcomes and control strategies, especially in the Middle Eastern countries.
Methods
We studied 399 ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from urinary tract infections (UTIs) occurred between 2014 and 2016 in University Hospital Sharjah. We included 124 ESBL-negative E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates from UTIs as controls. Pearson Chi squares test and independent t-test were used to compare difference between ESBL positives and negatives. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed.
Results
Approximately 75% of the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates causing UTIs were community-acquired. We found that recurrent UTIs, old age, and catheterization among other risk factors for community-acquired ESBL-positive UTIs. Majority of these ESBL-positive isolates were resistant to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin (74%) and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (73%) that are commonly used for treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
Conclusions
ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae have become major etiological pathogens of community-acquired UTIs in the United Arab Emirates. Healthcare providers should implement better infection control strategies and careful use of antimicrobials especially in out-patient and community settings."

Young travelers to South-East Asia may be at risk for Japanese encephalitis (JE).
Methods
IXIARO® (0.25 ml or 0.5 ml, depending on age) were administrated to 100 travelers aged ≥ 2 months to < 18 years. Solicited AEs were collected for 7 days after each injection, unsolicited adverse events (AEs) for a total of 7 months. JE neutralizing antibodies were assessed in 64 subjects.
Results
The most common solicited local AEs were redness (3/12 subjects), induration and tenderness (both 1/12) with 0.25 ml IXIARO®, and tenderness (44/88) and pain (22/88) with 0.5 ml IXIARO®. Common solicited systemic AEs were diarrhea (2/12) and loss of appetite (1/12) with 0.25 ml IXIARO® and muscle pain (27/88) and excessive fatigue (10/88) with 0.5 ml IXIARO®. In total, up to day 56, AEs were reported by 10/12 (83.3%) of subjects who received the 0.25 ml dose and 67/88 (76.1%) of those vaccinated with the 0.5 ml dose. All subjects (62/62; 100%) developed protective levels of JE neutralizing antibodies by Day 56 and 31/34 (91.2%) retained protective titers at Month 7.
Conclusions
IXIARO® was generally well tolerated in children, with an overall AE profile similar to adults. IXIARO® was highly immunogenic in both dose groups."

The Christian pilgrimage to the Holy Land has been recorded since the 4th century, while the Hajj, Islam's great pilgrimage, has existed for fourteen centuries, of which a body of literature devoted to the travelogues of the Hajj has been recorded for over ten centuries. Football is a sport played worldwide by more than 1.5 million teams and in 300,000 clubs. Most however play outside of the officially organized sphere: more than 4 percent of the global population plays football, including 270 million amateur players. Assembling for specific events is a uniquely human behavior, though the formal study of crowds did not begin until the mid-Twentieth Century. Today Mass Gathering Medicine focuses on the public health challenges to hosting events attended by a large enough number of people, at a specific site, for a defined period of time, likely to strain both the planning and response to the mass gathering of a community, state, or nation. All of us can recall attending a mass gathering, whether it be watching one's favorite rock group in performance or assembling for religious pilgrimage. Certainly, the event itself is transporting and transforming and the unison of behaviors and activities can be enormously enriching, uplifting and overwhelming, just as much as they may be at times dangerous and high risk. This review seeks to draw contrasts and comparisons between sporting gatherings and religious gatherings with a chief focus on Hajj, among the largest of all mass gatherings today. We will find there are some powerful similarities as well as stark differences. Each bequeaths a legacy which can inform the other and, as we make our observations, we join with you and the legions of other investigators who continue to remain fascinated and enthralled by mass gatherings which are among the most beloved and beholden events of modern humanity."

Our goal is to document two cases of HFRS, imported by two immigrants from two countries, and to make a review of the imported HFRS literature data. We performed a systematic literature review (PRISMA guidelines) of imported cases of HFRS and herein describe our two clinical cases. We found 20 published papers, with 16 of them in English and 4 in other languages. Twenty-three patients with travel- or immigration-associated HFRS, including our two cases, were identified. We included only papers that were in English. The average age of the patients was 35.9 ± 15.13 years, and the ratio of male to female was 8:1. Imported disease from Europe to Europe occurred in seven cases, America to Europe occurred in four cases, Europe to America occurred in two cases, America to America occurred in two cases, Asia to Asia in one case, Asia to Europe in one case, and Europe to Asia in one case. The results of the two cited cases are based on the clinical–laboratory, anamnestic, and serologic data for both the patients who tested positive for HFRS. Our systematic analysis shows that international travelers are important sources of infectious diseases. HFRS related to travel and immigration is a rare event. Principal risk factors for travelers and immigrants are camping outside recommended areas or under unsuitable conditions. In recent years, various publications have shown that international travelers and immigrants have expanded the spectrum of imported infectious diseases. The literature data show that the actual reported numbers of imported case of HFRS are limited."

In 2020, Japan will host the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020 (Tokyo 2020) which will involve a large population influx from various countries to Tokyo, the most populated city in Japan. We summarize the potential health risks for visitors to Tokyo 2020, related to communicable disease risks and other health threats, based on recent national and local surveillance reports.
Methods
We reviewed up-to-date surveillance reports published by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Tokyo Metropolitan Infectious Disease Surveillance Center.
Results
Communicable disease risks for vaccine-preventable illnesses such as measles and rubella, as well as food and waterborne diseases represent the most likely risks. The risk of acquiring vector-borne diseases is considered low in Japan. On the other hand, however, heat-related illness represents a potential risk, as Tokyo 2020 is scheduled during the hottest season in Japan, with temperatures generally expected to exceed 30 °C.
Conclusion
Maintaining an up-to-date routine vaccination schedule is highly recommended for visitors attending the Tokyo 2020 and appropriate hygiene measures for food and waterborne diseases as well as health promotion for heat-related illness. It may also be useful to increase the number of multilingual triage clinicians whom can be placed within emergency departments during the Tokyo 2020 to provide first contact services and coordination of emergency care among non-Japanese speaking visitors to Tokyo."

There is a large increase in the numbers of refugees and asylum seekers worldwide and a lack of data on the carriage of antimicrobial resistance in refugee/asylum seeking groups.
Methods
This article aims to identify the impact of refugees and asylum seekers on the acquisition and transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) through a literature search. The databases Embase, Medline, Pubmed, and Web of Science Core Collection were utilised and covered all articles before the 1st of October 2016. In total, 577 articles were identified, and studies were eligible if they met the selection criteria, including observational study design, English language, and AMR strains reported in absolute numbers. In total, 17 articles met the criteria, the majority were from the European region.
Results
Articles fitting the selection criteria exclusively reported AMR in bacterial species including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, K. oxytoca, Shigella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and Acinetobacter baumannii. The analyses indicated that a high percentage of AMR strains, have been circulating among refugees and asylum seekers.
Conclusion
The displacement of refugees and asylum seekers seem to play a key role in the transmission of AMR. Therefore, improved AMR control measures are essential. A knowledge gap was identified; further research is strongly recommended."

Delays in diagnosis and treatment for malaria are associated with an increased risk for severe disease and mortality. Identifying the extent of patient and health system delay can provide a benchmark against which interventions to reduce delays can be measured.
Methods
We performed an electronic search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and LILACS for studies reporting time to diagnosis and treatment after return from travel, onset of symptoms and seeking healthcare in non-endemic countries. Additionally, theses, conference proceedings and nationally reported surveillance data were also searched for information on time delays. There were no language restrictions and all the studies were assessed for methodological quality.
Results
Data from 69 papers out of 1719 identified records published between 2005 and 2017 were extracted; our findings show that median diagnosis delays of four or more days are common and patient delays accounted for a large proportion of diagnostic delay. There were limited data available on medical diagnostic delay.
Conclusion
Patient delays accounted for a large proportion of the overall diagnostic delay; however the retrospective nature of the studies could have overestimated patient delay since previous healthcare contacts were not included. Additionally, the high frequency of studies reporting a clinically significant delay is a major concern."

The disease is rare in Western Europe and the majority of cases described had a cutaneous clinical presentation. The disease may sometimes be confused with allergy, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Visceral symptoms are rare but may follow severe attacks. A definitive diagnosis can be obtained by the isolation of larvae from skin biopsies, but these are rarely performed. The diagnosis is usually presumptive, based on a combination of anamnestic, clinical, and biological factors. Several courses of the anti-helminths, albendazole or ivermectin, are often necessary. Although rare, the diagnosis should be evoked systematically in a migrant or traveller returning from an endemic area with cutaneous lesions."

More than 700,000 trips were made by residents in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (EWNI) in 2015 to tropical countries endemic for yellow fever, a potentially deadly, yet vaccine-preventable disease transmitted by mosquitoes. The aim of this study was to map the geographical accessibility of yellow fever vaccination centres (YFVC) in EWNI.
Methods
The location of 3208 YFVC were geocoded and the average geodetic distance to nearest YFVC was calculated for each population unit. Data on trips abroad and centres were obtained regionally for EWNI and nationally for the World Top20 countries in terms of travel.
Results
The mean distance to nearest YFVC was 2.4 km and only 1% of the population had to travel more than 16.1 km to their nearest centre. The number of vaccines administered regionally in EWNI was found correlated with the number of trips to yellow fever countries. The number of centres per 100,000 trips was 6.1 in EWNI, which was below United States (12.1) and above the rest of Top20 countries.
Conclusions
The service availability was in line with demand regionally. With the exception of remote, rural areas, yellow fever vaccination services were widely available with only short distances to cover for the travelling public."

keywords = "Chemoprophylaxis, Primaquine, Malaria, Non-immune traveler",
abstract = "Background
With increased international travel over the world the need for safe and effective chemoprophylaxis for malaria is as great as ever. The choice of regimen is difficult, as effectiveness should be weighted against potential adverse effects. Although, some studies have reported high prophylactic efficacy of primaquine, there is no comprehensive evidence comparing its prophylactic effectiveness as well as toxicity. To fill the gap, this systematic review and meta-analysis study was carried out.
Methods
Using MeSH terms, 756 records were detected through searching “Pubmed”, “Embase”,”Web of Science”and “Cochrane” databases. From these,7 relevant full-text articles with 14 comparisons for final quantitative meta-analysis were included in our review. In order to make a comparison between the studies, Risk Ratios(RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals(CIs) were estimated.
Results
Overall,74% reduction in the incidence of parasitaemia by primaquine versus other prophylactic regimens was estimated(RRoverall = 0.26, CI 95%:0.16–0.41--RRvivax = 0.16, CI 95%:0.07–0.36--RRfalciparum = 0.31, CI 95%:0.18–0.55). The incidence rate ratios for adverse effects showed no statistically significant difference between primaquine and control groups (p > 0.05).
Conclusions
For persons without G6PD deficiency, who are not pregnant, primaquine is the most effective presently available prophylactic for P. vivax malaria and comparable to such regimens as doxycycline, mefloquine and atovaquone-proguanil for the prevention of P. falciparum malaria."

Limited prospective data are available on the acquisition of viral, bacterial and parasitic diarrhoeagenic agents by healthy individuals during travel.
Methods
To determine the frequency of travel associated acquisition of 19 pathogens in 98 intercontinental travellers, qPCR was used to detect 8 viral pathogens, 6 bacterial enteric pathogens and 5 parasite species in faecal samples collected immediately before and after travel.
Results
We found high pre-travel carriage rates of Blastocystis spp. and Dientamoeba fragilis of 32% and 19% respectively. Pre-travel prevalences of all other tested pathogens were below 3%. Blastocystis spp. (10%), Plesiomonas shigelloides (7%), D. fragilis (6%) and Shigella spp. (5%) were the most frequently acquired pathogens and acquisition of enteral viruses and hepatitis E virus in this relatively small group of travellers was rare or non-existent.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that the role of viruses as the cause of persisting traveller's diarrhoea is limited and bacterial pathogens are more likely as a cause of traveller's diarrhoea. The substantial proportion of travellers carrying Blastocystis spp. and D. fragilis before travel warrants cautious interpretation of positive samples in returning travellers with gastrointestinal complaints."

To study the epidemiological and clinical features of Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) infection in a migrant population.
Methods
We performed a retrospective chart review, identifying a cohort of 21 symptomatic patients of migrant origin with confirmed HEV infection admitted in the period between January 1995–November 2014.
Results
20 (95%) patients came from South Asian countries highly endemic for HEV, all positive for HEV genotype 1. Recent travel to a highly endemic country was the most consistent risk factor identified in 90% of cases, duration from return to Italy to hospitalization ranged from 10 to 120 days. Nausea and vomiting (100%), jaundice (95.2%), and anorexia (85.7%) were the most common reported symptoms. Fever was present in 57.1% of cases. Transaminase values were elevated in all patients and serum bilirubin was raised in 86% of patients. We found no statistically significant differences between clinical symptoms, laboratory results or duration of hospitalization in patients with co-morbidities compared to those without. We also report a secondary case of HEV genotype 1 transmitted within Italy.
Conclusion
Our study highlights the epidemiological risk factors and clinical features of HEV infection in a migrant population in Italy and should stimulate further research regarding the prevalence and morbidity of HEV within migrant populations in Europe."

The recent West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak had catastrophic impact on populations, health care systems and economies of the affected countries. Somatic symptoms have been reported to persist long beyond the acute infection. This review was conducted to provide an overview on neuro- and socio-psychological long-term sequelae of EVD survivors.
Methods
Utilizing Pubmed and PsycInfo databases, a systematic review prepared according to PRISMA guidelines. Only studies reporting quantitative data on neuropsychological sequelae three weeks or later after discharge from the Ebola-treating unit were included. Pooled proportions of common outcomes were calculated.
Results
In total, 224 papers were identified, of which 10 were included. Depression, insomnia, fatigue, anxiety and post-traumatic stress were common sequelae in EVD survivors. However, data from high-quality studies were scarce.
Conclusions
EVD survivors have been thought to commonly face neuropsychological long-term sequelae. Methodological drawbacks and heterogeneity of current studies limit conclusions of the impact and magnitude of such sequelae. We advocate the preparation of a prospective, controlled cohort study protocol in preparation for a future outbreak."

Eritrean migrants accounted for the majority of people who drowned in the Mediterranean this year. Recently, data deficit about international migration has been reported.
Methods
One hundred and thirty-three Eritrean migrants, upon their arrival in Italy, were accommodated at the asylum seekers center of Castelnuovo di Porto, together with 25 sanitary workers, and received microbiological surveillance at the Clinical Pathology and Microbiology Unit of the University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome.
Results
Gram-negative bacteria, mostly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca, were frequently recovered in surveillance swabs. Gram-positive bacteria, represented by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus, were also isolated in surveillance swabs. In migrants, polymicrobial swabs were recovered at high frequency, and unusual microorganisms, rarely found in our country, were isolated.
Conclusion
The polymicrobial colonization and the high prevalence of gram-negative bacteria represent the baseline characteristics of this migrant population from Eritrea. The presence of unusual microorganisms can be potentially pathogenic to asymptomatic carriers at risk of developing clinical disease if immunosuppressed or subjected to invasive procedures. In conclusion, active microbiological surveillance can represent an advantage for the host country in terms of data collection and by tracing unusual or resistant microorganisms by monitoring migrants' health status."

Mefloquine is recommended in international health guidelines for preventing malaria in travellers. Reports of psychosis and suicide are often alluded to but are not clearly established.
Methods
We carried out a systematic review of the literature to identify and critically appraise any reported death or parasuicide associated with mefloquine prophylaxis. We developed a comprehensive search that included publications up to 11 July 2017. We included case studies but excluded newspaper reports. Two authors independently appraised each death or parasuicide against a standardised causality assessment tool. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42016041988).
Results
We identified 527 articles that required full-text retrieval; of these 17 were unique publications that reported deaths or parasuicide. Eight unique publications had sufficient detail to be included in causality assessment. We identified 2 deaths with a probable association that appeared to be idiosyncratic drug reactions; we categorised the remaining 8 deaths as “unlikely” to be related to mefloquine, or “unclassifiable”. There was one parasuicide with a possible causal association. There were 9 additional publications that searched spontaneous drug reporting databases; none provided sufficient detail to perform a causality assessment.
Conclusions
Overall, the number of deaths that we could reliably attribute to the prophylactic use of mefloquine is very low."

The goal of the study was to characterize high altitude illness in Nepali pilgrims.
Methods
We kept standardized records at the Himalayan Rescue Association (HRA) Temporary Health Camp at Gosainkund Lake (4380 m) in the Nepal Himalaya during the annual Janai Purnima Festival in 2014. Records included rate of ascent and Lake Louise Score (LLS). We defined High Altitude Headache (HAH) as headache alone or LLS = 2. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) was LLS≥3. High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) was AMS with ataxia or altered mental status.
Results
An estimated 10,000 pilgrims ascended rapidly, most in 1–2 days, from Dhunche (1960 m) to Gosainkund Lake (4380 m). We saw 769 patients, of whom 86 had HAH. There were 226 patients with AMS, including 11 patients with HACE. We treated patients with HACE using dexamethasone and supplemental oxygen prior to rapid descent. Each patient with HACE descended carried by a porter. There were no fatalities due to HACE. There were no cases of High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE).
Conclusions
HAH and AMS were common in pilgrims ascending rapidly to 4380 m. There were 11 cases of HACE, treated with dexamethasone, supplemental oxygen and descent. There were no fatalities."

One third of travellers to the poor regions of the (sub)tropics become colonized by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE). Co-resistance to non-beta-lactam antibiotics complicates the treatment of potential ESBL-PE infections.
Methods
We analysed co-resistance to non-beta-lactams among travel-acquired ESBL-PE isolates of 90 visitors to the (sub)tropics with respect to major risk factors of colonization: destination, age, travellers' diarrhoea (TD) and antibiotic (AB) use.
Results
Of the ESBL-PE isolates, 53%, 52%, 73%, and 2% proved co-resistant to ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, co-trimoxazole, and nitrofurantoin, respectively. The rates were similar among those with (TD+) or without (TD-) travellers' diarrhoea. Among fluoroquinolone-users vs. AB non-users, the co-resistance rates for ciprofloxacin were 95% versus 37% (p = 0.001), for tobramycin 85% versus 43% (p = 0.005), co-trimoxazole 85% versus 68% (p = 0.146), and nitrofurantoin 5% versus 2% (p = 0.147). In multivariable analysis co-resistance to ciprofloxacin was associated with increasing age, fluoroquinolone use, and tobramycin resistance.
Conlusions
While TD predisposes to ESBL-PE non-selectively, antimicrobial use favours strains resistant to drug taken and, simultaneously, any drug with resistance genetically linked to the drug used. Antibiotics taken during travel predispose to ESBL-PE with a high co-resistance rate."

The increasing reports of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) from many countries emphasize its importance for international travel. Muslim pilgrimages of Hajj and Umrah involve mass gatherings of international travellers. We set out to assess the presence of influenza and MERS-CoV in Hajj/Umrah returnees with acute respiratory infection. .
Methods
Disembarking passengers (n = 8753) from Saudi Arabia (October 2014 to April 2015) were interviewed for the presence of respiratory symptoms; 977 (11%) reported symptoms and 300 (age 26–90, median 60 years; 140 male) consented to participate in the study. After recording clinical and demographic data, twin swabs (nasopharyngeal and throat) were collected from each participant, pooled in viral transport media and tested by real-time RT PCR for MERS-CoV and influenza A and B viruses and their subtypes.
Results
The participants had symptoms of 1–15 days (median 5d); cough (90%) and nasal discharge (86%) being the commonest. None of the 300 participants tested positive for MERS-CoV; however, 33 (11%) tested positive for influenza viruses (A/H3N2 = 13, A/H1N1pdm09 = 9 and B/Yamagata = 11). Eighteen patients received oseltamivir. No hospitalizations were needed and all had uneventful recovery.
Conclusion
Despite a high prevalence of acute respiratory symptoms, MERS coV was not seen in returning pilgrims from Hajj and Umrah. However detection of flu emphasises preventive strategies like vaccination."

In this retrospective 6-year study, we examined the epidemiology of fever of unknown origin (FUO) in Greece over the past years. Forty-eight patients with classical FUO were included. The proportion of infectious causes of FUO (29.2%) was similar to previous studies in Greece and all infections were endemic to the area. Disease-related mortality was 12.5% and no deaths due to infection were recorded. In conclusion, none of the diagnosed infectious causes of FUO raised concerns about the possibility of imported diseases or pathogens. These results re-inforce the perception that migrants and refugees are not carriers of communicable diseases that can cause public health problems to European countries."

Tafenoquine is a new prophylactic antimalarial drug. The current analysis presents an integrated safety assessment of the Tafenoquine Anticipated Clinical Regimen (Tafenoquine ACR) from 5 clinical trials, including 1 conducted in deployed military personnel and 4 in non-deployed residents, which also incorporated placebo and mefloquine comparator groups.
Methods
Adverse events (AEs) were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®, Version 15.0) and summarized. Among all subjects who had received the Tafenoquine ACR, safety findings were compared for subjects who were deployed military personnel from the Australian Defence Force (Deployed ADF) versus non-deployed residents (Resident Non-ADF).
Results
The incidence of at least one AE was 80.6%, 64.1%, 67.6% and 94.9% in the mefloquine, placebo, tafenoquine Resident Non-ADF and tafenoquine Deployed ADF groups, respectively. The latter group had a higher incidence of AEs related to military deployment. AEs that occurred at ≥ 1% incidence in both tafenoquine sub-groups and at a higher frequency than placebo included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, gastroenteritis, nasopharyngeal tract infections, and back/neck pain.
Conclusions
Weekly administration of tafenoquine for up to six months increased the incidence of gastrointestinal AEs, certain infections, and back/neck pain, but not the overall incidence of AEs versus placebo.

Specific travel-related recommendations exist for the prevention or self-treatment of infectious diseases contracted by travellers to the tropics. In the current study, we assessed the medical preparedness per these recommendations, focusing on whether travellers carried antidiarrheal and antimalarial medication with them stratified by type of pre-travel advice.
Methods
We surveyed travellers departing from Hamburg International Airport to South or Southeast Asia, using a questionnaire on demographic, medical and travel characteristics.
Results
975 travellers were analysed – the majority (817, 83%) being tourists. A large proportion packed any antidiarrheal medication (612, 63%) – most frequently loperamide (440, 72%). Only 176 of 928 (19%) travellers to destinations with low-to medium risk for malaria packed a recommended antimalarial medication. The majority (162, 17%) of them carried antimalarials as stand-by emergency treatment (SBET). 468 (48%) travellers had a pre-travel medical consultation. This lead to higher odds of carrying SBET– with the highest odds associated with a consultation at a travel medicine specialist (OR 7.83 compared to no consultation).
Conclusions
Attending a travel medicine specialist was associated with better adherence to current recommendations concerning the carriage of stand-by emergency treatment of malaria. However, the proportion of travellers seeking pre-travel health advice was overall low in our population. Promoting pre-travel consultations may, therefore, lead to higher adherence to the current recommendations in travel medicine"

Deaths and certain illnesses onboard ships arriving at US ports are required to be reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and notifications of certain illnesses are requested.
Methods
We performed a descriptive analysis of required maritime illness and death reports of presumptive diagnoses and requested notifications to CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, which manages CDC's Quarantine Stations, from January 2010 to December 2014.
Results
CDC Quarantine Stations received 2891 individual maritime case reports: 76.8% (2221/2891) illness reports, and 23.2% (670/2891) death reports. The most frequent individual illness reported was varicella (35.9%, 797/2221) and the most frequently reported causes of death were cardiovascular- or pulmonary-related conditions (79.6%, 533/670). There were 7695 cases of influenza-like illness received within aggregate notifications. CDC coordinated 63 contact investigations with partners to identify 972 contacts; 88.0% (855/972) were notified. There was documentation of 6.5% (19/293) receiving post-exposure prophylaxis. Three pertussis contacts were identified as secondary cases; and one tuberculosis contact was diagnosed with active tuberculosis.
Conclusion
These data provide a picture of US maritime illness and death reporting and response. Varicella reports are the most frequent individual disease reports received. Contact investigations identified few cases of disease transmission."

abstract = "Background
Hajj is the annual mass gathering of Muslims, and is a reservoir and potential source of bacterial transmission. The emergence of bacterial transmission, including multi-drug resistance (MDR) bacteria, during Hajj has not been systematically assessed.
Methods
Articles in Pubmed, Scopus, and Google scholar were identified using controlled words relating to antibiotic resistance (AR) at the Hajj from January 2002 to January 2017. Eligible studies were identified by two researchers. AR patterns of bacteria were obtained for each study.
Results
We included 31 publications involving pilgrims, Hajj workers or local patients attending hospitals in Mecca, Mina, and the Medina area. Most of these publications provided antibiotic susceptibility results. Ten of them used the PCR approach to identify AR genes. MRSA carriage was reported in pilgrims and food handlers at a rate of 20%. Low rates of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive bacteria were reported in pilgrims and patients. The prevalence of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant bacteria was common in the Hajj region. Across all studies, carbapenem-resistant bacteria were detected in fewer than 10% of E.coli isolates tested but up to 100% in K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii. Colistin-resistant Salmonella enterica, including mcr-1 colistin-resistant E.coli and K.pneumoniae were only detected in the pilgrim cohorts.
Conclusion
This study provides an overview of the prevalence of MDR bacteria at the Hajj. Pilgrims are at high risk of AR bacterial transmission and may carry and transfer these bacteria when returning to their home countries. Thus, pilgrims should be instructed by health care practitioners about hygiene practices aiming at reducing traveler's diarrhea and limited use of antibiotics during travel in order to reduce the risk of MDR bacterial transmission."

Methods
As part of the Refugee Health Assessment Program, stool examinations and tuberculin skin testing were performed on refugees seen at Boston Medical Center between 1995 and 2012. Tuberculin skin test (TST) and stool examination data were collected for 6669 refugees; 3349 (50.2%) were TST positive (≥10 mm).
Results
Among TST-positive subjects, 176 (5.3%) had helminth infections and 1149 (34.3%) protozoa. After adjusting for sex, age, and country of origin, helminth and protozoan infections were not associated with TST-positivity. When species-specific effects were examined, subjects infected with Trichuris trichiura and Giardia lamblia had reduced odds of TST-positivity (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.65 [95%CI 0.44–0.96; p = 0.03] and aOR 0.79 [95%CI 0.65–0.95, p = 0.01], respectively).
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that T. trichiura and G. lamblia may provide protection against M. tuberculosis infection. This study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that immune response modulation and susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection is parasite species-dependent."

abstract = "Introduction
Malaria prevention can be complex due to the individual characteristics of the traveller, travel destination, duration of stay and type of travel. Our aim in this study was to document malaria chemoprophylaxis recommendations provided by travel-medicine experts in Europe for specific risk groups of travellers visiting malaria-endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa.
Methods
Travel medicine experts in Europe were asked to complete an online questionnaire, a 28-item Survey Monkey survey, on 11 malaria prevention scenarios. We also reviewed the recommendations of the UK, U.S. CDC, Germany, Switzerland, WHO and the electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC) for malaria prevention in risk groups.
Results
The questionnaire was sent to 110 travel medicine experts in 19 countries. The response rate was 44.55%. The experts would recommend, as first choice, malaria chemoprophylaxis atovaquone/proguanil for an adult traveller with no co-morbidities travelling for 2 weeks (91.67% of experts) and for 2 months (51.06%), for a healthy tourist child travelling for two weeks (68.09%) and for an adult traveller with liver cirrhosis (57.78%). Mefloquine was the first choice for a healthy tourist child travelling for 2 months (59.57%), for a tourist infant (8 kg) travelling for 2 weeks (59.57%) and for 2 months (68.09%), for a pregnant VFR (74.47%), for a breast-feeding mother with her 5 kg infant (72.34%) and for a VFR family with limited budget (63.83%). For an adult traveller with renal impairment the experts recommended mefloquine (42.22%) or doxycycline (37.78%). All experts (100%) recommended mosquito repellents. Mosquito nets were recommended routinely by 95.35% of the experts, air-conditioning by 83.72% and impregnated clothing by 81.40%.
Conclusion
The European experts differ in pre-travel anti-malarial recommendations for risk groups visiting malaria endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Contraindications are not always observed and there are no uniform recommendations for high-risk groups. 9 experts would recommend atovaquone/proguanil to a traveller with severe renal impairment although most reviewed national recommendations consider this a contraindication. Discordance in recommendations, a lack of key data and few chemoprophylaxis options limit choices for pre-travel health advisors."

Methods
During 2013–2016, a total of 42351 throat swabs were examined for presence of influenza viruses and MERS-CoV in Iranian general population and pilgrims returning from Mecca and Karbala with SARI by using one step RT-PCR kit.
Results
None of the patients had MERS-CoV but influenza viruses were detected in 12.7% with high circulation of influenza A/H1N1 (47.1%).

Neurocysticercosis (NCC) of Taenia solium has never been reported in Mongolia. A Mongolian traveler who visited China and India presented with epileptic seizures after his return to Mongolia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple ring enhancing lesions with edema surrounding several lesions in his brain that were initially diagnosed to be viral encephalitis or NCC.
Methods
Serology for cysticercosis using diagnostic antigens partially purified by cation-exchange chromatography and chimeric recombinant antigens and DNA analysis of a proglottid found in the patient's stool were applied for differential diagnosis.
Results
Serology showed strong positivity for NCC, and mitochondrial cox1 gene analysis revealed Indian but not Chinese haplotype of T. solium.
Conclusion
This NCC case was considered to be caused by eggs released from adult tapeworm(s) established after eating uncooked or undercooked pork contaminated with cysticerci during his stay in India. This is a case report of taeniasis and secondary NCC associated with travel to India with an updated review of NCC in Asia. Molecular tracking of the specimen is highly informative as a way to identify where the infection was acquired."

The acute phase of chikungunya is well documented; less so are its long-term effects. This systematic literature review provides an overview of the currently available data.
Methods
We performed an electronic search in PubMed/Medline and checked reference lists. We included studies in English on long-term sequelae of chikungunya in adults and on long-term sequelae of congenital infection from 2000 to 2016. Case reports, reviews and studies with a follow-up shorter than 6 weeks were excluded.
Results
In total, 37 studies were included; with follow-up periods ranging from 1.5 to 72 months. Most studies were questionnaire-based studies only, in which clinical diagnoses such as arthritis, alopecia and depression were mostly recorded without professional verification. Persisting arthralgia/arthritis (arthralgia/joint stiffness plus joint swelling) was the most frequent problem encountered. Further frequently mentioned sequelae were alopecia and depression. Quality of life was reduced in many for months to years after the acute phase of chikungunya. Female gender, older age, some co-morbidities and the severity of the acute phase were associated with persistent arthralgia. Congenital infection was associated with neurocognitive dysfunctioning in early childhood.
Conclusion
Chikungunya leads to (self-perceived) long-term sequelae in a considerable proportion of patients, impacting significantly on quality of life. Long-term chikungunya sequelae must be taken into account when dealing with this disease because of its important effect on public and individual health. Prospective large-scale, long-term studies with objective assessment of signs and symptoms attributed to the disease are needed to optimally quantify and qualify these problems."

abstract = "Background
Toxocariasis is a globally distributed zoonosis. The most important definitive hosts are dogs, whereas humans serve as paratenic hosts. Transmission to humans occurs by accidental ingestion of eggs, e.g. by consumption of contaminated fruits or vegetables. Although exposure to Toxocara is usually considered as relatively benign, it is implicated in a range of neurological, ophthalmologic and other organ-specific conditions, some of them with grave consequences. This review provides an overview on the epidemiology, presentation and risk factors of exposure to Toxocara in Africa.
Methods
A systematic search was performed for studies published after January 1st, 1990, in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch or German. The review was prepared according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies on toxocariasis in human populations and contamination in human environments were included.
Results
Sixty-five papers were included. Antibodies against Toxocara spp. in humans were found to be very common across Africa. Severe manifestations have been reported mainly from North Africa. Environmental contamination including soil, vegetables and fruits sold on markets was demonstrated in various locations in Africa.
Conclusions
Exposure to Toxocara is prevalent across the African continent. However, the complication frequency, the impact of the condition on the individual and the public health relevance of this zoonosis, and the economic impact have never been systematically evaluated."

Severe imported Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a potentially life-threatening disease with a reported mortality rate of 5–10% when patients are admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.
Methods
To retrospectively review the clinical aspects, the value of severity predictive scores and the management of patients with severe P. falciparum malaria admitted to an ICU in Milano, Italy between January 2010 and December 2015.
Results
Twelve patients were included: seven were male and five female with a median age of 43 years. All were initially treated with intravenous quinine. Median parasitaemia upon admission was 14,5% (range 1–20%). At the time of ICU admission, 3 patients (25%) had 5 or more World Health Organization criteria for severe malaria while another 6 of them developed one or more of the latter during their stay in ICU. Five required mechanical ventilation because of respiratory failure due to ARDS. Four patients required renal replacement therapy. Three patients underwent blood exchange transfusion. All patients survived.
Conclusions
Our retrospective evaluation of adults patients admitted to the ICU with severe imported P. falciparum malaria demonstrated a favourable outcome. Severity predictive scores currently in use probably overestimate the risk of malaria mortality in patients treated in health care systems of high income countries."

abstract = "Background
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been described as one of the most frequently reported mental condition among refugees and internally displaced populations (IDPs). Despite this, few has been reported about it in Latin America, even in Colombia, the country with the highest number of IDPs in the in the world.
Method
This ecological study assessed incidence and differences of PTSD in general population and IDPs in Colombia and its departments (32) during 2009–2012. Epidemiological data was collected from the National Health Records System (RIPS), retrieving the ICD-10 code F43.1 in both populations. We estimated PTSD incidence rates on both populations (cases/100,000 pop), using reference population of the IDPs (SISDHES and the general population was taken from the (DANE). Incidence rates ratios were calculated comparing both populations.
Results
In general population, 6619 cases of PTSD occurred (14.5 cases/100,000 pop, 95%CI 14.0–15.0) while 177 among IDPs (73.8 cases/100,000 pop, 95%CI 63.0–85.0). PTSD was 5.1 times higher among IDPs than in general population. Ranging from 1.6 (Tolima) to 15.8 (Quindío) (median: 4.4). In departments with higher incidence, also it was in IDPs (r2 = 0.4899; p < 0.01).
Conclusion
This study evidenced a significantly higher PTSD incidence among IDPs, when compared with general population in the same territories. This has relevant implications for screening, diagnosis and management of PTSD among IDPs, especially in high incidence areas. More studies are required to improve the understanding of this condition among vulnerable populations, as well to provide better medical and psychological interventions and for the development of public policies in countries, such as Colombia, with IDPs."

abstract = "Background
Previous studies have indicated that a pre-travel single dose of hepatitis A vaccine is not sufficient as protection against hepatitis A in immunocompromised travelers. We evaluated if an extra dose of hepatitis A vaccine given shortly prior to traveling ensures seroconversion.
Method
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 69, median age = 55 years) treated with Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitor(TNFi) and/or Methotrexate (MTX) were immunized with two doses of hepatitis A vaccine, either as double dose or four weeks apart, followed by a booster dose at six months. Furthermore, 48 healthy individuals, median age = 60 years were immunized with two doses, six months apart. Anti-hepatitis A antibodies were measured at 0, 1, 2, 6, 7 and 12 months.
Results
Two months after the initial vaccination, 84% of the RA patients had protective antibodies, compared to 85% of the healthy individuals. There was no significant difference between the two vaccine schedules. At twelve months, 99% of RA patients and 100% of healthy individuals had seroprotective antibodies.
Conclusion
An extra priming dos of hepatitis A vaccine prior to traveling offered an acceptable protection in individuals treated with TNFi and/or MTX. This constitutes an attractive pre-travel solution to this vulnerable group of patients."

Since the initial description of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we adopted a systematic process of screening patients admitted with community acquired pneumonia. Here, we report the result of the surveillance activity in a general hospital in Saudi Arabia over a four year period.
Materials and methods
All admitted patients with community acquired pneumonia from 2012 to 2016 were tested for MERS-CoV. In addition, testing for influenza viruses was carried out starting April 2015.
Results
During the study period, a total of 2657 patients were screened for MERS-CoV and only 20 (0.74%) tested positive. From January 2015 to December 2016, a total of 1644 patients were tested for both MERS-CoV and influenza. None of the patients tested positive for MERS-CoV and 271 (16.4%) were positive for influenza. The detected influenza viruses were Influenza A (107, 6.5%), pandemic 2009 H1N1 (n = 120, 7.3%), and Influenza B (n = 44, 2.7%). Pandemic H1N1 was the most common influenza in 2015 with a peak in peaked October to December and influenza A other than H1N1 was more common in 2016 with a peak in August and then October to December.
Conclusions
MERS-CoV was a rare cause of community acquired pneumonia and other viral causes including influenza were much more common. Thus, admitted patients are potentially manageable with Oseltamivir or Zanamivir therapy."

We describe trends of malaria in London (2000–2014) in order to identify preventive opportunities and we estimated the cost of malaria admissions (2009/2010–2014/2015).
Methods
We identified all cases of malaria, resident in London, reported to the reference laboratory and obtained hospital admissions from Hospital Episode Statistics.
Results
The rate of malaria decreased (19.4[2001]-9.1[2014] per 100,000). Males were over-represented (62%). Cases in older age groups increased overtime. The rate was highest amongst people of Black African ethnicity followed by Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi ethnicities combined (103.3 and 5.5 per 100,000, respectively). The primary reason for travel was visiting friends and relatives (VFR) in their country of origin (69%), mostly sub-Saharan Africa (92%). The proportion of cases in VFRs increased (32%[2000]-50%[2014]) and those taking chemoprophylaxis decreased (36%[2000]-14%[2014]). The overall case fatality rate was 0.3%. We estimated the average healthcare cost of malaria admissions to be just over £1 million per year.
Conclusion
Our study highlighted that people of Black African ethnicity, travelling to sub-Saharan Africa to visit friends and relatives in their country of origin remain the most affected with also a decline in chemoprophylaxis use. Malaria awareness should focus on this group in order to have the biggest impact but may require new approaches."

Malaria is not endemic in Italy, but it still represents an important threat to the travelers' health. With this study we wanted to compare the characteristics of imported malaria between adults and children.
Method
This retrospective observational study includes all patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit and in the Pediatric Department of Padua (Italy), and discharged with a diagnosis of malaria from 2005 to 2015. The variables considered are epidemiological and clinical.
Results
172 cases of imported malaria were studied (124 adults and 48 children), P. falciparum was responsible for 90,7% of the cases, and was contracted mostly in Africa (96,5%), especially by foreigners visiting friends and relatives (VFR). Chemoprophylaxis was adopted only by few patients. 93% of all the patients developed the uncomplicated malaria, but pediatric patients had severe malaria significantly more often than adults (OR = 4,06, p = 0,015). Children also had significantly lower hemoglobin levels and higher parasitemia. The drugs used to treat the two groups were substantially different, but both had a good overall outcome.
Conclusions
In order to reduce the risk of imported malaria, educational actions should target potential VFR travelers, and they should underline the different risk of severe malaria in adults and children. A further implementation of the recommended therapies could improve the patients' outcome."

New research methods offer opportunities to investigate the influence of environment on health during travel. Our study uses data from a smartphone application to describe spatial and environmental patterns in health among travellers.
Methods
A prospective cohort of travellers to Thailand used a smartphone application during their trips to 1) answer a daily questionnaire about health behaviours and events, and 2) collect streaming data on environment, itinerary, and weather. Incidence of health events was described by region and trip type. The relationship between environmental factors and health events was modelled using a logistic mixed model.
Results
The 75/101 (74.3%) travellers that completed the study answered 940 questionnaires, 796 (84.7%) of which were geolocated to Southeast Asia. Accidents occurred to 20.0% of participants and were mainly in the Thai islands, while self-rated “severe” mental health events (21.3%) were centred in Bangkok. The odds of a health event were higher in Chiang Mai (2.34, 95% CI: 1.08, 5.08) and on rainy days (1.86, 95% CI: 1.03, 3.36).
Conclusions
Distinct patterns in spatial and environmental risk factors emerged in travellers to Thailand. Location based tracking could identify “hotspots” for health problems and update travel advice to target specific risk groups and regions."

International travel has an important role in transmission of emerging infectious diseases. We described the imported infectious diseases in Korea from 2003 to 2012, and to analyze association of travels with the change in the incidences.
Methods
We used National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System to investigate the incidence of salmonellosis, shigellosis, malaria, and dengue. Data from Korea Tourism Organization was used to describe the inbound and outbound travelers by their age group, gender, and purpose of travel. We assessed association between international travel and the incidence of the infectious diseases, and seasonal variability.
Results
Among 1849 imported cases, dengue comprised the largest number with 631 cases. The proportion of imported cases among total cases gradually increased from 4.1% in 2003 to 30.3% in 2012 (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the number of travelers and the number of imported cases of shigellosis, dengue (P < 0.001), but not for malaria. Seasonal variability was observed for importation of salmonellosis, shigellosis and dengue fever (P = 0.005).

Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonosis attributed to multiple reservoirs. Climatic conditions influence the transmission of pathogenic leptospires, which require warm and humid conditions for survival. The influence of seasonality in human and animal leptospirosis in the subtropical region of Brazil remains poorly understood.
Methods
We performed a retrospective study to describe the patterns of human and animal exposure to leptospirosis and their association with precipitation events in Southern Brazil. Rainfall data were obtained from satellite images. Serum samples were tested using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT); samples with titer ≥ 100 were defined as seroreactive. Linear regression and Pearson's correlation were performed to assess whether there is a relationship between these variables.
Results
We found that precipitation events were not significantly associated with the exposure to leptospirosis in humans or animal species, except for dogs. The interspecies analysis revealed an association between canine and human exposure to leptospirosis. Leptospira kirschneri serovar Butembo (serogroup Autumnalis) presented the highest seroreactivity in humans.
Conclusion
This study provides valuable insights in human and animal leptospirosis in Southern Brazil. These insights will be essential to design intervention measures directed to reduce disease dissemination."

abstract = "Background
Cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is caused by the penetration and migration of canine or feline hookworm larvae into the skin, and frequently affects travelers from high-income countries returning from tropical and sub-tropical areas. Unfortunately, this pathology is neglected due to poor understanding among both physicians and travelers. This study describes the profile of cases reported in Marseille, France.
Patients and methods
A retrospective study was performed in two specialized hospitals between 2003 and 2015. Data on socio-demographics, clinical aspects and treatment were collected. Diagnosis was based on travel history and symptoms.
Results
Forty-three patients with a diagnosis of CLM were recorded in this study. They were aged between 14 and 70 and 51% were male. They were infected while visiting the Americas (37%), Africa (33%), Asia (28%) and (in the case of one patient) Portugal. The mean timescale for diagnosis was 41 days. Track lesions associated with pruritus in the lower limbs were the most common symptoms. Nine had a history of super-infection. Sixteen patients received treatment prior to referral including six who were administered antiparasitic drugs. A one-day treatment with ivermectin, administered at our facility, resulted, in most instances, in a favorable outcome.
Conclusion
This study reports 43 cases of CLM acquired mainly in Africa, Asia and the Americas but also, for the first time, CLM acquired during travel to Portugal. The data show the need for increased awareness of CLM prevention and treatment in order to optimize pre-travel advice and case management. Travelers need to understand how CLM is transmitted and the need to avoid contact with soil and sand contaminated by dogs and cats. In particular, footwear and sun chairs should be used on beaches."

Host genetic factors may impact susceptibility to infection. A small number of studies have investigated the association between factors such as ABO blood groups and selected phenotypes on the incidence and severity of H1N1 infections with inconclusive results.
Methods
Using data from the Clinic of Infectious Diseases – University Clinical Centre Prishtina and based on the examination of 125 patients hospitalized with H1N1 in the period 2009–2014, the frequency of blood groups from ABO and Rhesus (Rh) systems as phenotypical markers were evaluated. In addition, other phenotypes such as ear lobe free/ear lobe attached, normal chin/cleft chin, tongue roller/non roller, hand clasping right thumb over/hand clasping left thumb over, right-handed/left-handed, dark eyes/light eyes were also analyzed. The data obtained from the 125 hospitalized patients were compared with the data from the Kosovar population (n = 2000) as a reference group.
Results
A total of 303 patients with H1N1 were hospitalized in the period 2009–2015. Blood group and phenotype data available from 125 hospitalized H1N1 patients showed significant differences in the frequencies of the blood groups from Rh system as well as in two (out of six) phenotypes of the selected morphological traits compared to reference groups.
Conclusions
The findings from this preliminary study indicate that these Rh system and phenotype differences may be linked to H1N1 susceptibility and may guide identification of risk groups and populations."

Onchocerciasis is endemic in a number of tropical countries in Africa and South America, and it is occasionally diagnosed as an imported disease in non-endemic areas.
Methods
We describe the case of an African migrant with long-lasting pruritus and a cutaneous nodule who was diagnosed with onchocerciasis after nodulectomy, and review the medical literature regarding imported cases of onchocerciasis in the period 1994–2014.
Results
Twenty-nine cases of onchocerciasis diagnosed in migrants from endemic countries, and in expatriates and travellers from non-endemic areas were retrieved. They were predominantly males (73.3%), had a median age of 37 years (two were aged <15 years), and acquired the diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, most frequently in Cameroon (43.3%). Diagnosis of onchocercosis was proven in 73.3% of patients. The most frequent clinical manifestations in these and our own patient were pruritus (23/30, 76.7%), unilateral leg or forearm swelling (13/30, 43.3%) and rash (12/30, 40.0%), whereas only two (6.9%) complained of eye symptoms. Eosinophilia was observed in almost all of the patients (92.0%), with median counts of 2915/μL among migrants and 1960/μL among travellers/expatriates. Eighteen patients underwent a skin snip biopsy, which was positive in 10 cases (55.5%); in the other 13 patients the parasite was directly demonstrated by means of a skin or nodule biopsy (n = 5), nodulectomy (n = 5) or slit lamp examination (n = 3). Eighteen received ivermectin, alone, and seven ivermectin combined with diethylcarbamazine or doxycycline. Outcome details were available for only 14 patients, all of whom were asymptomatic after a median follow-up of 10 months (range 1–48).
Conclusions
Onchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease whose subtle and non-specific features may lead to under-diagnosis or underreporting in non-endemic areas. Physicians should consider this tropical disease when caring for migrants and travellers/expatriates with pruritus, skin lesions and eosinophilia."

abstract = "Objectives
Eosinophilia in travelers and migrants returning from the tropics is often associated with invasive helminthic infections. Total IgE is considered a useful additional diagnostic parameter; however, both parameters are also increased in various other non-helminthic diseases.
Methods
We retrospectively evaluated travelers and migrants seen at our department between September 2007 and May 2014. Patients with an absolute eosinophil count ≥500 cells/μl were considered for further analyses.
Results
Among 6618 returned travelers and migrants, 154 (2.3%) had a total eosinophil count ≥500 cells/μL. Of these, 71 patients (46%) were diagnosed with helminthic infection. In an additional 62 patients (40%) with eosinophilia a final diagnosis was found, including non-helminthic infections in 34 patients and non-infectious causes in 28 patients, while in 21 patients (14%) no diagnosis was made. Patients with helminthic infections had higher eosinophil counts than travelers and migrants with other diagnoses (median 981 vs. 710 cells/μl; p = 0.001), while total IgE levels (n = 70; 172 vs. 152 kU/l; p = 0.731) were similar in both groups.
Conclusion
Eosinophil count but not total IgE levels are associated with helminthic infections in returning travelers and migrants with eosinophilia. Our results do not support the use of total IgE to differentiate helminthic infections from other causes of eosinophilia in this population."

abstract = "Background
Overnight international travels made by Finns more than doubled during 1995–2015. To estimate risks and observe trends of travel-related notifiable sexually transmitted and food- and water-borne infections (STIs and FWIs) among travellers, we analysed national reports of gonorrhoea, syphilis, hepatitis A, shigellosis, campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis cases and related them to travel statistics.
Method
Cases notified as travel-related to the Finnish infectious diseases register were used as numerators and overnight stays of Statistics Finland surveys as denominator. We calculated overall risks (per 100,000 travellers) and assessed trends (using regression model) in various geographic regions.
Results
Of all travel-related cases during 1995–2015, 2304 were STIs and 70,929 FWIs. During 2012–2015, Asia-Oceania showed highest risk estimates for gonorrhoea (11.0; 95%CI, 9.5–13), syphilis (1.4; 0.93–2.1), salmonellosis (157; 151–164), and campylobacteriosis (135; 129–141), and Africa for hepatitis A (4.5; 2.5–7.9), and shigellosis (35; 28–43). When evaluating at country level, the highest risks of infections was found in Thailand, except for hepatitis A ranking Hungary the first. During 2000–2011, significantly decreasing trends occurred for most FWIs particularly in the European regions and for STIs in Russia-Baltics.
Conclusions
Our findings can be used in targeting pre-travel advice, which should also cover those visiting Thailand or European hepatitis A risk areas."

The failure to consider travel-related diagnoses, the lack of diagnostic capacity for specialized laboratory testing, and the declining number of autopsies may affect the diagnosis and management of travel-related infections. Pre- and post-mortem pathology can help determine causes of illness and death in international travelers.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective review of biopsy and autopsy specimens sent to the Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch laboratory (IDPBL) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for diagnostic testing from 1995 through 2015. Cases were included if the specimen submitted for diagnosis was from a traveler with prior international travel during the disease incubation period and the cause of illness or death was unknown at the time of specimen submission.
Results
Twenty-one travelers, six (29%) with biopsy specimens and 15 (71%) with autopsy specimens, met the inclusion criteria. Among the 15 travelers who underwent autopsies, the most common diagnoses were protozoal infections (7 travelers; 47%), including five malaria cases, followed by viral infections (6 travelers; 40%).
Conclusions
Biopsy or autopsy specimens can assist in diagnosing infectious diseases in travelers, especially from pathogens not endemic in the U.S. CDC's IDPBL provides a useful resource for clinicians considering infectious diseases in returned travelers."

Tafenoquine is a new drug for malaria prevention. The goal of the present work was to conduct a specific neurobehavioral study in rats with histopathological assessment of the brain.
Methods
The clinical, hematological, behavioral, motor activity, and neurohistopathologic changes induced by different dose levels of tafenoquine were evaluated following single super-therapeutic dose administration. Toxicokinetic data were generated to allow extrapolation to clinical exposures.
Results
At the highest dose (500 mg/kg), two animals (of 12) died. Surviving animals showed clinical signs of toxicity and had reduced body weight 7–8 days after dosing. Decreases in motor activity were observed on more than one occasion at doses > 9-fold higher than the clinical exposure. No statistically significant changes were observed for other behavioral endpoints. No neurohistopathological changes were noted. Changes in hematological and clinical pathology endpoints were observed at the lowest dose level (125 mg/kg). For context, the human dosing regimen is a 10 mg/kg load followed by 3.3 mg/kg weekly (in a 60 kg person).
Conclusions
As in humans, adverse events other than neurotoxicity were dose-limiting for tafenoquine in rats. This raises the prospect that a new weekly prophylactic, without neurologic liability, may become available in the near future."

Individuals with certain communicable diseases may pose risks to the health of the traveling public; there has been documented transmission on commercial aircraft of tuberculosis (TB), measles, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Federal public health travel restrictions (PHTR) prevent commercial air or international travel of persons with communicable diseases that pose a public health threat.
Methods
We described demographics and clinical characteristics of all cases considered for PHTR because of suspected or confirmed communicable disease from May 22, 2007, to December 31, 2015.
Results
We reviewed 682 requests for PHTR; 414 (61%) actions were completed to place 396 individuals on PHTR. The majority (>99%) had suspected (n = 27) or confirmed (n = 367) infectious pulmonary TB; 58 (16%) had multidrug-resistant-TB. There were 128 (85%) interceptions that prevented the initiation or continuation of travel. PHTR were removed for 310 (78%) individuals after attaining noninfectious status and 86 (22%) remained on PHTR at the end of the analysis period.
Conclusions
PHTR effectively prevent exposure during commercial air travel to persons with potentially infectious diseases. In addition, they are effective tools available to public health agencies to prevent commercial travel of individuals with certain communicable diseases and possibly reconnect them with public health authorities."

The number of adolescents who travel has increased. We estimated the preparedness of adolescents (12–18 years) departing from Athens to Africa and Asia.
Methods
An airport-based survey was conducted from 2011 to 2015.
Results
Sixty-eight adolescents participated; 27/68 (40%) had the Greek nationality. Their main destinations were the Indian subcontinent (37%) and South-East Asia (32%). Most adolescents planned to stay for <1 month (69%) or for 1–3 months (22%). Their main purpose for travel was to visit friends and relatives (VFRs) (60%). Compared to non-VFR adolescents, VFRs more frequently travelled to sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, stayed in local residences and for longer periods. Twenty-one (31%) adolescents sought pre-travel counseling (in 57% of cases 8–14 days before departure). Having the Greek nationality was the only significant factor associated with an increased probability for seeking pre-travel counseling. Vaccination against rabies, typhoid fever, Japanese encephalitis and meningococcus was highly inadequate for adolescents travelling to endemic areas. Significant gaps in malaria chemoprophylaxis were found in those travelling to the Indian subcontinent.
Conclusions
Less than one third of adolescents travelling to Africa and Asia seek counseling. There is a need to access adolescent travellers in Greece and improve pre-travel vaccinations and malaria chemoprophylaxis."

To review infections associated with adventure travel.
Methods
The PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases were searched combining the words infection with the following keywords: rafting, whitewater, surfing, (surfer* or windsurf*), (caves or caving or spelunking), (triathlon or trekking) or (hiking or adventure race), bicycling, backpacking, (mountain climb* or bouldering), horseback riding, orienteering, trekking, and skiing.
Results
Adventure travel is becoming much more common among travelers and it is associated with a subset of infectious diseases including: leptospirosis, schistosomiasis, viral hemorrhagic fevers, rickettsial diseases and endemic mycosis. Caving and whitewater rafting places individuals at particular risk of leptospirosis, schistosomiasis and endemic mycosis, while adventure races also place individuals at high risk of a variety of infections including campylobacter, norovirus and leptospirosis.
Conclusion
Travel practitioners need to be aware of the risks associated with adventure travel and should educate individuals about the risks associated with various activities. Doxycycline prophylaxis should be considered for travelers who are susceptible to leptospirosis due to participation in high-risk sports such as whitewater rafting, caving or adventure races."

A primary reason for non-adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis is fear of latent side effects. We examined latent effects of malaria chemoprophylaxis among Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs).
Methods
During July 18–September 16, 2016, RPCVs who served during 1995–2014 with an e-mail address in Peace Corps' RPCV database were invited to take an internet-based survey on malaria prophylaxis and medical diagnoses. “Good adherence” meant taking prophylaxis “as prescribed” or “most of the time.” Prevalence of diseases diagnosed after Peace Corps service was compared between users and nonusers of each antimalarial using log-binomial regression.
Results
Of 8931 participants (11% response rate), 5055 (57%) took chemoprophylaxis. Initial chemoprophylaxis was mefloquine 59%, chloroquine 13%, doxycycline 16%, atovaquone-proguanil 4%, and “other” 8%. Sixty percent reported good adherence. Mefloquine users had the best adherence (67% good adherence). Prevalences of most diseases were similar between exposed and unexposed groups. Certain psychiatric diagnoses were slightly more likely among mefloquine users (PR 1.14, 95% CI [1.04–1.25], P = 0.0048). When excluding those with prior psychiatric illness, there were no differences in psychiatric diagnosis rates.
Conclusion
Malaria chemoprophylaxis use by Peace Corps Volunteers is safe. Avoiding mefloquine use in those with prior psychiatric illness can reduce psychiatric side effects."

Methods
The study included all patients hospitalized with travel-related diseases in 2015 at a Danish infectious diseases ward. Patient data was extracted from the in-patient hospital registry. was analyzed regarding diagnoses, destination, purpose of travel and pre-travel information.
Results
240 patients were hospitalized with a total of 289 travel-related diseases, accounting for 16.6% (240/1450) of all admissions. Febrile illnesses were the most common (39.5%, 114/289) followed by respiratory (19.7%, 57/289) and gastrointestinal diagnoses (19.0%, 55/289). Most of the diseases were acquired in Sub-Saharan Africa (35.6%, 103/289) followed by South East Asia (27.0%, 78/289), and 60.0% (144/240) of the patients were tourists. One-third (36.3%, 81/223) of the non-migrants had received pre-travel information. The lowest rate was seen in people visiting friends and relatives (18.2%, 6/32).
Conclusion
Travel-related diseases are common among patients admitted to this Danish infectious disease ward. Malaria is the most common disease among both travelers and immigrants. In approximately one third of all the patients in our study etiology was unknown."

abstract = "Background
Enterobacteriaceae have become increasingly resistant, especially due to the acquisition and spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), which confer resistance to the majority of beta-lactams. Multi-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MRE) were first isolated in hospitals, but now they are disseminating in the community setting, mostly in low and middle income countries. Consequently, the increasing number of international travels leads to the importation of MRE from high-prevalence to low-prevalence countries.
Methods
The Pubmed database was used to conduct research from 1980 to 2016 by combining the following key words: travel, antibiotic resistance, ESBL, Enterobacteriaceae, genomic, metagenomic, urinary tract infection, infection.
Results
The research found that the MRE acquisition rates in healthy travellers from low-prevalence countries ranged from 21% to 51% depending on the study design and the visited geographic regions. After a trip to Asia and especially to South Asia, the acquisition rate could reach 85%. A trip to Africa or to the Middle East was associated with lower rates but still worrisome (13–44%). Digestive disorder, diarrhoea and antibiotics used during travel are major risks factors associated with the acquisition of MRE. Travel to endemic areas has also been identified as a risk factor for MRE infection, including urinary tract infections.
Conclusion
Travellers are at high risk of MRE acquisition and consequently of MRE infection. This risk should not be ignored by general practitioners. To reduce the risk of acquisition and subsequent transmission to relatives, travellers should be given recommendations prior to their travel."

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus spreading rapidly in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. No indigenous ZIKV infection had been seen in China. We monitored ZIKV infection among travelers returning to Enping county from ZIKV transmitting countries from 1 March to 10 April 2016.
Methods
We analyzed data including interviews; conducted laboratory test on blood, urine, saliva, conjunctival swab or semen specimens for evidence of ZIKV infection; evaluated household for presence of Aedes mosquitoes or larvae.
Results
A total of 925 individuals were screened, 507 (54.8%) were interviewed, 400 (43.2%) provided samples, of which 13 (3.3%) tested positive for ZIKV including 3 asymptomatic. Rash, conjunctivitis, sore throat, fever were the common symptoms; rash was more pronounced in adults than in children. ZIKV RNA was detected for 1–4 days in blood, but longer in urine and saliva (3–32 days and 2–10 days). Among interviewed, 57.0% had good knowledge about ZIKV, 45.8% were worried about ZIKV, 99.2% would go to hospital if they had infection. Aedes mosquitoes or larvae were detected in townships of infected returners.
Conclusions
ZIKV was imported to China. Screening by symptoms alone is inadequate for detecting ZIKV infection. ZIKV surveillance, health-education, and vector control are necessary to decrease risk of ZIKV transmission."

abstract = "Background
Diagnosing the cause of fever in the returned traveller is challenging. Efforts often focus on identifying ‘exotic’ pathogens. Primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections cause clinical features that overlap with many exotic pathogens. The age-matched seroprevalence of both EBV and CMV is greater in tropical than temperate areas. We describe the clinical and laboratory features of returned travellers diagnosed with primary CMV and EBV syndromes.
Methods
Patients with laboratory-confirmed primary EBV and CMV infections who had attended the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD), London between 1st October 2011 and 1st October 2016 were identified. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained and analysed.
Results
Twenty-two patients with primary EBV infection and 31 with primary CMV infection were identified. The commonest presenting features of both infections were fever (81.1%), headache (50.9%) and arthralgia/myalgia (49.1%). Cervical lymphadenopathy was seen more frequently with EBV than with CMV (59.1% vs. 25.8%, P = 0.02). Transaminitis (79.2%) and lymphocytosis (52.8%) were the commonest laboratory abnormalities in both groups.
Conclusions
Primary EBV and CMV infections are important causes of febrile illness in returning travellers. Identification of these pathogens prevents unnecessary, expensive investigations for more ‘exotic’ pathogens and impacts clinical management for example facilitating prognostication and antimicrobial stewardship."

abstract = "Background
An estimated 4–5 million individuals gather each year in the holy city of Touba, Senegal during the Grand Magal religious pilgrimage. Pilgrims come from across Senegal and the surrounding countries, as well as from countries outside Africa. It is the largest mass gathering (MG) of the Mouride community and the largest Muslim religious MG in West Africa.
Method
A cross-sectional study was conducted on all patients who attended a public healthcare structure during the November 2015 Grand Magal.
Result
Data were collected on a total of 32,229 healthcare contacts. The most frequent reasons for consultation were trauma, followed by fatigue and heatstroke. Infectious diseases were also prevalent with, notably, a high rate of febrile systemic illnesses and malaria, diarrheal diseases, and respiratory tract infections. Such results are likely to be linked to overcrowding and climatic conditions, the relative lack of sanitary facilities, and limited medical resources available during the event.
Conclusion
The context of the Grand Magal MG is unique, given its location in a tropical developing country and its international component which may favor the globalization of locally endemic diseases. As such, it warrants investment in modern methods for public health surveillance and planning of the event."

Immunocompromised and chronically ill travellers (ICCITs) are susceptible to travel related diseases. In ICCITs, pre-travel care regarding vaccinations and prophylactics is complex. We evaluated the protection level by preventive measures in ICCITs by analysing rates of vaccination protection, antibody titres, and the prescription of standby antibiotics.
Methods
We analysed, and reported according to STROBE guidelines, pre-travel care data for ICCITs visiting the medical pre-travel clinic at the Academic Medical Centre, The Netherlands from 2011 to 2016.
Results
We analysed 2104 visits of 1826 ICCITs. Mean age was 46.6 years and mean travel duration 34.5 days. ICCITs on immunosuppressive treatment (29.7%), HIV (17.2%) or diabetes mellitus (10.2%) comprised the largest groups. Most frequently visited countries were Suriname, Indonesia, and Ghana. Most vaccination rates were >90%. Of travellers in high need of hepatitis A and B protection, 56.6 and 75.7%, underwent titre assessments, respectively. Of ICCITs with a respective indication, 50.6% received a prescription for standby antibiotics.
Conclusion
Vaccination rates in our study population were overall comparable to those of healthy travellers studied previously in our centre. However, regarding antibody titre assessments and prescription of standby antibiotics, this study demonstrates that uniform pre-travel guidelines for ICCITs are highly needed."

Geographical information systems (GIS) have been demonstrated earlier to be of great use to inform public health action against vector-borne infectious diseases.
Methods
Using surveillance data on the ongoing ZIKV outbreak from Pereira, Colombia (2015–2016), we estimated incidence rates (cases/100,000 population), and developed maps correlating with the ecoepidemiology of the area.
Results
Up to October 8, 2016, 439 cases of ZIKV were reported in Pereira (93 cases/100,000 pop.), with highest rates in the South-West area. At the corregiments (sub-municipalities) of Pereira, Caimalito presented the highest rate. An urban area, Cuba, has 169 cases/100,000 pop., with a low economical level and the highest Aedic index (9.1%). Entomological indexes were associated with ZIKV incidence at simple and multiple non-linear regressions (r2 > 0.25; p < 0.05).
Conclusions
Combining entomological, environmental, human population density, travel patterns and case data of vector-borne infections, such as ZIKV, leads to a valuable tool that can be used to pinpoint hotspots also for infections such as dengue, chikungunya and malaria. Such a tool is key to planning mosquito control and the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases in local populations. Such data also enable microepidemiology and the prediction of risk for travelers who visit specific areas in a destination country."

Chronic Inflammatory Rheumatism (CIR) is one of the recognized and increasingly reported consequence post-chikungunya infection (pCHIK) in Colombia and Latin America.
Methods
Retrospective cohort study of 128 patients with CHIK that persisted with pCHIK-CIR after 59–68 weeks (1.13–1.31 years). This information was evaluated by means of a telephone survey and according to validated criteria (WHO 2015) previously (patients with >12 weeks post-CHIK with ≥1 manifestations [continuous/recurrent]: chronic polyarthralgia [pCHIK-CPA], stiffness and/or joint edema).
Results
Of the total CHIK-infected subjects finally included (n = 65), 28 (43.1%) reported pCHIK-CPA; and 38 patients (58.5%) at least one persistent rheumatological symptoms over the last year (pCHIK-CIR); 38.5% of them, morning stiffness, 18.5% joint edema, and 3.1% joint redness. No significant sex differences were found; 60% of patients with pCHIK-CPA aged> 40 years (RR = 3.75; 95%CI 1.47–9.53). The 29.2% of patients required medical attention because of symptoms.
Conclusions
Nearly half of patients with CHIK had at least one rheumatologic symptom persistent over a year, and the third of them, pCHIK-CPA. These results are comparable with previous estimates obtained in other cohorts in the country (Risaralda and Sucre) and are consistent with results from other studies in France and India."

The annual Hajj and Umrah are one of the largest recurring religious mass gatherings across the globe drawing pilgrims from more than 185 countries. The living circumstances and activities of the pilgrims may create an environment for the occurrence and spread of communicable diseases. Each year, the Health authority of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in coordination with international health authorities, updates health requirements for pilgrims. The Hajj for 2017 took place from August 24 to September 5, 2017. Here, we review the expected obligations for immunizations for the 2018 Hajj and Umrah.
Results
The Hajj and Umrah vaccine requirements include mandatory vaccinations against yellow fever, quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide (every 3 years) or conjugated (every 5 years) vaccines and poliomyelitis vaccine. Influenza vaccine utilizing the 2016 (Southern Hemisphere vaccine to all pilgrims) was recommended but was not obligatory for pilgrims. Ciprofloxacin is required for individuals >12 years excluding pregnant women as chemoprophylaxis to be given at the port of entry for Pilgrims coming from the meningitis belt. With the ongoing outbreaks of measles in Europe, it is recommended that all pilgrims have an updated immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles and mumps).
Conclusion
The mandatory vaccines remain the same with continued vigilance for the development of any new or emerging infectious diseases. Continuing surveillance for Zika virus, cholera and MERS-CoV are ongoing."

The aim of this study was to determine the presence of carbapenem resistance and carbapenemase production in Escherichia coli isolates from clinical samples in Turkey.
Methods
The prospective study included a total of 4.052 Escherichia coli isolates collected from patients admitted to a hospital from March 2011 to May 2012. We used ertapenem disc for screening carbapenemase production, and the confirmation was performed by using Etest. The resistance mechanisms and genetic relatedness of the carbapenem resistant strains were investigated by using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), respectively.
Results
Among the 4.052 E. coli isolates, 24 (0.59%) were found to be carbapenem resistant. Of these, only 5 isolates were positive for OXA-48 and 2 isolates were positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-2. The KPC-2 producing E. coli strains (n = 2) were both isolated from the same patient. The blaKPC genes were confirmed using DNA sequence analysis. The genetic relationship between the 24 E. coli strains studied by PFGE revealed that the strains were genetically unrelated.
Conclusions
This article confirms, to our knowledge for the first time, the detection of KPC-2-producing E. coli in Turkey, with OXA-48 being the most frequent carbapenemase in the study."

Cases of leprosy evaluated at a referral centre are described and salient features of autochthonous and imported cases are compared. A review of the literature on imported leprosy was performed.
Results
During the study period, 25 patients with leprosy were followed-up (10 were autochthonous cases and 15 were considered to be imported). Regarding imported cases, the majority were diagnosed in Latin American immigrants (10/15, 67%), mean age was 42 years, there were no differences in gender distribution, estimated average time from arrival in Spain to first visit at the unit was 3 years and from symptom onset to diagnosis was 2 years. Over 80% of imported cases had multibacillary disease and over one third of patients had been previously diagnosed with leprosy. One third had received alternate incorrect diagnoses initially, <50% of patients with imported leprosy completed standard therapy and were considered cured and over one third were lost to follow-up.
Conclusions
Leprosy remains a complex disease for healthcare professionals unfamiliar with this infection. Manifestations are polymorphic so misdiagnoses and consequent delays in diagnosis are not infrequent and may lead to resulting disabilities. Early diagnosis and management are essential to prevent sequelae and possible transmission. Improving access to health care, especially for vulnerable groups, would be necessary to advance in the control of this disease."

Traveller's diarrhoea (TD) is the most common infectious problem for travellers, and we lack effective ways of preventing it, apart from antibiotic prophylaxis. This study aims to quantify the risk reduction of a hypothetic TD vaccine Norwegian travellers are willing to pay for.
Methods
1204 clients at Reiseklinikken responded to a questionnaire asking what level of effectiveness would be required of a hypothetical vaccine against TD costing US$65.
Results
18.7% of the respondents would buy the vaccine even if it was only 20% effective. Among respondents older than 50 years, the proportion was 28.8%.
Conclusions
Our findings should encourage the development of vaccines and other preventive measures against travellers' diarrhoea."

Analyze the impact of educational level, negative beliefs and negative attitudes on the yellow fever vaccination coverage (YFVC).
Methodology
This analytical study involved a sample of 2763 people from 866 households. Educational status was described in six levels: No level (Respondent had never attended school), level-1 (respondent left before intermediate school), level-2 (Respondent attended intermediate school), level-3 (respondent attended high school), level-4 (Respondent attended university), Other level (When the level could not be determined). The Attitude towards vaccination was described in terms of person's availability to recommend vaccination to third. The relationships were analyzed by multivariate mixed logistic regression.
Results
Among the 2763 peoples, 2039 (73.8%) were vaccinated against yellow fever. People who left high school with or without the French baccalaureate were more likely to be vaccinated against YF than people without any diploma (OR = 1.4; p < 0.05). The probability of being vaccinated among people with negative attitudes was reduced by 40% (OR = 0.6; p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Low level of education, negative beliefs and negative attitudes have significant impacts on YFVC. Negatives beliefs and attitudes result often from a major lack of information about the benefits of vaccination. This deficit is exacerbated in persons with low educational level."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The association between the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and immigration is rarely studied, particularly for the immigrants crossing to the resettlement countries. Most of the published data are confined to those immigrants who were resident in European countries and rarely immigrated before they reach the final destination. Libya is a large country in North Africa with the longest coast of the Mediterranean Sea facing the European Union. It has been considered as the main transient station for African immigrants to Europe. The objectives of this study were to determine: (1) the prevalence of HCV in African immigrants gathered in Libya from different African countries on their way to Europe and (2) HCV genotype distribution in these immigrants and its correlation with different demographic factors.
Methods
A total of 14 205 serum samples were collected in a 3-year period (2013–2015) from different immigrants from North and sub-Saharan Africa who resided in the African immigrant campus, Tripoli, Libya. The participants were interviewed, and relevant information was collected, including socio-demographic, ethnic, and geographic variables. Each serum sample was tested for anti-HCV antibody using ELISA. The genotypes were determined and assigned using a specific genotyping assay and correlated with demographic and potential risk factors of the recruited individuals.
Results
Of the immigrants studied, 1078 (7.6%) were positive for HCV. The prevalence of HCV infection ranged from 1.4% to 18.7%; it was higher among individuals arriving from Nile river (3.6–18.7%) of North Africa, followed by those who arrived from the West African region (2.1–14.1%), Horn of Africa (HOA, 6.8–9.9%), and Maghreb countries (1.4–2.7%). The relative risk factor attributable to gender variation was not significant (95% Cl: 0.8513–1.2381). Five genotypes were detected in 911 African immigrants. Genotypic analysis showed that the predominant HCV genotypes in this group were genotypes 4, 1, and 2 that accounted for 329 (36.1%), 326 (35.8%), and 131 (14.4%) strains, respectively, followed by genotype 3 that accounted for 87 (9.5%) strains. Genotype 5 was isolated mainly from 18 HOA (2%) and 20 West African (2.2%) individuals.
Conclusions
The prevalence of HCV is considered high with a unique disparate distribution among African immigrants crossing to Europe. This indicated that the prevalence of HCV is high among these immigrants and thus may be reflected on the HCV prevalence in the guest countries. The broad genetic heterogeneity of HCV genotypes detected here may impact the efficacy of prevention and control efforts for HCV in both Europe and North and sub-Saharan Africa; hence, an integrated global policy of actions is needed."

Background
International travel is considered a risk for colonisation with extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE). To our knowledge, no studies to date have focused on ESBL-PE colonisation among long-term business travellers. Therefore this study aimed to clarify the characteristics associated with ESBL-PE colonisation in Japanese long-term business travellers.
Methods
Japanese business travellers planning to stay abroad for ≥6 months were enrolled. Of the 192 travellers, 135 provided only post-travel stool samples and 57 provided both pre- and post-travel stool samples. Additionally, microbiological analyses of ESBL-PE strains, including susceptibility tests and polymerase chain reaction amplification of CTX-M genes and their sequencing were performed.
Results
A post-travel survey showed that of the 55 travellers (40.7%) who tested positive for ESBL-PE after travel, the highest proportion was travellers returning from East and Central Asia. CTX-M gene analyses showed that CTX-M-15 was the most frequently observed (55.0%). A pre- and post-travel survey showed that of the 22 travellers (44.9%) acquired ESBL-PE during their travel, with acquisition most frequently observed in travellers returning from South Asia.
Conclusion
Risk-based evaluations of ESBL-PE colonisation should be performed not only for regular tourists but also for long-term business travellers."

The presence of large number of pilgrims during Hajj in Makkah region increases the risk of respiratory diseases. In this study, we aimed to assess the bacteriology of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) during Hajj season and to demonstrate the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns that should guide the clinicians towards more appropriate antibiotic use.
Methods
Patients with ARS presenting during Hajj season of 2014 were prospectively enrolled. According to EPOS2012 criteria. Sampling of sinus secretions was performed from the middle meatus adjacent to the maxillary sinus ostium via endoscopic guidance. Over all, the study has covered all ENT, emergency and outpatient departments in Hajj.
Results
Two hundred and twenty six patients with ARS were enrolled in the study. Pathogenic bacteria were identified in 93 (41.2%) patients. Of the 93 patients with bacterial ARS, Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 46 (49.5%) patients, out of which 13 (28.3%) were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).The second most common group of bacterial isolates was Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli, and various Klebsiella species. Antibiotic sensitivity showed that methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) was also sensitive to cephalosporins, quinolones and clindamycin, while exhibiting relatively less sensitivity rates to amoxicillin-clavulinic acid and macrolides.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrates the importance of assessing the bacteriology of ARS to help implement guidelines for proper treatment and prevention protocols during Hajj season."

Background
The Boston Area Travel Medicine Network surveyed travelers on travel-related health problems.
Methods
Travelers were recruited 2009–2011 during pre-travel consultation at three clinics. The investigation included pre-travel data, weekly during-travel diaries, and a post-travel questionnaire. We analyzed demographics, trip characteristics, health problems experienced, and assessed the relationship between influenza vaccination, influenza prevention advice, and respiratory symptoms.
Results
Of 987 enrolled travelers, 628 (64%) completed all surveys, of which 400 (64%) reported health problems during and/or after travel; median trip duration was 12 days. Diarrhea affected the most people during travel (172) while runny/stuffy nose affected the most people after travel (95). Of those with health problems during travel, 25% stopped or altered plans; 1% were hospitalized. After travel, 21% stopped planned activities, 23% sought physician or other health advice; one traveler was hospitalized. Travelers who received influenza vaccination and influenza prevention advice had lower rates of respiratory symptoms than those that received influenza prevention advice alone (18% vs 28%, P = 0.03).
Conclusions
A large proportion of Boston-area travelers reported health problems despite pre-travel consultation, resulting in inconveniences. The combination of influenza prevention advice and influenza immunization was associated with fewer respiratory symptoms than those who received influenza prevention advice alone."

In 2013, 200 million tourists visited countries that are endemic for hepatitis B virus (HBV). Backpackers are potentially at greater risk of hepatitis B than other travellers yet exposure to HBV remains under researched in this population.
Method
A cross-sectional survey of backpackers visiting two islands in Thailand was performed during early 2015. Participation in activities with high HBV exposure risk was recorded, alongside rates of vaccination and an evaluation of knowledge and attitudes towards the risk of HBV.
Results
1680 questionnaires were completed and analysed; the median participant age was 24 (range: 18–68) and 47.9% were male. 20.8% took part in activities with a high risk of HBV exposure. Over two-thirds of the sample were not protected against HBV. 24% were able to correctly identify HBV transmission methods. 44.1% underestimated the risk of HBV in Thailand.
Conclusions
The proportion of backpackers participating in high-risk activities was double the level found in previous studies that have examined the HBV exposure risk amongst travellers to endemic countries. Voluntary risk activities were the largest source of potential exposure to HBV and rates of vaccination are low. Backpackers should be considered for routine vaccination and education on risk behaviours should be included in the pre-travel consultation."

Background
The UK deployed a task force to Sierra Leone to assist in ending the 2014/15 Ebola outbreak. Malaria protection was based on existing Defence Policy which saw a wide range of bite prevention measures deployed. Atovaquone/Proguanil (“A/P”), Doxycycline (“D”) and Mefloquine (“M”) were the chemoprophylactic medications that were prescribed. A survey was undertaken to audit the Adverse Effect (AE) burden experienced by the population.
Method
A questionnaire based survey was administered that sought information on individuals' experiences with malaria chemoprophylaxis.
Results
337 personnel were eligible to take part and 151 (46.3%) individuals returned questionnaires. The reported AE rates for the three drugs were “A/P” 28% of the respondents, “D” 25% and “M” 23.1%. 24 individuals (15.9%) reported 1 AE while 34 (22.5%) reported multiple AEs. Eight (5.3%) individuals changed medication (Five “A/P”, two “M” and one “D”) because of unacceptable AE but no significant neuro/psychological conditions were reported. The malaria attack rate for the deployed population was 0.4 cases per thousand person weeks which is very low when compared to other military deployments to the West African Area.
Conclusion
UK Defence policy is effective in the way it balances the risk of malaria with that of AE due to chemoprophylaxis. “M” remains an acceptable chemoprophylactic agent for a section of the population."

abstract = "Summary
Looking at the worldwide emergency of antimicrobial resistance, international travellers appear to have a central role in spreading the bacteria across the globe. Travellers' diarrhoea (TD) is the most common disease encountered by visitors to the (sub)tropics. Both TD and its treatment with antibiotics have proved significant independent risk factors of colonization by resistant intestinal bacteria while travelling. Travellers should therefore be given preventive advice regarding TD and cautioned about taking antibiotics: mild or moderate TD does not require antibiotics. Logical alternatives are medications with effects on gastrointestinal function, such as loperamide. The present review explores literature on loperamide in treating TD. Adhering to manufacturer's dosage recommendations, loperamide offers a safe and effective alternative for relieving mild and moderate symptoms. Moreover, loperamide taken singly does no predispose to contracting MDR bacteria. Most importantly, we found no proof that would show antibiotics to be significantly more effective than loperamide in treating mild/moderate TD."

Post-artesunate delayed haemolysis is described as hemolytic anemia presenting days after malaria treatment in hyperparasitemic patients. Physiopathological mechanisms and clinical manifestations have not been thoroughly characterised.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective study of hospitalised malaria patients who received artemisinin derivatives from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015.
Results
21 patients were included in the study: 11 travellers, 8 travellers visiting friends and relatives and 2 immigrants. Median age was 35.5 years (IQR: 25.7–44.8) and 11 were men. Eight patients received oral and 13 received intravenous (IV) artemisinin-based drugs. Follow-up after the malaria episode was available for 15 patients (12 with IV treatment). Four patients presented with delayed haemolysis 9–14 days after artesunate treatment; all had been admitted with severe malaria, were treated IV and had hyperparasitaemia (17%–33%). Other than hyperparasitaemia, no other factors were associated with artesunate haemolysis. Patients' outcomes were favourable and the only additional therapeutic measure needed was a blood transfusion.
Conclusions
Delayed haemolysis is a frequent complication in hyperparasitemic malaria treated with IV artesunate. Follow-up is mandatory for at least 2 weeks after treatment initiation. This condition is potentially severe but does not appear to be life threatening."

Background
A case control study to better characterize the clinical features, laboratory, and radiological abnormalities associated with MERS-CoV infection in order to help with early identification of this syndrome from other respiratory infections.
Methods
Eighty patients admitted to a hospital in Riyadh, diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection based on RT-PCR were matched on age, sex, and the presence of a co-morbid condition on a basis of 1:2 to other patients admitted with respiratory symptoms and tested negative for MERS-CoV on RT-PCR.
Results
None of the reported MERS-CoV presenting symptoms was significantly associated with being infected with MERS-CoV. On the other hand, WBC count was significantly lower in patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection (median 5.7 vs 9.3, P: 0.0004). Neutrophil count was as well significantly lower in MERS-CoV patients (median 3.7 vs 6.7, P: 0.0001). Both AST, and ALT values were significantly higher in MERS-CoV infected group (AST median 42 vs 36, P: 0.03, and ALT median 33 vs 28, P: 0.003). Overall our MERS-CoV mortality rate was (10%) below the national figure of (40%).
Conclusions
None of the presenting symptoms are specific for MERS-CoV infection. And out of all the investigations WBC, neutrophil counts, AST and ALT values have some predictive utility."

abstract = "Background
Acute diarrhea remains a public health concern in armed forces deployed in tropical areas where access to water and soap is limited. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHR) on incidence of diarrhea in poor hygiene conditions.
Method
A prospective randomized trial was conducted between November 2014 and January 2015 among French military troops deployed in Africa to compare a group of soldiers receiving usual hand hygiene recommendations (control group), to a group of soldiers who received ABHR in addition to usual hand hygiene recommendations (intervention group). Data on diarrhea and hygiene behaviors were collected using self-questionnaires. The incidence rate of diarrhea episodes in groups was compared.
Results
Participation rate was 59% (236/400). The proportion of individuals who used ABHR was 97% in the intervention group and 62% in the control group. The overall incidence rate of diarrheal episodes was observed to be in the region of 60 per 100 persons-month without any significant difference between groups after adjustment on confounding factors (p = 0.93). Handwashing with soap was used on average 4 times a day in the control group and twice a day in the intervention group (p = 0.93). It was the only significant protective factor for diarrhea (p < 10−3).
Conclusion
Our results support that supplying soap and good quality water should be a priority on the field."

Background
Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of Skin and Soft Tissue Infections (SSTIs) in the community in the United States of America. Community Health Centers (CHC) serve as primary care providers for thousands of immigrants in New York.
Methods
As part of a research collaborative, 6 New York City-area CHCs recruited patients with SSTIs. Characterization was performed in all S. aureus isolates from wounds and nasal swabs collected from patients. Statistical analysis examined the differences in wound and nasal cultures among immigrant compared to native-born patients.
Results
Wound and nasal specimens were recovered from 129 patients and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. 40 patients were immigrants from 15 different countries. Although not statistically significant, immigrants had lower rates of MRSA infections (n = 15) than did native-born participants, and immigrants showed significantly higher rates of MSSA wound cultures (n = 11) (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.3, 9.7).
Conclusions
In our study, immigrants were more likely to present with SSTIs caused by MSSA than US-born patients. Immigants also reported lower frequencies of antibiotic prescription or consumption in the months prior to SSTI infection. This suggests that antibiotic resistance may vary regionally and that immigrants presenting with SSTIs may benefit from a broader range of antibiotics."

Background
The 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the largest and longest Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in the history, and the virus has escaped across countries and continents via air travel in this outbreak.
Method
The interpolated data from WHO Ebola situation reports were used to estimate number of weekly infectious individuals and daily effective reproduction numbers (Rt) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. A stochastic dynamic model was performed to estimate the risk of EVD importation into the top 20 final destination countries of air travelers departing from within the three epidemic countries, and the effectiveness of air travel restriction was subsequently evaluated.
Results
The daily Rt was estimated at 0.72–1.32 in Guinea, 0.62–1.38 in Liberia and 0.81–1.38 in Sierra Leone. The peak of EVD importation probability was observed in early November 2014 and the restriction of air travel may mitigate the risk up to 67.7% (95% CI 66.6–68.7).
Conclusions
Our results suggest that restriction of air travels is effective in reducing the risk of EVD importation but controlling of the virus at the original affected countries is vitally more important for preventing inter-terrestrial dissemination of EVD."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Cruise ships carry a large number of people in confined spaces providing an environment for transmission of infections. The aim of this study is to estimate the incidence of and describe the spectrum of respiratory infections and gastrointestinal illness among passengers and crew of cruise Ship A.
Material and methods
The study was carried out from January 2011 to December 2013 on cruise Ship A, including passengers and crew who presented with symptoms suggestive of acute respiratory infection (ARI), influenza-like illness (ILI) and gastrointestinal illness (GI). Advice about preventive measures of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections and influenza vaccination was given to passengers and crew. Data were collected by using one standardized form per patient.
Results
The most common destination was Northern Europe (90.7%). The mean duration of cruise was 10.6 days; 440 passengers and 421 crew members who sought medical attention were studied (mean age 72.6 ± 9.5 and 33 ± 7 years, respectively). ILI, ARI and GI were diagnosed in 32.7%, 15.9%, 17% and 10.9%, 80%, 0.2% of ill passengers and crew, respectively. The association of ARI, ILI and GI incidence in passengers was statistically significant with season, destination and duration of travel; the incidence for all illnesses was higher during winter, for travel to South America and for >14 days (p-value<0.001).
Conclusion
ARI, ILI and GI continue to pose a burden on cruise travel; therefore pre-travel advice is crucial for passengers and crew regarding respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Surveillance and implementation of control measures are important for outbreak prevention."

Many isolated populations of tribal peoples were nearly destroyed when they first contacted infectious diseases particularly respiratory pathogens such as measles and smallpox. Surviving groups have often been found to have declining populations in the face of multiple social and infectious threats. Malaria, especially Plasmodium falciparum, was thought to be a major cause of depopulation in some tribal peoples isolated in tropical jungles. The dynamics of such host parasite interactions is unclear especially since most such populations would have had long histories of exposure to malaria. Three groups are individually reviewed: Meruts of Borneo, Yanomami of Amazonia, Jarawas of the Andaman Islands. The purpose of this review is to examine the role of falciparum malaria in the depopulation of some isolated tribal groups in order to understand what measures, if any, would be likely to prevent such losses."

Enteric fever's incidence is decreasing among residents of high-income countries, although it's rising in travelers coming from low-resource endemic settings. The study's aim is to describe epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of patients with enteric fever.
Methods
Retrospective descriptive study of enteric fever cases diagnosed at a Tropical Medicine Unit in Barcelona, 1993–2012.
Results
Out of 40 patients, 31(77,5%) were returning travelers, and 70% of them had been in Southern Asia. In the rest of patients without an antecedent of a recent travel, the infection occurred mainly before year 2000. The more frequently reported symptoms were fever and diarrhea, lacking significant differences between S. typhi and S. paratyphi infections. Quinolones were used as empiric treatment in 47.2% of patients, 36.1% received 3rd generation cephalosporins, 2.78% azithromycin and 13.89% other combinations. Resistance to quinolones in the S. paratyphi group (66.7%) was significantly higher compared with the S. typhi group (20%) (p:0.02). 22.5% of patients had treatment failure and 23.6% patients presented complications, none of them had been previously vaccinated.
Conclusions
The diagnosis of enteric fever was more frequent among travelers coming from Southern-East Asia. Quinolone resistance is widely spread, particularly in S. paratyphi serotypes and should not be considered as first choice treatment anymore."

Background
The number of international travellers is increasing worldwide. Although health risks related to international travel are important and generally well-understood, the perception of these risks was unclear among Turkish travellers. We aimed to evaluate the attitudes and health risk awareness of Turkish travellers travelling to African countries.
Method
A survey was performed of Turkish travellers bound for Africa from Istanbul International Ataturk Airport in July 2013.
Results
A total of 124 travellers were enrolled in the study. Among them, 62.9% had information about their destination but only 11.3% had looked for information on health problems related to travel and their destination. Of all travellers, 53.2% had at least one vaccination before travelling. The most commonly administered vaccine was for typhoid. Among the travellers, 69.3% and 80.6% had “no idea” about yellow fever vaccination and malaria prophylaxis, respectively. A positive correlation was found between a higher level of travellers' education and receiving the recommended vaccination for the destination.
Conclusions
Our study revealed significant gaps in the vaccination and chemoprophylaxis uptake of Turkish travellers departing to Africa. An awareness and training program should be developed for travellers, as well as public health workers, to address health risks related to travel."

Background
This study established trends in major infectious disease mortality in British merchant shipping from 1900 to 2010 as compared with the British male working population and the Royal Navy.
Methods
A population mortality study of six infectious diseases using annual government mortality returns and death inquiry files for British merchant shipping and the Royal Navy, and official mortality data for the general male working aged population.
Findings
Relative mortality risks for each disease were increased significantly in British merchant shipping when compared with the general population; malaria by 58.2 fold, yellow fever (6276), typhoid (9.5), cholera (1734), dysentery (20.6) and smallpox (142). For all six diseases combined, relative mortality risks were 21.5 compared with the general population and 3.5 compared with the Royal Navy. Mortality trend patterns varied between diseases, but reductions in mortality in British merchant shipping consistently lagged many years behind those in both the British general population and the Royal Navy.
Conclusions
Merchant seamen were at far higher risk of death than probably any other occupational group of the population. Much of these excess risks came from exposure to infection in unhygienic and tropical ports, although some was a result of neglect of feasible preventative measures."

Background
Medical tourism, where patients travel abroad intentionally to access medical treatment, is a growing trend. Some of these patients travel to undergo organ transplantation. This study aims to quantify the number of UK patients who undergo liver transplantation abroad, assessing their motivations and management.
Methods
Questionnaires were sent to all seven UK liver transplant units enquiring about liver patients receiving transplant abroad. Included were questions on destination, motivation, and pre and post-transplant care.
Results
Responses were received from six of the seven transplant centres (86%). A total of 12 patients were identified as having undergone liver transplantation overseas. The top destinations were India, China and Egypt. Four units responded to questions regarding pre-transplant screening. One unit reported Hepatitis B and C screening not taking place. Four units responded to questions regarding post-transplant antimicrobial therapy. This revealed examples of patients inappropriately not receiving valganciclovir, co-trimoxazole, anti-fungal treatment and Hepatitis B immunoglobulins.
Conclusions
UK patients are undergoing liver transplant abroad, albeit in small numbers. Pre and post-transplant management of these patients is of a lower standard than that provided to those undergoing transplantation in the UK. Information transfer between overseas and UK based transplant teams is poor."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Brucella spp. prosthetic joint infections are infrequently reported in the literature, particularly in returning travellers, and optimal treatment is unknown.
Method
We describe a prosthetic joint infection (PJI) caused by Brucella melitensis in a traveller returning to the UK from Thailand, which we believe to be the first detailed report of brucellosis in a traveller returning from this area. The 23 patients with Brucella-related PJI reported in the literature are summarised, together with our case.
Results
The diagnosis of Brucella-related PJI is difficult to make; only 30% of blood cultures and 75% of joint aspiration cultures were positive in the reported cases. Culture of intraoperative samples provides the best diagnostic yield. In the absence of radiological evidence of joint loosening, combination antimicrobial therapy alone may be appropriate treatment in the first instance; this was successful in 6/7 [86%] of patients, though small numbers of patients and the likelihood of reporting bias warrant caution in drawing any firm conclusions about optimal treatment. Aerosolisation of synovial fluid during joint aspiration procedures and nosocomial infection has been described.
Conclusions
Brucella-related PJI should be considered in the differential of travellers returning from endemic areas with PJI, including Thailand. Personal protective equipment including fit tested filtering face piece-3 (FFP3) mask or equivalent is recommended for personnel carrying out joint aspiration when brucellosis is suspected. Travellers can reduce the risk of brucellosis by avoiding unpasteurised dairy products and animal contact (particularly on farms and abattoirs) in endemic areas and should be counselled regarding these risks as part of their pre-travel assessment."

Aim
To review the current state of knowledge concerning rickettsiae and rickettsioses in Croatia and to discuss their implications for travellers.
Methods
The PubMed database was searched from 1991 to 2015 by combining the words “rickettsia,” “rickettsiosis”, “travellers” and “Croatia”.
Results
Since 1969, Croatia appears to be free of epidemic typhus (ET) caused by Rickettsia prowazekii and the last case of Brill-Zinsser disease was recorded in 2008. Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) caused by Rickettsia conorii is the most frequent human rickettsial infection in Croatia, followed by murine typhus caused by Rickettsia typhi. Human cases of MSF and murine typhus have been predominantly observed along the eastern Adriatic coast from Zadar to Dubrovnik and between Zadar and Split, respectively. Rickettsia akari, etiologic agent of rickettsialpox, was isolated from blood of a patient diagnosed with MSF in Zadar, but no cases of rickettsialpox were reported. Several species of pathogenic (Rickettsia slovaca, Rickettsia aeschlimannii, Ricketsia helvetica, and Ricketsia raoultii) and species of undetermined pathogenicity (Ricketsia hoogstraalii sp. nov.) rickettsiae were identified in ticks collected in different ecological regions of Croatia. A search of the literature revealed no evidence of rickettsial infection in travellers visiting Croatia. Three imported cases of Rickettsia africae were observed in travellers returning from South Africa.
Conclusion
Rickettsiae and rickettsial diseases continue to be present in Croatia. As they can be acquired while travelling, physicians should consider rickettsial infection in the differential diagnosis of patients returning from Croatia and presenting with febrile illness."

abstract = "Background
Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL) infections are increasing in both adults and children. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of children with ESBL in an ethnically-diverse population, to determine what proportion of these infections were community-onset, and to identify risk factors predisposing children to ESBL acquisition.
Methods
A case-case-control study of children aged 0–18 years was conducted from 2012 to 2014. Patients with ESBL (detected via VITEK2) were matched 1:1:5 (based on age, sex, specimen source, and healthcare setting) with non-ESBL and uninfected controls. Data on prior antibiotic and healthcare exposure, international travel, prior urinary tract infection (UTI), comorbid gastrointestinal (GI), genitourinary (GU), neurologic, and immunocompromising conditions were collected and compared.
Results
Seventy-six patients were identified with 85 ESBL infections, of which 77 (91%) were E. coli. ESBL was isolated most frequently from urine (n = 72, 85%). Most infections were community-onset (n = 76, 89%) and were managed in the ambulatory setting (n = 47, 62%). On multivariate analysis, international travel (p < 0.001, OR 8.93; CI 2.92–27.78), comorbid GI condition (p = 0.002, OR 2.65, CI 1.36–5.15), Asian race (p = 0.005, OR 2.56, CI 1.34–4.89) and prior UTI (p < 0.001, OR 8.06, CI 3.47–18.87) were significant risk factors for ESBL.
Conclusion
Most ESBL infections in this study were community-onset. To our knowledge, this is the first description of international travel as a risk factor for ESBL acquisition in children in the United States."

Background
Increasing numbers of confirmed cases of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection resulting from non-mosquito-borne transmission have been reported.
Methods
We performed a systematic literature review (PRISMA guidelines) on intrauterine, intrapartum, sexual and animal bite ZIKV transmission. The presence of the virus in breast milk, urine, saliva and blood transfusions was also reviewed.
Results
The search resulted in 285 papers of possible relevance, of which we included 53 in the systematic review. Mother-to-child transmission was most frequently described with adverse infant outcomes including microcephaly, intracranial calcification and fetal death. Zika virus RNA has been detected in amniotic fluid, breast milk, seminal fluid, saliva, urine and blood. Semen and blood products have proved to be infectious. Male-to-female and male-to-male ZIKV transmission is documented. There are contradictory results concerning the infectiousness of breast milk and urine and data on saliva, animal bites, transplantation, needlestick injury and laboratory work are inconclusive.
Conclusions
Our systematic analysis shows that non-vector-borne ZIKV transmission plays a role in the spread of ZIKV and has great societal impact. It has important public health implications for the prevention and control of ZIKV globally and will be a basis for policy and further research."

We evaluated the performance of stool microscopy, serology, and real time PCR (qPCR) for the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis at our reference laboratory.
Methods
Using a convenience sample of specimens submitted between April 1, 2014 and May 31, 2015, positivity rates and performance characteristics were calculated.
Results
During the enrolment period, 17,933 stool specimens were examined for O&P, 14 of which were positive for Strongyloides larvae. For stool specimens serially positive for larvae, mean duration of larval shedding was 12.7 days following the initial positive specimen, while for sputum and urine, it was 12 and 2 days, respectively. During the enrolment period, 3258 specimens were processed for Strongyloides serology, 200 of which were reactive (6.1%), 210 indeterminate (6.5%), and 2848 non-reactive (87.4%). qPCR was positive in 11 of 12 (91.7%) stool specimens containing larvae, and negative in all stool specimens without larvae by microscopy. There was no cross-reactivity of Strongyloides-specific qPCR to other stool protozoa or helminths.
Conclusions
In the absence of immunosuppression, larval burden in strongyloidiasis is low, limiting the utility of microscopy, and favoring serologic testing. However, false negative serology can occur in those with hyperinfection necessitating a combined diagnostic approach. qPCR was insufficiently sensitive to replace microscopy for detection of larvae."

Although infections represent the most common health problem of travellers abroad, data on morbidity and incidences of various infections are scarce.
Method
Data on infections of Finnish travellers during 2010–2012 were retrieved from the database of SOS International, an assistance organization covering 95% of Finns requiring aid abroad. The study included 30,086 cases. For incidence calculation, the data were linked to the numbers of Finns visiting these regions during the same period as recorded by the Official Statistics of Finland.
Results
The incidence of infections was particularly high in Africa, southern Europe plus the eastern Mediterranean, and Asia plus Oceania. The most frequent diagnoses were acute gastroenteritis (38.0%) and respiratory-tract infections (RTI) (34.5%), followed by infections of the ear (12.6%), skin or subcutaneous tissue (5.1%), urogenital tract (4.2%), eye (3.1%), and systemic febrile infections (2.2%). Vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) accounted for 0.8% of cases, with varicella as most (49%) and influenza as second-most (27%) common.
Conclusions
Incidence of infections was higher in southern than in eastern and western Europe. Gastroenteritis and RTI proved the most frequent diagnoses, whereas systemic febrile infections were uncommon. Despite pre-travel immunizations, VPDs still occurred; pre-travel consultation should cover both varicella and influenza."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In June 2014, the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus (CHIKV) emerged in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI), a location where tourists comprise the majority of the population during peak season (January–April). Limited information is available concerning visitors' CHIKV awareness and prevention measures.
Methods
We surveyed a convenience sample of Virgin Islands National Park visitors aged ≥18 years. Respondents completed a questionnaire assessing CHIKV knowledge, attitudes, and practices; health information-seeking practices; and demographics.
Results
Of 783 persons contacted, 443 (57%) completed the survey. Fewer than half (208/441 [47%]) were aware of CHIKV. During trip preparation, 28% of respondents (126/443) investigated USVI-specific health concerns. Compared with persons unaware of CHIKV, CHIKV-aware persons were more likely to apply insect repellent (134/207 [65%] versus 111/231 [48%]; p < 0.001), wear long-sleeves and long pants (84/203 [41%] versus 57/227 [25%]; p < 0.001), and wear insect repellent-treated clothing (36/204 [18%] versus 22/227 [10%]; p = 0.02).
Conclusions
The majority of visitors surveyed did not research destination-related health concerns and were unaware of CHIKV. However, CHIKV awareness was associated with using multiple prevention measures to reduce disease risk. These findings underscore the importance of providing tourists with disease education upon destination arrival."

Background
Dengue fever is a frequent cause of morbidity in travellers. The objective was to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of dengue fever in Czech travellers.
Method
This descriptive study includes patients with acute dengue fever diagnosed at Hospital Na Bulovce during 2004–2013. Data were collected and analysed retrospectively.
Results
A total of 132 patients (83 males and 49 females) of median age 33 years (IQR 29–40) were included. Diagnosis was established by NS1 antigen detection in 87/107 cases (81.3%) and/or RT-PCR in 50/72 (69.4%) and by serology in 25 cases (18.9%). Dengue was acquired in South-East Asia in 69 cases (52.3%), followed by South Asia (48 cases; 36.3%), Latin America (14; 10.6%) and Sub-Saharan Africa (1; 0.8%). The most frequent symptoms included fever, rash and headache. Initial leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were lower in patients who presented in the early phase (0–4 days), however, platelet count was lower and AST, ALT and LDH activity higher in patients with a longer symptoms duration (≥5 days). The clinical course was mostly uncomplicated.
Conclusions
Dengue fever is becoming a frequent cause of fever in Czech travellers. Clinicians should be familiar with the typical clinical findings and novel diagnostic methods."

abstract = "Summary
Numerous studies in the past have stressed the importance of travelers' psychology and perception in the implementation of preventive measures. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the methodologies used in studies reporting on travelers' risk perception of infectious diseases. A systematic search for relevant literature was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. There were 39 studies identified. In 35 of 39 studies, the methodology used was that of a knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) survey based on questionnaires. One study used a combination of questionnaires and a visual psychometric measuring instrument called the ‘pictorial representation of illness and self-measurement” or PRISM. One study used a self-representation model (SRM) method. Two studies measured psychosocial factors. Valuable information was obtained from KAP surveys showing an overall lack of knowledge among travelers about the most frequent travel-associated infections and associated preventive measures. This methodological approach however, is mainly descriptive, addressing knowledge, attitudes, and practices separately and lacking an examination of the interrelationships between these three components. Another limitation of the KAP method is underestimating psychosocial variables that have proved influential in health related behaviors, including perceived benefits and costs of preventive measures, perceived social pressure, perceived personal control, unrealistic optimism and risk propensity. Future risk perception studies in travel medicine should consider psychosocial variables with inferential and multivariate statistical analyses. The use of implicit measurements of attitudes could also provide new insights in the field of travelers’ risk perception of travel-associated infectious diseases."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The annual Muslim pilgrimage attracts over two million pilgrims who gather in a limited time and space. The pilgrimage carries the potential risk of increase risk of the acquisition of Streptococcus pneumonia. In this cohort study, we evaluate the effect of the Hajj on the prevalence of pneumococcal serotype nasopharyngeal carriage in the Hajj pilgrim population. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effects of the mass gathering on carriage of invasive pneumococcal serotypes.
Methods
This is a prospective cohort study with two data collection periods: at the beginning and at the end of the Hajj. Nasopharyngeal samples were taken via a standardized swabbing method.
Results
A total of 1175 pilgrims were enrolled at the beginning of the study and 1155 (98.3%) were included at the second part of the study. The pre-Hajj samples were obtained at a mean of 0 days and the post-Hajj sampling occurred at a mean of 15 days after arrival to Saudi Arabia. The overall carriage rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the pre- and post-Hajj was 1.8% and 7.1% (P = 0.0016). The potential coverage of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), PCV10 and PCV13 were 15.5%, 19.1%; and 35.5%, respectively. The coverage for the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) was 40%.
Conclusion
Although there was an increase in the acquisition of S. pneumoniae, its magnitude is low which does not support public health recommendations for general pneumococcal vaccination of pilgrims except those at risk."

Background
Health threats during mass gatherings, such as the FIFA world cup 2014 differ from traditional health risks. The influence of event type, demographics of attendees and environmental conditions are still not fully understood.
Methods
An observational, prospective case–control survey conducted at the Frankfurt international airport in Germany on 544 travelers to the FIFA world cup 2014 and 432 regular travelers to Brazil departing after the end of the world cup.
Results
Travelers to the FIFA world cup 2014 were predominantly male whereas the gender distribution in the control group was more balanced. The majority in both groups obtained insect bites and sunburns as environmental risk factors. Every third traveler suffered from diarrheal complaints in both groups, whereas the proportion of travelers with flu-like symptoms was higher in the case group. Travelers to the FIFA world cup 2014 indicated alcohol intake and sexual contacts outside of a relationship more frequently than travelers in the control group.
Conclusions
The additional health risks of travelers to sporting events as the FIFA world cup 2014 should be addressed in addition to traditional health threats in pre-travel counseling for the Summer Olympic Games 2016 in Brazil."

abstract = "Summary
High altitude training is regarded as an integral component of modern athletic preparation, especially for endurance sports such as middle and long distance running. It has rapidly achieved popularity among elite endurance athletes and their coaches. Increased hypoxic stress at altitude facilitates key physiological adaptations within the athlete, which in turn may lead to improvements in sea-level athletic performance. Despite much research in this area to date, the exact mechanisms which underlie such improvements remain to be fully elucidated. This review describes the current understanding of physiological adaptation to high altitude training and its implications for athletic performance. It also discusses the rationale and main effects of different training models currently employed to maximise performance. Athletes who travel to altitude for training purposes are at risk of suffering the detrimental effects of altitude. Altitude illness, weight loss, immune suppression and sleep disturbance may serve to limit athletic performance. This review provides an overview of potential problems which an athlete may experience at altitude, and offers specific training recommendations so that these detrimental effects are minimised."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Brucellosis is the commonest zoonosis worldwide and typically results from ingestion of unpasteurized goat and sheep milk and cheese. Consumption of camel milk is common in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, but is an infrequently reported source of brucellosis.
Methods
We report three immigrant patients seen in one hospital system between 2007 and 2013 with brucellosis due to the consumption of camel milk.
Results
The case patients presented after 3–14 days of symptoms following travel to countries where Brucella is endemic. All three patients were bacteremic. One patient had definite infective endocarditis, one had possible endocarditis and one patient presented with acute brucellosis. The diagnoses were made expeditiously and appropriate treatment initiated.
Conclusions
Knowledge of travel, local customs and immigration patterns are keys to early Brucella diagnosis and optimal treatment. Previous reports implicating camel milk as the source of Brucella infection have been limited to patients living in or traveling to and from the Middle East. This report highlights the acquisition of Brucella infection in travelers to and immigrants from the Horn of Africa related to the consumption of camel milk."

A systematic search for relevant literature was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. 31 studies were identified. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS) were never isolated in Hajj pilgrims. The viruses most commonly isolated from symptomatic patients during the Hajj by PCR were rhinovirus (5.9–48.8% prevalence), followed by influenza virus (4.5–13.9%) and non-MERS coronaviruses (2.7–13.2%) with most infections due to coronavirus 229E; other viruses were less frequently isolated. Several viruses including influenza A, rhinovirus, and non-MERS coronaviruses had low carriage rates among arriving pilgrims and a statistically significant increase in their carriage rate was observed, following participation in the Hajj. Further research is needed to assess the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of respiratory symptoms and their potential role in the severity of the symptoms."

Background
The aim was to assess sexual risk-taking behaviour in a sample of Swedish youth who were sexually active while travelling abroad and to examine possible associations with sexual risk-taking behaviour during such travel.
Methods
From a population-based sample of 2189 Swedes 18–29 years, 768 who were sexually active while abroad, were assessed by a questionnaire concerning socio-demographic background, life-style, travel duration, sexuality, mental health, heavy episodic drinking (HED) and drug-use.
Results
Approximately 1/4 reported intercourse with a casual partner abroad. Casual sex was associated with HED, 18–24 years, and drug use in both sexes, and for women, also with ≥one month of travel. Among youth with casual partners, 48% reported non-condom use. Non-condom use with a casual partner was associated with 18–24 years, ≥one month of travel for women, and poor self-rated mental health for men. About 10% had ≥2 partners abroad. Having ≥2 partners abroad was associated with ≥one month of travel, and for men also with HED.
Conclusion
Male sex, 18–24 years of age, ≥1 month of travel, HED, and drug use were significantly associated with sexual risk-taking during travel abroad. Poor self-rated mental health and foreign-born parentage might also constitute risk factors for men."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Meningococcal meningitis is a serious disease. Travel-associated infection for the general traveller is low; however regular epidemics in indigenous population, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Our aim was to assess meningococcal vaccination for international travellers from Greece.
Methods
A prospective questionnaire-based study was conducted during 2009–2013.
Results
A total of 5283 travellers were studied (median age: 39.2 years); Meningococcal tetravalent vaccine (A,C,W135,Y) was delivered to 1150 (21.8%) of them. Of those who travelled to the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, 73.1% and 21.2% received meningococcal vaccine, respectively. Of those travellers who travelled to sub-Saharan Africa from November to June and from July to October, 22.1% and 20.6% were vaccinated with meningococcal vaccine, respectively. Of all travellers who travelled for <1 month and ≥1 month, 23.3%, and 20.5%, were vaccinated, respectively. Meningococcal vaccine was administered to 95.3% of pilgrims, 17.4% of those visiting friends and relatives (VFRs), 16.7% of those who travelled for recreation, and 13.8% of those who travelled for work. Of travellers who stayed in urban, in rural, and in urban and rural areas, 32%, 11.6% and 12.7% were vaccinated, respectively. Meningococcal vaccine was delivered to 29.2%, 21.1%, 19.4% and 5.1% of those who stayed in hotels, at local people's home, in camps, and on ships, respectively. The association of meningococcal vaccine administration with the destination, duration and purpose of travel, area of stay and type of accommodation was statistically significant.
Conclusion
There is a need to improve meningococcal vaccine recommendations for travellers from Greece, particularly for high risk populations, such as VFRs, business travellers and those visiting sub-Saharan Africa especially during the dry season."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Dengue infection among travelers has become one of the most public health concerns in present days. The importation of dengue virus can initiate an outbreak in non-endemic regions. Thailand is one of the countries topping the list of highest dengue infections in travelers.
Method
This study estimates the risk of dengue infection among travelers during their visit in Thailand by using a mathematical model with seasonal variations.
Results
The risk of dengue infection in high dengue season is 2.50–4.07 times that on low dengue season depending on the locations. The average daily risk of dengue infections of Thailand per 100,000 travelers is 2.14 and 7.03 for low and high dengue season, respectively. The highest rate of infection is Rayong and the lowest rate is Sing Buri. Several popular tourist provinces are high dengue endemic areas.
Conclusions
This study provides useful information on dengue infection among travelers. The main factors are the time of arrival in the year, the duration of stay of the travelers and the locations where the travelers spend most of their time."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Although Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 is the common disease causing serogroup, rare serogroups can also may cause legionellosis. A 54-year-old male patient (index case) reported that he had been on a religious trip (for visiting, tomb of Ali, which is important for Shias) to Iraq with a large group (50 shia pilgrims from Kars city of Turkey) two weeks prior to admission. Due to civil war, the hotel where the patient stayed in Iraq lacked proper hygiene. A large number of people in the travel group were experiencing the same symptoms. Other five cases were 2 males (ages; 50, 45) and 3 females including the wife of the index case (ages; 50, 28, 27).
Method
The detection of L. pneumophila IgG and IgM was performed by anti-L. pneumophila Indirect Immunofluorescent IgM, IgG kit. Legionella 1 biochip/verification BIOCHIP slides were used for serogrouping in Euroimmun AG, Leubeck, Germany.
Results
In index case, L. pneumophila IgM was positive with a titer of 1/32 titer. IgG was negative with a 1/100 titer. Another case (28 year old female), had clinical symptoms identical to the index case. L. pneumophila IgM and IgG were positive with titers of 1/64 and 1/100, respectively. These two cases were diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease caused by L. pneumophila serogroup 12 (index case) and female (28-year-old) by serogroup 11. The other 4 cases were diagnosed with possible Pontiac fever caused by L. pneumophila serogroups 14 (wife of the index case), 4, and 6 whereas the serogroup of L. pneumophila detected in 27 years old female case could not be identified.
Conclusion
A major limitation of this work is the absence of genotyping and the serogroup difference between index case and his wife who shared the same hotel. We suggest that this serogroup difference may be caused by (for men and women) sitting separately in Islamic rules. On the other hand, the movement of people in the context of mutual visits between countries or neighboring countries for tourism-related (i.e., for religious events or visits to holy sites) or immigration-related reasons, may cause some epidemic diseases. This study reemphasized that not only L. pneumophila serogroup 1, but other rare serogroups might cause also legionellosis which may increase in frequency and cause regional epidemics. We propose that increased financial resources for improving the hygiene conditions and performing routine legionella surveillance studies in touristic hotels would be useful measures for legionellosis prevention and control."

abstract = "Summary
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most widespread tick-borne viral infection of humans, occurring across western China through southern Asia, Middle East, and Southeastern Europe (SEE) and in the most of African countries. CCHF virus is maintained through vertical and horizontal transmission in several genera of ticks, mainly in Hyalomma, which spreads the virus to a variety of wild and domestic mammals, which develop a transient viremia without signs of illness. Human infections occur through tick bite or exposure to the blood or other body fluids of an infected animal or of a CCHF patient. In SEE the number of clinical cases of CCHF as well as the areal of the infected ticks continuously rapidly increased after 2000. The aim of this study was to present actual situation of CCHF in SEE. Sources of information include published literature and personal unpublished data.
Conclusions
Based on: 1. Hyaloma's presence in Western EU countries, 2. Changes in climatic conditions and 3. Absence of an active vaccination against CCHF, it can be expected that this disease will continue to present real threat for human health in SEE and Southwestern Europe (SWE)."

abstract = "Summary
Background
About 100 million passengers enter China via Shenzhen ports every year and such huge populations increase the risk of various infectious diseases, particularly mosquito-borne diseases, entering China. This paper reports the testing and monitoring of mosquito-borne diseases in febrile travelers through Shenzhen ports in 2013.
Methods
The blood samples of 619 febrile cases were collected and the serum of each sample was used for the specific gene amplification and IgM antibody detection of five typical mosquito-borne pathogens: Dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and West Nile Virus (WNV). Additionally, malaria was diagnosed by rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs).
Results
In total, 34 cases were detected of DENV infection (serotype I to IV), 17 cases of JEV infection, 2 cases of CHIKV infection, and 3 cases of malaria infection. No virus genes or IgM antibodies of YFV or WNV were detected in the samples. DENV, JEV and CHIKV cases were mainly from Southeast Asia, while malaria cases from Africa.
Conclusions
DENV, JEV and CHIKV were the primary pathogens imported via Shenzhen ports. International travelers with mosquito-borne infections would accelerate the spread of these diseases, thus reinforcing the need for surveillance of mosquito-borne infections at ports should become a high priority."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The recent Ebola epidemic has increased public awareness of the risk of travel associated viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). International preparedness to manage imported cases Ebola virus infection was inadequate, highlighted by cases of nosocomial transmission. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a re-emerging tick-borne VHF centred in the Eurasian region, affecting a large geographical area and with human-to-human transmission reported, especially in the healthcare setting.
Objectives
To systematically review the characteristics of travel associated Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.
Methods
A systematic review of travel-associated cases of CCHF was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement protocol. PubMed, SCOPUS, Science Citation Index (SCI) and ProMED databases were searched for reports published between January 1960 and January 2016. Three independent reviewers selected and reviewed studies and extracted data.
Results
21 cases of travel associated CCHF were identified, of which 12 died (3 outcome unknown) and 4 secondary (nosocomial) infections were reported. Risk occupations or activities for CCHF infection were reported in 8/12 cases when data were available. Travel from Asia to Asia occurred in 9 cases, Africa to Africa occurred in 5 cases, Africa to Europe in 3 cases, Asia to Europe in 2 cases and Europe to Europe in 2 cases.
Conclusion
CCHF related to travel is rare, is generally associated with at risk activities/occupation and is frequently fatal. Key to early diagnosis and prevention of nosocomial transmission is an understanding of CCHF risk factors and the geographical distribution of CCHF. International travel to CCHF endemic areas is increasing and clinicians and laboratory personnel managing returning travellers should maintain a high index of suspicion."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Long-term expatriates from low to high tuberculosis (TB) incidence countries get high rates of active TB and latent TB infection (LTBI). TB screening for expatriates is important for occupational health. Interferon-gamma release assays are more accurate than tuberculin skin test (TST). Rifapentine plus isoniazid for 3 months (3HP) is as effective as 9 months of isoniazid (9H) with a higher treatment-completion rate.
Methods
Decision trees and Markov models were constructed using a societal perspective on a lifetime horizon. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of 30 year-old expatriates. Seven strategies; TST with 3HP or 9H, QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) with 3HP or 9H, T-SPOT®.TB (TSPOT) with 3HP or 9H and chest X-ray examination (CXR) were modeled. The main outcome measure of effectiveness was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained.
Results
QFT with 3HP yielded the greatest benefits with the lowest cost ($US 674.8; 25.95660 QALYs [year 2012 values]). CXR was the least cost-effective ($US 13,666.8; 24.62917 QALYs). Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to adherence rate of 3HP and QFT specificity, but not to BCG vaccination rate.
Conclusions
Entry LTBI screening using QFT treated with 3HP is recommended on the basis of cost effectiveness among long-term expatriates from low to high incidence countries."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Travellers' diarrhoea in military populations is reported ranging from 50 to 70 cases per thousand person months. The UK personnel deployed to the Ebola Outbreak in Sierra Leone during the Ebola outbreak adopted standard measures associated with disease prevention. As part of the infection control measures against transmission of Ebola, personnel also rinsed their hands frequently in 0.05% hypochlorite. This was felt to have reduced the incidence of travellers' diarrhoea in the population and an audit was carried out to test this hypothesis.
Methods
Routine data identified diarrhoea and vomiting cases. A questionnaire sought information on traveller's diarrhoea and hand hygiene in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan.
Results
The incidence of Gastro Intestinal Disease for the population ranged from 23.9 Per thousand personnel per month to 74.4 per thousand personnel per month (mean 55.1 cases per thousand personnel per month). This included 4 headline outbreaks which accounted for 156 of the total number of 243 cases in the period of the deployment. The mean daily number of hand washes in Sierra Leone as reported in a survey was 17.02 (SD 8.2) and for Afghanistan was 9.06 (6.88). The mean difference was 7.94 (t 0.64 p < 0.0001.)
Conclusion
The gastro intestinal disease incidence appeared to be at the lower end of the range reported by other groups in an environment with, arguably, a greater risk of infection. Force health protection policies were similar between Sierra Leone and Afghanistan excepting the frequency with which hands were rinsed or washed. We recommend that hand washing stations are placed at every office and communal area and not just at the dining facility in order to minimise the incidence of travellers' diarrhoea on future operations."

Background
Shigella is an important cause of gastroenteritis in local Indian population, as well as of traveler's diarrhea in the international visitors to India. These patients often require appropriate antimicrobial therapy; however, rapid development of antimicrobial resistance poses a major hurdle in achieving this goal.
Method
A prospective study was conducted during 2009–12 in New Delhi, India, including 6339 stool samples from gastroenteritis patients. 121 Shigella strains were identified on the basis of colony morphology, biochemical reactions, serotyping and ipaH gene based PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disc diffusion, MIC determination by Vitek® 2 and phenotypic tests for ESBL/AmpC production were done.
Results
Nineteen percent strains (23/121) were found to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins and all were phenotypically confirmed to be ESBL producers; one strain was positive for AmpC. ESBL producing strains were also found to be significantly more resistant (p < 0.05) to several other antimicrobials agents in comparison to ESBL non-producers, [ampicillin (100% vs. 62.2%), ampicillin/sulbactam (100% vs. 30.6%), cotrimoxazole (100% vs. 77.6%), ciprofloxacin (87.0% vs. 49.0%), ofloxacin (87.0% vs. 52.0%) and gentamicin (30.4% vs. 7.1%)]. Multidrug resistance was seen in 76% strains.
Conclusions
Inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents puts high selection pressure on the higher-end antibiotics. Multi-drug resistance and high rates of ESBL production by Shigella is a matter of concern for the local population as well as international travelers. Therefore, better national level antimicrobial management programs are the priority needs."

abstract = "Summary
Against the background of the emergence and rapid spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas, we report the case of an afebrile ZIKV infection in a traveller returning from Central America to highlight relevant clinical and diagnostic aspects. ZIKV should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of dengue or chikungunya fever. Given the frequent subfebril and afebrile manifestations of ZIKV infections, we propose abstaining from the term “Zika fever (ZF)” in favour of “Zika virus disease (ZVD)”. Owing to its unspecific clinical presentation and cross-reactivity in serological assays, ZVD may easily be missed or misdiagnosed as dengue fever. Until conclusive data on the currently suspected link between ZIKV infection in pregnancy and foetal microcephaly become available, pregnant women and women who are trying to become pregnant should be advised against travelling to regions with ongoing ZIKV transmission. In addition, male travellers returning from regions with ongoing transmission should be informed of the potential risk of sexual transmission until conclusive data on the significance of this mode of transmission become available. Although probably low and seasonally restricted, there is a risk of ZIKV importation to Aedes mosquito-infested regions in temperate climates (including regions of North America and Europe) with consecutive autochthonous transmission."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A main cause of hepatitis A and B infections in European countries is travel to endemic countries. Most research on hepatitis vaccination among travellers from Europe has been conducted in airports or travel clinics, samples which potentially overrepresented frequent travellers.
Methods
2102 respondents across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK completed an internet-based questionnaire. Vaccination status, travel to endemic countries, and other characteristics were compared across frequent, occasional, and non-travellers. Logistic regressions tested association between vaccination and travel adjusting for potential confounders.
Results
Most respondents were occasional travellers (61%) and 24% were frequent travellers. Frequent travellers had 2.3–2.4 times the odds of being vaccinated relative to non-travellers, and odds of vaccination were 2.5–3.1 times higher among travellers to endemic areas relative to others (all p < .05). Frequent travellers were more aware of their vaccination status (HAV: 80% vs. 72%; HBV: 82% vs. 74%), though many who were vaccinated could not identify the number of injections to complete the series (47% vs. 29%) (all p < .05).
Conclusion
Travel frequency and destination endemicity are associated with increased hepatitis A and B vaccination. The number of unvaccinated travellers and the lack of recall for the dosing schedule suggest the need to improve travellers' awareness and adherence to recommendations."

Ocular manifestations of chikungunya fever are not frequent, but of great relevance. Common manifestations include conjunctivitis, optic neuritis, iridocyclitis, episcleritis, retinitis and uveitis. Diagnostic and monitoring investigations would include optical coherence tomography, fundus fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, visual field analysis, and electrophysiologic tests. There have been no prospective, randomized therapeutic trials, and it is unclear if the disease is self-limiting or if treatment is actually beneficial. Prognosis varies, ranging from full resolution to permanent vision loss despite intervention."

The guiding principles for the health response are the respect of equity and human rights as well as the accurate analysis of epidemiological trends and determinants of TB in migrants. The action framework “Towards tuberculosis elimination: an action framework for low-incidence countries” includes regulations for cross border migration among the top eight interventions for TB elimination in low incidence countries. Political commitment is the essential requirement, and currently, the limiting factor, to draft regulations for cross-border collaboration, establish cross-border referral systems with contact tracing and information sharing. The e-platform TB Consilium hosted by European Respiratory Society in collaboration with World Health Organization – Euro is an example of a tool that can be used to exchange information for clinical management and surveillance."

Background
International travelers are susceptible to a wide spectrum of travel related morbidities. Despite rising number of international travelers in Canada, the demographics, risk profiles, and preventative strategies of high-risk traveler groups, including pediatric travelers visiting friends and relatives (VFRs) are not well described.
Methods
A descriptive analysis was conducted on pre-travel consultations completed between January 2013 and August 2014 at a large pediatric tertiary care center in Toronto, Canada. Data on demographics, travel characteristics, and pre-travel interventions were extracted from 370 pre-travel consultations. Results were compared between all VFR and non-VFR travelers, as well as between children traveling to visit friends and relatives, for vacation, and for education and/or volunteer purposes.
Results
Forty-eight percent of consultations were for children <18 years of age (n = 177), of which 31% were for young children (<5 years of age). Young children were more likely to travel to visit friends and/or relatives than for other purposes (29% vs 9%, p < 0.0001). Children VFRs (cVFRs) were more likely to travel for >28 days than children traveling for vacation (43% vs 1%, p < 0.0001), and children traveling for education/volunteer purposes (43% vs 21%, p = 0.03). Around half of cVFRs traveled to destinations in Asia (51%). The majority stayed with locals, friends and/or relatives (85%), and nearly all traveled to urban destinations (98%). The most prescribed interventions for children were azithromycin (84%), Dukoral (66%), and the hepatitis A vaccine (60%). Atovaquone/proguanil was the most commonly prescribed antimalarial for children.
Conclusion
Children that travel to visit friends and relatives represent a unique travel group and may require specific considerations during pre-travel preparations. Our findings can help develop targeted pre-travel strategies for children VFRs."

Background
Three years of civil war in Syria have caused death and increase of communicable diseases. The suffering population has been forced to migrate creating a fertile condition for epidemic spread of infection within the refugee camps.
Methods
Forty-eight Syrian migrants, upon their arrival in Italy, were accommodated at the asylum seekers centre of Castelnuovo di Porto. They received a physical examination and were subjected to microbiological surveillance by blood, rectal, pharyngeal and nasal swabs collection and delivering to the Clinical Pathology and Microbiology Laboratory of the University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome.
Results
All refugees resulted negative for HBV, HCV and HIV infections. In swabs a large number of unusual gram-negative bacteria species were isolated, such as Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas monteilii, Pseudomonas fulva, Pseudomonas moselii, Aeromonas veronii, Aeromonas caviae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Acinteobacter guilloviae, Acinteobacter lowffii; Acinetobacter johnsonii; Acinteobacter tjernbergae; Pantoea agglomerans; Pantoea calida. Among isolates, strains resistant to carbapenems, ESBL producers and methicillin resistant were found.
Conclusions
The microbiological surveillance performed represents a useful action to understand refugees health status and to trace unusual microorganisms movement even carriers of antimicrobial resistance during migrants traveling."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Apart from outbreak reports, little is known about the endemicity of dengue and chikungunya virus in African countries. We investigated serum samples collected in Gabon before major outbreaks in 2007 and 2010 in order to identify pre-outbreak-circulation of both viruses.
Methods
Serum samples from Gabonese infants (162) were analyzed at 3, 9, 15 and 30 months of age by commercial ELISA for dengue and chikungunya IgG-antibodies. If samples were positive medical records of participants were analyzed for symptoms concordant with dengue and chikungunya infections during the time period of assumed seroconversion.
Results
IgG-antibodies against dengue were found in 12.3%, and IgG-antibodies against chikungunya in 0.6% of infants tested. Using the four measuring time points, we estimated corresponding incidences of 51/1.000 person-years and 2.5/1.000 person-years, respectively. Symptoms in positive-tested infants were mostly non-specific.
Conclusion
Seropositivity suggests that both viruses circulated before the well-noticed outbreaks. Clinical diagnosis of dengue and chikungunya is difficult especially in infants, underscoring the need for accurate and reliable diagnostic tests as well as awareness of medical personnel.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Brucellosis is one of the main neglected zoonotic diseases. Several factors may contribute to the epidemiology of brucellosis. Imported cases, mainly in travellers but also in recently arrived immigrants, and cases associated with imported products, appear to be infrequently reported.
Methods
Cases of brucellosis diagnosed at a referral unit for imported diseases in Europe were described and a review of the literature on imported cases and cases associated with contaminated imported products was performed.
Results
Most imported cases were associated with traditional risk factors such as travel/consumption of unpasteurized dairy products in endemic countries. Cases associated with importation of food products or infected animals also occurred. Although a lower disease incidence of brucellosis has been reported in developed countries, a higher incidence may still occur in specific populations, as illustrated by cases in Hispanic patients in the USA and in Turkish immigrants in Germany. Imported brucellosis appears to present with similar protean manifestations and both classical and infrequent modes of acquisition are described, leading on occasions to mis-diagnoses and diagnostic delays.
Conclusions
Importation of Brucella spp. especially into non-endemic areas, or areas which have achieved recent control of both animal and human brucellosis, may have public health repercussions and timely recognition is essential."

Background
Dengue fever (DF) is one of the most relevant human arboviral infections worldwide and has become a frequent cause of fever in the returning traveller. This retrospective study aimed to characterize epidemiological and clinical features and laboratory findings of dengue fever in German travellers.
Methods
This descriptive study analyzed medical records of patients diagnosed with DF presenting at the Section of Tropical Medicine of the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf from 2007 to 2011. Data were collected and analyzed retrospectively.
Results
In total, data of 119 DF patients (52 female, 67 male) were included in this study. The median age of the patients was 35 (range 15–75 years). DF was most frequently acquired in South-East Asia (n = 65; 54.7%), and in particular in Thailand (n = 23; 19.7%). A considerable percentage of DF infections (n = 14; 11.8%) was imported from Africa. Patients predominantly presented with fever, headache, rash, myalgia and arthralgia but also with gastrointestinal symptoms, i.e. diarrhoea. Nine patients showed signs of minor haemorrhagic manifestations. Neurological complications occurred in 13 patients. Low platelet count, leukopenia and elevated liver enzymes were the most relevant laboratory findings. Twenty patients (17.8%) had to be hospitalized. Overall, the clinical course was mostly mild to moderate, 13 patients (10.9%) showed DF warnings signs, no fatalities occurred.
Conclusions
DF presented as a mostly mild to moderate disease in this study cohort. Outpatient treatment was adequate for the majority of patients. Still, detailed knowledge of clinical symptoms and laboratory features is essential for appropriate triage."

abstract = "Summary
Albania is an attractive tourism destination with an increasing volume of travel. As a Mediterranean country some tropical infectious diseases are present in certain areas of Albania, including leptospirosis, which is a zoonotic infectious disease prevalent around the world. The goal of this retrospective study is to describe the ocular and cutaneous manifestations of leptospirosis in Albanian patients and raise awareness to travelers travelling in and out of the country.
Methods
We retrospectively studied 107 cases of leptospirosis, treated at “Mother Teresa” University Hospital Center, in Tirana, Albania between January 2009 and December 2014. All cases included in the analysis had a clinical and epidemiological presentation suggestive of leptospirosis, confirmed with ELISA (enzyme linked immunoassay) positive for IgM antibodies against Leptospira.
Results
There were 89.7% males (n = 96) and 10.2% females (n = 11). Mean age at the time of diagnoses was 43.7 ± 17.8 years old (range 17–78). All patients were native and residents of Albania. Conjunctival suffusion was present in 81.3% of the cases, whereas subconjunctival hemorrhage was seen in 12 patients (11.2%). Uveitis was seen in 38.3% of the cases and all patients with uveitis presented a severe systemic disease. A cutaneous rash was present in 58.8% of patients. Other cutaneous manifestations include jaundice in 62.6% and intense pruritus in 5.6% of cases.
Conclusions
Ocular and cutaneous involvement happens more frequently in patients with Leptospirosis, than it was thought to be. Therefore the clinician should be more careful in his systemic evaluation of the disease."

abstract = "Summary
Background
International travel carries the risk of imported diseases, which are an increasingly significant public health problem. There is little guidance about which variables should be collected by surveillance systems for strategy-based surveillance.
Methods
Surveillance forms for dengue, malaria, hepatitis A, typhoid and measles were collected from Australia and New Zealand and information on these compared with national surveillance forms from the UK and Canada by travel health experts. Variables were categorised by information relating to recent travel, demographics and disease severity.
Results
Travel-related information most commonly requested included country of travel, vaccination status and travel dates. In Australia, ethnicity information requested related to indigenous status, whilst in New Zealand it could be linked to census categories. Severity of disease information most frequently collected were hospitalisation and death.
Conclusions
Reviewing the usefulness of variables collected resulted in the recommendation that those included should be: overseas travel, reason for travel, entry and departure dates during the incubation period, vaccination details, traveller's and/or parents' country of birth, country of usual residence, time resident in current country, postcode, hospitalisation and death details. There was no agreement about whether ethnicity details should be collected. The inclusion of these variables on surveillance forms could enable imported infection-related policy to be formulated nationally and internationally."
