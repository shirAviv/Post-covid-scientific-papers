abstract = "Background
A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to summarize the evidence on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on metabolic profiles in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
Methods
We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and five other databases to identify all RCTs investigating the association between vitamin D and NAFLD up until 5 October 2016. Seven RCTs with 452 participants (227 patients and 225 controls) were included in the meta-analysis.
Results
The results showed that vitamin D administration had no beneficial effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (standardized mean difference [SMD]-0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.88, 0.42), insulin (SMD −1.09; 95% CI, −2.70,0.52) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (SMD −1.89; 95% CI, −3.88,0.09). Vitamin D supplementation also had no effect on lipid profiles including triglycerides (SMD −0.36; 95% CI, −1.77, 1.04), and total-cholesterol (SMD −0.46; 95% CI: −1.3, 0.39), as well as on aspartate transaminase (AST) (SMD −0.53; 95% CI, −1.11, 0.05), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SMD −0.66; 95% CI, −1.43,0.11), and body mass index (BMI) (SMD −0.25; 95% CI, −0.76,0.27).
Conclusions
Vitamin D supplementation had no effect on FPG, insulin, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, total-, LDL-cholesterol, AST, ALT, and BMI."

Dyslipidemia is one of the major risk factors for atherosclerosis and the main cause of death in the developing and developed countries. In this cohort study, the incidence of dyslipidemia and its components have been studied among individuals over 20 years old in Ahvaz, southwest of Iran.
Materials and methods
The Phase 1 of this study was conducted on the prevalence of Metabolic syndrome and its related factors by Diabetes Research Center in 2009. The target population included individuals over 20 years old who were selected using cluster sampling in Ahvaz health centers. In the second phase of the study, 5 years later in 2014, subjects were again recalled by health centers. Questionnaires, anthropometric indices and measurements were repeated similar to Phase 1. The blood sample was taken from everyone after 12h of fasting and then the factors (Chol, TG, HDL) were measured.
Results
The cumulative incidence of dyslipidemia obtained 60.7% (males 56.7% and females 64.8%). lipid profile {HDL, Triglycerides and Cholesterol had changes in their means(a significant reduction in the mean about 10, 22.25 and 13 units respectively) between baseline and 5 years later. Waist circumference here associated with incidence of high LDL and high chol, also sex and High LDL ‘educational level and daily consumption of vegetables were associated with incidence of low HDL and dyslipidemia respectively.
Conclusion
Age, educational level and daily intake of fruits and vegetables were effective variables on incidence of dyslipidemia. According to various studies, LDL and HDL levels in different regions of Iran, seems to be influenced by factors such as climate, nutrition and activity levels."

The study was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a training course of cognitive-behavioral stress management in glycaemia regulation in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus as well as in mental health status of their mothers.
Materials and methods
Fifty children with type 1 diabetes mellitus and their mothers were selected and randomly assigned into two groups. A group of mothers (n=25; as experimental one besides their children) passed a course, eight 2-h sessions, on the cognitive-behavioral and stress management, and the control group received the usual care. To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, before and after holding the course, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) test was done on both groups of children, and also some information was collected from the mothers through interview and the DASS (depression, anxiety, stress scale) and PSI (parenting stress index) questionnaires.
Results
After the intervention, HbA1c level decreased in the experimental group. Feeling of depression, anxiety and stress was significantly lower than the control group. Furthermore, training for parenting stress management positively affected on the sense of demanding, reinforcement, and adaptability in child domain and also on attachment, competence, depression, relationship with spouse and family health in parent domain.
Conclusion
The intervention program was significantly effective in reducing the amount of HbA1c in diabetic children, and also reduced the intensity of psychosocial problems such as depression, anxiety and stress in the mothers caring for children with type 1 diabetes."

Variants in Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 alpha (HNF1A) gene are associated with Metabolic Syndromeand its components independently. In this study, we aimed to assess the statistical association of the rs1169288, rs2464196 and rs735396 variants and haplotypes of HNF1A gene with metabolic syndrome (MS) and its components in a Moroccan population sample.
Methods
Three variants in the HNF1A gene were genotyped, rs1169288 A>C, rs2464196 G>A and rs735396 T>C in cases and controls from Moroccan population using KASPar® technology (KBioscience, UK). Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were assessed. MS was defined according to the international Diabetes Federation (IDF). The effects of HNF1A polymorphisms and constructed haplotypes on MS were estimated using logistic regression analyses.
Results
The HNF1A gene, rs1169288 and rs2464196 variants conferred an increased risk to MS (OR=2.08, 95%CI=1.38–3.14, P=0.0005 and OR=1.52, 95%IC=1.05–2.20, P=0.03, respectively) when adjusted for BMI, sex and age. We found that the C allele of the variant rs735396 was associated with an increased triglycerides level (p-value=0.04434) among patients and high weist circumference (P=0.02005) and total cholesterol (P=0.03227) amount among controls. The haplotype AAT (OR=5.656, P<0.00001) was the most significantly associated with susceptibility to metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
The present study demonstrated that SNPs rs1169288 and rs2464196 of HNF1A gene were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome in a Morrocan population. Furthermore, the CAC, AAC, AAT and AGT haplotypes of these SNPs and rs735396 were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome."

The objective of this study was to examine the strength and consistency of the relationship between depression and diabetes in Bangladeshi population.
Methods
The study was conducted at the medicine department of Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) during May 2012 to May 2013. Equal number of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and non-diabetic subjects (patient attendants) were recruited from outpatient department matching for age (±2 years) and gender. Demographic and anthropometric data were collected from all the subjects. Depression was assessed using, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. A subject with a score above 8 was considered as depressive. Baseline characteristics of diabetic and non-diabetic participants were compared using chi square test. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess the association between diabetes and depression adjusting for all plausible confounders in the model.
Results
24.8% non-diabetic and 56.2% diabetic subjects were found to have depression. Statistically significant difference was found in income, waist-to-hip ratio between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects (P<0.001). Diabetic patients show 7-fold greater odds of having depression in comparison to their non-diabetic counterpart [OR 7.0, 95% CI (3.4, 14.3)]. Female gender appeared as significant predictor of depression [OR 4.3, 95% CI (2.1, 8.9)].
Conclusions
In Bangladeshi population, people with diabetes are 7 times more likely to have co-existing depression in comparison to non-diabetic subjects. Further studies are required to establish the nature of the relationship between depression and T2DM."

Previous studies have demonstrated that hemoglobin-haptoglobin (Hb-Hp) complex plays a role in developing vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The complexes bind with Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), affecting the function of Lecithin:Cholesterol Acyltransferase (LCAT), and impairing the reverse cholesterol transport mechanism (RCT). This study investigated the influence of Hp phenotypes on serum levels of ApoA1 and LCAT in patients with T2DM.
Methods
The study comprised 131 T2DM patients and 111 matching healthy controls. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1C, and lipid profile were determined by chemistry autoanalyzer, LCAT and ApoA1 by ELISA, and Hp phenotypes by gel electrophoresis.
Results
Irrespective of Hp phenotypes, fasting blood glucose, HbA1C, and lipid profile were significantly higher in patients than in controls, while HDL-cholesterol, ApoA1, and LCAT were lower. ApoA1 correlated positively with LCAT (r=0.223, p=0.024) and HDL-cholesterol (r=0.255, 0.003) in patients only. When Hp polymorphism was taken into account, the levels of LCAT and ApoA1 were significantly lower in patients with Hp2-2 than that in patients of Hp1-1 and/or Hp2-1. Correlations between ApoA1 and each of HDL-cholesterol and LCAT (r=0.239, p=0.046, and r=0.252, p=0.040, respectively) were also observed, but only in patients with Hp2-2 phenotype.
Conclusions
The reduced levels of LCAT and ApoA1 observed in this study support the suggestion that T2DM patients with Hp2-2 phenotype could have altered RCT mechanism and increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease."

Methods
The registry includes all OA cases who referred to Fasa hospital (Iran) since 2013. Overall, 131 patients with OA with a Kellgren & Lawrence (K&L) score >1 and 261 controls were compared.
Results
Overall, 82.4% of individuals in the OA group and 40.8% of participants in the control group had MeS (P<0.001). Patients with OA had a 6.8 (95% CI: 4.1–11.4) higher chance of acquiring MeS. After adjusting for sex, age, and BMI, odds’ ratio (OR) for acquiring MeS in OA group increased to 10.9 (95% CI: 5.5–21.8). Among MeS criteria’s, high waist circumference (WC) has strongest correlation for acquiring OA (OR=27.535, 95% CI: 6.003–126.306).
Conclusion
Our findings revealed that metabolic markers are strongly associated with OA and the addition of each component of the MeS, significantly increases the risk of developing OA, therefore control of metabolic factors and appropriate screening must be considered in health policy making and prevention programs."

Electronic health data in the form of International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes is routinely used for clinical research, yet the accuracy of specific diagnoses is largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to assess the validity of computer extracted problem lists for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and other complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) within the VA Greater Los Angeles Health Administration (VHAGLA).
Methods
The study population consisted of patients at the VHAGLA with an ICD-9 diagnosis of DM between Jan 1st 1999 and March 22nd 2016 with visits to the eye clinic. Fifty patients either with or without an ICD-9 diagnosis of DR were randomly selected. The accuracy of ICD-9 codes for DR, as well as related co-morbidities such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA), were assessed through chart review.
Results
A total of 3193 patients met our inclusion criteria. Of the 50 patients with an ICD-9 diagnosis of DR, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.7. For 50 patients without a ICD-9 diagnosis of DR, the negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.9. Of the other co-morbid medical conditions, NPV ranged from a low of 63% for obesity to a high of 98% for CVA and CAD.
Conclusion
Validity of ICD-9 diagnoses of diabetic complications in this VA population varied considerably, with DR demonstrating moderate agreement, obesity being more under-documented, and CVA and CAD being more consistently documented. These discrepancies should be considered when using billing codes for research purposes."

Understanding the metabolic syndrome has been the center of attention in recent years as a major risk factor of many diseases. Given the rising incidence of this disease and as the patient can compete against this disease with choosing healthy lifestyle, in the present study, we investigated the predictors of metabolic syndrome, based on Walker’s health-promoting lifestyle in two large cities in Iran, in 2016.
Methods
This cross-sectional study used two-stage cluster sampling to select 1128 patients, among patients who referred to health centers in Isfahan and Yazd. Data were gathered by Walker lifestyle questionnaire that evaluates health-promoting behavior (nutrition, physical activity, health responsibility, spiritual growth, interpersonal relations, and stress management) by self-report that were completed by interviews for illiterate and semi-literate individuals. Data analysis was performed by SPSS statistical software.
Results
In this study, 576 women and 454 men participated with mean age of 56.19±12.11years and mean weight of 73.90±14.45kg.
Results
showed that the highest mean score for different health-promoting behaviors was related to social responsibility (25.53±5.65) and the lowest was related to nutritional status (15.18±5.79). Regarding the strongest predictor of lifestyle, the results of regression analysis showed that the most direct impact was related to stress management (R2=0.343) and the least direct impact was related to social responsibility (R2=0.243). Among the structures, physical activity with overall effect of R2=0.621 was the strongest predictor of lifestyle based on Walker’s pattern.
Conclusion
Considering the results of this study, the greater emphasis in planning and interventions to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome should be spotted on physical activity and stress management in patients with the metabolic syndrome."

Oral vitamin D supplementation is better than parenteral in improving vitamin D deficiency in individuals with no systemic illness. Our aim was to compare the efficacy of oral and parenteral routes of vitamin D supplementation on circulating serum 25(OH) vitamin D level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Methods
Total 85 cases of with type 2 diabetes mellitus were screened for vitamin D status of which 71 patients were vitamin D insufficient/deficient. They were randomized into two intent to treat groups with different vitamin D supplementation protocols (a) Oral-60000 IU per day for 5days (group I; n=40) and (b) injectable-300000 IU intramuscularly once (group II; n=31). Baseline and one month post supplementation 25(OH) vitamin D levels were measured in both the groups.
Results
Baseline clinical characteristics and 25(OH) vitamin D levels were comparable in both the groups. Post treatment 25(OH) vitamin D level in group I was 26.06±9.06ng/ml and in group II was 49.69±18.92ng/ml. After one month of vitamin D supplementation, increment in 25(OH) vitamin D level from baseline was significantly higher in group II than group I (p<0.001).
Interpretation & conclusions
Injectable method of supplementation was better than oral route in improving serum 25 (OH) vitamin D status in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study suggested impaired absorption of vitamin D from the gastrointestinal tract in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a need for parenteral route of vitamin D supplementation in deficient patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Method
In this cross sectional study thyroid function tests were analyzed in 16 diabetic ketoacidosis patients according to American diabetic association before and after insulin therapy.
Result
mean triiodothyronine (T3) level before and after ketoacidosis treatment were 63.2±28.2ng/dl/and 78.5±26.2ng/dl (P. value 0.00) respectively and the mean thyroxin level (T4) before and after ketoacidosis were 3.18±1.4ng/dl and 5.17±2.4ng/dl (P. value=0.00) .Mean thyrotropin (TSH) level and triiodothyronine uptake (T3RU) before and after treatment showed no significant difference.
Conclusion
Diabetic ketoacidosis is a sever systemic disease which along with reduction in T3 level, T4 level is also decreased and TSH level is normal. The changes in Thyroid hormones are reversed to normal after treatment of ketoacidosis so it is recommended in interpreting results of TFT in these patients we should consider these facts and thyroid function test should be repeated after treatment."

The use of second-generation atypical antipsychotics has an increasing role in the development of metabolic syndrome. However, these medications due to metabolic disorders can lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and subsequently mortality as well as reduced adherence to treatment. The main objective of current study was to determine the ability of melatonin to reduce the metabolic effects of second-generation antipsychotics.
Methods
This double blind controlled clinical trial was conducted on 100 patients aged 18–64 years old were treated with the second-generation antipsychotics for the first time. The patients were divided randomly into two groups of 50. The case group received slow-release melatonin at a dose of 3mg and the control group was given oral placebo at 8 p.m.
Results
The findings in melatonin group indicated significantly increase of HDL and decreased fasting blood sugar and systolic blood pressure, as well as had statistically significant increase in waist circumference, weight and BMI compared with placebo group.
Conclusion
According to the findings, it can be claimed that the addition of melatonin to atypical antipsychotics has led to a reduction in some of the metabolic effects of these drugs. In this study, HDL level was increased, and the mean systolic blood pressure and FBS were decreased in the melatonin group. Considering that these factors are contributing to cardiovascular disease as a leading cause of mortality in psychiatric patients, so the use of melatonin can reduce some of the medical effects of long-term treatment of atypical antipsychotics."

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the major chronic vascular complication of T2DM and leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Inflammation is one of the proposed pathway which explains microvascular complications in T2DM but exact mechanism is still unclear. Omentin-1 is an anti-inﬂammatory adipokine which promotes insulin signaling. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine having role in immune and inflammatory responses. The present study was conducted to elucidate the role of omentin-1 and IL-6 in the pathogenesis of DN and its association with insulin resistance. We aimed to assess and compare the serum levels of omentin-1 and IL-6 in T2DM patients with and without DN.
Materials & Methods
Our study comprised of 2 groups of 41 each. Group A (controls) included T2DM without nephropathy patients and group B (cases) included T2DM nephropathy patients. Parameters studied were serum omentin-1, insulin, IL-6, fasting blood glucose, urea, creatinine, lipid profile, HOMA-IR, eGFR and BMI.
Results & Conclusion
Omentin-1 (p=0.03) was significantly decreased; concomitantly, significant increase in levels of insulin (p=0.004), IL-6 (p=0.023) and HOMA-IR (p=0.0004) were found in cases compared to controls. Bivariate analysis showed eGFR correlating positively with omentin-1 and negatively with insulin in the study population. Our study results, based on serum omentin-1 and IL-6 data suggest important role played by inflammatory mechanism and insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients."

Better understanding risk factors for metabolic syndrome (MetS) will allow early targeted intervention to mitigate long term risk. We aim to determine the disparate impact of each individual MetS component on overall risk of developing MetS, stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, and age.
Methods
Using data from the 2003–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), MetS prevalence among adults (age ≥18) was stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, age, and by individual MetS components (e.g. hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), waist circumference, serum high density lipoprotein (HDL), serum triglycerides (TG). Mutlivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the disparate impact of each risk factor on MetS risk.
Results
Overall MetS prevalence was 33.3%, with the highest prevalence among older individuals, among women, and among Hispanics. When stratified by each individual component of MetS, low serum HDL was the strongest predictor of MetS risk overall and among both men and women, among all race/ethnic groups, and among all age groups (overall: OR 20.1, 95% CI 18.6–21.7). While presence of DM also increased an individual’s risk of MetS, DM was the weakest predictor of MetS.
Conclusions
Among U.S. adults, low serum HDL carries the strongest risk in predicting development of MetS. This effect was seen among men and women, among all race/ethnic groups, and among all age groups, highlighting the importance of low serum HDL as a marker of MetS risk."

To determine the association between thyroid hormones and insulin resistance in a population of healthy individuals.
Materials and methods
We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study in adults who attended a private clinic from 2012 to 2014. We excluded those participants with fasting glucose values ​​compatible with diabetes mellitus, abnormal thyroid hormone values, chronic use of corticosteroids, and incomplete medical records. Participants were divided into tertiles (low, intermediate and high) according to their free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine values. We defined Insulin resistance as a Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) value greater than 3.8. We conducted a univariate and multivariate Poisson regression model to assess the association between thyroid hormones and insulin resistance. The association measure reported was the prevalence ratio (PR) with their confidence interval (CI) at 95%.
Results
We evaluated 600 participants. The mean age was 36.8±14.2years and 33% were male. The frequency of insulin resistance was 29.5%. In the univariate regression, we found association between free triiodothyronine tertiles and insulin resistance. In the multivariate regression adjusted for age, sex, body mass index and thyroid stimulating hormone, the association between free triiodothyronine tertiles and insulin resistance remained; intermediate tertile (PR=1.54; CI95%: 1.10-2.15) and high tertile (PR=1.70; CI95%: 1.21-2.39). We found no association between T4 and insulin resistance.
Conclusions
High levels of free triiodothyronine are associated with insulin resistance. The use of free trioodothyronine to assess insulin resistance in healthy patients should be considered."

Results
The study 10-year CVD incidence was 15.8%, exhibiting a gradual increase according to the baseline body mass index (BMI) category. Baseline BMI ≥30kg/m2 was related with significantly higher 10-year CVD risk compared to BMI <25kg/m2, even after adjustment for age and other known CVD risk factors. Baseline BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio and waist-to-hip-to-height ratio were independently associated with the 10-year CVD risk in multi-adjusted models. Gender-specific analyses showed that these associations were more evident in men compared to women, with baseline BMI exhibiting an independent association with the 10-year CVD incidence in men.

Diabetic nephropathy traditionally produces significant proteinuria prior to the development of renal impairment. However, this clinical paradigm has recently been questioned. The current study evaluated the impact of diabetes mellitus on the prevalence of renal disease in general population.
Methodology
Data from of the HERMEX survey, an observational, cross sectional, population based study were used. The final sample included 2813 subjects (mean age 51.2 years, 53.5% female). Four hundred patients have diabetes. Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate was analyzed and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the CKD-EPI formula.
Results
Among participants without diabetes, 2.9%(2.2–3.6) had a GFR < 60 ml/min. Prevalence of abnormal UAE in population without diabetes was 3.3% (2.6–4.0). The global prevalence of renal disease was 5.6%(4.8–6.6). Prevalence of GFR <60 ml/min in subjects with diabetes was 8.8%(6.4–11.9)(p<0.001,Chi-square test). Prevalence of abnormal UAE in population with diabetes was 14.1%(7.7–19.8)(p< 0.001,Chi-square test). CKD prevalence was 20.3%(16.6–24.6)(p<0.001,Chi-square test). The logistic regression analysis showed a positive independent association of CKD with age, high blood pressure and albuminuria. No significant relationship was found with diabetes mellitus
Conclusions
CKD is more prevalent in population with diabetes. Nevertheless, most of patients with diabetes and CKD have no albuminuria. An increased cardiovascular burden seems to produce this clinical presentation."

Bipolar Disorder inpatients who were in manic episode and age-gender matched healthy controls were included in the study. CRI-I, CRI-II, AIP and AC parameters were calculated before and after treatment. The statistical significance level was accepted as p<0.05.
Results
Sixty-eight male patients and 60 healthy controls were included in the study. CRI-I, CRI-II, AIP and AC parameters showed an increase after treatment (p<0.001 for all parameters). There was no significant difference between patients and controls in terms of CRI-I and CRI-II and AC (p=0.129, p=0.573, p=0.129 respectively). Although mean AIP levels of patients was significantly lower than control group (p=0.031), the significance disappeared when we compared the patients and controls according to being in low, medium, and high risk groups (χ2=0.826, p=0.662).
Conclusions
Even in short term of treatment, antipsychotics have an important role in developing dyslipidemia and increasing cardiovascular risk. Manic state may have positive or at least no additional influences on atherogenic risk."

abstract = "Aim
To evaluate the local treatment-seeking behaviors of diabetics with a focus on the root causes of culture-specific barriers to treatment compliance and define targets for intervention.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was administered in the local language to 204 diabetic adults in rural and urban clinical settings. Fasting blood glucose level was measured in all participants prior to the survey. Questions included sociodemographic characteristics, treatment-seeking behavior, and perceptions of obstacles.
Results
Out of 204 participants, predictors of at target status included age (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02–1.11) and rural living area (OR 1.92, 92% CI 1.02–3.60). Participants were commonly diagnosed with symptoms of diabetes (44.6%). Participants demonstrated frequent healthcare provider contact (51% in last one month, 74.5% in last three months). Accidental or purposeful deviation from the recommended medications or treatment plan was reported by 18.7% and 12.8%, respectively. From the sample, 111 participants (54.4%) were capable of receiving SMS messages and 79 (71.1%) were willing to receive messages about diabetes. The most frequently self-reported obstacles to diabetes management were: medication costs (49.3%), treatment costs (46.6%), diabetic diet (33.8%), lack of relief on current treatment (17.4%), and transportation (16.7%).
Conclusion
Though most diabetics have frequent encounters with healthcare providers and report compliant behaviors, the majority do not meet recommended diabetes management guidelines. Screening of at-risk populations, targeted SMS campaigns, or diabetes-specific training for healthcare providers may improve clinical outcomes."

abstract = "Aims
Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is an important etiologic and prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer, but few studies have assessed health outcomes among hospitalized pancreatic cancer patients. We examined the associations between MetS and in-hospital outcomes, i.e. pancreatic resection, post-surgery complications, in-hospital mortality and discharge disposition among hospitalized patients with pancreatic cancer.
Methods
Using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) dataset from 2007 to 2011, we obtained data on 47,386 patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression models were used to compute estimates, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
Results
Pancreatic cancer patients with MetS were more likely to undergo pancreatic resection (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04–1.25) compared to those without MetS. However they were less likely to experience post-surgical complications (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.81–0.99), discharge to a skilled nursing facility (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83–0.93), and less likely to experience in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.44–0.61) compared to those without MetS.
Conclusion
Hospitalized pancreatic cancer patients with a clinical diagnosis of MetS were more likely to receive pancreatic resection, and had reduced odds of post-surgical complications and in-hospital mortality. If confirmed in future studies, then better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying this association will be needed, potentially leading to the development of clinical and/or molecular biomarkers to improve early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and identify patients that may benefit from pancreatic resection."

Few studies have examined whether longitudinal changes in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), independent of each other, are associated with the risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS). The objective of this study was to examine the longitudinal effects of VAT and SAT on MetS and metabolic risk factors in a multi-ethnic sample of Canadians followed for 5-years.
Materials and methods
In total, 598 adults of the Multicultural Community Health Assessment Trial (M-CHAT) were included in this study. Assessments of body composition using computed tomography (CT) and metabolic risk factors were conducted at baseline, 3-, and 5-years. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to model the longitudinal effects of VAT and SAT on MetS and metabolic risk factors.
Results
There were significant between-person (cross-sectional) effects such that for every 10cm2 higher VAT, the odds of MetS, high-risk fasting glucose levels and high-risk HDL-C levels significantly increased by 16% (95% CI: 9–24%), 11% (3–20%), and 7% (0–14%) respectively. Significant within-person (longitudinal) effects were also found such that for every 10cm2 increase in VAT the odds of MetS and high-risk triglyceride levels significantly increased by 23% (9–39%) and 30% (14–48%), respectively. Cross-sectional or longitudinal changes in SAT were not associated with MetS or metabolic risk factors.
Conclusions
This study found a direct relationship between longitudinal change in VAT and MetS risk independent of changes in SAT. Clinical practice should focus on the reduction of VAT to improve cardiovascular health outcomes."

Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are both associated with the development of Type 2 Diabetes and other pathologies; however, the influence of parental history of Type 2 diabetes (PH-T2D) has yet to be investigated. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of PH-T2D has on the risk of developing hyperinsulinemia and IR.
Materials and methods
1092 subjects (703 non-pregnant females and 389 males) were enrolled for a cross-sectional study. Clinical and biochemical parameters were collected. Subjects were allocated according to their PH-T2D: no parents, one parent, or both parents. Insulin resistance was calculated using the HOMA1 equation (HOMA1-IR). Logistic regression was used to determine the association (odds ratio) between PH-T2D and hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance.
Results
Increasing degrees of PH-T2D were associated with significant increases in fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and HOMA1-IR (p <0.05). Subjects having one or both parents were associated with an increase risk of developing hyperinsulinemia (odds ratio=1.53, 95%CI: 1.12–2.09, and odds ratio=1.92, 95%CI: 1.21–3.06, respectively) and insulin resistance (odds ratio=1.47, 95%CI: 1.08-2.00 and odds ratio=1.77, 95%CI: 1.09–2.87, respectively), when adjusting for age, sex, BMI, fasting plasma glucose, and triglycerides.

Newer blood gas analyzers have the ability to report electrolyte values and glucose in addition to pH, so this diagnostic process could be condensed in diagnosing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We aimed to assess the accuracy of the venous blood gas (VBG) analysis with electrolytes for diagnosing DKA.
Methods
This study prospectively identified a convenience sample of (60 patients) presented with DKA and tested their VBG and serum electrolytes. The diagnosis of DKA was made according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Serum chemistry electrolyte values were considered to be the criterion standard. Sensitivity and specificity of VBG electrolytes results were compared against this standard. In addition, correlation coefficients for individual electrolytes between VBG electrolytes and laboratory chemistry electrolytes were calculated.
Results
Paired VBG and serum chemistry panels were available for 60 patients, only 49 patients were included, In this study; 20% of cases were newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. The total number of diabetic ketoacidosis was 14 patients (28.5%). The sensitivity and specificity of the VBG and electrolytes for diagnosing DKA was 92.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]=89% to 99%) and 97.1% (95% CI=92% to 100%), respectively. Correlation coefficients between VBG and serum chemistry were 0.91, 0.47, 0.61, 0.65, and 0.58 for blood sugar, sodium, potassium, chloride, and creatinine respectively.
Conclusions
Findings of this study offer preliminary support for the possibility of using VBG sample rather than VBG sample and serum chemistry electrolytes together to rule out diabetic ketoacidosis."

We studied demographic and clinical factors association with pre-stroke glycemia, indicated by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), in acute stroke patients with T2D.
Methods
Using a questionnaire, we collected demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical information from 300 acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients in one hospital. We analyzed factors associated with HbA1c in patients with history of T2D.
Results
There were 111 patients with history of T2D and HbA1c measured on admission. In multivariable analyses factors associated with higher HbA1c were treatment with insulin (p=0.05), history of hyperlipidemia (p=0.01), and total cholesterol level (p=0.02). Poor adherence to T2D treatment was associated with higher HbA1c levels (p=0.006) only in a subgroup of patients with HbA1c ≥8%.

Sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) are any beverages containing added-sugar and supposed to increase body lipogenesis and fat accumulation in healthy subjects. This study was performed to assess the possible association between SSBs consumption and obesity in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients.
Methods
T2DM adults with no insulin treatment entered the study. Abdominal obesity and general adiposity were determined using waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI), respectively. SSBs intake was extracted from a validated food frequency questionnaire.
Results
Mean SSBs intake was 0.6 serving/d (145.6mL/d). There was no considerable association between SSBs intake and gender. About 46% of patients consumed at least one serving of SSBs per week. SSBs consumption was correlated neither to WC nor to BMI. After adjustment for confounding factors, abdominal obesity was associated with drinking SSBs ≥1 serving/week (OR=4.93, 95% CI: 1.35–18.03), and SSB ≥3 serving/week (OR=5.07, 95% CI: 1.22–21.15) compared to those consumed <1 serving/week. This association was not found for general obesity (OR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.60–1.23). Ex-smokers had higher SSBs intake compared to those never smoked (OR=3.94, 95% CI=1.06–14.71). Energy intake and macronutrients were similar in both SSBs sub-groups. Mean daily energy supplied by SSBs was 120kcal in participants having ≥1 serving of SSBs/week and 2.7kcal in <1 serving SSBs/week (OR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.09–1.20). Lower SSBs drinkers had 17% higher fiber intake (OR=0.83, 95% CI=0.73–0.96).
Conclusion
SSBs intake might increase abdominal obesity in diabetic population and therefore should be considered in diabetes control procedure."

Forty post-menopausal women (62.48±7.67years; 154.6±5.11cm; 73.93±15.43kg; 31.13±5.82 BMI kg/m2) with a diagnosis of T2D participated in this cross-sectional study. The patients performed fasting blood sample exams, anthropometrics assessments, body composition, and clinical exams. Subjects performed physical tests including handgrip, timed up and go, 30-s chair stand, arm curl, and sit-to-stand. The correlation between the parameters of physical tests, age, body composition, vitamin D, and blood glucose was assessed by Pearson correlation.
Results
The results showed there were significant correlations between blood glucose and relative strength (R=−0.398, p=0.011), arm curl test (R=−0.367 and p=0.020), and hip flexion (R=0.427, p=0.006).
Conclusions
These findings are important because they highlight the importance of resistance training in individuals with T2D and the relationship with a fat increase during a dicrease process. Furthermore, the concentration of serum glucose might be associated with decreases in muscle strength and muscle function in older adults. Thus, T2D patients should be involved with strength training to improve the strength and the muscle hypertrophy."

Since, resistin has been associated with coronary heart disease and with the progression of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), our objective was to determine the correlation between resistin and cardiovascular risk (CVR) in subjects with increasing degrees of hyperglycemia.
Methods
Using a cross-sectional study design, the anthropometric and biochemical profiles were collected from 180 subjects from Puebla, Mexico. Subjects were separated into Normoglycemic (NGT), pre-diabetic (PT2D), or T2D. CVR was determined by the Atherosclerosis Coefficient ((total cholesterol-high-density lipoprotein)/high-density lipoprotein), Castelli 1 index (total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein), Castelli 2 index (low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein), Framingham risk score (https://www.mdcalc.com/framingham-coronary-heart-disease-risk-score#next-steps), and the CVR index (CVRI=triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein). Differences between groups were determined using ANOVA. Partial correlation assessed the association between resistin and CVR indices. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk [Odds ratio (OR)] between resistin and CVR.
Results
Serum Resistin levels were similar between NGT, PT2D, and T2D. No correlation was observed between resistin and CVR indices for the NGT and PT2D. However, T2D demonstrated a strong negative association between the Framingham (r=−0.34, p=0.01), the Castelli 1 index (r=−0.29, p<0.01), and the CVRI (r=−0.38, p<0.05), when adjusted for sex and taking treatment for T2D. For T2D, when the subjects were separated by resistin into tertiles, elevated resistin was associated with a benefit for the Castelli 1 index (T1 v T3: OR=0.15, 95% CI: 0.03–0.070) and the CVRI (T1 v T3: OR=0.13, 95% CI: 0.03–0.66).
Conclusions
Here, we demonstrate that, for T2D, elevated resistin levels lowered the CVR in Mexicans."

To describe the relationship between daily physical activity (steps/day and self report method) and health indices. Also to observe relationship between daily physical activity and existence of any prior sign of metabolic syndrome in middle aged adults of 40–60 years. A secondary objective was to observe relation between objective (steps/day) and subjective (IPAQ) measure of physical activity.
Method
145 subjects were recruited from residential colony of New Delhi, India and their health indices (waist circumference, hip circumference, waist hip ratio, blood pressure, resting heart rate), and presence of any sign of metabolic syndrome were noted down. Their daily physical activity was determined by pedometer (steps/day) and IPAQ (self report). Steps/day was compared with self reported physical activity, presence of any prior sign of metabolic syndrome, and health indices.
Result
The average steps/day was 3226±1558 for females (n=76) and 4273±2530 for males (n=69). IPAQ results were inversely related with WHR (p=0.046, r=−0.166), RHR (p=0.020, r=−0.193) and signs of metabolic syndrome (p=0.017, r=−0.198). Pedometer determined physical activity was inversely related with prior signs of metabolic syndrome present (p=0.041, r=−0.170). Pedometer determined steps/day were positively correlated with self-reported physical activity (p<0.001, r=0.56).
Conclusion
Main findings suggested that fewer steps/day and METS are associated with more components of the metabolic syndrome. Prior signs of metabolic syndrome were mainly present in females. Majority of participants were sedentary, showed high resting heart rate, high waist hip ratio and more number of sign of metabolic syndrome."

abstract = "Background
Insulin Resistance(IR) is increasing in Africans as well as among the Human Immunodeficiency Virus(HIV) infected population for several reasons which include the viral infection itself and the use of Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This present study assessed the prevalence of IR among HIV infected population and the imminent effect of the disease and therapy on patients.
Methods
This cross sectional study was conducted in Lagos among 266 HIV infected participants and 130 HIV Negative controls aged 18–80 years. Questionnaires were administered and fasting venous blood samples collected for plasma glucose and insulin. Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) and Quantitative Insulin Check Index (QUICKI) indices were used to establish Insulin Resistance using a cut off of >2 and <0.339 respectively.
Results
Insulin resistance was prevalent in 24.1% of HIV-infected participants based on a HOMA-IR and 21.1% using QUICKI compared to 8.5% and 4.6% in the HIV uninfected controls (p<0.001). A prevalence of 25.8% was found among the HAART exposed group compared to 10% among the HAART naïve group (p=0.056) using HOMA-IR while QUICKI results showed 22.5% and 10% respectively (p=0.115).
Conclusion
This study established a significantly high prevalence of IR among HIV infected patients and a higher but non-significant prevalence among the HAART exposed group. Close monitoring of patients is recommended to reduce the risk of developing Diabetes Mellitus. Further research work is needed to identify ways of lowering the prevalence of IR in HIV infected persons."

Classification of diabetes mellitus (DM) into type 1 or type 2 is difficult in lean, young individuals. We studied the β-cell function, insulin resistance (IR) and autoimmunity in young patients with recent onset DM.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, we included patients (age below 35 years) with recent onset DM (<6 months) and normal body weight for evaluation. The detailed clinical examination was done to identify markers of IR. Autoimmune DM was diagnosed using glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), insulin autoantibody (IAA) and islet cell antibody (ICA). Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) models of HOMA-B and HOMA- IR were used for estimation of β-cell function and IR respectively. The patients were divided into four groups based on, the autoimmunity (A) and ketosis (K) as group 1 (A+K), group 2 (A−K+), group 3 (A+K−) and group 4 (A−K−). Appropriate statistical tests +)were used to analyze the results.
Results
The study population (n=75, all males) had a mean age of 28.9±4.3years, body mass index 20.6±1.9kg/m2, fasting plasma glucose 177.1±31.4mg/dl and HbA1c of 9.9±2.1% at presentation. The number of patients in groups 1 to 4 are 8, 5, 10 and 52 respectively (p<0.0001).

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has burdened health systems in the world to the value of 500 billion dollars/year. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4 Inhibitors) have been strongly associated with spending on the treatment of T2DM by the courts in Brazil. The aim of this study was to estimate the most cost-effective DPP-4 Inhibitor for T2DM treatment. A pharmacoeconomic study of cost-effectiveness was performed in a medium-sized municipality in Minas Gerais state, Brazil.
Methods
The data are from legalization in municipal health in 2013. The effectiveness of DPP-4 Inhibitors was measured by the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (A1c). The direct medical costs of drug and adverse drug reactions were identified. With these data, a cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) and construction of the decision tree for sensitivity analysis were performed.
Results
The representative of the most effective in reducing A1c gliptins was sitagliptin in combination with metformin, it was able to reduce A1c by 1.16% (1.09 to 1.22, CI 95%). The drug with the lowest cost was linagliptin, with a cost per patient/year of US$ 481.42. Sensitivity analysis performed by the decision tree shows that sitagliptin in association with metformin had the CER of US$ 1,506.75 per patient/year, to reduce A1c by 1%.
Conclusion
The most cost-effective DPP-4 Inhibitor was sitagliptin with metformin."

A descriptive, observational study was completed in a tertiary care hospital between November 2014 and March 2016. Fifty consecutive patients of Type 2-Diabetes Mellitus who had been on metformin therapy for at least three months were included in our study. Several Parameters were compared with vitamin B12 levels and severity of peripheral neuropathy (using Toronto Clinical Scoring System (TCSS) and Nerve Conduction Velocity). These included the duration of diabetes, duration of metformin usage, dietary history, and HbA1c levels. Definite B12 deficiency was defined as B12<150pg/ml and possible B12 deficiency as <220pg/ml.
Results
In our study, we found a negative correlation between duration of metformin use and Vitamin B12 levels(r=−0.40). The mean Vitamin B12 levels seen in our study was 212.3pg/mL. There is a positive correlation between the duration of metformin therapy and peripheral neuropathy (r=0.40). The mean TCSS score was 6.8. The percentage of patients with mild neuropathy was 28%, with moderate neuropathy was 20% and severe neuropathy in 12% of the patients. The average duration of metformin use in patients without peripheral neuropathy was 5.5yrs whereas the average length of metformin use in patients with peripheral neuropathy was 10.4 yrs.
Conclusion
Patients on long-term metformin therapy are at a high risk for Vitamin B12 deficiency and peripheral neuropathy. Interval Screening for peripheral neuropathy is recommended for patients on metformin even if Vitamin B12 levels appear to be normal."

Obesity is regulated by different metabolic factors like leptin, adiponectin insulin and neuropeptide orexin-A. The aim of this study is to assess the role of these hormones and their interrelationship with obesity in north Indian women.
Method
A total of 168 obese women with Body Mass Index (BMI)>30kg/m2 and 150 lean women (BMI<25kg/m2) as control were recruited in this study. Women with obesity were further subdivided into two groups according to their BMI, 71 overweight women with the BMI 25–29.9kg/m2 (mean±S.D: 27.87±0.71) and the 97 obese women with BMI>30kg/m2 (34.68±1.90). Orexin −A, leptin and adiponectin were estimated using quantitative sandwich enzyme linked immunoassay and insulin was estimated by using an immuno-radiometric assay.
Result
Orexin −A and adiponectin level were significantly lower however, leptin and inulin level were significantly higher in obese women as compared with control group. Further, the one- way group analysis showed that the orexin −A and adiponectin level were significantly lower but leptin and insulin level was significantly higher in obese women as compared to overweight and control group respectively.
Conclusion
Result showed that the level of adiponectin, leptin, orexin-A and insulin play an important role in the regulation of energy expenditure. In obesity, the activity of these peptides is disturbed."

To describe the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among older adults in Ecuador. A secondary objective was to examine the relationship between metabolic syndrome and its components and insulin resistance among non-diabetic participants.
Materials and methods
The National Survey of Health, Wellbeing, and Aging survey was used to examine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome according to demographic, behavioral, and health characteristics of the participants. Logistic regression models adjusted for covariates were used to examine the independent association of metabolic syndrome and its components and insulin resistance in non-diabetic older adults.
Results
Of 2298 participants with a mean age of 71.6 (SD 8.1) years, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 66.0% (95% CI, 62.6%, 69.3%) in women and 47.1% (95% CI, 43.2%, 50.9) in men. However, even higher prevalence rates were seen among literate individuals, residents from urban areas of the coastal and Andes Mountains region, obese subjects, those diagnosed with diabetes, and participants with≥2 comorbidities. Overall, abdominal obesity followed by elevated blood pressure were the metabolic syndrome components more prevalent and associated with insulin resistance among older Ecuadorians. Moreover, after adjustment for covariates, older adults defined as having metabolic syndrome had a 3-fold higher odds of having insulin resistance as compared with those without.
Conclusions
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is high among older adults in Ecuador. The present findings may assist public health authorities to implement programs of lifestyle and behavioral modification targeting older adults at increased risk for this cardio metabolic disorder."

The aim of present study was to assess the outcomes of multiple educational programs on glycemic control, quality of life and impact of diabetes in poorly controlled Type 1 Diabetic patients.
Participants and methods
A 12 months diabetes education programs were conducted every week for first one month then followed by every 3 months with follow up on improvement of HbA1c and QOL in T1D patients (n=54). Clinical characteristics were recorded at baseline visit. The QOL was evaluated by 15 set DQOL questionnaires in 40 consecutive patients at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months after education programs. The HbA1c level (%) was evaluated at same time point. Decrease in DQOL score was reported as improvement in QOL.
Results
The rate of patients response to educational programs was noted 74.07% (n=40) at end of the study (12 months). The prevalence of T1D was reported higher in men than in women. The overall DQOL score and HbA1c% level was significantly (P<0.05) decreased at 3, 6 and 12 months after educational programs. Patients exhibited greater satisfaction and diminished impact of diabetes after educational programs was observed after 3 months and it was continue up to end of study. The frequencies of self-monitoring of blood glucose were increased. Numbers of hypoglycemic and DKA events were decreased after educational programs when compared to baseline.
Conclusion
Results of study revealed that the appropriate education and counseling diminish impact of diabetes, improve QOL and help to achieve desired glycemic (HbA1c) level in poorly control T1D patients."

this study aimed to determine the most appropriate anthropometric indices for diagnosis of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its relationship with oxidative stress markers.
Material and methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015 on 108 employees working in Shahroud University of Medical Sciences. Demographics, anthropometric indices (BMI: Body mass index; WC: Waist circumference, WHR: Waist hip ratio, WHtR: Waist-to-height Ratio), Mets: and Then oxidative stress markers (total antioxidant capacity; TAC, Malondialdehyde; MDA, serum superoxide dismutase; SOD, catalase; Cat) were measured. All analyses were performed at a significant level of 0.05, using the SPSS Statistics 21 and Stata 12 software.
Result
The mean age of the participants was 41.4±7.8years. the mean values of different anthropometric indices in patients with metabolic syndrome were higher than those in subjects without MetS and this difference was significant. According to ROC curve the best marker for diagnosis of Mets was WHtR (Waist-to-height Ratio) and its cut off point was 0.54.Also, there was a positive correlation between WHtR and MDA serum levels. In addition, there was a negative correlation between WHtR and the levels of TAC, SOD, and CAT but it was not significant.
Conclusions
It seems that WHtR can be a valuable marker for predicting metabolic disorders and related diseases; moreover, it can be used for evaluation of oxidative stress level. Finally, the formula WC=height×0.54 as a simple tool for prevention of metabolic diseases can be used in university personnel."

To study the loss of diurnal variation in blood pressure in normotensive patients with Subclinical/overt hypothyroidism and effect of Levothyroxine (L-T4) treatment.
Materials and methods
In this interventional study Eighty patients between 17- 50 years with newly detected OH and SCH (74 women and 6 men) and nine euthyroid subjects (all men) with blood pressure <140/90 were recruited. All patients underwent 24h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) using ABPM machine before and after treatment with L-T4. Diurnal index (DI), Percent time elevation (PTE), Hyperbaric impact (HBI) were studied pre and post L-T4 treatment.
Results
Of the 89 subjects (22 SCH, 58 OH and 9 controls), 7 of the SCH and 30 of OH subjects reported back in follow up after L-T4 supplementation for evaluation. DI, HBI and PTE when compared at baseline between different groups (SCH- OH, SCH- control, OH- control) were insignificant. After L-T4 supplementation DI, HBI and PTE varied significantly with p value 0.007, 0.003 and 0.003 respectively between SCH- OH only. Post L-T4 analysis in SCH group was statistically insignificant (p-value 0.102) but a trend toward improvement in DI was noted (baseline and post treatment DI mean 7.00 and 13.00 respectively).
Conclusion
Loss of nocturnal dipping was found in patients with OH and SCH which was restored after L-T4 therapy only in patients with SCH and not with OH.
Treatment
of SCH patients with high cardiovascular risk may be beneficial in this setting and can be a new indication for LT4 therapy in SCH."

To determine the progression rates from metabolically healthy or unhealthy normal weight, overweight and obese phenotype to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a non-diabetic high risk population in Isfahan, Iran.
Methods
T2D incidence during a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.1 (2.3) years was examined among 1,982 non-diabetic first-degree relatives (FDR) of patients with T2D 30–70 years old. Participants were divided into 6 groups based on body mass index and metabolic syndrome component, except waist circumference, at baseline: metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically healthy overweight (MHOW), metabolically healthy obese (MHO), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW), metabolically unhealthy overweight (MUOW) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO).
Results
The MHO, MUOW, and MUO individuals at baseline were associated with incidence of T2D, independently of age and gender. MHO were 3 times (OR 2.96; 95% CI 1.07, 8.24) and MUOW were 2.75 times (95% CI 1.17, 6.45) more likely to develop T2D than those with MHNW. There was excess risk in MUO than MHO (OR 3.86; 95% CI 1.64, 9.11).
Conclusions
Obesity was a risk factor for T2D, even in the absence of any metabolic abnormalities. Metabolic abnormalities were a stronger predictor of incident T2D than obesity."

Observational studies evaluating the association between chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) have yielded inconclusive results.
Objective
The current meta-analysis was conducted to identify whether CHB infection plays a role in the risk of MetS and its components.
Methods
The electronic search of MEDLINE, PubMed Central, and EMBASE databases was systematically performed from their inception until February 2017 to identify all eligible studies. The most adjusted risk estimates and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations of chronic hepatitis B with MetS and its components were collected and analyzed.
Results
A total of 13 studies, with a total sample size of 138,994,999 subjects and 35,481,231 individuals with MetS were included in this Meta-analysis. The results of pooled analysis revealed that CHB infection is related to reduced risk of MetS (OR=0.83, 95%CI=0.71–0.79, random effects), with evidence of significant heterogeneity (I2=89%, P<0.001). This association was an age, gender, and ethnicity-dependent relationship. Moreover, CHB was associated with reduced risk of elevated blood pressure, reduced HDL-cholesterol, increased fasting glucose, and, most strongly with increased triglycerides in some subgroups. The sensitivity analyses confirmed the stability of the results.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis suggests that CHB is associated with decreased risk of MetS and some of its single components."

To assess the association between elevated serum ferritin levels and the presence of insulin resistance (IR) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in a population of individuals with no endocrine or metabolic disorders background.
Methods
Analytical cross-sectional study, carried out in adults of both sexes with no medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or other metabolic or endocrine disorder, who attended the outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru during 2012–2014 period. Impaired serum ferritin levels were defined as serum ferritin values >300μg/L in men and >200μg/L in women. IR was defined as a Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) value ≥3.8 and IGT was defined as an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) value between 126mg/dL and 199mg/dL. The reported association measure was the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Results
We analyzed 213 participants, the average age was 35.8±11.1years and 35.7% were males. The prevalence of impaired serum ferritin levels, IR and IGT in the population was 12.7%, 33.3% and 9.9% respectively. In the adjusted Poisson regression models, the prevalence of IR was higher among the group with impaired serum ferritin levels (PR=1.74; 95%CI:1.18–2.56); however, we found no association between impaired serum ferritin levels and IGT (PR=1.42; 95%CI:0.47–4.30).
Conclusions
Impaired levels of serum ferritin are associated with IR, nevertheless, not with IGT in a metabolically healthy population. Serum ferritin could be considered as an early marker of IR prior to the onset of glycaemia disorders."

This work aims to identify correlations between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on creatinine and/or cystatin C (Cr, CysC) with metabolic syndrome (MS) components in young adults, according to gender.
Material and methods
This is a cross sectional study, where young adults aged between 18 and 30 were matched by gender, age and body mass index. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation and blood sampling for laboratory measurements. MS was determined according to the JIS criteria. The eGFR was estimated using CKD-EPI equations (eGFRCr; eGFRCysC; eGFRCr-CysC).
Results
We evaluated 78 subjects with a mean age of 24.5 years. 10.2% had MS, with higher incidence among males (15.4% ♂ vs. 5.1% ♀). Elevated waist circumference was the MS component most observed. Significant correlations (Pearson; p<0.05) between eGFR and metabolic markers were observed only in males. In addition, we observed a significant association between the increase of MS components and the decay of eGFRCr and eGFRCr-CysC (zero vs. two or more components, ANOVA, p<0.05) only among males.
Conclusion
eGFR decay associated with components of MS and insulin resistance in young male adults could represent a worrying specific risk and indicate that further studies are needed to better understand these findings."

Patients with T2DM, with or without diabetic retinopathy were included in the study. Serum inflammatory cytokines, vascular growth factor were studied in different stages of DR.
Results
Patients with T2DM with and without diabetic retinopathy were compared. Patients with diabetic retinopathy had increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines CRP, TNF-alpha, as well as VEGF compared to serum levels of diabetic patients without retinopathy.
Conclusion
T2DM patients with retinopathy have higher levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines and VEGF compared to patients without retinopathy. These proinflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors are involved in the progression of DR and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The results showed the importance of inflammation and vascular endothelial growth factor in the progression of NPDR and PDR."

Comorbidity of non-communicable diseases carries a significant risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. With the rising burden of diabetes, hypertension and other risk factors, and ageing population in India, this is likely to pose a major threat to the health system. It is therefore essential to understand this high risk group. This article reports prevalence of comorbid diabetes and hypertension and its associated risk factors in the North Indian state of Punjab.
Methods
A household NCD STEPS survey was done in Punjab, India in a multistage stratified sample of 5127 individuals. All the subjects were administered the WHO STEPS questionnaire, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements. Every alternate respondent in the sample (n=2499) were assayed for blood glucose and lipid parameters.
Results
The prevalence of comorbid DM and HTN was 4.5% in the general adult population. DM, HTN and dyslipidemia co-existed in 1.8% of the population. Obesity and dyslipidemia are the most common comorbidities among persons with DM and HTN alone and comorbid DM and HTN. Factors strongly associated with comorbid DM and HTN include elderly age group, dyslipidemia, obesity and family history of DM.
Conclusions
The study reported high burden of comorbid diabetes and hypertension among the elderly, strongly associated with obesity and dyslipidemia. This emphasizes the role of nonpharmacological intervention such as weight reduction, physical activity, and dietary modification."

abstract = "Background/Aim
Cytokines are responsible for the modulation of immunological and inflammatory processes and play a significant role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) are considered as a pro inflammatory and interleukin-10 (IL-10) anti inflammatory have been shown to predict the risk of incident of CAD. Aim of present study is to examine the impact of the TNF-α and Il-10 levels on various components of the CAD.
Methods
Total 580 subjects were recruited in the present study out of which 290 diagnosed CAD subjects (Age 51.61±9.26; BMI 25.27±3.58) and 290 healthy controls (Age 51.72±9.48; BMI 24.02±7.42). Serum TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels were measured by ELISA.
Results
Data of present study revealed that CAD patients had higher frequency (p=0.001) of smoking (38.28%), Alcohol (21.03%), Diabetes (53.45%) and hypertension (48.28%) as compare to controls. Moreover, we have observed highly significant (p<0.05) difference in PR, BMI, DBP, DBP, Glucose, TC, TG, VLDL, LDL, TNF-α and TNF-α/IL-10. However, HDL and IL-10 were found lower in CAD.
Conclusion
The findings of present study suggest that the TNF-α/IL-10 ratio may play a vital role in the development of CAD of North Indian population."

abstract = "Background
Arterial stiffness is a principal cardiovascular risk factor. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a predisposing factor to arterial stiffness and persistent MetS circumstances can deteriorate the arterial stiffness severity. Low concentrations of plasma ghrelin are meticulously connected to arterial stiffness. This work targeted to judge the relationship between plasma ghrelin levels and intima-media thickness (IMT) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) as markers of arterial stiffness and inflammatory markers and in Saudi subjects with MetS.
Patients and methods
Eighty-four young adults were recruited from the visitors of the outpatient clinics of Taif hospitals, and then they were divided into a control group that involves subjects without MetS and a study group involving those with MetS. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, plasma ghrelin levels, fasting plasma glucose levels (FPG) and lipid profile were assessed. baPWV was measured by a volume plethysmograph while IMT was evaluated by ultrasonography.
Results
Plasma ghrelin values were significantly (P<0.001) decreased in the MetS group versus control group. Arterial stiffness was noticed in MetS group by significantly (P<0.01) increased IMT and baPWV (P<0.001) matched with control group. Plasma ghrelin concentrations were negatively associated with age, smoking, FPG, HbA1c, CRP, TNF-alpha, baPWV, and Lt Carotid IMT.
Conclusions
Depending on our outcomes showing the valuable properties of ghrelin in the cardiovascular system in patients with metabolic syndrome, it can be postulated that ghrelin may be associated with markers of atherosclerosis."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by insufficient insulin production or ineffective pancreatic secretions. In Ghana, the prevalence of DM was estimated to be 6.3% amongst men and women older than 30 years living in the Greater Accra region. The disease can be determined by various means including the use of the multistix that assesses the presence of glucose in urine.
Materials and methods
In this study, 100 subjects were sampled made up of 65% males and 35% females whose urine samples were verified using multistix.
Results
Most (63%) of the subjects diagnosed with the disease fell within the age ranges of 60–69 years and 70–79 years, thus establishing the fact that the incidence of the disease increases with increasing age and increasing body mass index (BMI) over above 25kg/m2. Some (44%) had a family history of diabetes. Other factors such as the socioeconomic status (SES) categories, physical activity levels and eating habits of the respondents played different roles in the occurrence of the disease.
Conclusion
The sex of the individual, however, did not have a major impact on the occurrence of the disease. This study confirmed that overweight body (BMI≥25kg/m2) especially of older ages above 50 years of have very strong link with the prevalence of diabetes mellitus."

This review examined whether maternal and paternal periconceptional nutrition effects an offspring's likelihood of developing chronic metabolic related conditions due to epigenetic imprinting.
Methods
A literature search was conducted in multiple science databases and limited to studies published after 2012, in English language and peer reviewed. The data from selected articles were extracted and a qualitative approach was employed due to heterogeneity of results.
Results
Newborns from obese fathers showed altered methylation overall and significant hypomethylation at the Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) gene. High maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was associated with altered offspring DNA methylation levels and gestational diabetes mellitus induced significantly increased methylation levels in offspring. Gestational weight gain was not associated with differentially methylated cord blood. Birth weight was higher in offspring exposed to famine in early gestation. Offspring born post maternal bariatric surgery showed a lower percentage of body fat and improved fasting insulin levels compared to siblings born pre-maternal bariatric surgery.
Conclusions
The available evidence suggests that poor maternal and paternal periconceptional nutrition can increase the risk of metabolic syndrome in offspring, through epigenetic imprinting. Potential parents should be advised that maintaining a healthy diet and BMI is likely to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome in offspring."

To describe the prevalence of abdominal obesity and its association with cardio metabolic risk factors among older adults in Ecuador.
Materials and methods
The present study used data from the National Survey of Health, Wellbeing, and Aging survey to examine the prevalence of abdominal obesity according to certain demographic, behavioral, and health characteristics of the participants. Logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to evaluate the association of abdominal obesity with cardio metabolic risk factors.
Results
Of 2053 participants aged 60 years and older, the prevalence of abdominal obesity was 65.9% (95% CI; 62.2%, 69.4%) in women and 16.3% (95% CI; 13.8%, 19.2%) in men. Notably, a higher prevalence of abdominal obesity was seen among residents in the urban areas of the country, those who reported their race as black or mulatto, individuals with sedentary lifestyle and obesity, and older adults with greater number of comorbidities. Moreover, after adjustment for potential confounders, women with abdominal obesity were 2.0, 2.8, and 1.6 times more likely to have diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and hypertriglyceridemia as compared with those without, respectively. Likewise, men with abdominal obesity had 51% and 22% higher rates of hypertension and diabetes than their non-obese counterparts, respectively.
Conclusions
the prevalence of abdominal obesity is high among older adults in Ecuador. Moreover, abdominal obesity is significantly associated with cardio metabolic risk factors. Therefore, further research is needed to evaluate sociodemographic and nutritional determinants of this emerging public health burden among older Ecuadorians."

abstract = "Background
There is evidence that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have an over-risk of cardiovascular disease. This may be mainly due to an increase in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS). The prevalence of MetS among adults in Algeria is 19.1%.
Objectives
The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of MetS among RA patients in Algeria. Another aim was to evaluate the relationship between MetS, inflammation biomarkers and disease scores.
Methods
The study was performed on a cohort of 249 patients meeting the ACR/EULAR criteria for RA, followed in 11 Algerian centers. The diagnosis of MetS was based on the NCEP/ATP III (MetS+ if ≥3/5) definition. Prevalence of MetS was calculated, and patients were divided in two groups (MetS+ and MetS-). Comparison between the groups was performed using a t-test.
Results
Among the 249 RA patients, 213 were females and 36 males of a mean age of 50.1±14.5years and a mean disease duration of 8.4±7.8years. The overall prevalence of MetS was 13.9% (CI95%: 9.5-20.1%); it was 14.3% in males and 13.8% in females. The ESR level was significantly higher in MetS+ patients than in MetS- patients (p=0.036).
Conclusion
In this multicenter study, unlike most studies on RA patients, the prevalence of MetS was as not higher in Algerian RA patients (13.9%) than in the Algerian general population (19.1%). Only ESR levels correlate with the presence of MetS, this may be due to the modest cohort size and needs to be confirmed."

Prospective study that included all patients submitted to elective colorectal cancer surgery between August 2015 and August 2016 at Hospital de Braga. Clinical and laboratory parameters evaluated pre-operatively were: central obesity, blood pressure, fasting glucose, triglycerides levels and HDL cholesterol levels. Any complications during the first 30-days after surgery were recorded (readmission, reintervention, anastomotic dehiscence, morbimortality).
Results
One hundred and thirty-four patients were included. Metabolic syndrome was diagnostic in 40.7% of patients with the ATPIII definition, 67.5% with the AHA definition and 67.0% with the IDF definition. At 30days after colorectal cancer surgery, 73.1% patients don’t have any complication, 15.7% have minor complications (grade I/II of Clavien-Dindo classification), 11.1% have major complications (grade III/IV/V of Clavien-Dindo classification) and 1.5% have died from surgical complications (grade V of Clavien-Dindo classification). The statistic analysis didn’t reveal any association between MS, or it’s different components, and surgical outcomes.

Methods
A total of 120 individuals participated in this cross sectional study: 60 patients with schizophrenia (26 males and 34 females) and 60 patients with bipolar I disorder (32 males and 28 females). The psychological disorders were diagnosed by some experienced psychiatrists according to the DSM-V. Furthermore, metabolic syndrome was diagnosed according to ATP III guidelines.
Results
Metabolic syndrome prevalence among schizophrenic and bipolar I patients was 28 and 36 percent, respectively; the disparity in prevalence is not significant. According to the results, compared to their male counterparts, females were more prone significant to metabolic syndrome. Moreover, diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher among bipolar I patients. On the other hand, schizophrenic males were observed to have higher fasting blood sugar levels in comparison to bipolar I males patients. Age, consumption of second generation antipsychotics or antidepressants, and the duration of the disorder were found to be related to metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
This study showed that metabolic syndrome is not more prevalent among bipolar I patients, compared to those with schizophrenia. Also, women are more likely to be affected by the syndrome. A number of factors such as age, consumption of medication, and duration of the disorder are associated with the likelihood of the syndrome."

Methods
A retrospective case-control study was conducted using clinical and biochemical profiles of patients with diabetes at the Endocrinology Centre and City Clinical Hospital No. 40, Ekaterinburg, Russia.
Results
The total study sample included 75 subjects. The average age (SD) was 48.2 (5.6) years, and the mean duration of diabetes (SD) was 6.2 (2.4) years. The most common type of extrasystoles were the single supraventricular extrasystoles, observed in 72.29% of cases (vs 38.89% in the control group) and paired supraventricular extrasystoles, which were identified in 30% of cases (vs 19.44% in the control group). Ventricular cardiac arrhythmias in the form of ventricular extrasystoles (VE) were identified in 25.71% of cases (13.89% in the control group).
Conclusions
This study revealed the signs of the morphological restructuring of the right chambers of the heart and a relatively high prevalence of supraventricular arrhythmias in the early stages of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, according to the results, the incidence of some types of supraventricular arrhythmias and the occurrence of tachycardia episodes in patients with type 2 diabetes mostly depends on the restructuring of the right chambers of the heart, which may be caused by the peculiarities of the cardiac innervation, with the higher density of choline and adrenergic plexuses in the right chambers."

The study was primarily aimed at investigating the association of Magnesium and Zinc levels in the serum of adult Non- obese and Obese type 2 diabetic patients, with particular reference to thyroid comorbidity.
Methods
108 patients with T2DM of both genders (24 Non obese and 84 Obese) were enrolled from a tertiary health care unit in Puducherry. The cardio-metabolic risk factors were assessed through body mass index, Waist hip ratio, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, lipid profile and glycated haemoglobin. Zinc and Magnesium were quantitated. Insulin resistance was by Homeostasis model assessment. Serum free T4, T3 and TSH were also measured.
Results
In non-obese type 2 diabetic group, Glycated haemoglobin had a strong positive correlation with free T4(r=0.784; p=0.003).TSH also depicted a positive association with HOMA-IR (r=0.924; p<0.001); whereas,T3 and Insulin had negative correlation with Magnesium (r=−0.599* and r=−0.620*; p 0.04 and 0.031). The levels of Zinc and Magnesium in the serum of obese diabetic patients had a positive correlation among them (r=0.565#; p<0.001). TAG/HDL ratio a measure of small dense LDL is positively correlated with LDL in both groups (r=0.881 and 0.912) with p value<0.001 for both.
Conclusion
Correlation among Glycemic control, Insulin resistance, Thyroid hormones, divalent cations and dyslipidemia depict differential characteristics in obese and non–obese type2 diabetes with Thyroid comorbidity."

Identification of at risk individuals using simple screening tools like Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) and appropriate life style interventions could greatly help in preventing or delaying the onset of diabetes and thus reducing the burden of disease.
Material and method
450 individuals >20years who consented to participate were selected randomly from three anganwadis of urban area of Rohtak city. Demographic characteristics and anthropometric measurements such as weight, height and waist circumference were taken. BMI was calculated. IDRS developed by Mohan et al. was applied for categorizing the individuals as high risk, moderate risk and low risk. World Health Organization (WHO) criterion of fasting blood glucose ≥126mg/dl was used for diagnosing diabetes.
Results
54% of individuals were categorized as high risk followed by 37.6% as moderate risk as per IDRS risk score. Prevalence of diabetes was more in ≥50years age group (28.6%) as compared to 35–49 years (14.2%) and 20–35 years age group (6.0%). Individuals with no physical activity had significantly high prevalence of diabetes as compared to mild or moderate physical activity (P 0.004). Similarly, males with waist circumference ≥100cm and females with ≥90cm had significantly high prevalence of diabetes (P 0.000 and P 0.005). On multiple logistic regression analysis age, family history of diabetes and BMI were independent predictors of diabetes.
Conclusion
Diabetes is a rising epidemic. Early screening and appropriate interventions at the start are needed for control of disease and risk factor modifications."

We aimed to investigate the association of eating meals while television viewing (TVV) and screen-based behaviors with cardio metabolic risk factors (CRFs) among school-aged children in Shiraz.
Materials and methods
This cross-sectional study was done on 409 primary school children (217 boys), aged 6–9 years. Physical activity, time spent on screen-based behaviors and frequency of eating meals while TVV were measured using a questionnaire. Anthropometric indices, fasting blood sugar (FBS), blood lipids, blood pressure (BP), dietary intakes and physical activity were assessed. Association of eating while TVV with CRFs were assessed using linear regression, adjusted for potential confounders. All statistical analysis were conducted using the Stata 13 software.
Results
Fully adjusted model showed that TVV time had significant positive association with waist circumferences (WC), and BP (p <0.05). Also, we found an inverse relationship between using Computer and Video games with TG level (β=−0.3; CI: −0.64, −0.09). Children who ate two or more breakfast meal while TVV had higher WC (β=2.02; CI: 0.51, 3.53) and FBS (β=3.58; CI: 0.39, 6.78) compared to who never ate breakfast while TVV. After adjustment for Screen time and BMI, eating snacks while TVV was positively associated with FBS and systolic BP. However, Eating dinner and lunch while TVV were not significantly associated with any of CRFs after adjustment for confounders.
Conclusions
We found that both eating breakfast and snacks while TVV were associated with WC, FBS and BP in children. Also, excessive TVV was associated with WC and BP."

To determine the levels of serum homocysteine and its association with insulin resistance among T2DM patients at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile Ife Nigeria.
Methods
It was a cross sectional study. It involved consecutive recruitment of 100 T2DM subjects with 100 age and sex matched controls. The fasting plasma glucose, serum creatinine, fasting lipid profile, glycosylated haemoglobin levels, fasting serum insulin and plasma homocysteine concentration were done. Insulin resistance was also determined. SPSS version 17.0 was used for data analysis.
Results
The mean age of subjects was not significantly different from controls. (58.9±8.3 vs. 59.0±8.3years, p=0.926 respectively). Mean Homocysteine level (tHcy) was significantly higher among T2DM subjects compared to controls (27.4±12.1 and 8.3±3.2μmol/L respectively, p=0.0001). Hyperhomocystinaemia was commoner among diabetic subjects compared with controls (81% vs. 5%, p<0.0001). T2DM with hyperhomocystinaemia were more likely to have poorer glucose control profile using glycated haemoglobin (7.4±1.9 vs 6.4±1.4%, p=0.04) and fasting blood glucose 8.6±2.2 vs 7.5±2.4mmol/L p=0.047 and insulin resistance (4.4±4.3 vs. 2.0±0.6, p=0.02) compared with T2DM with normohomocystenaemia. There were significant associations between hyperhomocystinaemic T2DM patients and IR, HbA1c, TC, TG and LDL cholesterol.
Conclusion
The study showed higher homocysteine levels in T2DM than controls. Homocysteine level is worsened by increasing insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and poor glucose control. Homocysteine level is a potential cardiovascular risk marker in type 2 diabetic mellitus subjects."

A healthy individual, with proper glucose regulation has an ability to switch between burning fat and carbohydrates. It has been suggested that signaling errors within this homeostatic system, characterized by impaired switching of substrate oxidation from glucose to fat in response to insulin, can contribute to the etiology of metabolic syndrome and occurs before the development of type II diabetes. Glucose regulation with restored insulin sensitivity facilitated through clinically regulated, benign dietary ketosis (BDK), may significantly reduce, regulate and reverse the adverse pathologies common to MetS and obesity. The study assessed if prolonged maintenance of induced and controlled physiological, dietary ketosis, would reverse pathological processes induced by MetS including a reduction in fasting triglycerides, BMI (body mass index) and body fat mass (BFM), weight, a significant decrease and/or normalization of hemoglobin A1c (HgA1c) and an increase in resting metabolic rate (RMR) and blood ketones. A group of 30 adults, previously diagnosed with MetS by their primary care physician, were randomly prescribed to one of three groups: a sustained ketogenic diet with no exercise, standard American diet (SAD) with no exercise or SAD with 3-5 days per week of exercise (30 min.). The results demonstrated that the change over time from week 0 to week 10 was significant (p=0.001) in the ketogenic group for weight, body fat percentage, BMI, HgA1c and ketones.

Recent studies have shown increasing prevalence of dysglycemia in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The present study was planned to study the prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes in RA patients from a tertiary care centre in Haryana, India.
Methods
150 diagnosed cases of rheumatoid arthritis which were on follow up in Rheumatology clinic from last one year and equal number of age, sex matched controls were recruited for the study. FPG, 2h plasma glucose level after 75g oral glucose tolerance test and HbA1c were estimated in all the subjects. In RA patients c-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF) and Anti-cyclic citrullinated (Anti CCP) antibodies were also measured and disease activity was assessed by using (DAS28 joint counts) and CDAI.
Results
Patients with RA had statistically significant higher waist circumference, hip circumference and BMI as compared to control group. Prevalence of glucose intolerance in RA patients and control group was 14.67% and 6.67% respectively which was statistically significant (p=0.025). The prevalence of pre-diabetes was in RA group was not significant statistically. There was higher disease activity in glucose intolerant (GI) RA cases as compared to normal glucose tolerant (NGT) RA cases. The most commonly used drug combination among RA patients was MTX+HCQ+SAAZ (49 patients, 32.67%). Maximum glucose intolerance was observed in patients who were on Non-HCQ drug combinations.
Conclusions
There is elevated prevalence of glucose intolerance among RA patients that is related to high disease activity, visceral adiposity and drugs usage."

Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 105 patients with type II diabetes whom participated in the coronary artery disease risk factor study in Kerman, Iran (KERCARDS). Patients with type II diabetes were called and those with clinical symptoms of CTS were included in the study, and median nerve indices were measured according to standard electro diagnosis tests. GEE statistical model was used to compare median nerve indices among diabetic patients with and without metabolic syndrome. All statistical analysis was done using SPSS 20.0.
Results
The mean age of participants was 57.57±9.53. There was no significant difference between the left and right hand regarding median nerve indices except median nerve motor amplitude (MA). Furthermore, components of metabolic syndrome including BMI and LDL were determined as risk factors for CTS according to several indices.
Conclusion
Components of metabolic syndrome had more influence on sensory indices than motor indices and primary control of these components might prevent dysfunction of sensory neurons and also motor neurons in advanced stages among diabetic patients."

Chronic kidney disease related-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) has been poorly studied in pre-dialysis Indian CKD population. There are limited data on the pattern of these disturbances in diabetic CKD patients. Therefore, a study was conducted to find out the profile of mineral bone disorders in T2DM patients with pre-dialysis CKD.
Methods
In this cross-sectional design, diabetic patients with newly-diagnosed stage 4 and 5 CKD were evaluated. Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25 hydroxy vitamin D and total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured in all patients. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
Results
A total of 72 eligible patients participated (44 males, 28 females; age 54.2±11.7). Patients with CKD Stage 5 had a lower level of corrected serum calcium and significantly higher level of inorganic phosphorus, total ALP and iPTH as compared to stage 4 patients. Overall, 38.5% were hypocalcemic, 31.43% were hyperphosphatemic. 24.2% of CKD subjects were vitamin D deficient (<10ng/ml) and 41.4% having vitamin D insufficiency (10–20ng/ml). In stage 4, hyperparathyroidism (iPTH>110pg/ml) was detected in nearly 43% of patients. In stage 5, only 32% patients was found to have hyperparathyroidism (iPTH>300pg/ml). There was a good correlation between iPTH and total ALP (r=0.5, p=0.0001) in this cohort. 25 (OH) vitamin D was inversely correlated with ALP (r=−0.39, P=0.001) and showed negative correlation with urine ACR (r=−0.37, P=0.002). As a group, the osteoporotic CKD subjects exhibited higher iPTH (220.1±153.8 vs. 119±108pg/ml, p<0.05) as compared to those who were osteopenic or had normal bone density. There was significant correlation between BMD and iPTH (adjusted r=−0.436; P=0.001). In the multivariate regression model, we found intact PTH to predict BMD even after adjustment of all the confounders.
Conclusion
The current study showed that adynamic bone disease is prevalent even in pre-dialysis CKD population. High bone turnover disease may not be the most prevalent type in diabetic CKD. However, it could contribute to the development of osteoporosis in CKD subjects. Serum total ALP can serve as a biochemical marker to identify pattern of bone turnover where intact PTH is not available."

Screening of family members is an important method to identify individuals at risk. Therefore, this study was planned to assess the atherosclerotic risk factors in first-degree relatives of patients with ischemic stroke.
Methodology
Case group included 40 first-degree relatives of ischemic stroke patients between 30 and 50 years of age. Forty age and gender matched apparently healthy subjects without major risk factors were recruited as controls. Their blood samples were analysed for routine biochemical parameters, Fasting Insulin, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and Homocysteine.
Results
First-degree relatives showed dyslipidemia (High total cholesterol, elevated Low Density Lipoprotein and elevated Non-High Density Lipoprotein), hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance compared to controls. They had high levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (p=0.045). There was positive correlation between fasting insulin and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance with high sensitivity C-reactive protein among first-degree relatives.
Conclusion
First-degree relatives of ischemic stroke patients exhibited hyperinsulinemia, Insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Insulin resistance, a low grade inflammatory state that leads to increased C-reactive protein which triggers the development of atherosclerosis. So screening for insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in first-degree relatives of ischemic stroke patients may help in preventing adverse vascular events."

Studies have shown that testosterone and estradiol (E2) are associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). To our knowledge, few studies, if any about the association of endogenous sex hormones with MetS have been done in Egypt.
Aim
To study the relation between endogenous sex hormones and MetS among Egyptian males.
Subjects and method
For the study, 80 Egyptian males were enrolled: 40 males with MetS and 40 healthy age-matched males. Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were taken for both groups. FBG, TC, HDL-C, TG, testosterone, and E2 levels were determined; LDL-C was calculated.
Results
Males with MetS had significantly lower testosterone levels and significantly higher E2 levels compared to those without MetS (p value 0.0001). The lowest quartile of testosterone was most prevalent among males with MetS (19/40 males, 47.5%) compared to those without MetS (0/40 males, 0%, p value 0.011). Estradiol in the third quartile was most prevalent among males with MetS (19/40 males, 47.5%) compared to those without MetS (1/40 males, 2.5%, p value 0.0001). Serum testosterone and E2 levels were independent predictors of MetS with optimum cut off value (≤2.37ng/ml) for testosterone and (>16.78pg/ml) for E2.
Conclusion
Endogenous testosterone and estradiol are independently associated with MetS with potential utility as predictors of MetS."

abstract = "Background and aims
The present study was to investigate the association between serum acylation stimulating protein (ASP) level with metabolic risk factors in North Indian obese women.
Methods
This is a case control study, total n=322 women aged between 20 and 45 years (n=162 with metabolic syndrome & n=160 without metabolic syndrome) were recruited for the study according to National Cholesterol Education Program Treatment Panel (NCEPATP) guidelines. Serum ASP level were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.
Results
Results indicated that circulating ASP and other metabolic risk factors (waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose etc) were significantly higher in women with metabolic syndrome (WmetS) than in women without syndrome (WometS) (p<0.001). Furthermore circulating ASP was significantly higher possitively correlated with waist circumference (r=0.51, p<0.001), triglyceride (r=0.56, p<0.001), glucose (r=0.70, p<0.001), and negatively correlated with high density lipoprotein(r=−0.56, p<0.001) in women with metabolic syndrome.
Conclusions
Conclusively circulating ASP was found to be significantly associated with hyperlipidemia, obesity and obesity related disorders in North Indian obese women."

abstract = "Background
By high prevalence of inactivity, particularly in diabetic patients, the need to effective interventions to promote physical activity is essential. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of education based on health promotion model (HPM) through multimedia on the physical activity in diabetic patients.
Method
In this quasi-experimental study, 76 patients with type II diabetes were evaluated (40 patents in intervention group and 36 patients in control group). The intervention group members and a friend or a family member, that could be supportive in physical activity, received teaching CD based on health promotion model. Both group members at the beginning of the study, two weeks and three months after the training, completed questionnaires. After data collection, statistical analysis was conducted using independent T-test, chi-square test, and repeated measurement of ANOVA.
Results
Finding showed that self-efficacy (P<0.001), health status (p=0.032), benefits (P<0.001) and friends support in physical activity (P<0.001) were perceived to be higher, and barrier of physical activity (P<0.001) was perceived to be lower in multimedia group compared to control group 3 months after training. There was a significant difference in average of metabolic equivalent of task (MET) between two groups after the intervention (P<0.001).
Conclusion
Planning of education based on the HPM and implementation through multimedia can change belief about physical activity and increase participation in physical activity."

abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
Type 2 DM is rapidly rising as a global health care problem that threatens to reach pandemic levels by 2030. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disease with no cure and chronic disease that results in major morbidity and mortality. The main objective of this study is to evaluate postprandial plasma glucose level and to determine factors affect on postprandial plasma glucose level among type 2 diabetes outpatients attending endocrinology clinics at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Teaching Hospital.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The study design was observational prospective longitudinal follow-up study, the study was conducted with sample of 1077 type 2 diabetes mellitus outpatient recruited via attended the diabetes clinics at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM) in Kelantan. Post prandial plasma glucose (PPG) parameter to measure the glycaemic control. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the independent variables that affect the PPG control.
RESULTS
About 426 (39.6%) of the patients did not achieve the optimal postprandial plasma glucose level (<10mmol/l). In this study, the possible factors that affect postprandial plasma glucose levels (PPG) were found to be gender (OR=0.77) and the duration of diabetes (OR=1.12).
CONCLUSION
It has been found that gender and the duration of diabetes are the factors affecting PPG. New strategy to improve the current status of control of diabetes is needed. The study recommends that health-care providers should pay more attention to type 2 DM male patients and patients who had diabetic for long time."

abstract = "Aims
Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of antidiabetic drugs that affect serum electrolytes levels. The aim of this review is the detailed presentation of the associated mechanisms of the SGLT2 inhibitors-induced electrolyte abnormalities.
Materials and methods
Eligible trials and relevant articles published in PubMed (last search in July 2017) are included in the review.
Results
SGLT2 inhibitors induce small increases in serum concentrations of magnesium, potassium and phosphate. The small increase in serum phosphate concentration may result in reduced bone density and increased risk of bone fractures, mainly seen with canagliflozin, but recent meta-analyses did not show increased risk of bone fractures with SGLT2 inhibitors.
Conclusion
The increases in serum electrolytes levels may play a role in the cardiovascular protection that has been recently reported with empagliflozin and canagliflozin."

abstract = "Background
Hypomagnesaemia has been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications. The present study investigated the association of hypomagnesaemia with T2DM and its complications in patients hailed mostly from the western hilly region of Nepal.
Methods
This study was conducted among 150 type 2 diabetic patients and 150 of non-diabetic controls between May to September 2016. Relevant demographic, anthropometric, physiological and biochemical variables were measured using standard protocols. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS version 17.0.
Results
Hypomagnesaemia (1.7±0.2mg/dl) was present in 50% of diabetic patients and none in the healthy controls (2.0±0.2mg/dl). It was inversely correlated with levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (r=−0.299), total cholesterol (r=−0.219), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (r=−0.168) and creatinine (r=−0.215) and directly correlated with serum creatinine based glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcr) (r=0.196). Subjects with hypomagnesaemia were significantly older (57.4±11.5years) and had higher levels of HbA1c (8.4±1.2%) and serum total cholesterol (248.3±72.0mg/dl). The methods of diabetes control did not have a significant influence on serum magnesium level. Patient’s age (OR: 1.05 (95% CI-1.01–1.09)), poor glycemic control (OR: 6.78 (95% CI-2.56–17.95)) and low eGFRcr (OR: 4.89 (95% CI-1.78–13.40)) were the significant predictors of hypomagnesaemia.
Conclusion
Half of type 2 diabetic population under study had hypomagnesaemia without regard to the method of diabetes control. Old age, poor glycemic control, and low eGFRcr were the significant predictors of low serum magnesium in these patients. Besides their regular anti-diabetic treatment, clinicians should also consider dietary supplementation of magnesium to prevent further complications of diabetes in these patients."
