abstract = "Shear wave sonoelastography is a valuable additional technique in differentiation between benign and malignant breast lesions. In this paper, a hypothesis of the potential role of this additional ultrasound technique as a very useful tool in differentiation of a medullary breast cancer subtype is proposed. Medullary breast cancer is a rare subtype, difficult for diagnosing, due to its benign radiologic features that can mislead to the wrong conclusion. After analyzing the results of nine patients diagnosed with medullary breast cancer and in comparison with two control groups (invasive ductal cancer of no specific type and fibroadenoma), we concluded that this breast cancer subtype shows specific elastography features based on qualitative and quantitative values."

The current therapies for DW include glucose regulation, wound debridement, pressure off-loading, surgeries, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, maggot therapy, and so on. However, the majority are not meeting all the prerequisites of DW because of extensive pathology and cost associated with the strategies. So, to overcome the problems related to the existing conventional therapies, we hypothesized to repurpose the current drugs, which can target a receptor having a considerable role in the progression of DW might be beneficial. One major challenge of DW is multifaceted pathophysiology includes prolonged inflammation, increased infections, decreased cell proliferation, and migration. Many shreds of evidence disclosed that inhibition of GSK-3β could result in reduced inflammation and infection, followed by increased cell proliferation and migration. Thus, we selected the GSK-3β receptor as a ubiquitous target for the treatment of multifactorial pathophysiology of DW. In the current hypothetical study, we investigated the use of rosiglitazone as a therapeutic modulator against the GSK-3β receptor. To validate our hypothesis, computational studies such as molecular docking and MMGBSA were performed. From the in silico methods, it is evident that rosiglitazone established a higher binding affinity against the selected receptor. Further, the Molecular Dynamic simulation study has revealed stable interaction of rosiglitazone against GSK-3β complex. Thus, rosiglitazone might be a drug of choice in the therapeutic management of DW."

We hypothesized that the cases of all subtypes of chondroma have to be investigated in complex and that obtaining combined data from a large cohort of cases may explain the logic of chondroma distribution and may answer the question of why the hand is the main target of the tumor. We retrospectively analyzed 1529 cases of various subtypes of chondroma. Enchondroma was the most frequent type (65.4%) and the hand was the main target location (49.8% of all cases). The right side of the body was affected in 900 cases (58.9%) and in 629 cases (41.1%) the left side was affected (p=0.03). The general results for tumor distribution are as follows: head and extremities – 92.8%; head, hands, and feet – 71.8%; and hands and feet – 62.8%. In the hand and the feet, multiple chondromas were distributed along the same digital ray in all cases. The anatomical distribution of various subtypes of chondroma follows “the periphery of the being”, the uneven lateral distribution, and the “same digital ray” patterns that permits to suggest that genetic mutations affecting the development of the body during the embryonic period are the main etiological component for this tumor."

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a highly heterogeneous mental disorder that could affect mental capacity and requires different treatment methods. The purpose of this meta-analysis study was to evaluate the OCD subjects’ intelligence quotient (IQ) and the effect of different treatments on OCD.
Methods
Through a systematic literature search up to December-2019, 108-studies were identified, with 8049-subjects with 6719-OCD subjects. The studies identified were 45 reporting IQs in OCD and 38 reporting comparisons between selective-serotonin reuptake-inhibitors (SSRIs) to placebo in the treatment of OCD, 9 reporting comparison between SSRIs to each other, 8 reporting comparison between cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to placebo and 8 reporting comparison between CBT to SSRIs. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated comparison was made according to the study content using a continuous method with a random or fixed-effects model.
Results
Subjects with OCD had significantly lower IQ (OR, −3.74; 95% CI, −4.83 to −2.64) than normal subjects. SSRIs (OR, −4.09; 95% CI, −4.87 to −3.30) and CBT (OR, −15.13; 95% CI, −19.27 to −10.99) had better effect than placebo in OCD treatment. No significant difference were found between different types of SSRIs (OR, -0.42; 95% CI, −1.32–0.49) or between CBT and SSRIs (OR, −1.99; 95% CI, −4.20 to 0.22) with non-significant better values favoring CBT.
Conclusions
The IQ of the OCD subjects was significantly lower than in normal subjects. The SSRIs and the CBT had a significant effect on treating OCD. Different SSRIs are similar in their effect on OCD. More studies are required to separate between CBT and SSRIs' insignificant differences."

We postulate that in FM disturbance of neurotransmitter balances at the brain’s insula not only leads to aberrant pain processing but could also govern other associated symptoms. Symptoms might arise from central nervous system dysregulation mediated through an imbalance between the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the inhibitory transmitter gamma-amino butyric acid. The insula could also have a leading role in the dysregulation of heart rate and blood pressure, bladder and bowel symptoms, and anxiety and sleep disturbances which are experienced by many FM patients. The presented hypothesis explains how the diverse FM-associated symptoms could be linked, and puts the brain’s insula forward as a possible therapeutic target to be further explored for FM."

This limitation is exacerbated by a focus on the dominant somatic mutation theory (that driver mutations cause cancer) with little consideration of alternative theories of carcinogenesis. The recently proposed detached pericyte hypothesis explains many puzzling phenomena in cancer biology for which the somatic mutation theory offers no obvious explanation. These puzzling phenomena include foreign-body tumorigenesis, the link between denervation and cancer, tumors in transgenic mice that lack the inducing mutation, and non-genotoxic carcinogens. The detached pericyte hypothesis postulates that (1) a carcinogen or chronic inflammation causes pericytes to detach from blood cell walls, (2) some detached pericytes develop into myofibroblasts which alter the extracellular matrix (3) some detached pericytes develop into mesenchymal stem cells, (4) some of the mesenchymal stem cells adhere to the altered extracellular matrix (5) the altered extracellular matrix disrupts regulatory controls, causing the adjacent mesenchymal stem cells to develop into tumors. Results from experimental studies support the detached pericyte hypothesis. If the detached pericyte hypothesis is correct, pericytes should play a key role in metastasis – a testable prediction. Recent experimental results confirm this prediction and motivate a proposed experiment to partially test the detached pericyte hypothesis. If the detached pericyte hypothesis is correct, it could lead to new strategies for cancer prevention."

This prospective study included 75 patients who completed a patient-reported outcome questionnaire. Among these, 46 patients completed an olfactory evaluation based on the duration of anosmia and dysgeusia. The olfactory evaluation revealed that 24% (N = 18) of patients had mild hyposmia, 13% (N = 10) had moderate hyposmia, 30% (N = 23) had severe hyposmia, 32% (N = 24) had anosmia, and 100% had dysgeusia (N = 75). The viral load significantly decreased throughout the 17 days following the onset of the olfactory disorder. The purpose of this study was to understand whether patients with COVID-19 can recover olfactory and gustatory function, in contrast to patients with other rhinoviruses and inflammatory diseases such as rhinosinusitis chronic and rhinosinusitis with polyps. These preliminary clinical findings indicate that the relatively rapid recovery of olfactory and gustative function can mean a resolution of viral infection in most patients. The present study suggests that coronavirus can induce olfactory dysfunction but not permanent damage. Olfactory and gustatory functional impairment has been recognized as a hallmark of COVID-19 and may be an important predictor of clinical outcome. Our study supports the need to add anosmia and dysgeusia to the list of symptoms used in screening tools for possible COVID-19 infection."

Besides, patients also complain about the burning sensation in the oral cavity and xerostomia. These symptoms have a major impact on the functional and psychological domains of oral health-related quality of life. However, the pathogenesis of xerostomia in OSMF is not yet well established. In our routine histopathology practice, we observed fibrosis surrounding minor salivary glands, distended acini, obliteration of acinar lumen and loss of interstitial spaces. Based on these features, we hypothesized that fibrosis in OSMF drives localized peripheral autonomous neuropathy in minor salivary glands, which leads to dysfunctional myoepithelial cells. These dysfunctional myoepithelial cells will unable to contract and expel saliva out of the salivary secretary unit, thus leading to xerostomia. In the present paper, experiments are recommended to prove this hypothesis, which can be exploited in the future for the development of appropriate drugs."

The elucidation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that converts angiotensin (Ang) II into Ang (1–7) led to the discovery of the cardio-protective axis of the RAS. In addition, novel components of the system, Angiotensin A (Ang A) and alamandine have been identified. Like Ang (1–7), alamandine is a vasodilator and can counteract the effects of Ang II by increasing nitric oxide release from the endothelium and decreasing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH)-related superoxide production. Theoretically, alamandine can be derived from Ang (1–7) by decarboxylation of the N-terminal aspartic acid residue to alanine, but the enzyme responsible for this is still unknown. To date, no human or mammalian enzyme with the assigned decarboxylase activity has been identified. However, several bacterial enzymes capable of converting aspartate to alanine have been reported. Therefore, we hypothesize that a bacterial enzyme, most likely present in the microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract, the heart, or systemic circulation could metabolize Ang II, and/or Ang 1–7, to Ang A and alamandine, respectively, in mammals."

Though all nations of the world have been affected by this disease, there have been marked cross-national variations in prevalence, severity and mortality rates. Various explanations, based on demographic, social and climatic factors, have been suggested to account for this variability, but these remain unverified to date. Based on recent research findings suggesting that human enterocytes may serve as a point of entry for SARS-CoV-2, leading to intestinal viral replication, this paper puts forward the hypothesis that prior intestinal infection with coronaviruses, either symptomatic or asymptomatic, may moderate this process and minimize the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This hypothesis is supported by evidence on the gastrointestinal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and related infections, on the geographical patterns observed in the variability of COVID-19 mortality, and on the occurrence and geographical distribution of outbreaks of diarrheal disease, as well as asymptomatic infection, with human coronaviruses as verified by direct or serological testing. Preliminary supporting evidence based on national and international health statistics is presented, along with suggestions on more robust methods by which this hypothesis may be tested. If the proposal put forth in this paper can be confirmed either wholly or in part, it would have significant implications in terms of strategies aimed at minimizing the severity of COVID-19 in a clinical setting."

The presence of generalized pain, among IBS symptoms, caused the most robust increase in the likelihood of fibromyalgia (80%). The symptoms which were increasing the possibility of fibromyalgia were mostly generalized pain, high WHOQOL total score, family history of cancer, and loss of workforce at admission. IBS is a condition that affects the daily life quality of individuals and is often a condition that can be confused or associated with other diseases. Primary care physicians should approach patients holistically, especially in patients with generalized pain, family history of cancer, loss of workforce at admission, and more careful about fibromyalgia in patients with high WHOQOL total score.

Anxiety does not appear to be a consequence of diagnosis or the motoric symptoms of the disorder and can manifest as Generalised Anxiety Disorder, phobias or panic attacks. At present, the neural underpinnings of anxiety disorders in Parkinson’s disease is unknown. Here, we make the novel proposal that the superior colliculus (SC), one component of a rapid, reflexive threat detection system in the brain, consisting of the colliculus, pulvinar and amygdala, becomes hyper-responsive to sensory stimuli following dopamine denervation of the striatum in Parkinson’s disease. This in turn leads to heightened responses to existing threat-related stimuli (giving rise to phobias and panic attacks), and heightened responses to anticipated threats (giving rise to Generalised Anxiety Disorder). This proposal is supported by a range of evidence, in particular elevated visual responses in the SC in an animal model of Parkinson’s disease and in Parkinson’s disease itself. Also facilitated saccadic eye movements (prosaccades, express saccades and fixational saccades) and increased distractibility in Parkinson’s disease, both of which involve the SC. Identifying one potential locus of change in the brain in Parkinson’s disease relevant to anxiety gives a potential target for interventions to combat a non-motor symptom that has a substantial negative effect on quality of life in the disorder."

Clinical data show that in addition to respiratory system damage, some male patients with COVID-19 are also accompanied by abnormal renal function and even renal damage. As the main receptor of syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is also found to be highly expressed not only in respiratory mucosa and alveolar epithelial cells, but also in renal tubule cells, testicular Leydig cells and seminiferous tubule cells. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has the possibility of infecting the male reproductive system, and the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the patient's semen further confirms this theory. In previous studies, it has been found that ACE2 has the ability to regulate autophagy. Not only that, recent studies have also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection can also lead to a reduction in autophagy. All of these associate SARS-CoV-2 with autophagy. Furthermore, autophagy has been shown to have an effect on male reproduction in many studies. Based on these, we propose the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 affects male reproductive function by regulating autophagy. This hypothesis may provide a new idea for future treatment of COVID-19 male patients with reproductive function injury, and it can also prompt medical staff and patients to consciously check their reproductive function."

Apart from ACE-2, recently EMMPRIN, has been regarded as a target for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) attachment and entry into the host cell. Since one of the routes of entry for the virus is the oral cavity, it becomes imperative to percept oral comorbidities such oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) in terms of EMMPRIN as a target for SARS-CoV-2. In the present paper, it is proposed that OSCC, by the virtue of upregulation of EMMPRIN expression, increases the susceptibility to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In turn, COVID-19 in OSCC patients causes exhaustion of EMMPRIN receptor due to binding with ‘S’ receptor leading to a downregulation of related carcinogenesis events. We proposed that in the ACE-2 depleted situation in OSCC, EMMPRIN receptor might get high jacked by the COVID-19 virus for the entry into the host cells. Apart from the anti-monoclonal antibody, it is recommended to explore the use of grape seed and skin containing mouthwash as an adjunct, which could also have anti EMMPRIN effects in patients with OSCC and OPMDs."

abstract = "Management of Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) with existing strategies of life style and pharmaceutical interventions has gained limited success as evidenced by its uncontrolled progression. Two key organs which are involved in pathophysiology of T2DM are liver and pancreas, both are the derivatives of endoderm with common precursor. In the invertebrates, hepatopancreas performs function of both liver and pancreas. It is known that derangement in glycolysis, neoglucogenesis, and glycogenolysis lead to hyperglycemia in T2DM although insulin levels are high. Several studies have reported implication of abnormal liver function in the development of metabolic syndrome i.e. T2DM. Partial hepatectomy has been shown to improve glycemic status in animal models of diabetes. This could be because liver and pancreas share same regenerating factors. These evidences suggest that abnormal liver status can impair pancreatic beta cell function and survival along with peripheral insulin resistance. We therefore hypothesize that restoring deranged liver functions may aid in the better control and management of T2DM. If found true, it may shift current intervention strategy towards liver rather than pancreas in the treatment of T2DM."

Thousands of studies are being devoted to understanding its epidemiology, its molecular characteristics, its mechanisms, and the clinical evolution of this viral infection. However, little has been published on its pathogenesis and the host response mechanisms in the progress of the disease. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis based on strong scientific documentation, associating oxidative stress with changes found in patients with COVID-19, such as its participation in the amplification and perpetuation of the cytokine storm, coagulopathy, and cell hypoxia. Finally, we suggest a therapeutic strategy to reduce oxidative stress using antioxidants, NF-κB inhibitors, Nrf2 activators, and iron complexing agents. We believe that this hypothesis can guide new studies and therapeutic strategies on this topic."

Meanwhile, 2019-nCoV-2 can activate PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling pathways, which can play the double roles as both anti-inflammatory and carcinogenic factors. Moreover, hypoxemia may be developed, resulting in the up-regulation of HIF-1 α expression, which can be involved in the occurrence, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of lung cancer. Additionally, the immune system in 2019-nCoV-2 infected cases can be suppressed to cause tumor immune evasion. Therefore, we speculate that COVID-19 may be a risk factor of secondary lung cancer."

Platelet/lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, monocyte/lymphocyte ratio and other hemogram parameters may be a marker in predicting suicide. In addition, the determination of the relationship between these inflammatory markers and the cyclicity/seasonality of suicide can provide a basis for preventive mental health measures. This hypothesis was performed on 193 patients who attempted suicide and the control group consisted of 109 healthy children and adolescents between 2014 and 2019. Data were evaluated by SPSS software version 22 and a value of p < 0.05 was accepted to be significant in all tests.

The clinical manifestations of infected patients generally range from asymptomatic or mild to severe illness, or even death. The ability of the virus to evade the host immune response have been major reasons for high morbidity and mortality. One of the important clinical observations under conditions of critical illness show increased risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation. Molecular mechanisms of how SARS CoV-2 induces such conditions still remain unclear. This report describes the presence of two unique motifs in the SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N-protein) that can potentially interact with fibrinogen and possibly prothrombin. This is based on an established function of secretory proteins in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-coagulase, Efb (Extracellular fibrinogen binding) and vWBP (von Willebrand factor Binding Protein), which are known to regulate the blood clotting cascade and the functions of host immune response. It is hypothesized that having protein interaction motifs that are homologous to these S. aureus proteins, the N-protein of this virus can mimic their functions, which may in turn play a crucial role in formation of blood clots in the host and help the virus evade host immune response. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested in vitro. Considering the overwhelming increase in the incidence of SARS CoV-2 infection globally, this information may be useful for further investigation and could help in deducing new therapeutic strategies to combat advanced stages of this disease."

Air pollution inhalation is responsible for a massive negative health effect. The practice of regular physical exercise is strongly encouraged to achieve a healthy lifestyle. However, particularly during a physical exercise session, the respiratory system undergoes some physiological adaptations that lead to an increase in the volume of inhaled air, so exercising in a polluted environment would consequently augment the number of pollutants inhaled. In this scenario, would it be safer to stay physically inactive? Or to choose an indoor facility to exercise? Or to keep performing outdoor activities once the benefits achieved with exercise will overcome the possible damage caused by additional exposure to air pollution? Currently, these questions still do not have a decisive answer, so we designed a hypothesis to be tested in which exercise would be beneficial regardless of the chosen place. Outdoor and indoor pollution are both equally harmful to health, however, we do not know if it would have a difference to exercise in one of them."

The disease originates majorly due to compromised function of the dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc), but not the ventral tegmental area (VTA) region of the midbrain. The differential susceptibility for degeneration is majorly attributed to morphological, molecular, and electrophysiological heterogeneity existing in DA neurons of SNpc and VTA. Long-range axonal arborization and a higher number of synapses in SNpc DA neurons make it more vulnerable compared to VTA DA neurons. Studies have shown that a decrease in such axonal arborization places DA neurons at decreased risk in PD. The two well established underlying mechanisms are a) As arborization is an energy-demanding process, increased redistribution of mitochondria to the axonal terminals occurs to satisfy the bioenergetic requirement b) The stabilization of axon-promoting factors at the axonal tip is an essential component for enhancing the arborization process. Interfering with any of these two processes would probably alleviate the degeneration of SNpc DA neurons. To accomplish the decreased stability of arborizing factors and thereby increase the resilience of SNpc DA neurons, we hypothesize the activation of anterograde transport-dependent recruitment of proteasomes to axon terminals as one of the most favorable approaches. Understanding this putative avenue of enhancing proteasomal activity and migration to the axonal tip could provide insight into the progression of neurodegeneration in PD and possibly offer a novel therapeutic strategy."

The risk of dementia when using proton-pump-inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor-blockers as a treatment of Helicobacter-pylori have a lot of controversial-research with different results; however, no final recommendation was deduced from all these researches. A meta-analysis study was performed to evaluate the relationship between PPIs and H2-receptor-blockers use and dementia.
Methods
Through a systematic literature search up to December-2019, 10-studies with 371951-subjects of them 71021Helicobacter-pylori-positive subjects using either PPIs or H2-receptor-blockers or both were identified reporting-relationships between PPIs and H2-receptor-blockers uses and dementia (10-studies contained PPIS, 4-contained H2-receptor-blockers). Odd-ratio (OR) with 95% confidence-intervals (CIs) was calculated comparing PPIs and H2-receptor-blockers users and to non-user subjects on the bases of dementia using the dichotomous-method with a random-effect-model.
Results
No significant difference was found between PPIs-users or non-user (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.62–1.22) or between H2-receptor blockers-users and non-users (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.91–1.59) as a risk of dementia. The extent of increases in dementia with H2-receptor-blockers was higher than that with PPIs. The impact of PPIs and H2-receptor-blockers was similar in all populations.
Conclusions
Based on this meta-analysis, the contentious use of PPIs or H2-receptor-blockers may not have an independent-relationship to dementia. This suggests that using PPIs or H2-receptor-blockers is not related to dementia. However, we still have to recommend careful use of PPIs and H2-receptor-blockers when treating Helicobacter-pylori and sticking to the dose and length of treatment and not to extend it to avoid any possible risk."

It produces groin pain, sensory alteration in the medial thigh (dysesthesia, sensory loss, or pain), adductor muscle weakness and pain/restriction of hip movements. Basically, the clinical diagnosis of obturator neuralgia is made by producing pain during internal rotation of the hip against resistance (“obturator sign”) or by extension and lateral leg movements. We postulate obturator neuralgia can induce lower urinary tract symptoms and dyspareunia and be diagnosed by using three clinical signs characterizing neuralgia everywhere on the body: painful nerve trunk (at the entrance of the obturator canal; by vaginal or rectal examination), abnormal sensibility and painful skin rolling test in its cutaneous innervation territory (inferomedial skin of the thigh). To support our assumptions, three female patients with longstanding lower urinary tract symptoms and/or dyspareunia and a clinical examination suggestive of obturator neuralgia (three clinical signs positive) were treated by perineural injections of dextrose 5% in sterile water (D5W). The three patients were clinically improved or cured after the treatment with two of them being cured after a single injection. While waiting for confirmation of these findings by randomized controlled trials, we suggest that obturator neuralgia should be sought in every patient with lower urinary tract symptoms and/or dyspareunia and that obturator perineural D5W injections be tried to relieve these patients."

These relationships have been observed in both clinical and experimental setups. Within-subject variability of clinical pain scores is traditionally assessed based on daily pain diaries collected during the pre-intervention stage. Experimental variability can be assessed by the Focused Analgesia Selection Test (FAST), which calculates the relationship between noxious stimuli administrated at various intensities and pain reports. The variability, either clinical or experimental, has been shown to predict the placebo response. In explaining the placebo response, Bayesian Brain Hypothesis (BBH) posits that pain perception (posterior), is composed of certainty (precision) of expectations (priors due to belief or conditioning) and incoming sensory information (likelihood), with the bulk of research focused on the precision of priors. Virtually all placebo analgesia research has focused on the priors and their certainty, rather than on the certainty of the likelihood, mainly because it cannot be assessed directly. We propose that the within-subject variability, as encapsulated by the FAST, is a proxy for certainty in (or, precision of) ascending sensory signals, and our results suggest that it could not only be assessed, but also manipulated. If true, our hypothesis will facilitate new lines of research and could potentially promote precision analgesic medicine by use of variability of pain scores as a diagnostic method to identify pain patients who will benefit from specific treatments."

However, till the time patients are diagnosed, cellular events and biomolecules get active effecting multiple organs at the same time. This series of events lead to disruption in normal functioning of the organs and their coordinative crosstalk, hence, increase in mortality rate of patients. The primary functional molecules of inflammatory pathways are active in NCDs. YKL-40, an anti-apoptotic molecule in inflammatory pathways, is overexpressed in patient fluids in different organs under diseased conditions. We performed a preliminary network analysis to study YKL-40 co-expression with diagnostic markers: TNNT2/I3 (Cardiac Troponin T/I) for cardiovascular diseases, LCN2 (NGAL) and CKM (Creatinine kinase M-type) in acute kidney injury and HbA1c in type-2-diabetes. It is observed that YKL-40 is actively co-expressed and linked with standard diagnostic markers and may be influencing the pathways active in organ crosstalk. The pathways may be regulating the signaling events in patients with non-communicable diseases leading to comorbidities. We, hence, postulate that if YKL-40 and disease specific pathways influenced are clinically utilized, this will provide the foundation of establishing tailored and specific approach in diagnosis and monitoring non-communicable diseases and predict the onset of comorbid conditions due to phenomenon influencing organ cross talks."

The delayed lung damage after SARS-CoV-2 infection may be caused by an autoimmune response to ACE2 induced by forced presentation of the ACE2 protein in a complex with CoV Spike in Fc Receptor positive Antigen Presenting Cells in the lung. The likelihood that this hypothesis is valid is low, but it is easily tested.
Testable predictions
1) Autoantibodies and T cells to ACE2 may be found in patients with the lung damage but not in those without 2) There may be an HLA linkage with the delayed lung disease 3) Vaccines based on the spike protein might initiate the process by amplifying Fc mediated uptake of ACE2-Spike complexes into APCs.
Practical Implications
The development of autoantibodies to ACE2 might predict the development of the inflammatory phase of Covid-19 disease. It might be wise to consider engineering versions of the spike that no longer bind to ACE2 for inclusion in vaccines.
Background
Infection by SARS-CoV-2 is followed by an inflammatory pneumonia in ∼14% of cases [1] and widespread organ damage [2]. The risk increases with age and certain predisposing conditions. Of these, hypertension stands out with 6.3% risk of death [3]. The virus enters cells by binding to the ACE2 protein [4]. ACE2 expression may be increased in hypertension, and this could be the basis for the predisposition by enhancing uptake of virus into cells that express ACE2 in lung, heart, blood vessels and kidney [5]."

Therefore, we think that Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI’s) with similar mechanisms of action may also be involved in COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis."

abstract = "There currently is no specific antiviral drug or a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infections; now exceeding 10,300,000 infections worldwide. In the absence of animal models to test drugs, we need to find molecular explanations for any unforeseen peculiarities in clinical data, especially the recent reports describing an unexpected asthma paradox. Asthma is considered a high medical risk factor for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection, yet asthma is not on the list of top 10 chronic health problems suffered by people who died from SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Resolving this paradox requires looking beyond the binary model of a viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) attaching to the ACE-2 receptor. A pBlast analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein contains two calcium-dependent fusion domains that were recently discovered SARS-CoV-1. These viral calcium-dependent binding domains can facilitate membrane fusion only after cleavage by the host surface protease TMPRSS2. Importantly, TMPRSS2 also requires calcium for its SRCR (scavenger receptor cysteine-rich) domain and itsLDLRA(LDL receptor class A) domain. Thus, the presence of EDTA excipients in nebulized β2-agonist medicines can disrupt SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection and can explain the asthma paradox. This model validates repurposing EDTA in nebulizer solutions from a passive excipient to an active drug for treating COVID-19 infections. Repurposed EDTA delivery to respiratory tissues at an initial target dose of 2.4 mg per aerosol treatment is readily achievable with standard nebulizer and mechanical ventilator equipment. EDTA warrants further investigation as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in consideration of the new calcium requirements for virus infection and the regular presence of EDTA excipients in common asthma medications such as Metaproterenol. Finally, the natural history of Coronavirus diseases and further analysis of the fusion loop homologies between the Betacorona SARS-CoV-2 virus and the less pathogenic Alphacorona HC0V-229E virus suggest how to engineer a hybrid virus suitable for an attenuated alpha-beta SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, replacing SARS-CoV-2 fusion loops (amino acids 816–855) with the less pathogenic HCoV-229E fusion loop (amino acids 923–982) may provide antigenicity of COVID-19, but limit the pathogenicity to the level of HCoV-229E."

Although MS is recognized by the demyelinating process, the axonal injury can occur from the start of the disease and lead to neurodegenerative process in the disease. Although MS appears to damage the brain locally, the progressive and neurodegenerative nature of the disease indicate the general and global brain damage. Various studies have indicated this global damage at all areas of white and gray matter. Moreover, the earlier stages of mentioned disease can affect the structural and functional brain connections. Demyelinating lesions, which are local at first glance, lead to a global damage to the functional connections of the brain. Therefore, it seems that the brain network or brain connectome are broadly affected by this disease; therefore, MS can be referred as a connectomopathy. The drugs used in this disease all seek to suppress or regulate the immune system, and the human brain has always been considered as a therapeutic target. However, if the brain is generally involved in the disease, so the treatment should be general. In fact, the treatment process should target the connectomopathy. One of the methods that can be used to achieve the mentioned goal is attending to the role of the brain in its treatment."

abstract = "Background
The stellate ganglion is an autonomic nervous ganglion, formed by the fusion of the inferior cervical sympathetic ganglion and the first thoracic sympathetic ganglion, which is present in about 80% of people. It is anterior to the neck of the first rib and contains neurons that supply sympathetic innervation to the head and neck. Injection of local anesthetics near the stellate ganglion (stellate ganglion block; SGB) has been used for multiple clinical indications including sympathetic-mediated pain and vascular insufficiency syndromes of the upper extremity. In addition, reports on SGB having significant impact on conditions linked to immune dysfunction have been published for a century, but the mechanisms of SGB action have been poorly understood.
Hypothesis
SGB hinders the sympathetic innervation of the immune organs, thus modulating the immune system activity and leading to the alleviation of the disease.
Evidence
All primary (thymus and bone marrow) and secondary immune organs (spleen, lymph nodes, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) receive a substantial sympathetic innervation, with norepinephrine (NE), as the main neurotransmitter. Complementarily, T and B lymphocytes express β2-adrenergic receptors, while innate immune cells express both α- and β-adrenergic receptors. The consequences of adrenergic receptor signaling can be summarized as immuno-modulatory. Activation of adrenergic receptors leads to decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 or TGF-β. Cellular changes include increase in the number of regulatory T cells and shift of the Th1/Th2 balance towards the Th2 response. Since the changes in immune response are global, the explanation has to include generalization of the SGB effect. A likely explanation includes centripetal neuronal pathways between the stellate ganglion and deep brain regions such as insula, amygdala, and hippocampus. Those, in turn, have reciprocal innervation with locus ceruleus, a brain-stem structure involved in the control of the autonomous nervous system.
Conclusion
Various pathologic conditions have been shown to be SGB responsive, where the symptoms have been reduced or eliminated. Many of those clinical improvements have been mirrored by measurable immunologic changes. A plausible explanation, consistent with the evidence available so far, is that SGB exerts its effects by regulating the immune system, through a central, reflex-like pathway. Our hypothesis provides a theoretical framework for understanding the effects of SGB and could, thus lead to wider usage of the technique in immune-linked disorders such as ulcerative colitis."

The combination of anti-inflammatory antiviral prostaglandins with interferons may lead to the clearance of viruses inside growth-restricted infected cells.

Though WHO supports facemasks only for Covid-19 patients, healthy “social exercisers” too exercise strenuously with customized facemasks or N95 which hypothesized to pose more significant health risks and tax various physiological systems especially pulmonary, circulatory and immune systems. Exercising with facemasks may reduce available Oxygen and increase air trapping preventing substantial carbon dioxide exchange. The hypercapnic hypoxia may potentially increase acidic environment, cardiac overload, anaerobic metabolism and renal overload, which may substantially aggravate the underlying pathology of established chronic diseases. Further contrary to the earlier thought, no evidence exists to claim the facemasks during exercise offer additional protection from the droplet transfer of the virus. Hence, we recommend social distancing is better than facemasks during exercise and optimal utilization rather than exploitation of facemasks during exercise."

Increasing evidence reveals that disturbance of social development from early life, such as isolation rearing since weaning, could affect individuals’ behavioral impulsivity. Its underlying mechanism remains unsolved, however manipulation of central 5-HT system provide effective therapeutic utility in both human and animal studies. We hypothesize that the pathophysiology of isolation rearing shares with the underlying mechanism of impulsivity in which a time-dependent change of central 5-HT is involved. The hypothesis can be tested by experiments to work out (i) early life social development serves as a factor in determining the function of central 5-HT in adulthood, and (ii) long term manipulation of central 5-HT can reverse the effects of isolation rearing on behavioral impulsivity and 5-HT related neurochemical profiles."

It manifests with hypermotor semiology resembling violent limb movements and an assymetric tonic-dystonic posture. The genes which are responsible for the autosomal dominant form of SHE (ADSHE) and whose function is to code the sub-unit of the neuronal acetylcholine receptor are well known. Considering that ADSHE is a prototype of SHE, it is thought that the dysfunction of the cortico-subcortical cholinergic network, which regulates the cycle of sleep, has a key role in the epileptogenesis of this syndrome. Namely, studies to date, have shown that the hypercholinergic activity is sufficient for the development of epileptic seizures, even though the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. NREM parasomnias are sleep disorders that are the most difficult to differentiate from SHE due to a similar clinical presentation. Considering the clinical similarities, NREM occurence and probable genetic connection, it is considered that fundamentally, both of these conditions share a common pathophysiological mechanism i.e. cholinergic dysfunction. The main difference between SHE and NREM parasomnias are the genuine epileptic seizures that are responsible for the semiology in SHE. These genuine seizures are not present in NREM parasomnias. Why this is so, remains to be elucidated. Considering that animal studies have shown that dynamic changes and the decreased levels of microRNA-211 contribute to epileptic seizures and to changes in cholinergic pathways, our hypothesis is that epileptic seizures and the development of epileptogenesis in SHE are a consequence of cholinergic dysfunction and decreased levels of microRNA-211 as opposed to NREM parasomnias where there is a stable level of microRNA-211, preventing epileptogenesis despite the cholinergic system dysfunction."

Determining the degree of fibrosis and structural changes and early diagnosis is an important indicator for the course of chronic liver disease, screening of complications and response to treatment. Considering the prevalence of the disease, the use of an invasive biopsy method does not seem practical. At least a preliminary assessment should be able to determine which patients should have a biopsy. In addition, it is not possible to repeat the liver biopsy frequently to follow the course of the patients. Liver biopsy is expensive and it cannot be performed in every hospital. Difficulties in the application for physicians and patients, sampling errors, differences in evaluation, the requirement of a trained physician, difficulties to repeat, and serious complications during the procedure are other disadvantages. The association rule discovery aims to find interesting and valuable associations within the data. Although association analysis is a very useful and popular task in data mining, as far as we know, there is not any study about association analysis of liver fibrosis. We hypothesize at this work that, evolutionary multi-objective methods can be very efficiently modeled and adapted for the automatic miner of comprehensible, accurate, and interesting numerical positive and negative association rules in liver fibrosis clinical decision making. Due to the numerical valued attributes in liver fibrosis data, for the first time, evolutionary intelligent MOPNAR was handled as a rule miner from liver fibrosis without using any discretizing process that requires domain experts. The algorithms modeled for a clinical decision support system in this study modify and adapt themselves for automatic discovery of numerical association rules and do not require modifying or changing the data. Sensitivity analysis of MOPNAR for liver fibrosis was also performed for the first time and a better parameter setting for this task was presented. According to the discovered rules in liver fibrosis data, the MOPNAR outperformed the compared method with respect to average confidence, lift, certainty factor, netconf, yulesQ, number of attributes, and number of covered records."

We propose here a mixed pharmacoepidemiological and pharmacochemical hypothesis to explain these findings. A number of psychotropic drugs exhibit activities against coronaviruses (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and the Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV)) and have been put forward as potentially anti-SARS-CoV-2. These treatments include numerous mee-too drugs (chemically and pharmacologically linked to those which have demonstrated anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy) which are frequently prescribed in psychiatric settings. Taken alone or in polypharmacy, these drugs could have a prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect, explaining the unexpectedly low proportion of patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19. Associated factors such as nicotine can also be considered in the context of a broad chemoprophylactic hypothesis in patients with psychiatric disorders taking different psychoactive substances."

It is now clear that the hyper-inflammatory response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 plays a major role in disease severity and lethality of the infection. Macrophages are innate immune cells that sense and respond to infections by producing a plethora of inflammatory molecules and by interacting with other inflammatory cells. Therefore, macrophages may be diriment on eliminating pathogens and promoting organ repair. However, macrophages can be a major player of the so called cytokine storm and may be damaging to the tissues. It is believed that macrophage activation syndrome is induced by SARS-CoV to be lethal. Surprisingly and fortunately few children die from COVID-19. For instance, in Italy, out of more than 30.000 deaths for COVID-19, three are children. Therefore, we must wonder why? Are macrophages different in children compared to adults? In my opinion they are different. It has been demonstrated that macrophages populate the lung in three “developmental waves”, and it has been suggested that similar waves may be observed in other important organs, such as the heart and kidney. It is most likely that macrophages heterogeneity is involved in determining the severity. There are no doubts that macrophages are important in determining life or death in these patients. Comparing macrophages of children with those of adults with different degrees of disease severity is, therefore, mandatory."

Mastitis, also predominantly a woman’s illness, is an inflammatory condition of the breast that, despite being an inflammation-related condition, is not currently considered a risk factor for breast cancer. This appears counterintuitive as epidemiological studies have identified chronic inflammation as a contributor to cancer risk, for example in gastric, oesophageal and colon cancers (Lin et al., 2016; Qadri et al., 2014; Principe et al., 2017).

abstract = "Pulmonary surfactant is considered to be one of the soaps. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the other enveloped viruses become very weak against surfactant. The SARS virus binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor and causes pneumonia. In the lung, the ACE2 receptor sits on the top of lung cells known as alveolar epithelial type II (AE2) cells. These cells play an important role in producing surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant is believed to regulate the alveolar surface tension in mammalian lungs. To our knowledge, AE2 cells are believed to act as immunoregulatory cells; however, pulmonary surfactant itself has not been believed to act as a defender against the enveloped viruses. This study hypothesises that pulmonary surfactant may be a strong defender of enveloped viruses. Therefore, old coronaviruses merely cause pneumonia. On the contrary, new SARS-CoV-2 can suppress the production of surfactant that binds to the ACE2 of AE2 cells. The coronavirus can survive in the lung tissue because of the exhaustion of pulmonary surfactant."

If the factors that lead children to involve in delinquency are defined, the risk of dragging children into crime can be detected before they are involved in crime and delinquency can be prevented with appropriate preventive rehabilitation programs, in the early period. However, given that delinquent behavior occurs under the influence of multiple conditions and factors rather than a single risk factor; the need for diagnostic tools to evaluate multiple factors together is obvious. Artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support systems have already been used in the field of psychiatry as well as many other fields of medicine. In this study, we assume that thanks to artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support systems, children and adolescents at risk can be detected before the criminal behavior occurs by addressing certain factors. In this way, we anticipate that it can provide psychiatrists and other experts in the field."

We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis). To support this hypothesis and to estimate the additional mortality that may linked to the COVID-19 controlling policy, we performed a step-by-step pragmatical approach. First, we chose a country (The Netherlands), and looked at the most common causes of mortality in this country. Then, we performed a literature study on the additional mortality when these causes were diagnosed late, and selected a paper with the most severe scenario. We also performed a literature study on the effect of economic crisis on additional mortality. The mortality data were then extrapolated to the demography of The Netherlands, and the results were compared with the present data on deaths directly due to COVID-19. Roughly, we forecast 388 additional deaths a week in The Netherlands in 5 years due to the direct and indirect effects of the lockdown measures. The most important implications of this hypothesis is that the additional mortality and increased mental health problem should be considered in evaluating the necessity of lock down and quarantine policy."

The patient manifested a sweet taste sensation in the upper and lower gums that increased with mood swings and notably with severe depressive symptoms. Blood tests showed an elevated serum creatinine level (115 μmol/L), a normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 6.5 mmol/L; MCV 96 fL) and a deficit in vitamin B12 (122.4 pmol/L). The patient received vitamin B12 supplementation and was treated with clomipramine, lithium, mirtazapine, modafinil, and olanzapine. He was discharged after improvement of his depressive symptoms and decrease in the sweet taste. On follow-up, the patient’s dysgeusia had subsided. Second, we hypothesize that the atypical dysgeusia may have been induced by vitamin B12 deficiency and medical comorbidities, leading to deafferentation (development of erroneous mouth mucosae sensations felt by the patient). This could have been increased by depression. Dysgeusia in elederly patients with depression should be extensively investigated in order to elucidate somatic contributing factors but it may not resolve until improvement of the depressive symptoms."

The degree of similarity is such that perhaps prior exposure to one virus could confer partial immunity to another. Indeed, data suggests a considerable amount of cross-reactivity and recognition by the hosts immune response between different coronavirus infections. While the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak rapidly overwhelmed medical facilities of particularly Europe and North America, accounting for 78% of global deaths, only 8% of deaths have occurred in Asia where the outbreak originated. Interestingly, Asia and the Middle East have previously experienced multiple rounds of coronavirus infections, perhaps suggesting buildup of acquired immunity to the causative SARS-CoV-2 that underlies COVID-19. This article hypothesizes that a causative factor underlying such low morbidity in these regions is perhaps (at least in part) due to acquired immunity from multiple rounds of coronavirus infections and discusses the mechanisms and recent evidence to support such assertions. Further investigations of such phenomenon would allow us to examine strategies to confer protective immunity, perhaps aiding vaccine development."

The impact of periodontal disease on systemic conditions has not been fully identified yet. Literature shows that the incidence of psoriatic arthritis in psoriasis-patients is higher in presence of periodontitis. To this day, it is not fully clear which pathophysiological mechanism lies behind this correlation. The missing link between these diseases might be the activation of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) due to DNAs of periodontal bacteria in synovial fluid.
Hypothesis
Periodontitis is not only a local inflammation but effects systemic conditions as well. We assume that periodontitis is an important risk factor for the development of psoriatic arthritis in patients with psoriasis due to the increase of AMPs triggered by elevated periodontal bacteria DNAs in synovial fluid.
Conclusion
Systemic inflammation caused by periodontitis, the circulation of inflammatory proteins and the increase of potential pathogenic bacteria in the blood stream as well as in synovial fluid might trigger the over-expression of several immunological factors as AMPs and activate immune cells in all parts of the body."

Northern Italy in particular the Lombardy region, north-eastern French regions, Switzerland and Belgium were amongst the hardest hit, while the central and southern Italian regions, all the Balkan countries from Slovenia to Greece and the Islands of Malta and Cyprus had much fewer cases and deaths per capita, and deaths per number of cases. Differences in public health measures, and health care delivery, in the author’s opinion, can only partly explain the difference. The geographical distribution of Phlebotomus sand-flies and the relative distribution of arthropod borne diseases Leishmaniasis and Phlebovirus infections especially the Sicilian Sandfly fever group corresponds to most areas of low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. A hypothesis is proposed whereby repeated arthropod or sandfly vector infection of humans by novel viruses of zoonotic origins carrying bat or mammalian RNA/DNA possibly since many generations, such as phleboviruses may have resulted in the development of an effective evolutionary immune response to most novel zoonotic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 by means of survival of the fittest. This process probably ran in parallel and concurrent with the progressive evolution of novel coronaviruses which spread from one mammalian species to another. Other possible, but less likely mechanisms for the role of sandfly meals within a much shorter time frame may have led to , (i) previous exposure and infection of humans with the SARS-Cov-2 virus itself , or a closely related corona virus in the previous decades, or (ii) exposure of human populations to parts coronavirus protein namely either S or more likely N protein carried mechanically by arthropods, but without clinical disease causing direct immunity or (iii) by causing infection with other arthropod borne viruses which could carry bat DNA/RNA and have similar functional proteins resulting in an immediate cross-reactive immune response rather than by natural selection . The Evidence possibly supporting or disputing this hypothesis is reviewed, however the major problem with the hypothesis is that to date no coronavirus has ever been isolated from arthropods. Such a hypothesis can only be supported by research investigating the possible biological relationship of arthropods and coronaviruses where paradoxically they may be promoting immunity rather than disease."

As the visceral fat possesses an intense immune activity, is involved in metabolic syndrome and is at the crossroad between the intestines, the systemic circulation and the lung, we hypothesized that it plays a major role in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV2 presents the ability to infect epithelial cells of the respiratory tract as well as the intestinal tract. Several factors may increase intestinal permeability including direct enterocyte damage by SARS-CoV2, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and epithelial ischemia secondary to SARS-CoV2- associated endothelial dysfunction. This increase permeability further leads to translocation of microbial components such as MAMPs (microbial-associated molecular pattern), triggering an inflammatory immune response by TLR-expressing cells of the mesentery fat (mostly macrophages and adipocytes). The pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the mesentery fat mediates systemic inflammation and aggravate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) through the mesenteric lymph drainage."

One of the pedagogical theories developed was the Threshold Concepts (TC) educational framework, based on education as a space of uncertainty, where the student needs to learn a certain concept or learning experiences that allow developing a new way of thinking. In medical education, written accounts about significant learning experiences, analysis of practice essays and semi-structured focus groups interviews have been applied to identify TC. In that way, our hypothesis is that the use of bibliometrics, as a tool to discover hidden relations between keywords, can overcome traditional difficulties related to TC identification. Keywords are applied to highlight the content of a digital object; they are concepts with a special meaning, similar to TC. Our challenge is to identify the bibliometric indexes that are able to show the relationship between the keywords that make them TC, especially in a medical context. In previous scientific literature, several methods were applied, mainly based on qualitative assessment. In this sense, we propose a quantitative, objective, and reproducible approach that can enrich the learning process from a scientific-based perspective."

We wonder why surfactants are still not tried for prophylaxis or therapy against COVID-19? That too when many of them have proven antiviral properties.

Transplantation of an olfactory tract graft into the damaged optic nerve is a technically achievable intervention, though anatomical limitations exist in the proposed surgical access. Optic nerve defects can also be potentially treated with axon growth stimulating therapy (Zymosan and CTP-cAMP). Optic neuropathy can be potentially cured by autotransplantation of a portion of the olfactory tract. Neuroanatomical and histomorphological aspects of olfactory tract autotransplantation into the damaged optic nerve are provided. Feasibility, technical and anatomical features, potential setbacks and limitations are discussed. Anatomical limitations exist, but with current neurosurgical technology can be overcome.

abstract = "The traditional formulation of ibuprofen is poorly soluble in water, so the administered dose must be 10 times higher than the dose required for a therapeutic effect. The development of a hydrosoluble form of ibuprofen can be a strategy to reach a high concentration in the lungs by using modern inhalation devices. Therefore, the development of an inhalable formulation with high bioavailability in the lungs was the leitmotiv of our investigation. The hypertonic ibuprofen solution to be nebulized (NIH) presents great relevant characteristics: bactericidal, virucidal, mucolytic and has a known anti-inflammatory property. Bactericidal and virucidal effects are related to the physico-chemical properties of Na-ibuprofenate as an amphipathic molecule. It has the capability to insert into the bilayer membranes destabilizing the structure, altering its biological properties and avoiding the duplication or infection. Our preliminary results indicate that the presence of this high ionic strength solution reduces 10 times the amount of ibuprofen necessary to kill bacteria, but also the time to kill 1x106 bacteria, from 4 h (in its absence) to only three minutes (in its presence). That was observed using Pseudomona aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Burkholderia cepacia. Also, “in vitro'' ibuprofen demonstrated virucidal activity against the so-called enveloped virus, a family that includes coronavirus strain (2019-nCoV). We observed too, the markedly reduced local inflammation in the airways after administering NIH lays on its ability to inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase and to markedly diminish reactive oxygen species (ROS). Other investigators also showed the importance of actin in the rapid spread of virus infection. Furthermore, reorganization of the actin filaments is a key step in lung inflammation induced by systemic inflammatory responses caused by SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest that the interaction between actin proteins and S1 is involved in the 2019-nCoV infection and pathogenesis. Consequently, the possibility of interfering in this interaction could represent a valid hypothesis for the development of promising therapeutic and prevention strategies. In conclusion, we consider that treating people with COVID-19 with NIH may be beneficial and an opportunity to contribute for the current global health emergency."

One of the interesting aspects of the clinical manifestation of the infection is an accompanying ocular surface viral infection, viral conjunctivitis. Although occasional reports of viral conjunctivitis caused by this and the related SARS-CoV virus (causing the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s) are available, the prevalence of this complication among infected people appears low (~1%). This is surprising, considering the recent discovery of the presence of viral receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in ocular surface tissue. The discrepancy between the theoretically expected high rate of concurrence of viral ocular surface inflammation and the observed relatively low occurrence can be explained by several factors. In this work, we discuss the significance of natural protective factors related to anatomical and physiological properties of the eyes and preventing the deposition of large number of virus-loaded particles on the ocular surface. Specifically, we advance the hypothesis that the standing potential of the eye plays an important role in repelling aerosol particles (microdroplets) from the surface of the eye and discuss factors associated with this hypothesis, possible ways to test it and its implications in terms of prevention of ocular infections."

More than 6,973,427 confirmed cases were diagnosed in nearly 213 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances, causing globally over 400,000 deaths. Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients have been identified, but the factors influencing the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well established. Upon infection or cell damage, high amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are released from damaged cells, which serve as mediators of inflammation through purinergic cell surface receptor signaling. As a protective mechanism to prevent excessive damage to host tissue, adenosine counteracts ATP's effects by adenosine receptor stimulation to suppress the pro-inflammatory response. Adenosine is seen as a major obstacle to the efficacy of immune therapies, and the adenosinergic axis components are critical therapeutic targets for cancer and microbial infections. Pharmacologic inhibitors or antibodies specific to adenosinergic pathway components or adenosine receptors in microbial and tumor therapy have shown efficacy in pre-clinical studies and are entering the clinical arena. In this review, we provide a novel hypothesis explaining the potential for improving the efficiency of innate and adaptive immune systems by targeting adenosinergic pathway components and adenosine A2A receptor signaling for the treatment of COVID-19."

abstract = "The surgeon has been recognised as the “second victim” of a surgical complication and the long term psychological impact of a surgical adverse event has been demonstrated. However, the immediate and early psychological response to a surgical complication has not been properly investigated. In this manuscript we analyse a well-known historical case of a surgical complication and discuss the early reaction of the surgeon. Sir Anthony Eden, UK Prime Minister in the ‘50s, underwent a cholecystectomy for gallstones, but the operation complicated with a biliary fistula causing jaundice and sepsis. The reaction of the surgeon followed a precise three-stage pattern that can be identified in almost every case of surgical complication. Initially he denied the complication, with a simplistic attitude, but subsequently he felt overwhelmed by the environmental pressure and gave up. The early psychological response of a surgeon to a surgical complication usually follows the three phases of “denial”, “desperation” and “action or get-away”. In the denial phase the surgeon tries to reassure him or herself by diminishing the real burden of the complication and to demonstrate self-confidence. After few days, when it is evident that the complication is more severe than expected, the surgeon changes completely his or her attitude and becomes more and more depressed and anxious. The reaction to phase 2 will determine the subsequent phase 3, where the surgeon would choose between a positive and proactive attitude or getting-away, thus disengaging from the complicated patient. Acknowledging these three phases would help team leaders and colleagues to recognise the need for a supportive, friendly and blame-free environment and to act timely to help the surgeon to overcome the negative impact on his or her personality and career."

Over the past few years, evidence emerged about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in cataract surgery video analysis for phase classification and instrument identification. Herein, we propose the use of AI to analyze intraoperative images captured by a surgical microscope to improve the fluidic of the phacoemulsification device. The principle is to develop an AI algorithm for recognizing anterior chamber movements by real-time automated analysis of microscope captured images. When AI recognizes an aspect of the anterior chamber which begins to be emptied, it sends a signal to the fluidic system to adjust the anterior segment depth. We believe that this technique could improve surgery security."

On the other hand, the use of nanofibers has become widespread in many fields for their unique properties and convenient design. The present study focuses on the production of hydrophobic nanofibers to absorb the bacteria and their toxins from the bloodstream that contains the infection. Many bacterial surfaces have hydrophobic surfactant properties due to hydrophobic surface protein. According to the principle of binding two hydrophobic molecules to each other in an aqueous medium, the nanofibers are designed to physically absorb the bacteria. The use of antibiotics in the study can remove some unattached bacteria. In addition, using nanofiber manufacturing techniques can reduce the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. The construction of the desired membrane can be used in subsequent studies as a replacement membrane for dialysis filters."

abstract = "SARS-CoV-2, the agent of COVID-19, shares a lineage with SARS-CoV-1, and a common fatal pulmonary profile but with striking differences in presentation, clinical course, and response to treatment. In contrast to SARS-CoV-1 (SARS), COVID-19 has presented as an often bi-phasic, multi-organ pathology, with a proclivity for severe disease in the elderly and those with hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Whilst death is usually related to respiratory collapse, autopsy reveals multi-organ pathology. Chronic pulmonary disease is underrepresented in the group with severe COVID-19. A commonality of aberrant renin angiotensin system (RAS) is suggested in the at-risk group. The identification of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor allowing viral entry to cells precipitated our interest in the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis. We propose that COVID-19 is a viral multisystem disease, with dominant vascular pathology, mediated by global reduction in ACE2 function, pronounced in disease conditions with RAS bias toward angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) over ACE2. It is further complicated by organ specific pathology related to loss of ACE2 expressing cells particularly affecting the endothelium, alveolus, glomerulus and cardiac microvasculature. The possible upregulation in ACE2 receptor expression may predispose individuals with aberrant RAS status to higher viral load on infection and relatively more cell loss. Relative ACE2 deficiency leads to enhanced and protracted tissue, and vessel exposure to angiotensin II, characterised by vasoconstriction, enhanced thrombosis, cell proliferation and recruitment, increased tissue permeability, and cytokine production (including IL-6) resulting in inflammation. Additionally, there is a profound loss of the “protective” angiotensin (1–7), a vasodilator with anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, antiproliferative, antifibrotic, anti-arrhythmic, and antioxidant activity. Our model predicts global vascular insult related to direct endothelial cell damage, vasoconstriction and thrombosis with a disease specific cytokine profile related to angiotensin II rather than “cytokine storm”. Our proposed mechanism of lung injury provides an explanation for early hypoxia without reduction in lung compliance and suggests a need for revision of treatment protocols to address vasoconstriction, thromboprophylaxis, and to minimize additional small airways and alveolar trauma via ventilation choice. Our model predicts long term sequelae of scarring/fibrosis in vessels, lungs, renal and cardiac tissue with protracted illness in at-risk individuals. It is hoped that our model stimulates review of current diagnostic and therapeutic intervention protocols, particularly with respect to early anticoagulation, vasodilatation and revision of ventilatory support choices."

abstract = "Clinical diagnosis is based on analysis of pathologic findings that may result in perceived patterns. The same is true for diagnostic pathology: Pattern analysis is a foundation of the histopathology-based diagnostic system and, in conjunction with clinical and laboratory findings, forms a basis for the classification of diseases. Any histopathology diagnosis is based on the explicit assumption that the same diseased condition should result in formation of the same (or highly similar) morphologic patterns in different individuals; it is a standard approach in microscopic pathology, including that of non-communicable chronic diseases with organ remodeling. During fifty years of examining diseased tissues under microscopy, I keep asking the same question: Why is a similarity of patterns expected for chronic organ remodeling? For infection diseases, xenobiotic toxicity and deficiencies forming an identical pathologic pattern in different individuals is understandable and logical: The same infection, xenobiotic, or deficiency strikes the same target, which results in identical pathology. The same is true for Mendelian diseases: The same mutations lead to the same altered gene expressions and the same pathologic pattern. But why does this regularity hold true for chronic diseases with organ remodeling? Presumable causes (or risk factors) for a particular chronic disease differ in magnitude and duration between individuals, which should result in various series of transformations. Yet, mysteriously enough, pathological remodeling in a particular chronic disease always falls into a main dominating pattern, perpetuating and progressing in a similar fashion in different patients. Furthermore, some chronic diseases of different etiologies and dissimilar causes/risk factors manifest as identical or highly similar patterns of pathologic remodeling.
Hypothesis
I hypothesize that regulations governing a particular organ’s chronic remodeling were selected in evolution as the safest response to various insults and physiologic stress conditions. This hypothesis implies that regulations directing diseased chronic remodeling always preexist but normally are controlled; this control can be disrupted by a diverse range of non-specific signals, liberating the pathway for identical pathologic remodeling. This hypothesis was tested in an analysis of arterial neointimal formation, the identical pathology occurring in different diseases and pathological conditions: graft vascular disease in organ transplantation, in-stent restenosis, peripheral arterial diseases, idiopathic intimal hyperplasia, Kawasaki disease, coronary atherosclerosis and as reaction to drugs. The hypothesis suggests that arterial intimal cells are poised between only two alternative pathways: the pathway with controlled intimal cell proliferation or the pathway where such control is dirupted, ultimately leading to the progressive neointimal pathology. By this property the arterial neointimal formation contitutes a special case of Kauffman’s Self-Organization.This new hypothesis gives a parsimonious explanation for identical pathological patterns of arterial remodeling (neointimal formation), which occurs in diseases of different etiologies and due to dissimilar causes/risk factors, or without any etiology and causes/risk factors at all. This new hypothesis also suggests that regulation facilitating intimal cell proliferation cannot be overwritten or annulled because this feature is vital for arterial differentiation, cell renewal, and integrity. This hypothesis suggests that studying numerous, and likely interchangeable, non-specific signals that disrupt regulation controlling intimal cell proliferation is unproductive; instead, a study of the controlling regulation(s) itself should be a priority of our research."

Rhinophyma is a skin disorder which causes nose enlargement and deformation due to proliferation of sebaceous glands and connective tissue. It is not only an aesthetic problem but may also lead to impaired nasal breathing and problems with liquids intake.
Hypothesis
Although rhinophyma is considered to be a subtype of rosacea, here we hypothesise whether it is a separate disease with mechanical trauma as a main reason of the disease progress.
Methods
22 patients with diagnosed rhinophyma were qualified for the study. All patients were physically examined and detailed patients’ medical history was obtained. Patients were asked to answer a number of questions regarding their usual skin care, purification procedure as well as handling of the nose and nasal cavity. Results were subjected to statistical analysis.
Results
Due to our observations there is a group of patients who have never presented any typical symptoms of rosacea while they are now suffering from rhinophymatous changes. Most of those patients confirmed longlasting mechanical nose cleaning which included any skin lesions removal by squeezing and nose picking which resulted in local skin inflammation, swelling, pain or itching.
Conclusion
It is suspected that many different factors may induce rhinophyma development. In our opinion, mechanical repetitive trauma is one of the most important. Therefore we encourage physicians to include adequate questions while taking medical history from the patient and implement proper recommendations for nasal care as soon as possible."

abstract = "In recent years numerous reports have highlighted the options of chemical breath analysis with regard to non-invasive cancer detection. Certain volatile organic compounds (VOC) supposedly present in higher amounts or in characteristic patterns have been suggested as potential biomarkers. However, so far no clinical application based on a specific set of compounds appears to exist. Numerous reports on the capability of sniffer dogs and sensor arrays or electronic noses to distinguish breath of cancer patients and healthy controls supports the concept of genuine cancer-related volatile profiles. However, the actual compounds responsible for the scent are completely unknown and there is no correlation with the potential biomarkers suggested on basis of chemical trace analysis. It is outlined that specific features connected with the VOC analysis in breath – namely small concentrations of volatiles, interfering background concentrations, considerable sampling effort and sample instability, impracticability regarding routine application - stand in the way of substantial progress. The underlying chemical-analytical challenge can only be met considering the severe susceptibility of VOC determination to these adverse conditions. Therefore, the attention is drawn to the needs for appropriate quality assurance/quality control as the most important feature for the reliable quantification of volatiles present in trace concentration. Consequently, the advantages of urine as an alternative matrix for volatile biomarker search in the context of diagnosing lung and other cancers are outlined with specific focus on quality assurance and practicability in clinical chemistry. The headspace over urine samples as the VOC source allows adapting gas chromatographical procedures well-established in water analysis. Foremost, the selection of urine over breath as non-invasive matrix should provide considerably more resilience to adverse effects during sampling and analysis. The most important advantage of urine over breath is seen in the option to partition, dispense, mix, spike, store, and thus to dispatch taylor-made urine samples on demand for quality control measures. Although it is still open at this point if cancer diagnosis supported by non-invasively sampled VOC profiles will ultimately reach clinical application the advantages of urine over breath should significantly facilitate urgently required steps beyond the current proof-of-concept stage and towards standardisation."

Amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is highly conserved in evolution, is expressed in neurones in response to a wide range of damaging agents. The hypothesis proposed is that APP has a protective function to counter damage but if it fails and the neurone dies then breakdown products of APP miss-fold and lead to amyloid deposition. This fits with the evidence that amyloid deposition is a consequence rather than a cause of cell death. Germ line mutations in APP impair the protective role and lead to increased neuronal loss in response to damage. This leads to early onset and severe Alzheimer’s disease. Inflammation, infection, hypoxia, trauma and pollution are damaging agents which interact to cause the disease. The bacteria which cause chronic periodontitis appear to have a significant role. Prevention needs to focus on avoiding trauma, reducing pollution and improving dental hygiene. Furthermore we should attempt to optimise the oral microbial flora by suppressing the growth of pathogenic bacteria that cause gum disease and the bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx that cause life threatening infections following viral upper respiratory infections. This leads to a key research question: does the regular consumption of natural live yoghurt reduce the carriage of periodontal and oropharyngeal bacterial pathogens? Theoretical considerations indicate it should and if so regular natural live yoghurt consumption could be an important preventive agent."

However, COVID-19 is increasingly recognized to cause an overwhelming inflammatory response and cytokine storm leading to end organ damage. End organ damage to heart is one of the most severe complications of COVID-19 that increases the risk of death. We proposed a two-fold mechanism responsible for causing acute coronary events in patients with COVID-19 infection: Cytokine storm leading to rapid onset formation of new coronary plaques along with destabilization of pre-existing plaques and direct myocardial injury secondary to acute systemic viral infection. A well-coordinated immune response is the first line innate immunity against a viral infection. However, an uncoordinated response and hypersecretion of cytokines and chemokines lead to immune related damage to the human body. Human Coronavirus (HCoV) infection causes infiltration of inflammatory cells that cause excessive production of cytokines, proteases, coagulation factors, oxygen radicals and vasoactive molecules causing endothelial damage, disruption of fibrous cap and initiation of formation of thrombus. Systemic viral infections also cause vasoconstriction leading to narrowing of vascular lumen and stimulation of platelet activation via shear stress. The resultant cytokine storm causes secretion of hypercoagulable tissue factor without consequential increase in counter-regulatory pathways such as AT-III, activated protein C and plasminogen activator type 1. Lastly, influx of CD4+ T-cells in cardiac vasculature results in an increased production of cytokines that stimulate smooth muscle cells to migrate into the intima and generate collagen and other fibrous products leading to advancement of fatty streaks to advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Direct myocardial damage and cytokine storm leading to destabilization of pre-existing plaques and accelerated formation of new plaques are the two instigating mechanisms for acute coronary syndromes in COVID-19."

Discovery of the prone sleep position risk factor provided tangential support for the cardiorespiratory control hypothesis which defines the mainstream approach.

In asking why?, this paper exposes some of the shortcomings regarding this apparent oversight by mainstream SIDS researchers and examines the role of respiratory infection and puts the case for the “Infection Hypothesis.” In addition, the paper provides encouragement to neuropathologists to examine the potential link between CNS findings and cardiac function (as opposed to respiratory function) in relation to infection and to examine possible correlates between CNS findings and established risk factors such as recent infection, contaminated sleeping surfaces, maternal/obstetric/higher birth, ethnicity, non-breast-feeding, male gender, etc. or with the usual gross pathological findings of SIDS (intrathoracic petechial hemorrhages, liquid blood, congested lungs). The shortcomings exposed through this review invite questions over current research directions and hopefully encourage research into other more plausible hypotheses, such as the infection paradigm.•Mainstream SIDS researchers appear to have overlooked the key relationship between prone sleep position and infection.•This omission has major implications for current and future SIDS research"

Statins are among the most widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs.

At the end of January 2020, the infection spread all over Italy, but with high infection rates and mortality in the northern part, especially in Lombardy, the most industrialized and polluted region of the country. It is noteworthy that a strong association between severe viral respiratory disease and air pollution has been described. Air pollutant could be solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and can be of natural origin (such as ash from a volcanic eruption) or released from motor vehicle depletes (carbon monoxide gas) or factories (sulfur dioxide). Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of sulphuric acid, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrochloric acid into the atmosphere. Pulmunary diseases spreadby means of small droplets in thebreath, also called aerosols, and air pollution may facilitate the outside survival of viruses. We suppose that ash and gases emitted from the Mount Etna contributed to air pollution, potentially favouring the major contagion of COVID-19 in the eastern flank of the mountain, as in Catania city. In fact, ash and gases (with regard to radon) are usually particularly intense in winter, with a reduction of emission of specific metals with warmer weather. This is the first paper that elaborates the hypothesis of a potential role of volcanic gases and heavy metals-related air pollution, combined to specific climatic conditions and regional topography, in favouring severe COVID-19 diffusion in Sicily.

Topical treatments commonly require biochemical agents such as bovine thrombin to activate PRP ex vivo for clotting and growth factor release to facilitate healing upon application to the wound of interest. Recent studies have explored electrical stimulation as an alternative to bovine thrombin for PRP activation due to the former’s cost, workflow complexity and potentially significant side effects; however, both approaches require separating the PRP from whole blood (WB) prior to activation. Eliminating the separation (typically centrifugation) step would reduce the cost and duration of the clinical procedure, which may be critical in trauma and surgical applications. We hypothesize that electric pulses (EPs) can release growth factors from WB, as they do from PRP, without requiring centrifugation of WB into PRP. A pilot study for two donors demonstrates the potential for EP stimulated growth factor release from WB. This motivates future experiments assessing EP parameter optimization for WB activation and in vivo studies to determine the clinical benefits for topical treatments and, especially, for injections in orthopedic applications that already utilize non-treated/non-activated WB."

abstract = "The current SARS-Cov-2 virus pandemic challenges critical care physicians and other caregivers to find effective treatment for desperately ill patients — especially those with sudden and extreme hypoxemia. Unlike patients with other forms of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, these patients do not exhibit increased lung stiffness or dramatic dyspnea., even in the presence of arterial blood oxygen levels lower than that seen normally in mixed venous blood. Urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation with high inflation pressures and raised inhaled oxygen concentration have proved unhelpful or worse, but why? Our Hypothesis is that sudden opening of a previously undetected probe-patent foramen ovale (PPFO) may explain this mystery. As hypoxemia without acidosis is a rather weak stimulus of dyspnea or increased ventilation, and opening of such an intracardiac shunt would not worsen lung mechanical properties, the absence of dramatic symptom changes would not be surprising. We point out the high frequency of PFO both in life and at autopsy, and the physiological evidence of large shunt fractions found in Covid-19 patients. Published evidence of hypercoagulability and abundant evidence of pulmonary emboli found at autopsy are in accord with our hypothesis, as they would contribute to raised pressure in the pulmonary arteries and right heart chambers, potentially causing a shunt to open. We review the interaction between viral corona spike protein and ACE-2 receptors present on the surface of alveolar lining cells, and contribution to hypercoagulabilty caused by the spike protein. Search for an open PFO after a large drop in arterial oxygen saturation can be performed at the bedside with a variety of well-established techniques including bedside echocardiography, nitrogen washout test, and imaging studies. Potential treatments might include balloon or patch closure of the shunt, and various drug treatments to lower pulmonary vascular resistance."

Ever since, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has swiftly invaded every corner on the planet. By the end of April 2020, almost 3.5 million cases have been reported worldwide, with a death toll of about 250,000 deaths. It is currently well-recognized that patient’s immune response plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This inflammatory element was evidenced by its elevated mediators that, in severe cases, reach their peak in a cytokine storm. Together with the reported markers of liver injury, such hyperinflammatory state may trigger significant derangements in hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic machinery, and subsequent modulation of drug clearance that may result in unexpected therapeutic/toxic response. We hypothesize that COVID-19 patients are potentially vulnerable to a significant disease-drug interaction, and therefore, suitable dosing guidelines with therapeutic drug monitoring should be implemented to assure optimal clinical outcomes."

This hypothesis suggests that a deficiency of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) may be the primary factor related to the SARS-Cov-2 disease spectrum and the risk for mortality, as subclinical nutritional deficiencies may be unmasked by any significant increase in oxidative stress. NAD+ levels decline with age and are also reduced in conditions associated with oxidative stress as occurs with hypertension, diabetes and obesity. These groups have also been observed to have high mortality following infection with COVID-19. Further consumption of NAD+ in a pre-existent depleted state is more likely to cause progression to the hyperinflammatory stage of the disease through its limiting effects on the production of SIRT1. This provides a unifying hypothesis as to why these groups are at high risk of mortality and suggests that nutritional support with NAD+ and SIRT1 activators, could minimise disease severity if administered prophylactically and or therapeutically. The significance of this, if proven, has far-reaching consequences in the management of COVID-19 especially in third world countries, where resources and finances are limited."

Hypertension is known to be associated with the risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease; these two conditions usually co-exist and interact with each other. At present, many studies have focused on how to intervene ARAS correctly or just optimal medical therapy (OMT). For patients with severe ARAS, stent implantation seems to be able to receive better clinical benefits because it can avoid renal ischemic injury; however, it remains inconclusive whether stent implantation is suitable for the essential hypertension patients accompanied with mild to moderate ARAS. We speculate that renal artery revascularization may accelerate renal dysfunction in essential hypertensive patients accompanied with mild to moderate ARAS, especially when hypertension could not be controlled within the normal range after the revascularization."

After converting to lumbar flexion, lamina osteotomy is innovatively finished by an UBS through interspinous space.

It is evident from our molecular docking analysis of violacein and silver nanoparticles with the TFAM-DNA complex which gave resulting negative binding energy of −8.836 kcal/mol for violacein with inhibition constant (Ki value) of 1.51 μM and high binding score of 9518 for silver nanoparticle in the DNA interacting cavity of TFAM. Hence, our hypothesis of employing violacein and silver nanoparticle for cancer treatment by TFAM inhibition seems highly promising and further in-vitro and in-vivo studies are extremely demanded in this concern."

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) action are critical for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) cell entry and infectivity. ACE2 expression and RAAS are abnormal in hypertension and obesity, while TMPRSS2 is overexpressed when exposed to androgens, which may justify why these factors are overrepresented in COVID-19. Among therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesized that spironolactone, a long used and safe mineralocorticoid and androgen receptors antagonist, with effective anti-hypertensive, cardioprotective, nephroprotective, and anti-androgenic properties may offer pleiotropic actions in different sites to protect from COVID-19. Current data shows that spironolactone may concurrently mitigate abnormal ACE2 expression, correct the balances membrane-attached and free circulating ACE2 and between angiotensin II and Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), suppress androgen-mediated TMPRSS2 activity, and inhibit obesity-related RAAS dysfunctions, with consequent decrease of viral priming. Hence, spironolactone may provide protection from SARS-CoV-2, and has sufficient plausibility to be clinically tested, particularly in the early stages of COVID-19."

Safinamide is a novel inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) with neuroprotective properties. Methamphetamine abuse causes dysfunction in the respiratory chain of the mitochondria, but the specific signaling mechanism and role of the uncoupling protein-2(UCP-2) remain unclear. As we know, some indirect evidence indicates that neurodegeneration can be caused by inhibition of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor, TrkB and its downstream signaling pathway, such as the PGC-1α protein. Neuroprotective strategies and approaches to the management, treatment or prevention of methamphetamine-induced neurodegeneration by modulating BDNF / TrkB / PGC-1α-UCP-2 can be considered as novel therapeutic approaches to these psychostimulant neurochemical and neurobehavioral approaches. Previous studies have shown that safinamide, a monoamine oxidase-B (MAOB) inhibitor, can function as a neuroprotective agent and inhibit the neurodegenerative process especially in Parkinson's disease but its impact on other neurodegenerative processes and drug-induced neurotoxicity remain unclear. Although there is some evidence that BDNF / TrkB / PGC-1α-UCP-2 signaling pathway and mitochondrial UCP-2 mediated safinamide induced neuroprotection but it’s exact and precise mechanism of action and neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative disorder and the protective properties against methamphetamine induced neurodegeneration and the role of BDNF / TrkB / PGC-1α signaling pathway and role of mitochondrial UCP-2 in this process have not yet been clarified. Therefore, in subjects addicted to methamphetamine, we hypothesized that safinamide will provide neuroprotection against methamphetamine-prompted neurodegeneration, and it appears that BDNF / TrkB / PGC-1α signaling pathway and mitochondrial UCP-2 are likely to play a critical role."

This article presents a hypothesis that connects social and organizational structures to the emergence of symptoms and mental disorders in the population. It is our belief that some of these structures fundamentally impact the distribution of MD/MS in a population and the medical and psychological communities must consider this impact seriously. Laws aim at directing the behavior of groups of people, whose behavior is strictly interdependent with their neurobiology. Given the ability of laws to direct the behaviors that regulate social interactions, traumatic factors may be considered capable of linking a non-material object (e.g., a law) to a real effect (e.g., MS/MD). We discuss, as a paradigmatic example, the laws that regulate the use of psychotropic substances."

One way of non-invasively stimulating the otolith organs is via a small electrical current applied to the skin behind the ears. This technique is called vestibular nerve stimulation, or VeNS, and is believed to have a good safety profile. Thus, it has previously been argued that VeNS could be used in human health as a means of treating the complications of metabolic syndrome, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Weight loss itself is known to improve diabetic control, however, tantalizing evidence is now emerging that the improvements seen in the glycemic control of type 2 diabetics who undergo repeated vestibular stimulation are significantly better than would be expected on the basis of weight loss alone. As vestibular stimulation has been shown to increase levels of an anti-inflammatory protein, called sirtuin 1, we hypothesize here that VeNS will increase levels of an associated enzyme called AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK plays an important role in glucose and fat metabolism and is activated by exercise, as well as being a known target for certain anti-diabetic drugs. This hypothesis is readily amenable to clinical testing as specific assays for testing human AMPK are available. If substantiated, then this hypothesis could prove an important clinical insight and potentially offer a new treatment avenue for patients with type 2 diabetes; a condition which remains a major cause of morbidity and premature mortality worldwide."

Decisions with regard to moderate aortic regurgitation can be difficult. We hypothesise that mild aortic regurgitation as assessed volumetrically can in fact be moderate to severe when analysed from a bioenergetics point of view. The conservation of energy predicts that any regurgitant volume will require the heart to provide more work energy to support the circulation. Aortic regurgitation involves the left ventricle imparting potential energy, via blood pressure, and kinetic energy, via increased ejected volume and velocity respectively. This implies that regurgitant volume, ejection velocity, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and regurgitant orifice area are all important factors. We present limited data to demonstrate our hypothesis. A bioenergetic analysis of aortic regurgitation, reveals that correlation between regurgitant volume and effective regurgitant orifice can be poor in certain physiological circumstances. In addition we identify the importance of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate control in patients with aortic regurgitation. The concept that mild aortic regurgitation can be ignored is from an engineering point fundamentally flawed in some cases."

The exact pattern of immune system changes and their condition during the disease process is unclear. The available knowledge has indicated that the NF-kappa-B pathway, which is induced by several mediators, has a significant role in cytokine storm through the various mechanisms. Therefore, identifying the state of the immune cells and the dominant mechanisms for the production of cytokines incorporated in the cytokine storm can be a critical step in the therapeutic approach. On the other hand, some studies identified a higher risk for diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus exhibits a close association with inflammation and increases the chance of developing COVID-19. Patients with diabetes mellitus have shown to have more virus entry, impaired immunity response, less viral elimination, and dysregulated inflammatory cytokines. The parallel analysis of COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus pathogenesis has proposed that the control of the inflammation through the interfering with the critical points of major signaling pathways may provide the new therapeutic approaches. In recent years, the role of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) in chronic inflammation has been proved. Numerous immune cells express the DPP4 protein. DPP4 regulates antibody production, cytokine secretion, and immunoglobulin class switching. DPP4 inhibitors like sitagliptin reduce inflammation intensity in different states. Following the accumulating data, we hypothesize that sitagliptin might reduce COVID-19 severity. Sitagliptin, an available DPP4 inhibitor drug, showed multidimensional anti-inflammatory effects among diabetic patients. It reduces the inflammation mostly by affecting on NF-kappa-B signaling pathway. Under the fact that inflammatory mediators are active in individuals with COVID-19, blocking the predominant pathway could be helpful."

abstract = "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine with effects in immune regulation, inflammation, and infection. The use of drugs that inhibit IL-6 biological activity has been proposed as a treatment for patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rationale for this approach includes commitment to the concept that inflammation is a cause of lung damage in COVID-19 and belief that IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory molecule. Observational data thought to support IL-6 inhibition include elevated circulating IL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients and association between elevated IL-6 and poor clinical outcomes. However, IL-6 has significant anti-inflammatory properties, which calls into question the rationale for employing IL-6 blockade to suppress inflammation-induced tissue injury. Also, studies suggesting a beneficial role for IL-6 in the host response to infection challenge the strategy of using IL-6 blockade to treat COVID-19. In studies of recombinant IL-6 injected into human volunteers, IL-6 levels exceeding those measured in COVID-19 patients have been observed with no pulmonary adverse events or other organ damage. These observations question the role of IL-6 as a contributing factor in COVID-19. Clinical experience with IL-6 receptor antagonists such as tocilizumab demonstrates increase in severe and opportunistic infections, raising concern about using tocilizumab and similar agents to treat COVID-19. Trials of drugs to inhibit IL-6 activity in COVID-19 are ongoing and will shed light on the role of IL-6 in COVID-19 pathogenesis. However, until more information is available, providers should exercise caution in prescribing these therapies given the potential for patient harm."

After infection, large amounts of inflammatory cytokines are secreted, known as the cytokine storm. These cytokines can cause pulmonary damage induced by inflammation resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. One of the therapeutic approaches for treatment of ARDS is a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). MSCs suppress inflammation and reduce lung injury through their immunomodulatory properties. MSCs also have the potential to prevent apoptosis of the lung cells and regenerate them. But our suggestion is using MSCs-derived exosomes. Because these exosomes apply the same immunomodulatory and tissue repair effects of MSCs and they don’t have problems associated to cell maintenance and injections. For investigation the hypothesis, MSCs should be isolated from tissues and characterized. Then, the exosomes should be isolated from the supernatants and characterized. These exosomes should be injected into a transgenic animal for COVID-19. In the final section, lung function assessment, histological examination, micro-CT, differential leukocyte, viral load analysis, cytokine assay, and CRP level analysis can be investigated. COVID-19 treatment is currently focused on supportive therapies and no vaccine has been developed for it. So, numerous researches are needed to find potential therapies. Since the pathogenesis of this disease was identified in previous studies and can cause lung injury with ARDS, investigation of the therapeutic approaches that can suppress inflammation, cytokine storm and ARDS can be helpful in finding a novel therapeutic approach for this disease."

abstract = "Atheromatous plaques occurring in large arteries are common and life-threatening lesions. Multiple factors are involved in the pathogenesis of atheromatous plaques, such as hyperlipidaemia and hypercholesterolaemia, high blood pressure and chronic systemic inflammation. Recent findings have suggested that infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) may increase the risk of developing atheromatous plaques. However, HPV is considered a tissue-specific virus with a strong tropism towards squamous epithelial cells, and the mechanisms whereby it may promote the development of atheromas remain unclear. Here, we propose a connecting hypothesis to explain the possible causative role of HPV on atheroma development. We hypothesize that HPV infection may promote atheroma formation in infected patients by enhancing systemic inflammation or by directly targeting blood vessels via nucleic acids carried by extracellular vesicles such as exosomes. The pro-inflammatory effects of HPV and the release of extracellular vesicles by HPV-transformed cells are well documented in scientific literature. Possible experimental approaches to test this hypothesis are also discussed, especially experiments employing transgenic mice bearing HPV16 transgenes. If correct, this hypothesis would have major implications for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, especially due to the preventable nature of HPV infection through vaccination."

Via supervised machine learning, a classifier of convolution neural network (CNN) was built by using 908 facial images, half of those were photos of children labeled with “autism”, which may include some developmental disorders with autism-like features. Then face images were generated for two categories of photos. Above all, the most important discovery of this research is that face images labeled “autism” and normal controls populate two quite distinctive manifolds. Different pattern was found to be distributed in the eyes and mouth in the generated photos for two categories of faces by deep learning. It is showed that supervised machine learning can obtain facial features, which could possibly be applicable to improve early screening for childhood developmental disabilities by facial expression.

Studies show that ibuprofen demonstrates superior efficacy in fever reduction compared to acetaminophen. As fever may have benefit in shortening the duration of viral illness, it is plausible to hypothesize that the antipyretic efficacy of ibuprofen may be hindering the benefits of a fever response when taken during the early stages of COVID-19 illness."

Abnormal movements such as tremor, myoclonus, and choreoathetosis due to infantile nutritional vitamin B12 (Cbl, cobalamin) deficiency or after Cbl injection have been recognized for many years. However, nutritional Cbl deficiency may be more common than recognized and a variety of the abnormal movements may be beyond our estimates.
Objective
To define the relationship between a large variety of abnormal movements in infants and vitamin B12 deficiency even if serum vitamin B12 levels and/or examination are normal.
Materials and methods
This study analyzed a variety of abnormal movements such as involuntary eye movements, limb and body contractions, and gasping as well as clinical, metabolic, radiologic, and treatment results in 13 infants with nutritional Cbl deficiency. This is a retrospective study based on observation and experience.
Results
This study included 13 infants (11 boys and 2 girls) with a large spectrum of abnormal movements, the mean age at admission was 8.3 months with a range of 3–22 months. All patients were breastfeeding. In seven cases and their mothers serum vitamin B12 levels were below 200 pg/ml. About one-third of cases serum vitamin B12 levels were over 200 pg/ml. Clinically, mild hypotonia was present in 5 cases, inadequate social interactions in 2 cases, and sensorineural hearing loss in one case. Brain MRI showed frontotemporal enlarged subarachnoid spaces and thinning of the corpus callosum in two cases. EEG examinations were normal in all cases at admission. All cases recovered rapidly within one month with treatment.
Conclusion
Nutritional Cbl deficiency is a treatable disease that should be considered in the etiology of a variety of movement abnormalities in infants even if serum vitamin B12 values and neurological development are normal."

It is known that low Se is associated with increased incidence of cancer and heart diseases. Therefore, it is advisable to supplement diet with this element albeit in a proper form. Although blood increased concentrations of Se can be achieved with various pharmacological preparations, only one chemical form (sodium selenite) can offer a true protection. Sodium selenite, but not selenate, can oxidize thiol groups in the virus protein disulfide isomerase rendering it unable to penetrate the healthy cell membrane. In this way selenite inhibits the entrance of viruses into the healthy cells and abolish their infectivity. Therefore, this simple chemical compound can potentially be used in the recent battle against coronavirus epidemic."

abstract = "Purpose
Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infection with COVID-19 can result in silent transmission to large numbers of individuals, resulting in expansion of the pandemic with a global increase in morbidity and mortality. New ways of screening the general population for COVID-19 are urgently needed along with novel effective prevention and treatment strategies.
Hypothesis
A hypothetical three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment approach based on an up-to-date scientific literature review for COVID-19 is proposed. Regarding diagnosis, a validated screening questionnaire and digital app for COVID-19 could help identify individuals who are at risk of transmitting the disease, as well as those at highest risk for poor clinical outcomes. Global implementation and online tracking of vital signs and scored questionnaires that are statistically validated would help health authorities properly allocate essential health care resources to test and isolate those at highest risk for transmission and poor outcomes. Second, regarding prevention, no validated protocols except for physical distancing, hand washing, and isolation exist, and recently ivermectin has been published to have anti-viral properties against COVID-19. A randomized trial of ivermectin, and/or nutraceuticals that have been published to support immune function including glutathione, vitamin C, zinc, and immunomodulatory supplements (3,6 Beta glucan) could be beneficial in preventing transmission or lessening symptomatology but requires statistical validation. Third, concerning treatment, COVID-19 induced inflammation and “cytokine storm syndrome” with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) have resulted in extreme morbidity and mortality in those with certain comorbidities, secondary to “acute respiratory distress syndrome” (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Deficiency in red blood cell, serum and alveolar glutathione has been published in the medical literature for ARDS, as well as viral and bacterial pneumonias, resulting from increased levels of free radical/oxidative stress. A randomized controlled trial of blocking NF-κB and cytokine formation using glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine [NAC] and alpha lipoic acid) and PO/IV glutathione with associated anti-viral effects should be performed, along with an evaluation of Nrf2 activators (curcumin, sulforaphane glucosinolate) which have been scientifically proven to lower inflammation. Since high mortality rates from sepsis induced DIC due to COVID-19 infection has also been associated with thrombotic events and elevated levels of D-dimer, randomized controlled trials of using anticoagulant therapy with heparin is urgently required. This is especially important in patients on ventilators who have met certain sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria. The use of acetazolamide with or without sildenafil also needs to be explored with or without heparin, since increased oxygen delivery to vital organs through prevention of thrombosis/pulmonary emboli along with carbonic anhydrase inhibition may help increase oxygenation and prevent adverse clinical outcomes.
Conclusion and Implications
A three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment plan is proposed for addressing the severe complications of COVID-19. Digital monitoring of symptoms to clinically diagnose early exposure and response to treatment; prevention with ivermectin as well as nutritional therapies that support a healthy immune response; treatment with anti-inflammatory therapies that block NF-κB and activate Nrf2 pathways, as well as novel therapies that address COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS with DIC including anticoagulation and/or novel respiratory therapies with or without acetazolamide and sildenafil. These three broad-based interventions urgently need to be subjected to randomized, controlled trials."

Hesperidin is a classical herbal medicine used worldwide for a long time with an excellent safety profile. Hesperidin is a well-known herbal medication used as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Available shreds of evidence support the promising use of hesperidin in prophylaxis and treatment of COVID 19. Herein, we discuss the possible prophylactic and treatment mechanisms of hesperidin based on previous and recent findings. Hesperidin can block coronavirus from entering host cells through ACE2 receptors which can prevent the infection. Anti-viral activity of hesperidin might constitute a treatment option for COVID-19 through improving host cellular immunity against infection and its good anti-inflammatory activity may help in controlling cytokine storm. Hesperidin mixture with diosmin co-administrated with heparin protect against venous thromboembolism which may prevent disease progression. Based on that, hesperidin might be used as a meaningful prophylactic agent and a promising adjuvant treatment option against SARS-CoV-2 infection."

Statistical analysis based approaches has been widely employed for this purpose which are comprised of four stages such as pre-processing, feature extraction, feature reduction and classification. The outcome of such approaches are highly dependent upon the image quality: better the image, higher the outcome. In this paper, we present a hypothesis that the quality of the image, which is enhanced at the pre-processing stage, can play a significant role in enhancing the classification performance of any statistical approach. To strengthen our theory we first employed an improved image enhancement technique, which consists of three different sub-stages: noise removal using median filter, contrast enhancement using histogram equalization technique and image conversion from gray-scale to RGB. After image enhancement, we extract features from an enhanced MR brain image using a discrete wavelet transform and these feature are further reduced by color moments i.e mean, standard deviation, and skewness. Finally, we trained an advanced deep neural network (DNN) to categorize the human brain MRI images as normal or pathological. The approach obtained 95.8% which is significantly higher than the previous state-of-the-art techniques. The result evident that our hypothesis about the role of image enhancement process in medical image classification, is realistic and also have potential to improve the performance of other medical image analysis technique."

The disease is multifactorial, and diabetes has been considered as one of the major risk factors for the development of AD. Chronic hyperglycemic condition in diabetes promotes non-enzymatic protein modification by glucose termed as glycation, which affects protein structure and function. Previous studies have shown that many of the enzymes, including proteases, are affected by glycation. Conversely, glycated proteins are known to become resistant to protease action. In these hypotheses, we have extended these two concepts to the regulation of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) by secretases leading to amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation. The first hypothesis deals with the glycation of α-secretases leading to its reduced activity, while in the second hypothesis, AβPP glycation may prevent α-secretases action, rendering its processing by β secretase. As diabetes is a risk factor for the development of AD, either or both these pathways may operate, leading to the manifestation of AD."

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may impair ocular function, while other serotonin receptor-binding drugs might improve it. A putative vision-improving drug must be safe at therapeutic doses, most preferably with long-lasting benefits from a single or very few administration(s). One drug potentially satisfying these criteria is the common, botanically-occurring indole alkaloid and “major hallucinogen,” harmine. Harmine is prominent in the leaves of the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) Passiflora, and in Peganum and Banisteriopsis, the two preeminent “sacred” medicinal plants of India/pre-Islamic Persia/modern Iran and the Amazon respectively. Though the possibility of drug-drug or herb-drug interactions exists, especially with SSRIs, at correct patient-individualized dosages, these plants, used alone, are minimally hallucinogenic, well tolerated, potentially exerting profound therapeutic effects on vision from a single or few administration(s) lasting months or years. The hypothesized mechanism for this extraordinary action is tuning of the serotonergic receptors in the eye in their binding affinity for serotonin, a putative neurochemical “ocudelic” homologue to the psychedelic phenomenon, likely potentiated, according to clinical experience with classical hallucinogens, by therapeutic music, positive psychological “set,” and conducive environmental “setting.” Blinded research with harmala alkaloid-containing plants in ocular patients using psychedelic therapy accoutrements, viz. eyeshades, high fidelity classical music, headphones, two guides, pre-dosing preparation, and post-dosing integration, could non-invasively assess visual acuity in presbyopia. Significant results would stimulate further exploration of this novel approach to ocular disorders. Deeper benefit, particularly when the retina is compromised, might follow co-ingestion of the harmala alkaloid-containing plants with plants containing dimethyltryptamine."

abstract = "A study by Saraiva et al. (2011) demonstrated the presence of Angiotensin II receptors on the erythrocyte membrane. This little-known information should be deemed as crucial as the SARS-CoV-2 relationships with oxygen saturation and the Renine Angiotensin System but it currently remains unexploited. The pulmonary and cardiovascular systems are involved in any typical complications of COVID-19 but numerous other unrelated symptoms may occur. To fill the gap, we shall first emphasize some similarities between the complications of this infectious disease and Decompression Illness (DCI), which involves bubble formation. We theorized that the Angiotensin II clearance by the red blood cells could trigger the release of its oxygen content in the bloodstream. The resulting foam would worsen the widespread endotheliitis, worsen the gas exchange, trigger the coagulation process, the inflammation process and the complement pathway as typically occurs in DCI. At the end, we propose a plausible mechanism."

abstract = "Covid-19 is a new coronavirus disease first described in December 2019. This respiratory illness is severe and potentially fatal. Severe cases make up to 15%, lethality ranges between 1.5 and more than 10%. What is urgently needed is an efficient pharmacological treatment for the treatment of severe cases. During the infection of alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, the ACE2 receptor has a central function. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 without significant change of cell-surface ACE2 and, therefore, might be potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Starting inhibition at 0.1 µM, CQ completely prevented in vitro infections at 10 µM, suggesting a prophylactic effect and preventing the virus spread 5 h after infection. In a first clinical trial, CQ was effective in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promotion of virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease. In addition, HCQ, which is three times more potent than CQ in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (EC50 0.72 µM), was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Theoretically, CQ and HCQ could thus be effectively used in the treatment of SARS-CoV pneumonia. From a pharmacological standpoint, however, the major problems of oral treatment with these drugs are possible severe side effects and toxicity. Concretely, this relates to (a) the inconsistent individual bioavailability of these drugs at the alveolar target cells, depending on intestinal resorption, hepatic first-pass metabolism and accumulation in liver, spleen and lung, and (b) the need for a relatively high concentration of 1–5 µM at the alveolar surface. Therefore, we propose in a first dose estimation the use of HCQ as an aerosol in a dosage of 2–4 mg per inhalation in order to reach sufficient therapeutic levels at the alveolar epithelial cells. By using a low-dose non-systemic aerosol, adverse drug reactions will markedly be reduced compared with oral application. This increase in tolerability enables a broader use for prevention and after contact with an infected person, which would be an advantage especially for the high-risk, often multi-morbid and elderly patients. Empirical data on self-medication with a one-week aerosol application by two of the authors is presented. Inhalation was well tolerated without relevant side effects."

abstract = "COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread across the globe. Predisposing factors such as age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and lowered immune function increase the risk of disease severity. T cell exhaustion, high viral load, and high levels of TNF-ɑ, IL1β, IL6, IL10 have been associated with severe SARS-CoV-2. Cytokine and antigen overstimulation are potentially responsible for poor humoral response to the virus. Lower cellular redox status, which leads to pro-inflammatory states mediated by TNF-ɑ is also potentially implicated. In vivo, in vitro, and human clinical trials have demonstrated N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as an effective method of improving redox status, especially when under oxidative stress. In human clinical trials, NAC has been used to replenish glutathione stores and increase the proliferative response of T cells. NAC has also been shown to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway (IL1β and IL18) in vitro, and decrease plasma TNF-ɑ in human clinical trials. Mediation of the viral load could occur through NAC’s ability to increase cellular redox status via maximizing the rate limiting step of glutathione synthesis, and thereby potentially decreasing the effects of virally induced oxidative stress and cell death. We hypothesize that NAC could act as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of COVID-19 through a variety of potential mechanisms, including increasing glutathione, improving T cell response, and modulating inflammation. In this article, we present evidence to support the use of NAC as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of COVID-19."

The rheological, anti-inflammatory, and renin-angiotensin axis properties of PTX highlight this drug as a therapeutic treatment alternative for patients with COVID-19 by helping reduce the production of the inflammatory cytokines without deleterious effects on the immune system to delay viral clearance. Moreover, PTX can restore the balance of the immune response, reduce damage to the endothelium and alveolar epithelial cells, improve circulation, and prevent microvascular thrombosis. There is further evidence that PTX can improve ventilatory parameters. Therefore, we propose repositioning PTX in the treatment of COVID-19. The main advantage of repositioning PTX is that it is an affordable drug that is already available worldwide with an established safety profile, further offering the possibility of immediately analysing the result of its use and associated success rates. Another advantage is that PTX selectively reduces the concentration of TNF-α mRNA in cells, which, in the case of an acute infectious state such as COVID-19, would seem to offer a more strategic approach."

abstract = "Piriformis syndrome is described as a neuromuscular condition which occurs when the sciatic nerve is compressed and/or irritated by the piriformis muscle. It is characterized by acute tenderness in the buttock with sciatica-like pain radiating into the posterior aspect of the thigh, leg, and foot. The neurogenic leg and foot pain experienced with this condition is consistent with involvement of the sciatic nerve. However, the posterior thigh pain associated with piriformis syndrome is due to involvement of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve (i.e., posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh), which is a branch of the sacral plexus independent of the sciatic nerve. This nerve is rarely mentioned relative to piriformis syndrome even though posterior thigh pain is more prevalent in patients than leg and foot pain. In the few instances when the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve is referenced relative to piriformis syndrome the neuralgic signs associated with it are attributed to compression by piriformis. Yet, given the dramatic size difference between the sciatic and posterior femoral cutaneous nerves one would expect direct piriformis compression to impact the sciatic nerve first and produce leg/foot pain at a far greater frequency than posterior thigh pain. However, the opposite is seen in the literature, which raises the question, what underlying mechanism is responsible for this phenomenon? It is hypothesized that the prevalence of posterior femoral cutaneous nerve involvement in piriformis syndrome is due to compression of the inferior gluteal vein by a hypertrophied piriformis muscle."

Craniosynostosis syndromes exhibit a group of similar symptoms because of the mutual cause, craniosynostosis, with Crouzon syndrome being the most common one. At present, the surgical approach for Craniosynostosis syndromes has been established and generally accepted, including a series of surgical interventions in stages according to patients’ age, severity and function of skull malformation. It's a large, complex, long time span deformity correcting procedure with formidable limitations, including high risk, expensive cost, quantity shortage of qualified surgeons and unsatisfactory successful rate for complicated cases. Hence, a new nonsurgical therapy for patients with craniosynostosis syndromes is seriously needed. A concept of Dynamic Cranial Suture Management (DCSM) was introduced. It includes objective and evaluable monitoring tools and craniosynostosis patent modifying drugs or medications tools which consist of regulatory factors for osteoclasts, osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells. By using these tools alternatively in different skull developing stages, DCSM is designed to prevent craniosynostosis. A Crouzon syndrome case was also presented."

Cu is involved in the functions of critical immune cells such as T helper cells, B cells, neutrophils natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. These blood cells are involved in the killing of infectious microbes, in cell-mediated immunity and the production of specific antibodies against the pathogens. Cu-deficient humans show an exceptional susceptibility to infections due to the decreased number and function of these blood cells. Besides, Cu can kill several infectious viruses such as bronchitis virus, poliovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1), other enveloped or nonenveloped, single- or double-stranded DNA and RNA viruses. Moreover, Cu has the potent capacity of contact killing of several viruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2. Since the current outbreak of the COVID-19 continues to develop, and there is no vaccine or drugs are currently available, the critical option is now to make the immune system competent to fight against the SARS‐CoV‐2. Based on available data, we hypothesize that enrichment of plasma copper levels will boost both the innate and adaptive immunity in people. Moreover, owing to its potent antiviral activities, Cu may also act as a preventive and therapeutic regime against COVID-19."

SARS-CoV-2 binds its host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through the viral spike (S) protein. The mortality related to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in COVID-19 patients has been suggested to be connected with cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), an excessive immune response that severely damages healthy lung tissue. In addition, cardiac symptoms, including fulminant myocarditis, are frequent in patients in a severe state of illness. Diacerein (DAR) is an anthraquinone derivative drug whose active metabolite is rhein. Different studies have shown that this compound inhibits the IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, TNF-α, NF-κB and NALP3 inflammasome pathways. The antiviral activity of rhein has also been documented. This metabolite prevents hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and influenza A virus (IAV) adsorption and replication through mechanisms involving regulation of oxidative stress and alterations of the TLR4, Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB signalling pathways. Importantly, rhein inhibits the interaction between the SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting rhein as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of SARS-CoV infection. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that DAR is a multi-target drug useful for COVID-19 treatment. This anthraquinone may control hyperinflammatory conditions by multi-faceted cytokine inhibition and by reducing viral infection."

Unfortunately, it remains unclear which form of uric acid – prooxidant or antioxidant – could be a predictive marker of cardiovascular disease, especially in patients after myocardial infarction. It is well-known that uric acid is an organic compound and the water-soluble final product of purine catabolism, which is catalysed by xanthine oxidoreductase and excreted by kidneys. An increased concentration of UA in human plasma leads to diseases like tumours, renal disorders, atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, polycythaemia vera, haemolytic anaemias, ischemia, oxidative stress, and rare genetic disorders connected with UA degradation. Epidemiological studies have shown that UA might be a marker of oxidative stress, progression of inflammation, or renal disease. A fortiori, it is possible that could also be a predictor for short/long-term survival of patients with CVD. Evidence provided by multiple studies is controversial and mutually exclusive. Among 71 studies the most of them found an independent association between SUA and CVD risk. Some of those studies confirm that CVD risk is higher in women who had elevated SUA levels. On the other hand, many studies reached the opposite conclusion and did not find any relationship between SUA and CVD mortality and morbidity."

It affects an estimated 8 million Americans and more than 125 million people worldwide. The estimated cost to treat psoriasis in USA is over 13 billion US dollars per year. Treatment of psoriasis may include topical steroid-sparing agent, topical corticosteroids, phototherapy or biologics. Tacrolimus has 10-fold greater immunosuppressive activity than the ciclosporin A which has been recommended for effective treatment of psoriasis. However, it has been widely investigated using conventional formulation approaches which limit its clinical outcomes. It has poor cutaneous bioavailability when administered topically using conventional delivery approach, thus it has poor efficacy against the psoriasis. Low aqueous solubility and high degradation of Tacrolimus make it difficult to formulate as a liquid preparation. Moreover, Tacrolimus has narrow therapeutic index and thus it is essential to prevent its possible toxic effects when a modified release dosage form is administered. The present hypothesis aims to put forward to incorporate Tacrolimus into a novel lipid based nanocarrier system, which would be further loaded into a hydrogel base and evaluated for its target specific topic delivery. Due to the structural similarity of the lipid nanocarriers and skin, these vesicles would target the skin tissues effectively and treat psoriasis with minimum or no side effects. Thus, the proposed formulation would be a considerable value addition to the current therapeutic approaches used for psoriasis management."

Although previous studies have emphasized differences, we have focused on the overarching common denominators of the three conditions in terms of mechanism theories. In consequence, fatal cases with subdural hemorrhage (SDH) classified as SBS could be classified as high risk BRUE with SDH. Fatal cases without SDH could be classified as SIDS. Non-fatal cases with SDH and retinal hemorrhages (RHs), currently classified as SBS, could be classified as BRUE with SDH and RHs, leaving a fourth group of BRUE without SDH and RHs. While both the BRUE and the SIDS diagnoses have been refined and developed, alleged abusive head trauma (AHT) cases with and without external signs of trauma have been indiscriminately combined. This is analogous to indiscriminately grouping together, e.g., headache due to a brain tumor or headache after head trauma. Alleged AHT cases with external signs of trauma and high velocity impact might be explained by the traditional AHT mechanism theories, whereas the one-third of all alleged AHT cases without external signs of trauma could be explained by the hypoxia cascade theory and/or other non-shaking theories."

However, it is not pathogenic for bat at all, because free DNA in cytoplasm or blood cannot bring up violent immune response in bat; but it can produce severe inflammations in human.

As it is evident from the recent studies that SARS-CoV-2 requires host enzyme Furin to activate receptor binding domain of its S protein and host Angiotensin Convertase Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is required as binding receptor, facilitating the entry of virus into the host cell. Evidence from literature shows that oral cancer tissues as well as paracarcinoma tissue exhibit higher expression of both Furin and ACE2, giving rise to the hypothesis that patients with oral cancer have higher chances of SARS CoV2 infection. It is also hypothesised that there will be increased severity of disease due to facilitated entry of the virus into the cells. Therefore, we suggest oral cancer patients require extra attention during COVID-19 pandemic and re-evaluation of current treatment paradigms in oral oncology is also needed."

The central nervous system lacks classical meningeal lymphatic (circulation) drainage, and the exact underlying mechanisms of how immune cells from the peripheral lymphatic system enter the central nervous system (CNS) remain unknown. To determine whether the perinasal lymphatic system or lymphatic vessels are involved in cerebral immune defence and play a role in causing CNS infections (especially respiratory tract-related infections), we performed an anatomic study to investigate the drainage differences between the perinasal and intracerebral lymphatic systems by using injection of Evans blue and anatomic surgery, together with immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assays. Surprisingly, we found that (1) the pituitary (adenohypophysis) is involved and is rich in lymphatic vessels and (2) perinasal tissue could communicate with central pituitary lymphatic vessels in a specific and unidirectional manner. Taken together, our study may be the first to anatomically demonstrate the existence of novel lymphatic vessel structures in the pituitary, as well as their communication with the perinasal (lymphatic) tissue. Our findings suggest the existence of an ultimate loop for “classical” meningeal lymphatic drainage and are relevant to cerebral infection and immune defence."

abstract = "SARS-CoV-2 is a novel beta-coronavirus causing over 200.000 lethal cases within six months of first infecting humans. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). COVID-19 is characterized by two phases: the first resembles the flu with pneumonia, but after about seven or eight days the disease suddenly worsens to a sepsis-like syndrome. It is difficult to explain this virus-immune-pathology sequence from virology or immunology only. This paper hypothesizes that host-produced anti-spike protein antibodies are responsible for immune-induced viral dissemination. Subsequently, systemic distribution of virus-antibodies complexes activates the immune pathology observed in severe COVID-19. This hypothesis may be counterintuitive to immunologist that consider many anti-spike antibodies to be virus-neutralizing antibodies. Although anti-spike antibodies may hinder infection of epithelial cells, antibody binding to the spike protein may facilitate virus infection of myeloid leukocytes. If myeloid leukocytes reenter the circulation, they could spread the virus from a locoregional infection to a systemic disease. Disseminated virus in combination with antibodies results in dispersed virus-antibody complexes that overstimulate the immune system. The hypothesis aligns with the sequences of virus, immune and pathological events in COVID-19. The delay in onset from both syndromes results from an immune system still naïve to the non-cross-reactive spike protein. Details of this hypothesis are in concordance with many clinical characteristics of COVID-19, including its predominant lethality for the elderly, and the mostly asymptomatic course of disease in children. It predicts putative detrimental effects of vaccines that induce virus-neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein, as has been shown for other coronaviruses. This hypothesis has consequences for treatment of patients, evaluation of personal and herd immunity and vaccine development. In patients, cellular immunity should be stimulated. Neutralizing antibodies might not be indicative for immunity. Vaccines should aim to stimulate cellular immunity COVID-19 and/or stimulate humoral immunity against viral proteins except for the immunodominant spike protein."

However, about 15% of patients progress to severe stages and 2.5% of these patients succumb to this illness. Most patients with severe disease belong to the elderly age group (<65 years of age) and have multiple associated co-morbidities. The immune responses induced by the COVID 19 virus, during the incubation and non-severe stages, requires the early initiation of a specific adaptive immune response to eliminate the virus and prevent the progress to severe stages. In patients with a dysfunctional bridge adaptive immunity, the innate immune response becomes exaggerated due to the lack of feedback from the adaptive immune cells. The resultant cytokine storm is responsible for the severe lung injury leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome seen in COVID 19 patients. Mesenchymal stem cells are known to suppress overactive immune responses as well as bring about tissue regeneration and repair. This immuno-modulatory effect of MSCs could hold potential to manage a patient with severe symptoms of COVID 19 infection due to a dysfunctional adaptive immune system."

In this context we present transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive treatment that brings a new perspective when thinking about treatment of neurological diseases. It is easy to handle, low cost, few side effects and good adherence to patients. TDCS presents good evidence for clinical practice, but when it comes to PD the results obtained are inconclusive and some protocols have not yet been tested.

However, there are some obvious problems in applying rhBMP-2 clinically. Among them, early endplate osteolysis frequently occurs in the lumbar interbody fusion, which readily leads to cage subsidence or shift, thus influencing clinical effects. Moreover, robust bone formation activity and serious osteolysis coexist. What is the internal mechanism? How do we solve this problem? Strontium (Sr) is now widely used for the treatment of osteoporosis. It elicits a double effect in that it simultaneously enhances bone formation and inhibits bone resorption. We propose that Sr might be a solution for osteolysis induced by rhBMP-2 in spinal interbody fusion. Whether this synergistic effect leads to new metabolic pathway activation remains to be explored. Clarifying the synergistic effect and mechanism will be of great importance in improving both the osteogenic effect and reducing the dose amount of rhBMP-2, as well as corresponding costs."

Understanding the underlying mechanism and the prognostic value of this symptom will help better manage patients. SARS-CoV-2, as SARS-CoV-1, may likely spread to the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory nerve, a known gateway for respiratory neurotropic viruses. We hypothesise that sudden loss of smell due to COVID-19 is the consequence of a protective host defence mechanism involving apoptosis of olfactory receptor neurons. Sacrificing smelling over neuroprotection is a logical strategy, even more so as olfaction is the only sense with the ability to regenerate in adults. Induced apoptosis of olfactory neurons has been shown in mice, successfully preventing neuroinvasion. On the other hand, adult olfactory neurogenesis has been shown to be regulated in part by the immune system, allowing to restore olfactory function. Understanding anosmia as part of a defence mechanism would support the concept of sudden anosmia as being a positive prognostic factor in the short term. Also, it may orient research to investigate the risk of future neurodegenerative disease linked to persisting coronavirus in neurons."

Of great interest, some cases of CS during pregnancy spontaneously resolve after delivery. Most studies suggest that aberrant luteinizing hormone (LH)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) receptor (LHCGR) seems to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of CS during pregnancy. However, not all women during pregnancy are observed cortisol hypersecretion. Moreover, some cases of adrenal tumors or macronodular hyperplasia with LHCGR expressed, have no response to hCG or LH. Therefore, alternative pathogenic mechanisms are indicated. It has been recently reported that estrogen binding to estrogen receptor α (ERα) could enhance the adrenocortical adenocarcinoma (ACC) cell proliferation. Herein, we hypothesize that ERα is probably involved in CS development during pregnancy. Better understanding of the possible mechanism of ERα on cortisol production and adrenocortical tumorigenesis will contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of CS during pregnancy."

The realization of action potentials generated by neurons that cause electrochemical signals to be released and cross synapses may create primordial feelings. A primordial feeling may precede image making and mark the first moment of subjectivity while thinking. It may produce a Feeling of Knowing (FOK) that when associated with physical sensations originating within the body (i.e., interoception) cause a broadly heightened awareness of thought and become a risk factor for certain aspects of mental afflictions. The strategy outlined in this article is to use mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and exposure activity to break up the automaticity of habitual reactions to primordial feelings as FOKs associated with interoception and do something different. Thus the individual does not move away from the unpleasant interoceptive experience but instead stays with it and learns to not push the not right experience away but instead just let it be. Through mindfulness-based interventions unpleasant interoception is used to focus one’s reactivity to unpleasant primordial feelings and FOKs and break up the automaticity of being driven by them. Thereby, one decides to approach these internal sensations though exposure to the interoceptive not just right sense instead of engaging in neutralizing activity."

It originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world, causing over 5,569,679 global cases and 351,866 deaths in almost every country in the world, including Europe, particularly Italy. In general, based on existing data published to date, 80.9% of patients infected with the virus develop mild infection; 13.8% severe pneumonia; 4.7% respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure; 3% of these cases are fatal. Critical patients have been shown to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hospitalization in intensive care units. The average age of patients admitted to hospital is 57–79 years, with one third half with an underlying disease. Asymptomatic infections have also been described, but their frequency is not known. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is mainly airborne from one person to another via droplets. The data available so far seem to indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host. The virus attacks type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi through the binding of the Spike protein (S protein) to viral receptors, of which the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) receptor is the most important. ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in numerous tissues, including the oropharynx and conjunctiva, but mostly distributed in ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi. The arrival of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs causes severe primary interstitial viral pneumonia that can lead to the “cytokine storm syndrome”, a deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response triggered by the activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6), whose effect is extensive lung tissue damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), that are life-threatening for patients with COVID-19. In the absence of a therapy of proven efficacy, current management consists of off-label or compassionate use therapies based on antivirals, antiparasitic agents in both oral and parenteral formulation, anti-inflammatory drugs, oxygen therapy and heparin support and convalescent plasma. Like most respiratory viruses can function and replicate at low temperatures (i.e. 34–35 °C) and assuming viral thermolability of SARS-CoV-2, local instillation or aerosol of antiviral (i.e. remdesivir) in humid heat vaporization (40°–41 °C) in the first phase of infection (phenotype I, before admission), both in asymptomatic but nasopharyngeal swab positive patients, together with antiseptic-antiviral oral gargles and povidone-iodine eye drops for conjunctiva (0,8–5% conjunctival congestion), would attack the virus directly through the receptors to which it binds, significantly decreasing viral replication, risk of evolution to phenotypes IV and V, reducing hospitalization and therefore death."

Leukocyte immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor subfamily B member 1 (LILRB1) involves in the occurrence and development of various tumors through transmitting immune inhibitory signals. However, the regulatory mechanism of LILRB1 underlying the disease progression of adenocarcinoma remains vague. This study is aimed to disclose the expression pattern of LILRB1 on adenocarcinoma and its indicative roles on the diagnosis and prognosis of adenocarcinoma patients.
Methods
LILRB1 level in microarray was measured using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Expression analysis of LILRB1 gene were based on the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2.0 (GEPIA2) and Oncomine databases. Survival and correlation analyses were analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (Breastinvasivecarcinoma, TCGA-BRCA).
Results
The IHC results showed that the number of LILRB1-positive cells were robustly elevated in some common subtypes of adenocarcinoma including thyroid gland papillary carcinoma, gastric mixed adenocarcinoma, colon and rectal mucinous adenocarcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and invasive ductal breast carcinoma compared to their corresponding para-carcinoma. Although the enhancement of LILRB1 expression was only observed in pancreaticadenocarcinoma (PAAD) by using GEPIA2, its expression presented a significant increase in the above subtypes of adenocarcinoma by analyzing using Oncomine database. Besides, there had a significant positive association between LILRB1 expression status and pathological stages, and a negative association between LILRB1 status and Overall Survival (OS) probability in the above certain subtypes of adenocarcinoma.
Conclusion
LILRB1 is abnormally upregulated in certain subtypes of adenocarcinoma. Patients with low LILRB1 possibly portend a good prognosis in adenocarcinoma. These findings imply that LILRB1 may act as a diagnostic and prognostic target in some subtypes of adenocarcinoma."

Thereby natural occurrence antibodies to Pg inhibit the promotion of breast carcinogenesis. Antibodies to E2 and Pg increase E2 concentration but decrease Pg concentration when the levels of antibodies to Bp are high. Therefore, antibodies against Bp switch hormonal effects of antibodies to E2 and Pg from the increase of Pg concentration to the increase of E2, thus stimulating breast cancer promotion.

The world is facing a pandemic of unseen proportions caused by a corona virus named SARS-CoV-2 with unprecedent worldwide measures being taken to tackle its contagion. Person-to-person transmission is accepted but WHO only considers aerosol transmission when procedures or support treatments that produce aerosol are performed. Transmission mechanisms are not fully understood and there is evidence for an airborne route to be considered, as the virus remains viable in aerosols for at least 3 h and that mask usage was the best intervention to prevent infection. Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC) are used as a primary infection disease control measure. However, if not correctly used, they may contribute to the transmission/spreading of airborne diseases as proposed in the past for SARS. The authors believe that airborne transmission is possible and that HVAC systems when not adequately used may contribute to the transmission of the virus, as suggested by descriptions from Japan, Germany, and the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. Previous SARS outbreaks reported at Amoy Gardens, Emergency Rooms and Hotels, also suggested an airborne transmission. Further studies are warranted to confirm our hypotheses but the assumption of such way of transmission would cause a major shift in measures recommended to prevent infection such as the disseminated use of masks and structural changes to hospital and other facilities with HVAC systems."

The electrocardiograph (ECG) signal has been used as a reference. The heart-rate has been estimated using both signals; the PPG and PEPG. The hypothesis of this paper is that PPG and PEPG signals features integration can lead to improve the understanding and estimation of the human body's vital signs by including multi-dimensional features. The results show that the PPG signal is the most robust technique in terms of change in frequency and time domains under the same conditions. Additionally, the PPG signal is less sensitive to artifacts compared to the PEPG signal. Such a study opens possibilities to consider the PPG signal for a wide range of biomedical applications especially in wearable biomedical technologies to utilize its non-invasive property."

Elimination Communication (EC) refers to a caregiver’s nurturant response to infant cues, while also using timing, to gently and non-coercively cradle the infant in a supported, secure squatting position to eliminate. Such practices have been reported in ethnographic observations of hunter-gatherer care of infants, who cry less than minority world (Western) infants. We hypothesize that the current minority world practice of delayed toilet training and lack of caregiver response to elimination cues results in excessive, unexplained infant crying as infants eliminate in the constraints of diapers and in non-beneficial postures. As a corollary, we hypothesize that EC will reduce unexplained infant crying in the early months, perhaps even planating the Normal Crying Curve. To evaluate our hypothesis, we designed a pilot study to collect empirical data from mothers who practiced EC with their infants, tracking crying and fussing at Weeks 4, 6, 8 and 12 primarily utilizing a 24-hour Baby’s Daily Diary. We computed baseline measures, compared our crying data with those from the literature, assessed our data for internal crying peaks, and used hierarchical multi-level modeling to evaluate cross-level interactions. We found that infants in our pilot study cried on average 50.3% less (p < 0.05), and up to 70.9% less in Week 6, compared to literature studies. Moreover, when we evaluated our data to seek out a significant crying peak across weeks, no such crying duration difference was found. Using hierarchical generalized linear modeling, we found that greater daily crying episodes predicted greater daily elimination opportunities. Shorter crying episodes predicted a greater number of daily elimination opportunities compared to longer crying episodes, especially among low baseline crying infants. Our results suggest that crying prompts caregivers to offer elimination opportunities, but when the crying continues, caregivers may try other behavioral responses, such as feeding. Additionally, our results suggest that with the practice of EC, unexplained infant crying may be significantly reduced and warrant future research with an expanded sample. If the practice of EC indeed planates the Normal Crying Curve, then such results will have a significant impact on our understanding of unexplained infant crying."

Based on available evidence, we put forward the hypothesis that the different MI:DCI ratios influence the selection process, determining the dominant follicle and the follicles that will undergo atresia. We also suggest that the MI:DCI ratio may be regulated by follicles’ intrinsic characteristics, which possibly drive the cohort recruitment at each ovarian cycle."

The emergence of drug resistant parasites, severe toxic effects of existing anti-leishmanials, and nonexistence of an effective vector control measures and human vaccine(s) against VL poses a serious problem to VL treatment and control. In VL, the disease pathogenicity is correlated with the up-regulation of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β), which can deactivate macrophages and favors the growth of intracellular parasite and disease clearance is expedited through the increased levels of Th1 mediated cytokines (IL-12) which can activate macrophages to release IFN-γ; stimulates inducible NOS to release NO and kills the leishmania parasite. Enkephalins (ENKs), are endogenous neuropeptides with immune stimulatory properties. ENKs and its fragmented peptides at lower concentrations activates Th1 type cytokines and inhibits Th2 type cytokines, which may be helpful in parasite clearance. ENKs in combination with currently available anti-leishmanial drugs may be helpful in reducing the toxicity and duration of therapy. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ENKs alone or in combination with current recommended anti-leishmanial agents might be effective in the treatment of VL with enhanced efficacy and safety profile."

Due to strenuous training and competitions, athletes may present sleep complaints compromising good quality and quantity of sleep. Studies have related sleep debt to the occurrence of musculoskeletal injuries in athletes, but the mechanisms that can lead to this are not entirely clear. Studies involving animals and humans have shown that poor sleep quality can cause significant changes in hormones and cytokines. Demonstrating that this hormones changes lead to a decrease of testosterone and growth hormone levels and increased cortisol levels, important hormones in the process of protein synthesis and degradation. In athletes, the sport itself is a risk factor of injuries, and sleep debt may result in overtraining syndrome associated with inflammatory markers and ultimately to immune system dysfunction. Thus, we hypothesize that athletes who have sleep debt are more susceptible to musculoskeletal injuries due to increased catabolic pathway signaling, i.e. protein degradation and decreased anabolic pathway signaling, compromising muscle integrity. In this sense, we indicate the relationship between musculoskeletal injuries and sleep debt involving new targets for immunological signaling pathways that start the reduction of the muscle recovery process."

The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and its pathology of associated acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, coagulopathy and multiorgan failure is not known. SARS-CoV-2 is an envelope virus with S (spike), M (membrane), N (nucleocapsid) and E (envelop) proteins. In a closely related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the transmembrane E protein exerts an important role in membrane-ionic transport through viroporins, deletion of which reduced levels of IL-1β and a remarkably reduced lung edema compared to wild type. IL-1β is generated by macrophages upon activation of intracellular NLRP3 (NOD-like, leucine rich repeat domains, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3), part of the functional NLRP3 inflammasome complex that detects pathogenic microorganisms and stressors, while neutrophils are enhanced by increasing levels of IL-1β. Expiring neutrophils undergo “NETosis”, producing thread-like extracellular structures termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which protect against mild infections and microbes. However, uncontrolled NET production can cause acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathy, multiple organ failure, and autoimmune disease. Herein, we present arguments underlying our hypothesis that IL-1β and NETs, mediated via NLRP3 inflammasomes, form a feed-forward loop leading to the excessive alveolar and endothelial damage observed in severe cases of COVID-19. Considering such assertions, we propose potential drug candidates that could be used to alleviate such pathologies. Considering that recent efforts to ascertain effective treatments of COVID-19 in severe patients has been less than successful, investigating novel avenues of treating this virus are essential."

Such novel recyclable VPD could effectively avoid thoracotomy, thus resulting in favorable outcomes with reassuring safety."

In DDH, hip joint forms normally during the organogenesis, but deforms during the fetal development. Acetabulum remains comparable in width with normal acetabulum, but has increased length and decreased depth, resulting in a poor coverage of the femoral head. In cases of severe hip subluxation and luxation due to DDH, the femoral head articulates with the external side of the iliac bone, forming a neoacetabulum in the position that was genetically predetermined to become bony tissue. A neoacetabulum is therefore formed under intermittent mechanical pressure, but never has the depth of a physiological acetabulum due to different forces at this new location. Over time, the depth of the neoacetabulum increases, and a crest is formed that obstructs reposition of the femoral head into the anatomic acetabulum. We hypothesize that the neoacetabulum on the iliac bone in DDH patients is formed of hyaline cartilage, despite the lack of genetic predisposition for hyaline cartilage formation in this area. We assume that as the femoral head migrates during development in such patients, joint capsular tissue interposes between the external side of the iliac bone and the femoral head, and a cartilaginous metaplasia of the capsule follows. This results in elongation of the acetabular cartilage in the same direction as the femoral head migrated. This assumption is based on the finding that in patients with hip luxation such interposed joint capsule showed signs of cartilaginous transformation. Furthermore, in the inner part of such joint capsules, proteoglycan production was notably higher than that of other non-cartilaginous tissue. Also, high expression of cartilaginous genes, which are usually not expressed in this tissue, was observed. Confirmation of this hypothesis would put a new perspective on the pathogenesis of DDH and could lead to better management or even prevention of this condition."

PHPT causes persistent hypercalcemia via the elevated and constant secretion of parathyroid hormone. Due to the effects of parathyroid hormone on target organs such as the bones, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract, untreated PHPT can lead to complications such as decreased bone mineral density, nephrolithiasis, and chronic abdominal pain, respectively. Given PHPT’s drastic effect on calcium metabolism, it is likely that the condition also affects other organ systems, such as the inner ear, which rely on calcium for normal structure and function. Specifically, the saccule and utricle have otoconia made of calcium carbonate deposited on a protein framework. We hypothesize that PHPT, the epitome calcium disorder, can cause otoconia degeneration, one manifestation of which is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). As a preliminarily test of this hypothesis, we measured the levels of otolin-1, an inner ear glycoprotein found in the otoconia protein framework and a proposed biomarker for otoconia degeneration in patients with PHPT. We found a positive linear relationship between PTH (parathyroid hormone) and otolin-1 levels (R2 = 0.53) and total calcium and PTH levels (R2 = 0.32). These findings suggest that both PTH and total calcium levels affect otolin-1 levels, implying that the calcium dysregulation caused by PHPT may contribute to the otoconia breakdown and may be associated with inner ear disorders such as BPPV."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD) are the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, associated with modulation of acetylcholine levels and amyloid beta accumulation & dopamine level and alpha-synuclein oligomerization, respectively. Therefore, a better understanding of their pathological mechanisms reveals novel target proteins and encourages exploitation of suitable lead molecules. In the present study, targets for AD and PD were sought not only to suppress the pathological condition but to restore the normal physiological function. In this view, activation of retinoic acid receptor alpha can be formulated as a novel target to improve choline acetyltransferase transcription that works together with acetylcholine esterase and beta-secretase 1 inhibition against AD. Likewise, inhibition of Polo-like kinase 2 fails to phosphorylate alpha-synuclein and motivates efficient autophagic clearance. Therefore, PLK2 inhibition, together with L-DOPA supplementation and monoamine oxidase B inhibition widens the therapeutic options for PD. As oxidative stress is the major factor for neurodegeneration, AMPK activation stabilizes energy metabolism and Sirtuin 1 (histone deacetylase 1) activation enhances AMPK, PGC1a and Nrf gene expressions. Phytochemical extracts from saffron stigma were broadly appreciated on memory enhancement and cognition. However, the exact mechanism was not established. Therefore, this inspires the exploitation of phytochemicals in saffron stigma extract using in-silico tools, to anticipate lead molecules that interact with various neurodegeneration associated protein targets."

Hydrogen peroxide is produced physiologically by oral bacteria and plays a significant role in the balance of oral microecology since it is an important antimicrobial agent. In the epithelial cells, the enzyme superoxide dismutase catalyzes a reaction leading from hydrogen peroxide to the ion superoxide. The induced oxidative stress stimulates a local innate response via activation of the toll-like receptors and the NF-κB. Those kinds of reactions are also activated by viral infections. Virus-induced oxidative stress plays an important role in the regulation of the host immune system and the specific oxidant-sensitive pathway is one of the effective strategies against viral infections. Therefore, nose/mouth/throat washing with hydrogen peroxide may enhance those local innate responses to viral infections and help protect against the current coronavirus pandemic. We strongly encourage the rapid development of randomized controlled trials in both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative subjects to test the preliminary findings from the in-vitro and in-vivo observational studies that we identified."

EAAT-2 dysfunction has been associated with the neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Impairment of EAAT-2 transporter function results excess accumulation of glutamate in synaptic cleft that acts on post-synaptic glutaminergic receptors excessively resulting in influx of Na+ and Ca2+ ions into the neurons. This triggers excitotoxicity in post-synaptic neurons by activating apoptotic or necrotic pathways causing neurodegeneration in AD. The compounds that increase the EAAT-2 activity may have therapeutic potential for neuroprotection in AD. The positive allosteric site activation of EAAT-2 represents a promising entry point for the identification of novel pharmacological compounds for the management of neurodegenerative conditions involving glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity.

Endocardial rupture with exposure of infarcted tissues triggers platelet thrombosis within the rupture site and then the thrombus grows towards the ventricular chamber forming LVT. This hypothesis is implicated by the comparable clinical features of patients with LVT or with cardiac rupture, and supported by experimental findings in murine model of AMI revealing the mechanistic link between rupture and LVT. This hypothesis, if confirmed, would improve our understanding on the pathophysiology of both rupture and LVT as two pivotal mechanical complications after AMI, and the role of platelets in the setting of AMI and hence the use of anti-platelet therapies. Future studies are warranted to test this hypothesis by serial cardiac imaging on AMI patients with high risk of LVT."

Although PPI is clinically useful, why PPI is inhibited in schizophrenia is largely unknown. Prepulse inhibition is mediated by M2-like muscarinic acetylcholine receptor on neurons in the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC), activation of this receptor induces Gαi dissociation, and inhibits adenylyl cyclase, resulting in the inhibition of the neurons. On the other hand, the symptoms of schizophrenia are mainly linked to hyperactive dopaminergic activity, mediated by dopamine D2-like receptor. Interestingly, D2-like receptor also uses Gαi. This means that both M2-like acetylcholine receptor and D2-like dopamine receptor use same Gαi-protein, competitively. Thus, chronic over-activation of D2-like receptor observed in schizophrenia may disrupt normal M2-like acetylcholine receptor functions due to their shared coupling to Gαi-proteins, i.e. by reducing the amount of Gαi-protein available for M2-like acetylcholine receptors, resulting in the impairment of PPI."

Empirical evidence of viral genomic material shedding weeks after apparent clinical and laboratorial resolution of COVID-19 may be an indirect proof for persistent viral infection. Furthermore, tropism towards certain immune-privileged territories may facilitate immune evasion by this virus. Structural homology with SARS-CoV-1 indicates that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to directly impair pRb and p53, which are key gatekeepers with tumor suppressor functions. Additionally, COVID-19 features preeminent inflammatory response with marked oxidative stress, which acts as both as initiator and promotor of carcinogenesis. Should there be a carcinogenic risk associated with SARS-CoV-2, the implications for public health are plenty, as infected patients should be closely watched during long periods of follow-up. Additional investigation to establish or exclude the possibility for persistent infection is paramount to identify and prevent possible complications in the future."

To suggest an in silico modelling approach to estimate the fatigue failure on peripheral Nitinol stents implanted in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and interpret the clinically observed stent fractures of a retrospective series of patients.
Materials and Methods
Preoperative data of 27 patients who underwent SFA Nitinol stenting were retrospectively analyzed. Data about preoperative features of the SFA and the lesion were collected. Follow-up data were also collected about the occurrence of restenosis/occlusion and stent fracture.
Results
After a lengthening of the entire vessel, the occluded region was slightly stretched due to its high stiffness, whereas the healthy regions accommodated the artery length variation. The stent fatigue was predicted to be higher in the regions of low stiffness and higher shortening. In 7 out of 27 patients a stent fracture was clinically recorded. The model resulted to be accurate in 90% of the cases.
Conclusions
The clinical outcomes in terms of biomechanical fatigue behavior of peripheral Nitinol stents of the SFA could be interpreted by our new approach."

Sequence data of Avian Influenza (AI) viruses were retrieved from accessible databases (GenBank, GISAID, IRD) and analyzed for the existence, as well as functional prediction of the putative zinc finger or ‘‘zinc-binding’’ motif(s) of HA protein. It is hypothesized that the ZF motif(s) in HA of AI virus can be used as a ‘‘novel’’ biomarker for categorization of the virus and/or its virulence. As a model for analysis, we used the H5 subtypes of highly pathogenic, non-pathogenic and low pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI, NPAI and LPAI) viruses of H5N1 and H5N2 of avian and human origins. Interestingly, our method of characterization using the zinc-finger agrees with the existing classification in distinguishing between highly pathogenic and non-pathogenic or low pathogenic subtypes. The new method also clearly distinguished between low and non-pathogenic strains of H5N2 and H5N1 which are indistinguishable by the existing method that utilizes the sequence of the polybasic amino acids of the proteolytic cleavage site for pathogenicity. It is hypothesized that zinc through the activities of zinc-binding proteins modulates the virulence property of the viral subtypes. Our observation further revealed that only the HA protein among the eight encoded proteins of influenza viruses contain high numbers of Cys-His residues. It is expected that the information gathered from the analysis of the data will be useful to generate more research hypotheses/designs that will give further insight towards the identification and control of avian influenza virus through the molecular manipulation of zinc finger motifs present in viral HA protein."

The vagal nerve contains a complex neuro-endocrine-immune network. The majority, at least 66%, of the gastric myenteric neurons receive direct cholinergic excitatory stimulation from the pre-enteric vagal nerve. Changes in vagal function may cause stomach problems, although the mechanisms that change the vagal function have not yet been fully illuminated. Considering the course of the vagal nerve in the cervical region, it is thought that conditions such as stiffness, tightness and decreased elasticity in this region may compress the vagal nerve andmay affect vagal function. According to this hypothesis, neuroinflammation and hyperalgesia may occur in the vagal nerve under mechanical pressure, resulting in increased complaints of pain and burning in the stomach increases. However, as the vagal nerve has various effects on the motility of the stomach and vagal dysfunction affects the motor function of the stomach, relaxation techniques applied to the soft tissues of the cervical region will provide mechanical relief in the nerve. Thus, the vagal nerve will be decompressed and be able to function optimally. According to our clinical observations, in patients whose soft tissues in the cervical region are relaxed, gastric symptoms are decreased. Based on research results and clinical experience, cervical region tightness can be considered to cause stomach problems through the vagal nerve, and soft tissue relaxation of the cervical region can be a promising treatment method for stomach symptoms."

In this paper, a novel hypothesis on the pathogenesis is proposed and with which some clinical phenomena are explained. In those with crowded cerebellopontine angle in anatomy, the cranial nerve root and surrounding vessel are getting closer and closer to each other with aging and finally the neurovascular conflict happens. As the interfacial friction associated with pulse, the nerve incurs demyelination. Since this pathological change develops to a certain degree, some transmembrane proteins emerge from the nerve due to a series of signaling pathway mediated by inflammatory cytokines. Among them, voltage-gated (Nav1.3) and mechanosensitive (Piezo2) ion channels may play the important role. With pulsatile compressions, the Piezo2 drives the resting potential toward depolarization forming a state of subthreshold membrane potential oscillation. Under this condition, just an appropriate pressure can make the membrane potential easy to reach threshold and activate the sodium channel, eventually generating conductible action potentials from the axon. When these ectopic action potentials propagate to the central nerve system, an illusion of sharp pain is perceived; while to the nerve-muscle junctions, an attack of irregular muscle constriction occurs. This hypothesis can well explain the symptomatic manifestation of paroxysmal attacks aroused by emotions. When we get nervous or excited, our heart rate and blood pressure alter correspondingly, which may give rise to “a just right pressure” – with specific frequency, amplitude and angle – impacting the suffered nerve to reach the threshold of impulse ignition. After a successful microvascular decompression surgery, the trigger is gone (there is no compression anymore) and the symptom is alleviated. While the postoperative recurrence could be attributable to Teflon granuloma development if had been placed improperly – for this nerve root has been susceptible no matter to arteries or to neoplasms. Besides, it may illustrate the clinical phenomenon that secondary TN or HFS cases are seldom caused by schwannoma: with a proliferative sheath, the nerve root is actually insulated. By contrast, not all neurovascular contacts can lead to the onset: it demands an exclusive extent of demyelination firstly."

At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with this disease are only supportive. It is well known that zinc (Zn) possesses a variety of direct and indirect antiviral properties, which are realized through different mechanisms. Administration of Zn supplement has a potential to enhance antiviral immunity, both innate and humoral, and to restore depleted immune cell function or to improve normal immune cell function, in particular in immunocompromised or elderly patients. Zn may also act in a synergistic manner when co-administered with the standard antiviral therapy, as was demonstrated in patients with hepatitis C, HIV, and SARS-CoV-1. Effectiveness of Zn against a number of viral species is mainly realized through the physical processes, such as virus attachment, infection, and uncoating. Zn may also protect or stabilize the cell membrane which could contribute to blocking of the virus entry into the cell. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that Zn may inhibit viral replication by alteration of the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in rhinoviruses, HCV, and influenza virus, and diminish the RNA-synthesizing activity of nidoviruses, for which SARS-CoV-2 belongs. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that Zn supplementation may be of potential benefit for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19."

abstract = "It is widely believed that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers a disproportionate immune response which causes a devastating systemic injury, particularly in individuals with obesity, itself a chronic, multi-organ inflammatory disease. Immune cells accumulate in visceral adipose tissue and together with paracrine adipocytes release a wide range of biologically active cytokines (including IL-1β, IL5, IL6 and IL8) that can result in both local, pulmonary and systemic inflammation. A more intense ‘cytokine storm’ is postulated as the mechanism behind the extreme immune response seen in severe COVID-19. It is striking how dangerous the combination of obesity and COVID-19 is, resulting in a greater risk of ICU admission and a higher mortality. Furthermore, patients from a BAME background appear to have increased mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection; they also have a higher prevalence of central obesity and its metabolic complications. In the absence of an effective vaccine, the therapeutic potential of immune-modulating drugs is a priority, but the development of new drugs is expensive and time-consuming. A more pragmatic solution would be to seek to repurpose existing drugs, particularly those that might suppress the heightened cytokine activity seen in obesity, the major risk factor for a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist licensed to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis. It has been shown to diminish pulmonary response to antigen, tissue eosinophilia and IL-5 expression in inflammatory cells. It has also been shown to decrease elevated levels of IL-1β and IL8 in humans with viral upper respiratory tract infections compared with placebo-treated patients. In addition, in silico studies have demonstrated a high binding affinity of the montelukast molecule to the terminal site of the virus’s main protease enzyme which is needed for virus RNA synthesis and replication. Montelukast, which is cheap, safe and widely available would appear to have the potential to be an ideal candidate drug for clinical trials, particularly in early stage disease before irreparable tissue damage has already occurred.
Hypothesis
Through a direct anti-viral effect, or by suppression of heightened cytokine release in response to SARS-CoV-2, montelukast will reduce the severity of immune-mediated multiorgan damage resulting from COVID-19, particularly in patients with central obesity and metabolic syndrome."

According to the pathological studies of COVID-19 and SARS, a sharp decrease in T lymphocytes leads to the breakdown of the immune system. The cellular immune system of children differs from that of adults may be the keystone of atypical clinical manifestations or even covert infection. The frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated pathogens infections might be resulting in trained immunity of innate immune cells, immune fitness of adaptive immune cells or cross-protection of antibodies in the children. Therefore, due to lack of specific vaccine, some vaccines for tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia may have certain application potential for the front-line health workers in the prevention and control of COVID-19. However, for high-risk susceptible populations, such as the elderly with basic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, it is necessary to explore the remedial effect of the planned immune process on their immunity to achieve the trained immunity or immune fitness, so as to improve their own antiviral ability."

CQ and HCQ (CQ/HCQ) inhibit pH-dependent steps of SARS-CoV-2 replication by increasing pH in intracellular vesicles and interfere with virus particle delivery into host cells. Besides direct antiviral effects, CQ/HCQ specifically target extracellular zinc to intracellular lysosomes where it interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and coronavirus replication. As zinc deficiency frequently occurs in elderly patients and in those with cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, or diabetes, we hypothesize that CQ/HCQ plus zinc supplementation may be more effective in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality than CQ or HCQ in monotherapy. Therefore, CQ/HCQ in combination with zinc should be considered as additional study arm for COVID-19 clinical trials."

One of the histopathological hallmarks of AD is the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers as neuritic plaques in brain. The Aβ oligomers are produced from amyloid precursor protein by the action of secretase enzymes, among which β-secretase 1 (BACE1) catalyses the rate-limiting step. Thus, BACE1 is one of the most important therapeutic targets in preventing deposition of the plaques, progression of the disease, and thus as a disease-modifying therapeutic strategy. The present study was undertaken to isolate and identify novel phytochemicals from the pteridophyte Dipteris wallichii, and to determine their pharmacological properties. A novel compound was eventually detected and named Dip-1, and its pharmacological properties were predicted using computational modelling. The compound was found to have pharmacophores similar to those of known BACE1 inhibitors. Thus, further studies were performed to determine its drug likeness, blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, inhibitory potential and IC50 value. The results were promising, and the compound was found to have high drug likeness and BBB permeability, and a potent inhibitor of BACE1, with IC50 value of 0.0372 nM. Thus, the present study reports a novel BACE1 inhibitor from the plant D. wallichii, and is significant owing to its therapeutic implication as a disease-modifying therapy for AD."

abstract = "With the number of cases crossing six million (and more than three hundred and seventy thousand deaths) worldwide, there is a dire need of a vaccine (and repurposing of drugs) for SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). It can be argued that a vaccine may be the most efficient way to contain the spread of this disease and prevent its future onset. While many attempts are being made to design and develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, pertinent technological hitches do exist. That is perhaps one of the reasons that we don’t have vaccine for coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-1 and MERS). Recently developed CRISPR-mediated genome editing approach can be repurposed into a cell-modification endeavor in addition to (and rather than) correcting defective parts of genome. With this premise, B-cells can be engineered into universal donor, antigen specific, perpetually viable, long lasting, non-oncogenic, relatively benign, antibody producing cells which may serve as an effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and, by the same rationale, other viruses and pathogens."

Psychiatric disorders cause a high burden of disease and disability for the society. Liquid biopsies provide potent opportunities for screening programs, diagnosis, prognostic stratification and treatment monitorization. Previously, the liquid biopsy studies were mainly focused on the several malignancies without proper screen methods, but this approach has also a strong potential for decreasing disease burden in CNS pathologies. The main restriction for the diagnosis of CNS diseases is the lack of the methods to receive biochemical/functional information form a tightly enveloped compartment.
The hypothesis/theory
In this proposal, we aim to develop a fast and cheap diagnostic platform based on the detection of exosomes originating from the central nervous system (CNS) cells. We intended to develop a sensor device with minimum maintenance costs, which is highly specific and sensitive for psychiatric diseases.
Evaluation of the hypothesis/idea
In order to give background information for our proposal; we began with reviewing the concept of liquid biopsies and adaptation of this concept for psychiatric disorders. Then we discussed the conventional and novel methods for the detection of extracellular vesicles (EV). Furthermore, we discussed the detection of exosomes originating from central nervous system and methods analyzing the content of the EVs. Additionally, we reviewed the imaging techniques for detection and visualization of EVs.
Empirical data
We used in silico research tools (MetaCore™ version 6.37, Clarivate Analytics, and ExoCarta database) to detect appropriate disease specific exosomal markers. We proposed our design for the detection of EVs based on the immune-capture of EVs and detection of surface antigens via the antibody conjugated fluorophores. We also proposed a design to increase the channels for detection of exosomal antigens by using bioinformatics methods, including pathway networks, RDOC matrices and exosome databases which we called “Mentalexo” approach. We applied this approach on depression and addiction disorders in order to find appropriate exosomal markers.
Consequences of the hypothesis and discussion
We believe that our proposal may contribute to the conception of new diagnostic devices focusing on the detection of exosomes in psychiatric conditions."

abstract = "Despite tremendous efforts of experimental and clinical studies and knowledge, the pathophysiology of severe mental illness (SMI), including bipolar disorder (BD), unipolar depression (mood disorders, MD), and schizophrenia (SCZ), remains poorly understood. Besides their chronic course and high prevalence in society, mental and somatic comorbidities are really serious problems; patients with these disorders have increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) diseases (CVD) including coronary artery diseases (CAD, i.e. myocardial infarction and angina), stroke, sudden cardiac death, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, and thromboembolic disease. Although it is determined that triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels are increased in MD and SCZ, the underlying reason remains unknown. Considering this, we propose that electronegative LDL (L5) is probably the main crucial element to understanding CVD induced by SMI and to discovering novel remedial approaches for these diseases. When it is hypothesized that L5 is greatly presupposed in CV system abnormalities, it follows that the anti-L5 therapies and even antioxidant treatment options may open new therapeutic opportunities to prevent CVD diseases secondary to SMI. In this review article, we tried to bring a very original subject to the attention of readers who are interested in lipoprotein metabolism in terms of experimental, clinical, and cell culture studies that corroborate the involvement of L5 in physiopathology of CVD secondary to SMI and also the new therapeutic approaches for these disorders."

This phenomenon is termed spontaneous decidualization. Repeated menstruation is produced in modern women because of better general health and having fewer pregnancies later in life and limiting breast feeding. The repeated breakdown of a progesterone primed endometrium releases an inflammatory cascade which appears to have short and long term adverse consequences. Repetitive modern menstruation is no longer a sign of good general and reproductive health but a harbinger of possible future health problems. Cyclical menstruation has no intrinsic biological value or necessity in modern life. Spontaneous decidualization can be prevented by using estrogen-progestin combinations or progestins on their own. Newer and safer hormonal products are now available and should become even safer in the future. Hormonal suppression of spontaneous decidualization should be encouraged in adolescent and young women as a health promotional option."

abstract = "The recent outbreak of Covid-19 has represented a major challenge for the countries affected by the disease, not only in terms of loss of human life, economic downturn, and constraint on individual freedom, but also for the great pressure on the national health systems and hospitals. The 380 kDa virus has been a perfect storm, especially for those national health systems used to working with limited resources and high intensity rhythms, such as Italy. For the first time in the new century, a virtually unknown fast-spreading disease has caused a public health emergency thus forcing most countries to deal with an insurmountable logistic gap. Hence, every branch of Medicine, even though not directly involved in the treatment, has been called upon to provide its contribution to resolve the crisis. It is now becoming more apparent that Covid-19 is not solely a lung disease, but a complex systemic disease involving several organs and systems. This is due to an abnormal inflammatory response which eventually leads to multisystemic coagulopathy which mainly, but not uniquely, targets the lungs. Although the pathophysiology of this syndrome is still not fully understood, macrophages and their immune complex system seem to play a key role. It is not yet clear why some patients develop the violent immune response which results in pneumonitis while others do not. There are clues indicating that the systemic hyper-inflammation defined as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), or cytokine storm, requires an increase in choline consumption to synthesize phosphatidylcholine and stimulate phagocytosis, organelle biogenesis, secretory functions, and endocytosis. 18F-Fluorocholine is a synthetic analog of the naturally occurring choline normally used for PET/CT imaging of prostate cancer patients. 18F-Fluorocholine could image and quantify the macrophage activity in pulmonary interstitial infiltrates of Covid-19 pneumonia. If the hypothesis is confirmed experimentally, 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT could be used to in vivo image and quantify the degree of lung inflammation and potentially stratify the gravity of this disease."

Since SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS has a strong immunological component, many investigators are utilizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, TNF-alpha and CCR5. However, targeting a single cytokine with an expensive monoclonal antibody could be a less pragmatic approach. We propose the use of cyclophosphamide as an immunomodulator, given its proven role in various settings including autoimmune diseases, and in the post-haploidentical stem cell transplant. Cyclophosphamide could deplete cytotoxic and effector T cell populations while relatively sparing the regulatory T cells (Tregs). Cyclophosphamide could tip the balance away from the overtly pro-inflammatory and could be a less expensive and effective alternative to the currently investigated monoclonal antibodies."

Therefore, an automatic PR determination method for analyzing of long-term EEG is described in this study. The presented technique was applied to the pathological EEG recordings that were obtained from two different datasets gathered as a retrospective in Selcuk University Hospital (SUH) and Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH). With this method, PR in the dataset was determined and then compared with the ones detected by the specialist doctor. Two tests were carried out in the SUH dataset and the classification success of the method was 83.22% for test 1 and 85.19% for test 2. On the other hand, three tests were carried out for two different position values for BCH dataset. The highest classification success of the six tests was 75% for test 5, while the lowest classification success appeared as 58.33% for test 6. As a result, the overall success in the detection of PR with the conducted method is 84.20% for SUH and 66.7% for BCH. According to these results, the determination of PR that is known to be indicative of neurological disorders and presenting them to expert information will accelerate the interpretation of long-term EEG recordings."

Special feet connected to a prosthesis, prosthetic sports feet, enable athletes with a lower limb amputation to run. The selection of a prosthetic sports feet is usually based on body weight and preferred sports performance. The selection of a prosthetic sport feet is also based on clinicians who likely have limited experience due to a small number of athletes with a lower limb amputation.
Hypothesis
Athletes with a lower limb amputation are not satisfied with the use and service associated with prosthetic sports feet due to a lack of prosthetic sports feet provision guidelines, poorer function of prosthetic sports feet compared to the anatomical foot and ankle, and limited experience of clinicians.
Evaluation of hypothesis
A mixed-methods study in 16 athletes with a lower limb amputation using a prosthetic sport foot from Össur or Otto Bock, included semi-structured interviews and quantitative analysis. Three dimensions of prosthetic sports feet were investigated: 1) use, 2) provision process, and 3) cosmetics. Qualitative data were analyzed to identify factors influencing consumer satisfaction. Quantitative data were analyzed to investigate satisfaction and perceived relative importance of the dimensions.
Results
Participants were satisfied with the prosthetic sports feet use. However, they were not satisfied with the process prior to provision. The prosthetic sport feet use was perceived as the most important dimension. Sports performance was the critical element in the prosthetic sports feet use and was influenced by stability, confidence and fear, safety, focus, energy return, and comfort. Cosmetics were unimportant. Motivation to purchase the prosthetic sports feet was the key element for the prosthetic sports foot acquisition. Satisfaction about the process prior to provision was negatively influenced by poor support of professionals during rehabilitation, the complexity and duration of the purchase process, and lack of information and accessibility of prosthetic sports feet.
Conclusion
The most important dimension of the prosthetic sports feet was its use, which was directly influenced by performance. To further increase the satisfaction with prosthetic sports feet, clinicians should establish how to meet the desired sports performance level of athletes with a lower limb amputation. Improving the process prior to the provision process may increase satisfaction. We suggest increasing the support of professionals during rehabilitation and training through cooperation between involved services, organizing prosthetic sports feet try-out sessions, and increase the accessibility of the prosthetic sports feet. In this way, individuals with a lower limb amputation may become and stay more physically active and participate in sports."

Increasing obesity and c-section rates in the US have been cited as contributing factors needing remediation, and because of the two to three fold difference in maternal mortality rates in non-Hispanic black women compared to white women, inequality and implicit racial bias has been targeted as well for remediation. Using an epidemiologic approach, a hypothesis here brought to bear is that US immigration policy changes over the past 50 years have brought changes in the gene pool that have caused increasing obstetric hemorrhage and other causes of maternal death. ABO gene frequencies have changed in the US during this time such that ABO O, a gene associated with hemorrhage and mortality in pregnancy, has increased in frequency in the US thus increasing population maternal mortality rate. Using mendelian randomization logic, noting the increase in ABO O gene in the US population over the past 30 years and the association of ABO O gene with both hemorrhage and lower longevity, the increase in frequency of the ABO O gene in the past 30 years in the US population might be causative of an increase in maternal mortality rate. Consequences of this hypothesis would include recognition of the role of ABO gene and thus ABO blood group in prediction of risk of obstetric hemorrhage. Thus those at risk on this basis would be under high surveillance and would have medications and treatment strategies readily available. While research on ABO gene and pregnancy has been done, much of the research is being done in countries other than the US, and given the increasing mortality in the US as well as the role that ABO gene may have in that, further research needs to be done in US populations to quantify risk for all adverse events in pregnancy related to ABO blood type including hemorrhage as well as inter-related causes including pre-eclampsia, cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic disease and infection."

In order to restore stability, highly invasive surgical fusion is needed for patients who are not responding to conservative treatment. Given the risk and complications of surgery, there has been the urge for improvement with a less invasive solution. Formation of vertebral body osteophytes is a common observation that has been treated as a degenerative condition. However, recent studies have associated it with reduced motion of spinal segments. Unlike the traditional view, we regard it as adaptive reactions aiming to repair and hypothesize that the spinal segments could be stabilized or fused by intentionally induced osteophytes growth at the mobile parts of the intervertebral joint. This could be achieved by injecting Bone Morphogenetic Proteins to the anterior ends of the vertebral bodies and/or the facet joints on both sides of two consecutive vertebrae percutaneously. If verified, it would be the first time that fusion could be achieved without surgery. Hence it would provide a valuable alternative to current treatments of spinal instability. Preliminary test in favor of this hypothesis is presented and we recommend that a formal study with sufficient number of samples is needed for verification."

Firstly, the effects of different severity of stenosis as much as 20%, 30%, and 40% are investigated in the velocity of blood while artery radius of 0.002 m and Sisko parameters of n = 0.639 and b = 0.1735 are constant. Then, stenosis with the severity of 40% remains, and the radius of the artery is varied from 0.002 m to 0.0035 m to investigate the effects of artery radius on the blood velocity. Finally, different types of blood fluids are employed by manipulation of Sisko parameters, and influences of blood fluid behaviors are investigated in velocity profiles. It is reported that influences of increasing severity of stenosis and reducing the radius of the artery cause blood velocity to be augmented due to the role of stenosis as an obstacle against blood flow and influences of artery radius in reducing cross-section area of the vessel. Maximum velocities are roundabout 0.15 m/s, 0.185 m/s of 0.235 m/s in order of stenosis of 20%, 30% and 40% respectively. Also, investigation in the effects of the behavior of different blood showed that blood fluid types could change maximum flow velocity as much as 0.025 m/s. Despite of roll of stenosis severity, artery radius, and blood fluid behavior in exacerbation of velocity deviation, it was concluded that their consequences for the human body healthy can be ignorable in the range of studied."

To the best of our knowledge, no intervention has been approved for this purpose, so the major suggestion in this regard is using personal preventive equipment (PPE) and similar measures as well as other sanitizing practices. Since we do not know how long we should face this universal issue, using antecedent pharmacotherapies for reducing oral-respiratory secretions to combat this virus might play a role in this regard. Given that currently there is no definitive cure for COVID-19, so we hypothesize that, considering drug solutions to reduce saliva and droplet production may be helpful in controlling Coronavirus spread during aerosol and respiratory droplet producing procedures."

abstract = "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with fast spreading all over the world caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus which can culminate in a severe acute respiratory syndrome by the injury caused in the lungs. However, other organs can be also damaged. SARS-CoV-2 enter into the host cells using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as receptor, like its ancestor SARS-CoV. ACE2 is then downregulated in lung tissues with augmented serum levels of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Interestingly, ACE2+ organs reveal the symptomatic repercussions, which are signals of the infection such as dry cough, shortness of breath, heart failure, liver and kidney damage, anosmia or hyposmia, and diarrhea. ACE2 exerts a chief role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by converting angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1–7) that activates Mas receptor, inhibits ACE1, and modulates bradykinin (BK) receptor sensitivity, especially the BK type 2 receptor (BKB2R). ACE2 also hydrolizes des-Arg9-bradykinin (DABK), an active BK metabolite, agonist at BK type 1 receptors (BKB1R), which is upregulated by inflammation. In this opinion article, we conjecture a dialogue by the figure of Sérgio Ferreira which brought together basic science of classical pharmacology and clinical repercussions in COVID-19, then we propose that in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection: i) downregulation of ACE2 impairs the angiotensin II and DABK inactivation; ii) BK and its metabolite DABK seems to be in elevated levels in tissues by interferences in kallikrein/kinin system; iii) BK1 receptor contributes to the outbreak and maintenance of the inflammatory response; iv) kallikrein/kinin system crosstalks to RAS and coagulation system, linking inflammation to thrombosis and organ injury. We hypothesize that targeting the kallikrein/kinin system and BKB1R pathway may be beneficial in SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially on early stages. This route of inference should be experimentally verified by SARS-CoV-2 infected mice."

Fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, loss of appetite, olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are the most prevalent general symptoms. Decreased immune system cells such as suppressed regulatory T cells, cytotoxic and helper T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages and increased proinflammatory cytokines are the characteristic features. Compounds derived from Allium sativum (garlic) have the potential to decrease the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and to reverse the immunological abnormalities to more acceptable levels. Allium sativum is suggested as a beneficial preventive measure before being infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. Allium sativum is a functional food well-known for its immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, antimutagenic, antitumor properties. Its antiviral efficiency was also demonstrated. Some constituents of this plant were found to be active against protozoan parasites. Within this context, it appears to reverse most immune system dysfunctions observed in patients with COVID-19 infection. The relations among immune system parameters, leptin, leptin receptor, adenosin mono phosphate-activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma have also been interpreted. Leptin’s role in boosting proinflammatory cytokines and in appetite decreasing suggest the possible beneficial effect of decreasing the concentration of this proinflammatory adipose tissue hormone in relieving some symptoms detected during COVID-19 infection. In conclusion, Allium sativum may be an acceptable preventive measure against COVID-19 infection to boost immune system cells and to repress the production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines as well as an adipose tissue derived hormone leptin having the proinflammatory nature."

abstract = "Background and pilot study
Recent reports reveal a close relationship between migraine and gastrointestinal disorders (GI), such as celiac disease (CD) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). CD is a genetic autoimmune disorder, which affects the mucosa of the small intestine. Gluten, found in various grains, not only plays a major role in the pathophysiology of CD and NCGS, but also aggravates migraine attacks. Another common food component, which can induce migraine headaches, is histamine. Diamine oxidase (DAO) is an enzyme, which degrades histamine. Reduced activity of DAO means reduced histamine degradation, which can cause histamine build-up and lead to various symptoms, including headaches and migraine. In this paper we propose a hypothesis, that in pathogenesis of migraine, low serum DAO activity is related to CD and NCGS. We also conducted our own pilot study of 44 patients with severe migraine in efforts to evaluate the co-presence of decreased serum DAO activity and celiac disease/NCGS in patients. 44 consecutive migraine patients were divided into 2 groups: decreased DAO activity (group 1; n = 26) and normal DAO activity (group 2; n = 18). All patients were screened for celiac disease. The diagnosis of NCGS was made after exclusion of CD, food allergies and other GI disorders in the presence of gluten sensitivity symptoms. Furthermore, dietary recommendations were given to all participants and their effects were assessed 3 months after the initial evaluation via the MIDAS (Migraine Disability Assessment) questionnaire.
Results and conclusions
Only 1 patient fit the criteria for celiac disease, rendering this result inconclusive. Pathological findings of the remainder of patients were attributed to NCGS (n = 10). 9 of 10 patients with NCGS belonged to the decreased serum DAO activity group (group 1; n = 26), suggesting a strong relationship between reduced serum DAO activity and NCGS. MIDAS questionnaire revealed, that patients with decreased serum DAO activity were more severely impacted by migraine than those with normal DAO activity, and this remained so after our interventions. Dietary adjustments significantly reduced the impact of migraine on patients’ daily activities after 3 months in both groups. We argue, that migraine, celiac disease and NCGS may benefit from treatment with a multidisciplinary approach, involving neurologists, gastroenterologists and dietitians."

abstract = "Objectives
Results from a recent study showed that the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality was higher in patients who received febuxostat, a potent urate-lowering agent, than that in patients who received allopurinol. Therefore, we hypothesized that an abrupt change in serum urate levels caused by urate-lowering agents would influence the risk of cardiovascular events.
Methods
We included patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) who received allopurinol or febuxostat. Cardiovascular events were defined as follows: nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, unstable angina, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. The change in serum urate levels was determined by the difference or reduction rate in urate within 6 months after exposure to allopurinol or febuxostat. The factors associated with cardiovascular events were evaluated by Cox regression analysis.
Results
In total, 207 patients with CVD who were exposed to allopurinol or febuxostat were included. Cardiovascular events occurred in 38 patients (18.4%). In univariate analysis, age, diabetes mellitus, baseline urate levels, difference in mean urate levels between baseline and post-exposure (Δuratemean), and reduction rate in urate to the lowest post-exposure levels (Δuratelowest/day) were associated with cardiovascular events. Further, results from the multivariate analysis revealed that age [hazard ratio (HR) 1.036, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.001–1.072, p = 0.042], Δuratemean (HR 1.188, CI, 1.033–1.366, p = 0.015), and Δuratelowest/day (HR 6.963, CI, 2.215–21.886, p = 0.001) were associated with cardiovascular events.
Conclusion
Rapid reduction in serum urate levels was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events. Thus, careful attention should be paid to abruptly changing serum urate levels after treating urate-lowering agent in high-risk CVD patients."

abstract = "Although not widely studied, behavioral host manipulation by various pathogens has been documented. Host manipulation is the process by which a pathogen evolves adaptations to manipulate the behavior of the host to maximize reproduction (Ro) of the pathogen. The most notable example is rabies. When a host is infected with the rabies virus it gets into the host’s central nervous system and triggers hyper aggression. The virus is also present in the rabid animal’s saliva so being bitten transmits the infection to a new host and the old host is left to eventually die if untreated. Toxoplasmosis is another example. When mice are infected they demonstrate a fearlessness toward cats, thus increasing their chances of being eaten. Toxoplasmosis needs the digestive tract of the feline to survive. Recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans (e.g., through cat feces) has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen. Even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in-person sociality during the 48-hour incubation period, thus producing an obvious vector for transmission. Here we hypothesize that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, which produces the COVID-19 disease may produce similar host manipulations that maximize its transmission between humans."

Additionally, there are only two FDA-approved drugs, riluzole and edaravone, which are more effective at the early stages of ALS. Therefore, establishing biomarkers for ALS patients are vital for rapid and accurate diagnosis. Several biomarkers including genetic, biochemical, neurophysiological, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and imaging data have been reported for the diagnosis and evaluating progression of ALS, however none of them have been studied in the preclinical stage of ALS and superiority of different biomarkers have not been evaluated until now. We hypothesized that serum biochemical parameters can be used as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and evaluation of ALS progression even at the preclinical stages. Because, serum biochemical parameters are widely used, easy to measure, routine and cheaper approach to measure certain serum biochemistry parameters helping diagnosis and progression of several diseases. Moreover ALS causes hypermetabolic state which leads to malnutrion, losing weight and muscle mass in patients. Thus protein, lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms are impaired in the ALS patients. These impairments can be observed via serum biochemical parameters indicating nutrient metabolism and muscle destruction. Additionally, pathological changes in ALS have been started before disease symptoms manifesting. Therefore we hypothesized serum biochemical parameters can be used to prognosis and evaluate preclinical stages of ALS."

Glomerular podocyte dysfunction can result in proteinuria, the presence of a large amount of protein in the urine. Podocytes are unique epithelial cells that divide into 3 separate structural and functional segments: a cell body, major processes, and foot processes. Since synaptopodin, dynamin, and actin are crucial components of the podocyte cytoskeleton, degradation of these proteins is associated with cytoskeleton instability, resulting in the development of proteinuria. Cathepsin L (CatL), a cysteine proteinase, plays a crucial role in various renal diseases. CatL expression is elevated in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephropathy, which is used as a model of minimal change NS. In CatL-deficient mice, which do not develop proteinuria, dynamin is retained through the escape of CatL-mediated decomposition, resulting in no changes in the filtration barrier of podocytes. However, there is limited information on the roles of CatL in NS. Based on these data, CatL might play an important role in the development of proteinuria. Furthermore, identifying the functions of CatL may contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of childhood-onset NS. We hypothesize that high levels of CatL can lead to cytoskeletal instability of podocytes, resulting in proteinuria in childhood-onset NS."

abstract = "Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease widespread in the temperate zone. The definitive hosts of Toxoplasma gondii, which causes the disease, are cats. All warm-blooded vertebrates, including humans, can be intermediate hosts. A person is usually infected by ingesting oocysts, e.g. by consuming along with vegetables some contaminated soil, by drinking contaminated water, or by ingesting tissue cysts contained, for instance, in poorly cooked meat. Less common is congenital transmission or transmission via organ transplant from an infected donor. Recently, it has been suggested that toxoplasmosis could also be transmitted sexually from infected men to uninfected women. In this article, we discuss and present evidence for an alternative hypothesis, which suggests that toxoplasmosis could be transmitted by oral sex (via fellatio) from an infected man to an uninfected person (male or female), especially if the uninfected individual swallows the infected ejaculate. This hypothesis finds support in the following facts and findings: (1) Toxoplasma has been found in male ejaculate. (2) In several animal species, presence of the parasite in the seminal fluid of infected males can lead to infection of uninfected females during mating. (3) A higher prevalence of toxoplasmosis has been reported in both homosexuals and promiscuous individuals, i.e. in populations which practice a broader spectrum of sexual activities, including oral sex. (4) In heterosexual couples, a partner’s infection seems to be a risk factor for infection in women but not in men. (5) A higher prevalence of toxoplasmosis in females compared to males has been observed in adolescents aged 10 to 14, where oral sex, including fellatio, is highly prevalent among those who have not yet engaged in penetrative intercourse. (6) On a theoretical level, one could expect that when an uninfected person swallows ejaculate containing Toxoplasma tissue cysts, this results in a similar infection pattern to ingestion of Toxoplasma-contaminated undercooked meat. (7) Approximately two-thirds of Toxoplasma infections in pregnant women cannot be explained by any of the known risk factors. (8) In both women and men who report practicing fellatio with men, there is a higher prevalence of toxoplasmosis than in corresponding controls. If our hypothesis is correct, an effective public health campaign with emphasis on early sexual education about the risks of unprotected oral sex will be necessary, especially in pregnant women and HIV-positive people. This route of toxoplasmosis transmission could be experimentally verified by force-feeding laboratory mice with the ejaculate of infected men."

At present, there is no specific antiviral drug or vaccine for COVID-19. The pathogenic infectivity of the virus requires the S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein to bind the host cell receptor, angiontensin converting enzyme (ACE2). While the binding to host cell receptor is the first step of infection, the entrance of the virus into the cell needs the cleavage of S1–S2 subunits to expose S2 for fusion to cell membrane via host proteases including cathepsins, cell surface transmembrane protease/serine (TMPRSS) proteases, furin, trypsin and factor Xa. Previous in vitro studies have shown that factor Xa inhibition can decrease viral infectivity. We suppose that host cell proteases including furin (as expressed highly in lungs), factor Xa and cathepsin are possible targets to decrease viral burden, therefore unfractioned heparin and low molecular weight heparin-LMWH (specifically dalteparin and tinzaparin for their anti inflammatory action) can be potential inhibitors of multiple endoproteases involved in virus infectivity. Our hypothesis needs to be tested in in vitro and clinical studies, however as we are in an urgent situation as the burden of SARS-CoV2 is increasing all around the world, we recommend the usage of unfractioned heparin or LMWH in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospitalized patients with the risk–benefit judgement of the clinician. Whether our hypothesis is clinically applicable and successful in decreasing viral infection will be evaluated for further studies."

Given that increased oxidative stress is a hallmark of aging, it is understandable that waning nitric oxide and chronic degenerative disease arise in tandem. To this end, translational evidence-based strategies are needed to mitigate the impending toll on personal and public health. Dietary nitrate supplementation, particularly in the form of beetroot juice, is an active area of inquiry that has gained considerable attention in recent years. Compelling evidence has revealed beetroot juice can elicit potent physiological responses that may offer associated health benefits for multiple clinical disorders including hypertension, dementia, and sarcopenia. Even in the absence of overt disease, age-related impairments in cardiovascular and skeletal muscle function may uniquely benefit from beetroot juice supplementation as evidence has shown blood pressure lowering effects and improved muscle function/contractility – presumably from increased nitric oxide bioavailability. This, in turn, presents a practical opportunity for susceptible populations to support ease of movement and exercise tolerance, both of which may promote free-living physical activity. A theoretical rationale details the potential health effects of dietary nitrate supplementation, wherein a working framework hypothesizes beetroot juice consumption prior to structured exercise training may offer synergistic benefits to aid healthy aging and independent-living among older adults."

abstract = "Throughout the world, ethanol is both an important commercial commodity and a source of major medical and social problems. Ethanol readily passes through biological membranes and distributes throughout the body. It is oxidized, first to acetaldehyde and then to acetate, and finally by the citric acid cycle in virtually all tissues. The oxidation of ethanol is irreversible and unregulated, making the rate dependent only on local concentration and enzyme activity. This unregulated input of reducing equivalents increases reduction of both cytoplasmic and intramitochondrial NAD and, through the latter, cellular energy state {[ATP]/([ADP][Pi])}. In brain, this increase in energy state stimulates dopaminergic neural activity signalling reward and a sense of well being, while suppressing glutamatergic neural activity signalling anxiety and unease. These positive responses to ethanol ingestion are important to social alcohol consumption. Importantly, decreased free [AMP] decreases AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) activity, an important regulator of cellular energy metabolism. Oxidation of substrates used for energy metabolism in the absence of ethanol is down regulated to accommodate the input from ethanol. In liver, chronic ethanol metabolism results in fatty liver and general metabolic dysfunction. In brain, transport of other oxidizable metabolites through the blood-brain barrier and the enzymes for their oxidation are both down regulated. For exposures of short duration, ethanol induced regulatory changes are rapid and reversible, recovering completely when the concentrations of ethanol and acetate fall again. Longer periods of ethanol exposure and associated chronic suppression of AMPK activity activates regulatory mechanisms, including gene expression, that operate over longer time scales, both in onset and reversal. If chronic alcohol consumption is abruptly ended, metabolism is no longer able to respond rapidly enough to compensate. Glutamatergic neural activity adapts to chronic dysregulation of glutamate metabolism and suppression of glutamatergic neural activity by increasing excitatory and decreasing inhibitory amino acid receptors. A point is reached (ethanol dependence) where withdrawal of ethanol results in significant metabolic energy depletion in neurons and other brain cells as well as hyperexcitation of the glutamatergic system. The extent and regional specificity of energy depletion in the brain, combined with hyperactivity of the glutamatergic neuronal system, largely determines the severity of withdrawal symptoms."

Electrical storm (ES) is cardiac electrical instability characterized by recurrent episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. ES is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, hence requires prompt intervention. Treatment of underlying etiology is of prime importance in termination of ES. Anti-arrhythmic medications serve as an adjunctive therapy in suppression of ES by reducing myocardial excitability. The anti-arrhythmic conventionally employed is amiodarone in combination with non-selective beta-blockers to reduce the adrenergic input to myocardium. However, anti-arrhythmics at increased concentrations can lead to adverse systemic effects including hemodynamic instability.
Hypothesis
We hypothesize 1. The use of intravenous or oral anti-arrhythmic therapy for patients in electrical storm is limited by their toxicities and blood pressure lowering effect. Corollary 1. Injection of anti-arrhythmic medications into the pericardial space, an extra-vascular structure encasing the heart, provides an option for use of higher concentration of anti-arrhythmic while limiting systemic absorption. Corollary 2. The pericardial space has direct communication to the epicardium, the outer most layer of cardiac muscle, spatial proximity may allow for effective therapeutic options in electrical storm. We present experimental and clinical evidence in support of these hypothesis."

The way that the condition affects sleep has not yet been fully elucidated; it is clear that the symptoms of the disease such as pruritus and scratching can affect sleep but other factors, such as changes in the immunological system related to the disease can also have an effect. We argue that this relationship may be bi-directional, with changes to the skin barrier (barrier dysfunction, alterations in its microbiome and oxidative stress) and immunological function caused by the condition impairing sleep and leading to imbalanced inflammatory pathways that exacerbate AD and other associated conditions such as impetigo. We highlight the need for further studies to investigate this correlation between AD and sleep to make the role of this relationship clearer."

Such a complication could be preeclampsia. In our previous animal model, administration of pure DNA isolated from fetus did not induce any prenatal complications. Here we hypothesize that in real life during preeclampsia or other pregnancy complications, placental DNA might be transported by extracellular vesicles to maternal cells. Also, our preliminary data prove that placental DNA is present in circulating exosomes in maternal blood. Therefore, a lipid bilayer of extracellular vesicles could protect DNA from degradation by enzymes. Extracellular vesicles tend to merge with other cells, therefore, following expression of fetal genes from placental extracellular vesicles in maternal cells could lead to an immune response already observed in pregnancy complications. Future studies should be mainly focused on verification of our hypothesis and evaluate the potential of placental/fetal extracellular vesicles and their gene transfer in preeclampsia or other pregnancy complications."

This study aims to investigate the impact of obstacle collision according to the presence or absence of light and the change of gait when using smartphones while walking.
Study design/setting
A cross-sectional study.
Subjects
24 healthy young people.
Methods
Obstacle collision was measured in participants as they passed through four obstacles at different heights (eyes, waist, knees, ankle level), with the lights turned on. The same was measured with the lights turned off. To measure spatiotemporal variables, GAITRite was used. Obstacle collision was used in the frequency analysis, and the spatiotemporal variables were assessed using one-way ANOVA test. The post-hoc Tukey’s test was used to detect spatiotemporal variables differences (p < 0.05).
Results
Obstacle collision was the highest at eye level when playing games and messaging while walking. It was also higher when lights were turned off rather than when lights were on. Gait function decreased while walking when messaging or playing games on a smartphone as compared to when walking without a smartphone.
Conclusion
Understanding the collision rate of various obstacles encountered when using smartphones while walking could contribute to the prevention of accidents."

The multi-modal brain images dataset (BraTs 2012) was used, that is a skull stripped and co-registered. In order to remove the noise, bilateral filtering is applied and then texton-map images are created by using the Gabor filter bank. From the texton-map, the image is segmented out into superpixel and then the low-level features are extracted: the first order intensity statistical features and also calculates the histogram level of texton-map at each superpixel level. There is a significant contribution here that the low features are not too much significant for the localization of brain tumour from MR images, but we have to make them meaningful by integrating features with the texton-map images at the region level approach. Then these features which are provided later to classifier for the prediction of three classes: background, tumour and non-tumour region, and used the labels for computation of two different areas (i.e. complete tumour and non-tumour). A Leave-one-out (LOOCV) cross validation technique is applied and achieves the dice overlap score of 88% for the whole tumour area localization, which is similar to the declared score in MICCAI BraTS challenge. This brain tumour localization approach using the textonmap image based on superpixel features illustrates the equivalent performance with other contemporary techniques. Recently, medical hypothesis generation by using autonomous computer based systems in disease diagnosis have given the great contribution in medical diagnosis."

Leading authorities have called for the inclusion of nutrition in every electronic health record as one of the many remedial steps required to give dietary quality the routine attention it warrants. Existing tools to capture dietary intake are based on either real-time journaling or recall. Journaling, or logging, is time and labor intensive. Recall is notoriously unreliable, as humans are notably bad at remembering detail. Even allowing for the challenge of recall, these dietary intake methods are labor and time intensive, and require analysis at the n-of-1 level. We hypothesize that dietary intake assessment can be “reverse engineered”—predicating assessment on the recognition of fully formed dietary patterns—rather than endeavoring to assemble such a representation one food, meal, dish, or day at a time. This pattern recognition-based method offers potential advantages over existing methods, including speed, efficiency, cost, and applicability. We have developed and provisionally tested such a system, and the results thus far support our hypothesis. We are convinced that leveraging pattern recognition to make dietary assessment quick, user-friendly, economical, and scalable can allow for the conversion of dietary quality into a universally measured and routinely managed vital sign. In this paper, we present the supporting case."

Several case reports have described the presence of tophi in the intervertebral disc (IVD) or endplate of patients with hyperuricemia or gout, and these patients also exhibited severe intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). We speculated that uric acid may have dual effects on an IVD. On the one hand, physiological concentrations of uric acid have powerful antioxidant activity and can effectively maintain the steady state of the IVD, while on the other hand, high concentrations of uric acid have strong oxidizing activity and the resulting high osmotic pressure can aggravate IDD.

Instead, the rate of transmission is significative higher, with a faster spread of the virus responsible of the worldwide outbreak and a significative higher mortality rate due to the development of a severe lung injury. Most noteworthy is the distribution of death rate among age groups. Children and younger people are almost protected from severe clinical presentation. Possible explanation of this phenomenon could be the ability of past vaccinations (especially tetanic, diphtheria toxoids and inactivated bacteria as pertussis) to stimulate immune system and to generate a scattered immunity against non-self antigens in transit, as coronaviruses and other community-circulating viruses and make immune system readier to develop specific immunity against Covid-19. The first support to this hypothesis is the distribution of mortality rate during historical pandemics (“Spanish flu” 1918, “Asian flu” 1956 and “the Hong Kong flu” 1968) among age groups before and after the introduction of vaccines. The immunological support to the hypothesis derives from recent studies about immunotherapy for malignancies, which propose the use of oncolytic vaccines combined with toxoids in order to exploit CD4 + memory T cell recall in supporting the ongoing anti-tumour response. According to this hypothesis vaccine formulations (tetanus, diphtheria, Bordetella pertussis) could be re-administrate after the first contact with Covid-19, better before the development of respiratory severe illness and of course before full-blown ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The CD4 + memory exploiting could help immune system to recall immunity of already know antigens against coronaviruses, avoiding or limiting “lung crash” until virus specific immunity develops and making it faster and prolonged. Finally, this administration could be helpful not only in already infected patients, but also before infection. In fact, people could have an immune system more ready when the contact with the Covid-19 will occur."

abstract = "Objective
To propose the hypothesis that non-celiac gluten sensitivity is associated with chronic low-back pain related to spondyloarthritis, and a gluten free diet has a therapeutic benefit in a subgroup of patients. Gut involvement is a well-known association of spondyloarthritis but limited to a few disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Currently the therapeutic implication of this association is pharmacologic treatment for inflammation with immunosupresive drugs for both diseases. Here is a case series of patients with chronic low-back pain, spondyloarthritis related features, and response to gluten free diet despite celiac disease being ruled out.
Methods
Retrospective case report of 110 patients from a tertiary hospital rheumatology clinic specialized in chronic pain and gluten sensitivity. These are patients with refractory low-back pain and spondyloarthritis features who followed a gluten free diet despite celiac disease being ruled out. Demanding improvement was defined based on the achievement of at least one of the following objectives: asymptomatic status, remission of chronic low-back pain, returning to normal life, returning to work, changing from confinement to bed/wheelchair to being able to walk, returning to self-sufficiency for hygiene and personal care, discontinuation of opioids.
Results
Average age at low-back onset pain was 30. Average disease duration was 15 years. 87 (79%) of the patients experienced improvement. 69 (62%) of the patients achieved demanding improvement. Average duration of gluten-free diet in patients with demanding improvement was 60 months. 56 out of 69 patients with demanding improvement ingested gluten. Of these 56 patients, 54 experienced clinical worsening and were considered as having non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Oral aphthae and having a relative with celiac disease were associated with demanding improvement. Out of 28 patients retrospectively classified as having axial spondyloarthritis, 23 had demanding improvement. Out of 16 patients with uveitis, 13 had demanding improvement. Out of 83 patients with fibromyalgia, 48 had demanding improvement.
Conclusion
These observational data support the proposed hypothesis and offer information regarding possible clinical predictors of response to diet."

These evaluation processes are more frequently performed through visual inspection and manual palpation, which are simple and low cost methods.

In this context, our view is that an application derived from the hypothesis will serve as an additional tool to assist in the physical assessment process and, consequently, in the diagnosis of disorders related to postural and movement changes."

abstract = "Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) has emerged, rapidly spreading and severely straining the capacity of the global health community. Many nations are employing combinations of containment and mitigation strategies, where early diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital in controlling illness progression and limiting viral spread within the population. Thus, rapid and accurate methods of early detection are vital to contain COVID-19 and prevent further spread and predicted subsequent infectious waves of viral recurrence in future. Immediately after its initial characterization, Chinese and American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) rapidly employed molecular assays for detection of COVID-19, mostly employing real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. However, such methods require specific expensive items of equipment and highly trained analysts, requiring upwards of 4–8 h to process. These requirements coupled with associated financial pressures may prevent effective deployment of such diagnostic tests. Loop mediated isothermal amplification(LAMP) is method of nucleic acid amplification which exhibits increased sensitivity and specificity are significantly rapid, and do not require expensive reagents or instruments, which aids in cost reduction for coronavirus detection. Studies have shown the successful application of LAMP assays in various forms to detect coronavirus RNA in patient samples, demonstrating that 1–10 copies of viral RNA template per reaction are sufficient for successful detection, ~100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR methods. Importantly, studies have also now demonstrated the effectiveness of LAMP methodology in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at significantly low levels, particularly following numerous improvements to LAMP assay protocols. We hypothesise that recent advancements in enhanced LAMP protocols assay perhaps represent the best chance for a rapid and robust assay for field diagnosis of COVID-19, without the requirement of specialized equipment and highly trained professionals to interpret results. Herein, we present our arguments with a view to disseminate such findings, to assist the combat of this virus that is proving so devastating. We hope that this strategy could be applied rapidly, and confirmed for viability with clinical samples, before being rolled out for mass-diagnostic testing in these current times."

abstract = "Functional somatic symptoms refer to physical symptoms that cannot be (bio) medically explained. The pattern or clustering of such symptoms may lead to functional syndromes like chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, among many others. Since the underlying pathophysiology remains unknown, several explanatory models have been proposed, nearly all including social and psychological parameters. These models have stimulated effectiveness studies of several psychological and psychopharmacological therapies. While the evidence for their effectiveness is steadily growing, effect-sizes are at most moderate and many patients do not benefit. We hypothesize that the context in which interventions for functional somatic symptoms are delivered substantially influences their effectiveness. Although this hypothesis is in line with explanatory models of functional somatic symptoms, to our knowledge, studies primarily focusing on the influence of contextual aspects on treatment outcome are scarce. Contextual research in the field of somatic symptoms has (irrespective whether these symptoms can be medically explained or not), however, just begun and already yielded some valuable results. These findings can be organized according to Duranti's and Goodwin's theoretical approach to context in order to substantiate our hypothesis. Based on this approach, we categorized empirical findings in three contextual aspects, i.e. 1) the setting, 2) the behavioural environment, and 3) the language environment. Collectively, some support is found for the fact that early identification of patients with functional somatic symptoms, starting treatment as soon as possible, having a neat appearance and an organized office interior, a warm and friendly nonverbal approach and a language use without defensiveness are contextual parameters which enhance the assessment by the patient of the physician’s competence to help. Nonetheless, in vivo studies addressing the most aspects, i.e. nonverbal behaviour and language, are needed for better understanding of these contextual aspect. Moreover, future research should address to what extent optimizing contextual aspects improve care for functional somatic symptoms."

Our hypothesis is that a negative feedback pathway through 5-HT1A auto-receptors decreases the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with increasing dose, thereby creating the second, anomalous part of the dose-response curve. This effect can also account for the so-called therapeutic window of such antidepressants."

However, the fact that a subgroup of patients with a massive tear in the rotator cuff were able to keep a normal function, should make us question this traditional view. We hypothesize that the teres major which is also a monoarticular scapulohumeral muscle, although it is not part of the conjoined tendon of the rotator cuff, can play a role in glenohumeral stability by a direct support of the humeral head generated by the particular posteroanterior location of this muscle under the humeral head and which, as far as we know, has not been written up previously. This particular effect could appear while the arm is being lifted and the humeral head could be leaning on against the teres major muscle belly underneath it. An anatomical a radiological study was carried out to substantiate our hypothesis. Two cadaver specimens were used for the anatomical study. Frist body was studied through conventional dissection. The second body was analysed through sectional anatomy. Then a radiological study was carried out using magnetic resonance imaging in a healthy male volunteer. Both anatomically and radiologically, the anteroinferior surface of the humeral head was showed firmly resting against the muscle belly of the teres major, to the point of misshaping it from 110 degrees of arm elevation with external rotation. The specific contribution of this effect to the glenohumeral stability needs to be confirmed by further studies and can help us to prevent the high incidence of glenohumeral dislocations."

We hypothesized that etomidate combined with fentanyl was more effective than etomidate combined with ketamine in the anesthesia of pediatric strabotomy. To prove our hypothesis, a prospective randomized controlled clinical study was performed, in which 35 children with strabotomy received etomidate plus ketamine (group A) for anesthesia induction and maintenance and 35 children with strabotomy received etomidate combined with fentanyl (group B). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), bispectral index (BIS), anesthesia effect, and emergence agitation and pain were observed before anesthesia induction (T1), after anesthesia induction (T2), at the beginning of the operation (T3), after 10-min operation (T4), and at the end of the operation (T5). Children in group B had significantly lower MAP and HR from T3 to T5, decreased BIS from T2 to T4, better anesthesia effect, and smaller emergence agitation and pain scores at 10 min after entering into postanesthesia care unit (PACU) compared with group A (p < 0.05). The mean emergence agitation score in group B was significantly lower than that in group A when the maximum emergence in group B was at 20 min after entering into PACU (p < 0.05). In conclusion, etomidate combined with fentanyl plays a good efficacy in anesthesia of pediatric strabotomy compared with etomidate plus ketamine."

Diagnosis of PD is performed in terms of certain criteria depending on the clinical symptom evaluation. However, this method may be inadequate, especially during the onset of the disease. Acoustic analysis of PD is a cost-effective, easy, and non-invasive method for early diagnosis. The mining of association rules is one of the problems in data mining that aims to find valuable and interesting associations in huge data sets. Although association analysis is very popular and useful, to the best of our knowledge, there is not any study on association analysis of PD using vocal change characteristics. Automatic mining of comprehensible, interesting, and accurate association rules in PD data sets containing huge numerical processed voice data is aimed in this study. Due to the numerical characteristics of the vocal attributes in pre-processed PD data, classical association rules mining methods cannot be efficiently applied to this problem. For this reason; MOPNAR, NICGAR, and QAR_CIP_NSGAII that are artificial intelligence-based algorithms were modeled for mining of numerical association rules in order to obtain better performances without using any pre-process for numerical data for the first time. Furthermore, the problem of association analysis of PD with vocal change characteristics was modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem considering many different complementary/contradictory metrics such as support, confidence, comprehensibility, interestingness, etc. in this study. According to the obtained multi-objective rule sets, the NICGAR outperformed in terms of average confidence, average CF, average netconf, average yulesQ, and average number of attributes."

We demonstrate a failure by the proponents of these syndromes to structure their scientific arguments in a logically valid fashion, which lead them to promote assumptions to the status of facts.

abstract = "Septic shock causes high mortality in hospitalized patients, especially in those that develop myocardial dysfunction as an early complication. The myocardial dysfunction of septic shock is characterized by a decrease in ventricular relaxation (diastolic dysfunction) and reduced ventricular ejection fraction (systolic dysfunction). Most patients with septic shock have low serum thyroid hormone levels, a condition known as non-thyroidal illness syndrome. Thyroid hormones sustain myocardial contractility and energy metabolism. Septic shock non-thyroidal illness syndrome causes myocardial hypothyroidism, and hypothyroidism causes myocardial dysfunction that resembles the myocardial depression of septic shock. We hypothesize that the myocardial hypothyroidism that occurs during septic shock has a causal role in the pathogenesis of septic shock-induced myocardial dysfunction. Thyroid hormones regulate the calcium cycle, the phenotype of contractile proteins, adrenergic response, and fatty acid transport and oxidation in the cardiomyocytes. Therefore, the administration of levothyroxine and liothyronine to normalize thyroid hormones level within the myocardium will improve the myocardial function. The hypothesis will be tested in humans with septic shock by performing a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study to compare the effect of thyroid hormone administration with placebo on myocardial function. The proposed hypothesis challenges the idea that non-thyroidal illness syndrome is a beneficial response of the thyroid hormone axis to illness and that thyroid hormone replacement is detrimental. The administration of thyroid hormone in order to prevent and reverse myocardial hypothyroidism during septic shock is a new theoretical concept on thyroid hormone metabolism and action at the tissue level during non-thyroidal illness syndrome. If the hypothesis is correct, clinicians should consider cardiac hypothyroidism as a central player in myocardial dysfunction caused by sepsis. Thyroid hormone replacement should be incorporated into the armamentarium of septic shock treatment."

It is the most common condition under the umbrella of demyelinating disease, thought to occur as a result of a primary autoimmune insult. Various genetic and environmental risk factors have been implicated as potential triggers and/or predisposing factors; however, the exact mechanism of disease remains elusive. Diagnosis and management are based on clinical presentation, with adjunct imaging and biochemical assessment. Since the 19th century anatomical distribution of lesions in MS have been observed to demonstrate a characteristic periventricular, perivenular distribution; spinal cord and cortical lesions also demonstrate this perivenous preponderance. Venous abnormalities have long been observed on pathology characterized by irregular narrowing and dilatation with associated venous wall and perivenous infiltrates. Active CNS lesions are characterized by perivenular inflammatory infiltrates. There is accompanying global dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier, even within normal appearing tissue, with low levels of inflammatory change and tissue injury seen at pathology. Although several CNS antigens have been identified as potential candidates, including myelin related antigens, a specific pathogenic antigen remains elusive. Evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid reveals characteristic oligoclonal bands, indicating a broad inflammatory response against a variety of CNS antigens. Antibodies have been identified against endothelial elements in sera of patients with MS, their role is not yet clearly elucidated. Emerging evidence suggests there may be a more systemic inflammatory process, heralded by a systemic preclinical prodrome. In light of such seemingly-discrepant clinical, anatomic, immunologic and pathologic findings we propose a unifying theory; specifically we propose that MS is a primary autoimmune vasculopathy, with a predilection of CNS venous structures. Characteristic CNS lesions are a secondary manifestation resulting from an inflammatory response to the uncovering of usually privileged CNS antigens."

However, recent papers have demonstrated loss of canals of Hering (CoH) to be the earliest histologic change in liver biopsy specimens from patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). We posit that CoH loss prior to significant inflammation or evidence of bile duct injury might be a very early, perhaps even an initiating lesion of PBC. As a potential target of inflammatory or toxic injury, CoH loss may initiate rather than follow the cascade of events leading to duct injury and loss and their sequelae. Toxins may be exogenous in origin, such as environmental toxins or drug exposures, or endogenous, resulting from genetic or epigenetic alterations in canalicular bile transporters upstream from the CoH. In turn, this hypothesis suggests that loss of CoH would lead to altered bile flow and composition injurious to downstream bile ducts, because bile composition has not been modulated by normal CoH physiologic functions or because, in the absence of CoH, canalicular fluid flow into the biliary tree is disrupted interfering with soluble trophic factors important for bile duct integrity. Regardless of the pathogenic mechanism causing CoH loss, only following such loss would the characteristic diagnostic findings of PBC become evident: damage to downstream interlobular and sub-lobular bile ducts. To the extent that the causal mechanisms for CoH loss can be identified, clinical identification (as through early identification of CoH loss) and intervention (depending on the inciting cause) may offer promise for treatment of this enigmatic disease."

This dataset consists of 115 images. In this paper, a novel stable feature extraction method is presented to classify humerus fractures. This method is called exemplar pyramid method and it is inspired by exemplar facial expression recognition methods. To classify humerus fractures, X-ray images were employed as input. In this study, X-ray images are resized to 512 × 512 sized image. Then, the used humerus fracture images are divided into 64 × 64 size of exemplars. To create levels, maximum pooling which has been mostly used in deep networks is used and four levels are created. Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and local binary pattern (LBP) are employed for feature generation. The most discriminative ones of the generated and concatenated features are selected by using ReliefF and Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) based two levelled feature selector (RFNCA). To emphasize success of the proposed exemplar pyramid model based feature generation, four conventional classifiers are chosen for classification and the proposed exemplar pyramid model achieved 99.12% classification accuracy by using leave one out cross validation (LOOCV). Results and tests clearly illustrates success of the proposed exemplar pyramid model based humerus fracture classification method.

It is not established however that noradrenaline (NA), a widely distributed neurotransmitter in the brain that is also a principal output molecule of the sympathetic nervous system, can produce psychological effects associated with infection. This paper puts forth the hypothesis that through neural-immune crosstalk, serious infection increases noradrenergic signaling, both in the central nervous system and in peripheral organs. In this manner, elevated noradrenergic transmission may help produce basic symptoms of infection such as fever, fatigue, aches and pains (including headache), nausea, and loss of appetite. NA may also promote cognitive impairment, major depression, unipolar mania, and even epileptic seizures in some cases. The paper focuses on three major types of infection: influenza (viral), tuberculosis (bacterial), malaria (parasitic), while also summarizing the potential relationship between NA and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Four lines of evidence are used to test association between NA and influenza, tuberculosis, and malaria: direct measures of NA and its metabolites; and incidence of hypertension, bipolar mania, and epileptic seizures, since the latter three conditions may be associated with elevated NA. In addition, heart rate variability data are examined with respect to a number of infectious diseases, since those data provide information on sympathetic nervous system activity. While the data do not unequivocally support elevated noradrenergic signaling promoting psychological symptomatology with infection, many studies are consistent with this view."

abstract = "One of the most striking characteristics of human beings is the incredible capacity to adapt to different environments. This capacity allowed humans to spread all over our planet, occupying habitats as diverse as deserts, tropical forests or tundra regions. Interactions with the environment, climate, food and water availability shaped our evolution and define our survival. Essential to human life, oxygen availability also controls human dispersion and adaptation. For example, low oxygen availability can lead to physiological adaptations in populations living in highlands. Moreover, the consequences of differential oxygen availability (or even exposure to hypoxia) are evident in process as fine-tuned controlled as gene regulation. Physiological responses to fluctuations in oxygen availability are crucial already from the early days of life, since the human fetal environment is characterized by hypoxia. Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs) act as major regulators of pathways involved in glycolysis, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and stem cells function. Here we explore the physiological consequences of hypoxia in the human organism. In this sense, and considering the existence of HIF sequences in promoter regions of genes important to immune regulation, we hypothesize that exposure to induced hypoxia through the use of hypobaric chambers can be used as a complementary therapy to control chronic inflammation in several diseases characterized by systemic inflammatory conditions. Among these inflammatory conditions we highlight autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammation in HIV infected individuals under antiretroviral treatment. Several experiments, including arthritis animal models, the evaluation of athletes that already use hypobaric chambers to induce erythropoiesis, and the potential consequences of hypoxia as an immunotolerogenic inducer in the HIV infection context are approached and discussed here."

abstract = "The serine-threonine kinase CK2, which targets over 300 cellular proteins, is overexpressed in all cancers, presumably reflecting its ability to promote proliferation, spread, and survival through a wide range of complementary mechanisms. Via an activating phosphorylation of Cdc373, a co-chaperone which partners with Hsp90, CK2 prolongs the half-life of protein kinases that promote proliferation and survival in many cancers, including Akt, Src, EGFR, Raf-1, and several cyclin-dependent kinases. CK2 works in other ways to boost the activity of signaling pathways that promote cancer aggressiveness and chemoresistance, including those driven by Akt, NF-kappaB, hypoxia-inducible factor-1, beta-catenin, TGF-beta, STAT3, hedgehog, Notch1, and the androgen receptor; it promotes the epidermal-mesenchymal transition and aids efficiency of DNA repair. Several potent and relatively specific inhibitors of CK2 are now being evaluated as potential cancer drugs; CX-4945 has shown impressive activity in cell culture studies and xenograft models, and is now entering clinical trials. Moreover, it has long been recognized that the natural flavone apigenin can inhibit CK2, with a Ki near 1 µM; more recent work indicates that a range of flavones and flavonols, characterized by a planar structure and hydroxylations at the 7 and 4′ positions – including apigenin, luteolin kaempferol, fisetin, quercetin, and myricetin - can inhibit CK2 with Ki s in the sub-micromolar range. This finding is particularly intriguing in light of the numerous studies demonstrating that each of these agents can inhibit the growth of cancer cells lines in vitro and of human xenografts in nude mice. These studies attribute the cancer-retardant efficacy of flavones/flavonols to impacts on a bewildering array of cellular targets, including those whose activities are boosted by CK2; it is reasonable to suspect that, at least in physiologically achievable concentrations, these agents may be achieving these effects primarily via CK2 inhibition. Inefficient absorption and rapid conjugation limit the bioefficacy of orally administered flavonoids; however, the increased extracellular beta-glucuronidase of many tumors may give tumors privileged access to glucuronidated flavonoids, and nanopartical technology can improve the bioavailability of these agents. Enzymatically modified isoquercitrin has particular promise as a delivery vehicle for quercetin. Hence, it may be worthwhile to explore the clinical potential of flavones/flavonols as CK2 inhibitors for cancer therapy."

Under the pathological state of diabetes, hIAPP oligomers can promote the expression and secretion of the inflammatory factor IL-1β, while IL-1β-mediated inflammatory response is the pathogenesis basis of intervertebral disc degeneration.

Headlines and abstracts of 760 publications identified in 2 databases were checked, and a total of 68 systematic reviews were included in our review with the goal to see if breastfed children were mostly considered as the intervention or control group. Our review showed that in 79,41% of papers breastfed children were regarded as the intervention group. The results of these papers were usually presented in a manner to show breastfeeding was beneficial in comparison to formula-feeding – as if breastfeeding was a health intervention. This way of data presentation probably helps to form attitude that formula-feeding is the norm and breastfeeding an optional choice, a “superstandard” with certain health benefits. Therefore, all available studies that regard breastfeeding should be interpreted with caution. We suggest that authors, while conducting and reporting clinical trials, regard breastfed children as the control group, and non-breastfed children as the intervention group."

Poor bone quality and wide range of motion hamper the natural bone fusion, thus making surgery often the only possible way to deal with the underlying pathology. The proximity to important neurovascular structures represents the stabilization in this segment a challenge to the surgical team. There are two major techniques, which are used to achieve a dorsal fusion in the C1-C2 Segment: Goel/Harms and Magerl techniques. The reported risk for damaging the vertebral artery in both techniques lies between 8% and 9,5% using a C-Arm. In Goel/Harms technique lateral mass screws in C1 and pedicle screws in C2 are placed. A transarticular screw is placed on both sides C1-C2 in Magerl technique in order to achieve stabilization of the C1-C2 Segment. By using the new navigational methods for a better imaging of the bony structures (O-Arm), this risk could be reduced further down. The risk for injury of the vertebral artery using the O-Arm navigation depends on the pathology, which is operated, ranging from 0, 3% to 2%. A further problem represents the anatomical variations of the vertebral artery, of which the high-riding vertebral artery being the most important one, reported between 10 and 14,5% of the cases according to the literature review. The novel technique for intraoperative imaging of the vertebral artery represents a fusion between an intraoperative O-Arm and intraoperative application of contrast, thus intraoperatively seeing the exact way of the vertebral artery. Also, after the insertion of the screws, a second CT scan with the O-Arm could be performed, yet again with contrast, to see whether the perfusion of both vertebral arteries is preserved. The significance of this method could bring the injuries of the vertebral artery to 0% independently on the technique, which has been used. This method could be used not only for craniocervical stabilization but also for removal of complex tumors in craniocervical junctions, whereas the vertebral artery is encompassed."

Cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells are required to generate an effective immune response against viruses, functional exhaustion of which enables disease progression. Patients with severe COVID-19 present significantly lower lymphocyte, and higher neutrophil, counts in blood. Specifically, CD8+ lymphocytes and NK cells were significantly reduced in cases of severe infection compared to patients with mild infection and healthy individuals. The NK group 2 member A (NKG2A) receptor transduces inhibitory signalling, suppressing NK cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity. Overexpression of NKG2A has been observed on CD8+ and NK cells of COVID-19 infected patients compared to healthy controls, while NKG2A overexpression also functionally exhausts CD8+ cells and NK cells, resulting in a severely compromised innate immune response. Blocking NKG2A on CD8+ cells and NK cells in cancers modulated tumor growth, restoring CD8+ T and NK cell function. A recently proposed mechanism via which SARS-CoV-2 overrides innate immune response of the host is by over-expressing NKG2A on CD+ T and NK cells, culminating in functional exhaustion of the immune response against the viral pathogen. Monalizumab is an inhibiting antibody against NKG2A which can restore the function of CD8 + T and NK cells in cancers, successfully ceasing tumor progression with no significant side effects in Phase 2 clinical trials. We hypothesize that patients with severe COVID-19 have a severely compromised innate immune response and could be treated via the use of Monalizumab, interferon α, chloroquine, and other antiviral agents."

These perceptions drove the current definitions of normality and abnormality, parameters used in the diagnosis of the disease, goals of treatment and studied outcomes. Despite the explosive advancement in technology that could have potentially changed our ‘upstream’ thinking, practitioners remain captives of these old beliefs and have streamlined current technology in a ‘downstream’ fashion; in the form of goal-directed protocols, and engineering systems that would study their implementations. As a result, diseases continue to evolve, become more resistant to therapy, late to diagnose, and with a persistent worsening of outcomes. With a primarily focus on the heart and from an anesthesiologist prospective, we challenge the fundamentals of the current paradigm from an ‘upstream’ prospective. We challenge the current ‘territorial’ definitions of the organs studied, the current terminology of some diseases, the parameters used in their diagnosis, the diagnostic modalities used and their goals of treatment. We illustrate some examples when the current collective ‘myth’ meets the ‘reality’ in an acute care setting, further clarifying the limitations of the current paradigm. We also, provide a theoretical hypothesis of what we believe to be a potential substitute of the current paradigm. Our theory redefines disease from an organ-based functional phenomenon to a structural-based tissue phenomenon, calling for an integrative and holistic approach of tissue assessment rather than a discrete approach that may potentially obscure the interaction of non-appraised organs. We also believe in redirecting technology in an upstream direction to better redefine and early detect diseases rather than submitting to generationally inherited beliefs. Whereas we have started some of our research on our proposed paradigm, our theoretical framework remains to be thought-provoking, and hypothesis-generating at the present time."

Antipyretics and especially acetaminophen received some attention recently due to the associations with some autoimmune conditions and lack of studies on the mechanisms influencing the immune system. A couple of recent studies involving large cohorts have found no association between the use of acetaminophen in early childhood and seroconversion leading to T1DM (TEDDY, involving international cohort) or diagnosis of overt T1DM (Norwegian MoBa) in the follow up years. The paper gives the supplemental argumentation for the antipyretic hypothesis presented in Medical Hypotheses in 2016 that is still valid in face of the mentioned conclusions. The hypothesis assumes that critical effect of acetaminophen and possibly other antipyretics expresses itself as the immediate influence on the immune system in the unfortunate coincidence with the other environmental factors, supposedly involving feverish, new to immunity, viral infection, all creating triggering circumstances regardless of age. Young age, in this respect should be regarded as a risk factor due to immatureness of immunity.

The endosymbiotic theory suggests that evolution of a eukaryotic cell is a consequence of the fruitful association between an archaea (Asgard) and an alphaproteobacterium (Rickettsia). We hypothesize that, during pathological conditions like sepsis, such endosymbiotic homeostasis between the two systems is perturbed. We underscore the fact (supported by in silico homology analyses) that during sepsis, the Asgard component of a cell is promoted to trigger aerobic glycolysis as well as the innate immune response (spearheaded by the TLR pathway), while suppressing the Rickettsia counterpart, thereby promoting the Warburg effect. It might be this discord between the two endosymbiotic partners (Asgard and Rickettsia-derived cellular components) that promotes sepsis."

Swept source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) showed a nodular lesion arising from the sclera with compression of overlying choroid.

After tooth loss, the natural healing process is governed by the formation of the blood clot, which is stabilized by a fibrin bridge, the starting structure for new bone apposition. The hematoma is then replaced by the granulation tissue which is rich in fibroblasts that synthesize the extra-cellular matrix. The adjoining of wound edges requires further contraction of the healing tissue which is exerted by myofibroblasts. Excessive myofibroblasts contraction at the early stage of healing might explain, in part, the pathophysiology of alveolar bone resorption. The authors advocate the use of collagen right after tooth extraction to sustain the soft tissue and releasing the tension at the most coronal portion of the wound, thus preventing excessive detrimental myofibroblasts contraction."

abstract = "Background
After approximately 24 weeks of gestation, human cutaneous wounds and incisions heal by scar formation. Continued or unregulated stimulation of tissue fibroblasts is thought to lead to an activated state with ongoing collagen deposition resulting in a visible hypertrophic scar. There is evidence that mechanical forces as sensed by fibroblasts lead to downstream events such as excessive extracellular matrix deposition. Mechanical forces acting on the wound fibroblast are exerted by underlying muscles as well as intrinsic forces found in the dermal component of the surrounding skin. Under static conditions, collagen is oriented parallel to the direction of strain. In an effort to minimize resultant scar formation various and often contradictory lines of non-extension, lines of least tension, have been described for planning optimal surgical incisions.
Hypothesis
We hypothesize that it is possible to avoid longitudinal stretch on incisions and thereby minimize resultant pathologic scars if defined anatomical considerations are respected. We hypothesize that placement of skin incisions parallel to lines of minimal longitudinal stretch, non-invasively measured by orientation of collagen orientation would in turn result in minimal scar formation.
Evidence
Historical recommendations often derived from human post mortem studies and animal experiments have shed some light on cutaneously observed lines of non-extension. Theoretical considerations of non-extension lines have suggested possible directions of surgical incisions. Post surgical analysis of dermatological interventions have similarly added to our understanding of possible non-extension lines. Measuring anisotropy in the skin can determine collagen orientation in the skin and may therefore allow one to objectively place incisions parallel to non-extension lines. To date no randomized clinical study in humans has addressed whether such an approach would lead to less scarring. A study involving volunteers examining many body areas seems ethically challenged.
Conclusion
The hypothesis, although not proven, is supported by available evidence. If our hypothesis that measurable cutaneous collagen orientation guided incisions improved scar formation then surgical incision planning would deservedly require more clinical attention. Preoperative measurement or at least pre-closure assessment of anisotropy prior to surgical incision placement or closure would notably reduce the incidence of hypertrophic scars."

The last 5 layers of the Resnet50 model have been removed and added 8 new layers. With this model, 97.2% accuracy value is obtained. Also, results are obtained with Alexnet, Resnet50, Densenet201, InceptionV3 and Googlenet models. Of all these models, the model developed with the highest performance has classified the brain tumor images. As a result, when analyzed in other studies in the literature, it is concluded that the developed method is effective and can be used in computer-aided systems to detect brain tumor."

abstract = "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a long-term degenerative disease that primarily affects the motor system of the central nervous system. This disease is difficult to diagnose and is one of the common diseases in the public. In this paper, we have proposed a novel data sampling method for the classification of Parkinson disease based on the acoustic features from the speech signals. In the proposed data sampling method, the one against all (OGA) has been used to divide the dataset into five equal parts. With applying the OGA to the PD dataset having two classes (healthy and Parkinson disease), the minority and majority classes have been obtained. First of all, for healthy class in the dataset (first case), five equal partitions have been composed and then for PD class in the dataset (second case), five equal partitions have been composed. To classify the these all data partitions, we have used three different classifiers including the weighted k-NN (nearest neighbor), Logistic Regression (LR), and support vector machine with medium Gaussian kernel function. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid models (the combination of classifiers and OGA based data sampling), the classification accuracy, the confusion matrix, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) have been used. While the LR, SVM with Gaussian, and weighted k-NN classifiers achieved the classification accuracies of 77.50%, 83.80%, and 82.10% in the classification of PD with the acoustic features, the combinations of classifiers and OGA based data sampling (first case) obtained the 79.04%, 87.36%, and 88.48% using the LR, SVM with Gaussian, and weighted k-NN classifiers, respectively. In the second case, the obtained classification accuracies are the 84.30%, 88.76%, and 89.46% using the LR, SVM with Gaussian, and weighted k-NN classifiers with the OGA based data sampling, respectively. The achieved results have shown that the proposed the one against all (OGA) based data sampling could be used in the combination of classifier algorithms as the data pre-processing method in the classification of Parkinson's disease with acoustic features."

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a potential enhancer of AD, and an epidermal barrier breaker which induces greater penetration of allergens and other compounds. ACD presents an eczematous rash, red and itchy, with inflammation mediated by cytokines. ACD is an immunological disorder caused by contact with an allergic substance (haptens) that involves immunotoxicity, irritation and inflammation. Mast cells (MCs) are important immune cells that intervene, as effector cells, in allergic and anaphylactic reactions, asthma, autoimmune diseases and cancer. In dermatitis, activated MCs release inflammatory chemical mediators and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, TNF, and IL-33. In addition, IL-1 activates MCs to generate a number of cytokines and chemokines, which aggravate inflammation. IL-38 cytokine, an IL-1 family member, is secreted by activated immune cells, including macrophages and lymphocytes, and possesses anti-inflammatory activity. IL-38, by binding IL-36 receptor (IL-36R), provokes suppression of inflammation in many immune diseases. In particular, IL-38 inhibits the generation of IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 along with other cytokines/chemokines. Here, we hypothesize for the first time that IL-38 may suppresses the inflammatory response in dermatitis, exerting beneficial therapeutic effect."

abstract = "Introduction
Spinal cord impact is a mature method for building models of spinal cord injury (SCI). However, a common problem is that the degree of elicited paralysis may not be identical even though animals receive the same impact. We hypothesize that this difference may be caused by the difference in the secondary injury mechanism of SCI and there might be an impact dosage named “median paralyzing dose (PD50)”, similar as the “median lethal dose (LD50)” in pharmacology. In addition, since SCI is a result of multiple mechanisms, we hypothesize that it is more suitable to employ multiple regression analysis to analyze the related factors for complete paraplegia. So the present study aimed to calculate the existence of PD50 and analyze the related factors of SCI-induced complete paralysis using logistic regression under the PD50 which represents identical primary injury.
Material and methods
Rat models of SCI were built using the weight-drop method under PD50. PD50 was calculated by Karber’s method. Rats were allocated into two groups according to whether they developed complete or incomplete paralysis 2 weeks after injury. Cavity and spared tissues in the two groups were compared. Neuronal preservation, microglia/macrophage reaction, T-lymphocyte infiltration, astrocyte activation and neuronal apoptotic were compared by immunohistochemistry. The logistic regression model was constructed and significant related factors of complete paralysis were selected.
Results
Of the two groups, the cavity in the injured spinal cord of the complete-paralysis rats was significantly larger and the spared white matter volume (SWMV%) was obviously smaller. Whereas, the spared grey matter volume was not different between groups. Macrophage reaction, T-lymphocyte infiltration and neuronal apoptosis were significantly more severe in the complete-paralysis rats. Astrocyte activation and neuronal preservation showed no difference between groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that cavity volume, SWMV%, microglia/macrophage reaction and neuronal apoptosis were significantly correlated with SCI-induced complete paralysis.
Conclusion
As a non-mainstream method, it is feasible to analyze the secondary factors of SCI-induced complete paralysis using multiple regression analysis in the condition of identical primary injury (PD50). SWMV% and microglia/macrophage reaction are important factors that contribute to complete paralysis at the early phase of severe SCI."

The WHO declares the NCoV-19 infection disease (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and subsequently, on March 11, 2020, declared it a Global Pandemic. Although some people infected with SARS CoV-2 have no symptoms, the spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical, with most COVID-19 infections being not severe. The common mild symptoms include body aches, dry cough, fatigue, low-grade fever, nasal congestion, and sore throat. More severe COVID-19 symptoms are typical of pneumonia, and upon progression, the patient’s condition can worsen with severe respiratory and cardiac problems. Currently, there is no drug or vaccine for curing patients. It has been observed that people with challenged immunity are highly prone to SARS CoV-2 infection and least likely to recover. Also, older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe forms of COVID-19. We are suggesting here a strategy for the COVID-19 treatment that could be effective in curing the patients in the current scenario when no efficient medicine or Vaccine is currently available, and Clinicians solely depend upon the performing trials with drugs with known antiviral activities. Our proposed strategy is based on the compilation of published scientific research and concepts. The different published research indicates the success of a similar strategy in different physiological conditions, and such a strategy is widely studied at the cellular level and in animal models."

During septic shock, increased capillary permeability results in excess filtration of intravascular fluid and solutes producing interstitial edema with subsequent hydrostatic and oncotic gradient breakdown. The accumulation of interstitial fluid results in impaired solute exchange, leukocyte signaling, and aberrancy in capillary flow. Modulation of lymphatic flow during times of interstitial volume overload such as septic shock may decrease interstitial volume resulting in improved perfusion, decreased end-organ damage, and contribute to disease resolution. Multiple studies in both humans and animals have shown nitric oxide to be a potent modulator of lymphatic function. The present study suggests a hypothetical adjunct therapy for patients with septic shock through the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors, which may improve microcirculatory flow by decreasing interstitial fluid volume via increased lymphatic fluid drainage."

abstract = "Maintaining a body temperature within a narrow range is vital for the survival of all mammals, including humans. With the help of optogenetics, a better understanding of the thermoregulatory organs and pathways is achieved. Optogenetic activation of the GABAergic neurons in the ventral part of the lateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) leads to decrease in the body temperature. On the other hand, number of drugs could alter the thermoregulatory balance, leading to a hyperthermic state, such as serotonin syndrome (SS). SS is a potentially life-threatening clinical condition that occurs as a result of a drug-induced increase in the intrasynaptic serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) levels due to overdose of a single drug or due to interaction between two or more drugs with serotonergic mechanism of action. In this hypothesis, we propose a novel method for the treatment of hyperthermia, a core clinical sign of serotonin syndrome, through deep brain stimulation (DBS). An electrode is stereotactically placed in the VLPO, which may lead to reduction of the core body temperature. If proven effective, this technique should be left as a salvage method for reduction of hyperthermia, where the drug treatment is insufficient or ineffective. This technique could be used for the treatment of other syndromes, where hyperthermia takes a central place, including malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, etc. DBS, on the other hand, could be used alone to induce hyperthermia in patients with malignant diseases. Hyperthermia improves the immune response, improves the drug penetration and stop the repair of already damaged tumor cells after chemotherapy or radiotherapy."

Cell migration is indispensable in metastatic cascade, and aquaporins (AQPs) promote cell migration by facilitating water influx at cell front (lamellipodia). In fact, AQPs overexpressed widely among many cancer types. Accordingly, previous efforts of targeting AQPs as strategies of cancer treatments were based on AQP inhibitors, yet the efficacy of AQP inhibition was limited based on recent surveys. On the contrary, whether AQP agonist has role in cancer treatments has not been explored. AqF026, an AQP1 agonist, was initially applied to a mouse model of peritoneal dialysis. Herein, we aimed to apply AqF026 to magnify the water influx into lamellipodia of migrating cancer cells so as to induce oncosis by causing overloaded cancer cell swelling in advance of metastatic cascade. Cell swelling is a characteristic of oncosis. With impairment or insufficient regulatory volume decrease (RVD), cell swelling can lead to oncosis. Cancer cells with metastatic potentials shared the same population of cancer cells with multidrug resistance (MDR) lineage, and the impairment or insufficient RVD is shown in cancer cells with MDR. Taken together, the author hypothesized that given appropriate concentration or dose of AQP1 agonist AqF026, the AqF026 may induce oncosis of cancer cells preferentially rather than normal cells by causing overloaded water influx via AQP1 and consequent irreversible cell swelling."

At the beginning of the study, most common subthreshold psychiatric disorders were Specific Phobia with a prevalence of 3%, followed by Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder 2.2%. After three-year of the follow-up period, 37% of subthreshold cases progress into psychiatric disorders. Living in a city centre in a slum and psychiatric disorder history of the family were independent risk factors for developing psychopathology. Living in a village was an effective protective factor in the disappearance of Subthreshold Psychiatric Disorder symptoms.

This is achieved by topical wipe of a solution to the closed eyelid skin above the eyelashes. The receptor target is TRPM8, an integral membrane protein that transduces the sense of coolness/cold to the central nervous system. The wipe solution contains a TRPM8 agonist called cryosim-3 (1-diisopropylphosphorylnonane) at 1–3 mg/mL in water and designed for delivery to the eyelid margin. Other sensory systems negatively affected by heat, such as the surfaces of the nasal cavity, can also be treated with the TRPM8 agonist as an adjunct to relieve discomfort from the heat."

Yet multiple structural, process, policy and people factors can combine to result in medical error and patient harm. Measuring the quality of palliative care has many challenges due to its presence across multiple health sectors, variable skill and experience of providers and lack of defined processes for providing services. In Canada there is screening for symptoms and distress in most cancer centers, but not in non-cancer diseases. Screening for distress and disease burden can identify suffering, that when properly addressed, improves quality of life and reduces depression and hopelessness that can lead to requests for hastened death. Our hypothesis is that some requests for hastened death (known as Medical Assistance in Dying or MAiD in Canada) are driven by lack of access to palliative care or lack of quality in the palliative care attempting to address disease burden and distress such that the resulting provision of hastened death is a medical error. The root cause of the error is in the lack of quality palliative care in the previous weeks, months and years of the disease trajectory – a known therapy that the system fails to provide. The evidence for palliative care addressing symptoms and improving quality of life and mood as well as providing caregiver support is established. Early evidence supporting the use of psychotherapeutics in emotional and existential distress is also considered. We present three cases of request for assisted death that could be considered medical error. The paper references preliminary evidence from a review of previous access to palliative care in a limited number of MAiD cases showing that only a minority were identified as having palliative care needs prior to the admission where MAiD was provided. The evidence linking disease burden to hopelessness, depression and hastened death is provided. The many studies revealing the inequity or underservicing of the Canadian population with regards to palliative care are reviewed. We examine a recent framework for palliative care in Canada and point out the need for more aggressive use of standards, process and policies to ensure that Canadians are receiving quality palliative care and that it is equitably accessible to all."

Millions of people die because of this drug resistance developed gradually through extensive use of the drugs. Inherently, some drugs are less prone to become ineffective by drug resistance than others. Covalent inhibitors bind to their targets via a biologically permanent bound with their cognate receptor and therefore display more potent inhibiting characteristics. Suicide inhibitors or mechanism-based inhibitors are one of the covalent inhibitors, which require a pre-activation step by their targeting enzyme. This step accrues their selectivity and specificity with respect to other covalent inhibitors. After that pre-activation step, they produce an analogue of the transition state of the catalytic enzyme, which is practically incapable of dissociating from the enzyme. Suicide inhibitors, due to their high intrinsic affinity toward the related enzyme, are resistant to many mechanisms involved in the development of drug resistance and can be regarded as one of the enemies of this scientific hurdle. These inhibitors compete even with monoclonal antibodies in terms of their cost-effectiveness and efficacy."

In the state of obesity, excess fat accumulates in the liver, a key organ in systemic metabolism, altering the inflammatory and metabolic signals contributing substantially to the development of hepatic IR. Current therapies for these metabolic disorders have not been able to reverse their rapidly rising prevalence. One of the reasons is that the effects of existing drugs are predominantly non-lasting [1], [2]. The vagus nerve (VN) is known to play an essential role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis while decreased VN activity has been suggested to contribute to obesity associated metabolic syndrome [3], [4]. Several studies have reported that activation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) cholinergic signaling with or without VN intervention has protective effects against obesity-related inflammation and other metabolic complications [5]. However, the molecular mechanisms are still not elucidated. Exaggerated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and consequent dysregulated inflammation has been implicated in the development of lipid accumulation and IR [6]. Whether targeting α7nAChR can regulate IR through these pathways is rarely reported. Accordingly, the present proposal posits that activation of the α7nAChR by VNS attenuates ER stress induced inflammation, thus ameliorating hepatic IR in Kupffer cell. We will focus on the specific interaction between vagal cholinergic activity and the modulation of ER stress induced inflammation via the α7nAChR associated pathway during IR development. Recently, the Endocrine Society has emphasized the absence of specific evidence from basic science, clinical, and epidemiological literature to assess current knowledge regarding underlying mechanisms of obesity [7]. In this proposal, we assign a significant role to α7nAChR in obesity-induced hepatic IR, and suggest a possible therapeutic strategy with VNS intervention."

abstract = "The increase in the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has not yet been adequately explained. There is evidence that when people with a specific personality profile, including strong systematic thinking, attention to detail and lesser social communication skills, though not falling on the autistic spectrum (AS), are more likely to have children with autism, especially when both parents have such characteristics. The use of new technologies such as social networks facilitates the communication of these persons because it does not rely on skills in which they are deficient. We hypothesize that the massive use of such technologies for the establishment of romantic relationships increases the reproductive success of this population contributing to the increase in the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder."

abstract = "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, are chronic intestinal disorders that requires lifelong treatments. IBD are associated with perceived stress, poor quality of life, and psychopathological disorders. Previous studies have documented that psychological distress and depression are risk factors for IBD. On the other hand, IBD itself might be a source of psychological stress. IBD negatively affect individuals’ daily social interactions and close interpersonal relationships. Despite IBD's detrimental effects on quality of life, patients’ adherence to medicaments remains low, increasing the risk of relapses and the subsequent worsening of the clinical condition. Drawing on attachment and mentalization theories, we aim to contribute to understanding of the mechanisms involved in the poor quality of social relationships and the tendency for medication non-adherence in patients with IBD. We hypothesize a bidirectional link between IBD and attachment style and related mentalization abilities, where an individual’s attachment style refers to a complex and characteristic pattern of relating to self and others and mentalization refers to the process of inferring one’s own and others’ mental and physical states. This hypothesized link between IBD and insecure attachment style, mediated by reduced mentalizing abilities, may be a risk factor for developing both IBD-related psychological disorders and reduced medication adherence, which could then lead to worsening disease management and prognoses for the disease course. The medication nonadherence is here considered as both an outcome and a risk factor of this vicious circle. We share the view that preventing the worsening of the IBD condition and promoting patients’ medication adherence would be possible by considering the circular relationship between IBD, attachment, and mentalization and by promoting reflective functioning in patients with IBD, from the onset of the disease."

Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis. What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients; assessed since the 4th-6th day of illness onset, such increases seem to be predictive of an adverse prognosis. Our hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities. TZD are PPARγ agonists that act on nuclear receptors, thereby triggering certain transcription factors. TZD were widely used for type-2 diabetes in the first decade of this century and although concerns have been raised for possible side effects associated with long-term treatment, their use has been recently revaluated for their anti-inflammatory properties in numerous medical conditions."

abstract = "Introduction
Chronic treatment with dopamine D2 receptor antagonists has been proposed to lead to dopamine receptor supersensitivity. Frequently, this is conceptualized as upregulation or changes in the structure or function of the post-synaptic D2 receptor. However, the measured 1.4-fold increase in D2 receptor density and the lack of actual receptor supersensitivity are probably inadequate to explain outcomes such as tardive dyskinesia (TD) and dopamine supersensitivity psychosis.
Hypothesis
Recent data suggest that TD may result from a combination of presynaptic, synaptic, and postsynaptic changes.
Discussion
Presynaptic increase in dopamine release occurs when super-therapeutic blockade of postsynaptic D2 receptors results in excess synaptic unbound dopamine which ultimately ends up being reuptaken by the presynaptic neuron through the dopamine transporter. The increased availability of recycled dopamine results in higher vesicular dopamine concentrations. Since the quantity of neurotransmitter released (known as quanta) is determined by the number of presynaptic neurotransmitter vesicles, the increase in the number (concentration) of dopamine molecules in the vesicles results in a higher concentration of synaptic dopamine with successive depolarization events. Synaptic changes such as the appearance of perforated synapses which is an early step in new synapse formation have been shown in animal models of TD. Finally, postsynaptic increases in D2 receptor expression without demonstration of increased sensitivity or potency has been demonstrated.
Conclusion
TD likely develops due to changes across the synapse and terminology such as ‘dopamine receptor supersensitivity’ can be misleading. ‘Synaptic upregulation’ may be a more correct term."

Recent genomic studies reveal that AR-regulated genes contribute to CRPC emergence. Several reasons for the development of resistance towards anti-androgens have been hypothesized, including intracellular testosterone production, androgen overexpression, somatic mutations of AR resulting in a gain of function, constitutive activation of AR splice variants, imbalance in AR regulators, and bypass of AR in CRPC progression. Recent findings suggest that epigenetic alterations are involved in the deregulation of AR signaling. Overexpression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the enzymatic member of the polycomb repressor complex PRC2, has emerged as a key activator of AR in CRPC. Studies indicate that overabundance of EZH2 in localized prostate tumors increases the risk of biochemical recurrence after surgery, as it activates AR by enhancing methylation, resulting in the suppression of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes. This apparent association between EZH2 and AR in activating target genes by cooperative recruitment might play a critical role in the emergence of CRPC. Our hypothesis is that combination treatment targeting EZH2 and AR may be a novel efficacious therapeutic regime for the treatment of castrate resistant prostate cancer, and we propose to investigate this possibility."

The target of 2019-nCoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) positive cells. ACE2 is present in the salivary gland duct epithelium, and thus it could be the target of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-related animal model experiments show that it can infect the epithelial cells on the salivary gland duct in Chinese rhesus macaques by targeting ACE2. Clinical studies confirmed that 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV could be detected in saliva of human patients. We hypothesize that the infection of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV will lead to inflammatory pathological lesions in patients’ target organs, and possibly inflammatory lesions in salivary glands. 2019-nCoV may cause acute sialoadenitis in the acute phase of infection. After the acute phase, chronic sialoadenitis may be caused by fibrosis repairment. Although there was no direct evidence to prove this, the available indirect evidence indicates a high probability of our hypothesis."

Current therapeutic strategies include conservative management; however, unresponsive patients with pancreatic leaks will frequently require interventions. Existing evidence indicates that endoscopic transpapillary stenting can shorten the duration of external pancreatic fistula; however, the length of conservative treatment in the early stage cannot be avoided. Therefore, endoscopic transpapillary stenting cannot play a decisive role in the treatment and prevention of postsurgical external pancreatic fistula. The authors propose that endoscopic transpapillary stenting before surgery, however, can be used to prevent and treat postsurgical external pancreatic fistula and complications caused by the prolonged maintenance of the drainage tube for abscesses, including retrograde infection, through its physiological drainage effect. This hypothesis has important clinical implications for the accelerated postoperative recovery of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis."

In addition to physical inactivity and obesity, established risk factors for T2D, chemical contaminants consumed in industrialized food such as BPA might also be a contributor to the development of T2D. Epidemiological studies have shown that BPA concentrations are higher in human specimens of T2D when compared to healthy subjects, while experimental studies suggested that bisphenol A (BPA) impairs the pathway by which insulin stimulates glucose uptake. In skeletal muscle and adipocytes, insulin resistance is developed by the impairment of the insulin pathway to stimulate the translocation of glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the cell membrane. Recent results demonstrated that BPA impairs several components of insulin-induced glucose uptake pathway and affect the expression of GLUT4. Regular physical exercise delays or inhibits the development of T2D due to the physiologic processes taking place during muscle contraction, and the fact that skeletal muscle is the site for almost 80% of the glucose transported under insulin stimulation. In fact, the mechanism by which contraction induces glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is partially independent of the insulin pathway, therefore, the effect of BPA on this mechanism is unknown. We hypothesize that during the development of insulin resistance, BPA contributes to the impairment of the molecular pathway by which insulin induces glucose uptake while contraction-induced glucose uptake is not impaired. At the late stages of T2D, BPA may affect GLUT4 expression that will decrease the ability of muscle contraction to induce glucose uptake."

This anosmia and the frequency with which patients present is highly unusual. Coronaviruses have been known to cause common cold symptoms. COVID-19 infections have been described as causing more severe respiratory infections and the symptoms reported by authors from Wuhan, China have not specifically included anosmia. We describe patients who have presented during a two-week period of the COVID-19 pandemic with complete loss of sense of smell. Most had either no symptoms or mild respiratory symptoms. Many had a normal otolaryngologic exam. A relationship between COVID-19 and anosmia should be considered during the pandemic.

Today, MR images are used to determine the type of brain tumor. Manual diagnosis of brain tumor type depends on the experience and sensitivity of radiologists. Therefore, researchers have developed many brain tumor classification models to minimize the human factor. In this study, two different feature extraction (nLBP and αLBP) approaches were used to classify the most common brain tumor types; Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary brain tumors. nLBP is formed based on the relationship for each pixel around the neighbors. The nLBP method has a d parameter that specifies the distance between consecutive neighbors for comparison. Different patterns are obtained for different d parameter values. The αLBP operator calculates the value of each pixel based on an angle value. The angle values used for calculation are 0, 45, 90 and 135. To test the proposed methods, it was applied to images obtained from the brain tumor database collected from Nanfang Hospital, Guangzhou, China, and Tianjin Medical University General Hospital between the years of 2005 and 2010. The classification process was performed by using K-Nearest Neighbor (Knn) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), A1DE, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classification methods, with the feature matrices obtained with nLBP, αLBP and classical LBP from the images in the data set.

Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have started to be used with the development of computer technology in order to enable individuals who are in this situation to communicate with their environment or move. This study focused on the spelling system that transforms the brain activities obtained with EEG signals into writing. In BCI systems working with P300 obtained from 64 electrodes, data recording and processing cause high cost and high processing load. By reducing the number of electrodes used, the physical dimensions, costs, and processing loads of the systems can be reduced. The main problem at this stage is to determine which electrodes are more effective. Randomness-based optimization methods perform their experiments within the framework of a specific fitness function, resulting in near-best results rather than the best result. The electrodes chosen as a result of the study are expected to contribute positively to the classifier performance. At the same time, an unbalanced data set is balanced, and an increase in system performance is expected.
Method
Electrode selection was performed in both the original dataset and ADASYN dataset using the Genetic Algorithm and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization methods. As a dataset, Wadsworth BCI Dataset (P300 Evoked Potentials) was used in the study. The channels chosen most frequently by optimization methods were determined and compared with the 64-channel classification results using LS-SVM and LDA.
Result
As a result of the optimization processes, the eight channels selected most frequently, the channels selected more than the average of all the selected channels and 64 channel results were compared. The highest accuracy was achieved with the LDA classifier for user A with 29 channels selected with BPSO with 97.250%.
Conclusions
The results obtained in the study showed that the number of channels decreased by optimization methods increases the classification performance. In addition, classifier training and test times have been greatly reduced. The application of the ADASYN method did not result in any significant difference."

In hypospadias surgery, tubularization of the neourethra over a catheter or stent has been the standard method for decades. However, the male urethra is not a tubular structure with uniform configuration and diameter by forming a fossa (navicularis) in the glans penis. We recently investigated the structural anatomy of the glanular urethra using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We have shown that the male urethra does not have a uniform tubular structure and not covered by the corpus spongiosum to the end. The glanular urethra that forms the “fossa navicularis” has a wider caliber than the proximal urethra. Its vertical elliptical shape resembles a laterally compressed slit-like passage. The fossa navicularis is covered by a thin layer of fibrous tissue (“septum glandis”) which is an extension of tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum and the corpus spongiosum. Our hypothesis is based on the results of MRI of the glanular urethra and the basic principles of fluid dynamics. We analyzed the flow dynamics of urine on this particular component of the urethra in terms of shape and structural properties. Because of its wider caliber than the proximal urethra, the glanular urethra (fossa navicularis) should cause an increase in pressure and a decrease in velocity of the urine flow. The navicular shape of the fossa and its elliptical external opening (the meatus) should allow urine to be expelled at higher flow rates and at opposite angles at the upper and lower corners which make the wave-like shape of the urine. It can be said that the changes in the volumetric form, pressure and velocity, as well as the wave-like shape of the urine flow are caused by the “fossa navicularis” covered by the “septum glandis”. We propose that the “fossa navicularis” and “septum glandis” play a role as ‘flow control chamber” in controlling the flow of the urine exiting the urethra, which must be taken into account for successful functional reconstruction of hypospadias."

abstract = "Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a major avoidable cause of premature morbidity and mortality in the United States (US) and worldwide, due primarily to increased risks of stroke as well as myocardial infarction. While there are therapeutic lifestyle changes and adjunctive pharmacologic medications of proven benefit, recent interest has increasingly focused on Complementary and Alternative Medicine, in particular, Mind-Body Interventions. With respect to BP, it is tempting to speculate that mindfulness with paced breathing will have beneficial effects in the short run that may translate into lowered risks of stroke in the long run. Paced breathing is deep diaphragmatic breathing with typical rates equal to or less than 5–7 breaths per minute compared with the usual rate of 12–14. One plausible mechanism of benefit is that paced breathing stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system which alters neuronal function in specific areas of the brain and reduces stress chemicals. The hypothesis that mindfulness with paced slow breathing reduces BP could be directly tested in randomized trials designed a priori to do so. Subsequently, a finding that mindfulness with paced breathing reduces BP would also lead to direct tests in randomized trials of reductions of carotid atherosclerosis and, if so, a larger scale trial to test whether there is a direct impact of mindfulness with paced breathing on reducing the risks of stroke and MI. If rigorous testing of this medical hypothesis led to positive results this would have large and important clinical and policy implications in the US and worldwide."

A considerable effort is going on in the field of research that tries to harness the power of T cells against cancer cells to design new anti-cancer immunotherapeutic designs. All these efforts are getting a setback due to the fact that T cells become dysfunctional in tumors while expressing exhaustion markers, so it is necessary to understand from the perspective of cancer itself that what is lacking in tumor-specific T cells in tumor microenvironment so they are getting evaded. Keratoacanthoma is a compelling case of a tumor where auto-regression is happening and many molecular mechanisms can be attributed to this fact. One of the possibilities is having non-exhausting T cells and a highly conducive environment for anti-tumor immune response. In this hypothesis, I am proposing a detailed strategy to decipher this peculiar type of possible immune response in keratoacanthoma and how it can be idolized to create successful anti-cancer T cell immunotherapies."

Drop attack could be related with a vestibular sympathetic reflex alteration because it is involved in blood pressure control. Probably drop attack aetiopathogenesis may be due to a sudden change in the otolith function of the utriculus and/or sacculus. At the same time flow mechanisms of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have a recognized impact on the origin of vestibular drop attack. According to this, the common origin of the perilymph and of the CSF may be an important argument in favour of the potential role of the fistula in the development of drop attacks."

In analogy with “the atopic march” in allergic diseases, we suggest “a dysbiotic march” in IBS; initiated by extensive use of antibiotics during childhood, often before school age. Various abdominal complaints including IBS may develop soon thereafter, while systemic symptom like CFS, fibromyalgia and ME may appear years later."

In PTED, the traumatic event is perceived as unjust and the patient’s response involves feelings of embitterment, rage, and helplessness along with repeated intrusive memories and a persistent negative change in mental well-being. Patients with AN share several psychopathological features with the clinical disturbed dimensions described in PTED. Accordingly, the comorbidity between PTED and AN needs further characterization.

Respiratory conditions are extensively described among more serious cases of COVID-19, and the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the hallmark features of critical COVID-19 cases. ARDS can be directly life-threatening because it is associated with low blood oxygenation levels and can result in organ failure. There are no generally recognized effective treatments for COVID-19, but treatments are urgently needed. Anti-viral medications and vaccines are in the early developmental stages and may take many months or even years to fully develop. At present, management of COVID-19 with respiratory and ventilator support are standard therapeutic treatments, but unfortunately such treatments are associated with high mortality rates. Therefore, it is imperative to consider novel new therapeutic interventions to treat/ameliorate respiratory conditions associated with COVID-19. Alternate treatment strategies utilizing clinically available treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions, or erthropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy were hypothesized to increase oxygenation of tissues by alternative means than standard respiratory and ventilator treatments. It was also revealed that alternative treatments currently being considered for COVID-19 such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by increasing hemoglobin production and increasing hemoglobin availability for oxygen binding and acetazolamine (for the treatment of altitude sickness) by causing hyperventilation with associated increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood may significantly ameliorate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms. In conclusion, is recommend, given HBOT, pRBC, and ESA therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried among COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory conditions and that future controlled-clinical trials explore the potential usefulness of such treatments among COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions."

Cancer stem cells are thought to be resistant to chemotherapy inhibiting different signaling pathways. This might sound stemness is maintained even when the growth is suppressed. Typically, growth factors are known to stimulate MEK/ERK pathways, which is responsible for mitogenic activity, while the PI3K appears more related with the maintenance of stemness. The cross-talk, even in positive or negative ways, between these two pathways could stimulate or accelerate the conversion of normal stem cells into cancer stem cells. Here, we propose a new hypothesis of a mechanism for the conversion of stem cells or progenitors including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to tissue-specific cancer stem cells. This conversion could be prepared by inhibiting MEK/ERK pathway and enhancing PI3K/AKT pathway exploiting conditioned media derived from cancer cell lines, which are good sources of many different cytokines, chemokines, tissues-specific factors, metabolites and so on, together with some inhibitors. The feasibility of this combination will be explained in this hypothesis through the reports published somewhere. Generation of cancer stem cells using embryonic stem cells/iPSCs will bring new theory in the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and assist drug screening that applies for the precision medicines for individuals."

abstract = "Atherosclerosis and its fatal complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke, represent the most common cause of morbidity or mortality in modern world. It was observed that an excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accompanies atherosclerosis. Under physiological circumstances, intracellular H+ accumulates and cell membrane depolarizes during ROS production, rendering ROS generation self-limiting and thus avoiding oxidative stress. However, the persistent production of ROS during atherosclerosis suggests that the physiologically self-limiting ROS-generating process was somehow disrupted and there may be an as-yet unknown mechanism supporting unlimited ROS generation. We thus postulated that an outward H+ conductance, which can efficiently export H+ from the cytosol and maintain membrane potential, may play a crucial role during atherosclerosis. So far, Hv1 channels were mainly found in immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils). As large quantities of vascular infiltrating macrophages exist, we proposed that Hv1-mediated oxidative stress promoted excessive ROS production and the formation of foam cells, contributing to atherosclerosis. In addition, we could not exclude the possibility that Hv1 channels may be upregulated in vascular cells under atherosclerotic conditions, which may also exert effects on vascular inflammation and fibrous cap formation. The present study will employ Hv1 knockout mice in combination with in vitro studies to explore the role of Hv1 channel in atherosclerosis and dissect the underlying mechanisms. The results are expected to offer novel insights into the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis as well as clues for developing novel therapeutic avenues."

Malignant transformation is a rare and late complication of chronic osteomyelitis. This study presented the results of six cases of carcinogenesis and precancerosis transformations arising from chronic osteomyelitis.
Methods
Patients who were diagnosed as chronic osteomyelitis and treated in our division were retrospectively retrieved from electronic case system of our hospital. A total of six cases of chronic osteomyelitis patients, confirming with pathological results were included. Not only the characteristics and causes of chronic osteomyelitis, but also time from diagnosis to malignancy, histological types, therapeutic choices and results of treatment were fully incorporated to further study this disease.
Results
All 6 cases with chronic osteomyelitis included in the study were male, with average age of 55.67 year-old (ranging from 48 to 66). The average time from onset of osteomyelitis to carcinomatous change was 31 years (ranging from 9 to 50). Two thirds of patients had explicit infection source of trauma, whereas the rest cases had no obvious culprits before osteomyelitis emerging. All 3 patients diagnosed as carcinoma were performed with proximal limb amputation, but therapy strategies varied in the remaining 3 patients in precancerosis stage. After amputation, 1 patient had carcinoma relapsed at the lower portion of his femur.
Conclusion
Although carcinomatous degeneration exists as a rare complication in chronic osteomyelitis, some suspicious conditions such as failure treatment of refractory ulcer and bulking of cauliflower-like mass should be taken cautiously. Early diagnosis and proximal amputation are essential for prognosis and clinical results."

As the evidence will suggest, the brain is ill-equipped to manage the intrusion of low-dose ionizing radiation (IR) beyond that which is naturally occurring. When the brain’s antioxidant defenses are overwhelmed by IR, it produces an abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can lead to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of synaptic plasticity, altered neuronal structure and microvascular impairment that have been identified as early signs of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, vascular dementia and other diseases that progressively damage the brain and central nervous system. Although genes play a role in all outcomes, the focus here will be on the non-genetic processes at work. Common assumptions regarding the risks of low-dose IR will be addressed, such as: 1) comparing rapid, repeated bursts of man-made IR sent exclusively into the head to equivalent amounts of head-to-toe background IR over longer periods of time; 2) whether epidemiological studies that dismiss concerns regarding low-dose IR due to lack of evidence it causes cancer, heritable mutations or shortened life spans also apply to neurodegeneration; and 3) why even radiation-resistant neurons can be severely impacted by IR exposure, due to IR-induced injury to the processes they need to function. Also considered will be the difficulty of distinguishing the effects of dental X-ray exposure from similarly low amounts of background IR and where to find the evidence that they may, in fact, be responsible for neurodegeneration. Finally, the long-standing belief that whatever risks are inherent in dental radiography must be undertaken for the sake of oral health is challenged on two counts: 1) while dentists continue to drape their patients in lead-lined aprons, the most effective IR safety precautions are often ignored; and 2) there is an alternative dental imaging technology that does not use IR. While the thrust of this article will be on dental radiation and will touch on how age, gender, X-ray equipment and protocols may increase risk, chiropractic radiographs also will be considered because they focus exclusively on the central nervous system. If X-ray imaging is found to be associated with neurodegeneration, the risk-versus-benefit must be reevaluated, every means of reducing exposure implemented and imaging protocols revised."

abstract = "Theories of pain have traditionally attributed the sensory experience of pain to the brain. We present here a new hypothesis on the origin of pain which is based on a novel approach to the management of persistent pain. We call it the ‘pain channel’ hypothesis of the origin of pain. There are key components to the development of our hypothesis: [1] Our clinical outcome of a persistently pain-free state, representing a maintained pain score of 0/10 has been achieved in a growing cohort of various presentations of persistent pain now exceeding 130 patients over the course of the last five years. With complete control of pain, the patients rapidly return to their premorbid state and level of function. This result requires careful consideration and explanation. [2] Regional anaesthesia has been used as a diagnostic tool to confirm the clinically suspected source of the persistent pain. The pharmacodynamics of local anaesthetics identify the sodium channel of the primary nociceptive sensory neuron as the critical subcellular structure generating pain. [3] Sodium channel function has been recognised as a bioelectromagnetic phenomenon. [4] Neuromodulation has been used to provide our long-term pain relief result. We understand the neuromodulation unit as producing an electromagnetic field within the super low wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum and we have devised a strategy which we believe delivers maximal electromagnetic field effect to the intended sodium channels to create a long-term conduction block. We believe that our clinical outcome challenges the current understanding of the role of the brain in pain. We hypothesise that pain is a peripheral phenomenon rather than being a construct of the brain, as our strategy is peripherally based and completely reverses the presenting clinical profile of persistent pain. More specifically we hypothesise that the sensory phenomenon of pain is a function of specific sodium channels which are coded for pain and which are part of the subcellular structure of peripheral nociceptive sensory nerves. We believe that these hypotheses can lead to a change in focus in the diagnosis and management of pain and drive improvement in current technology and medications to facilitate effective treatment of persistent pain."

abstract = "Urinary bladder dysfunction and voiding disorders lead to the accumulation of residual urine. Left untreated, these conditions result in urinary tract infections. In order to empty the urinary bladder properly, clean intermittent catheterization procedures are highly advocated as an effective measure. Clean intermittent catheterization is a repetitive procedure, which includes inserting the urinary catheter into the urinary bladder. However, inserting the urinary catheter several times a day into the urinary bladder further compromises patient’s safety since the procedure itself is a risk for acquiring catheter-related urinary tract infections. In order to prevent catheter contamination and further infections, new catheter models or catheterization techniques need to be developed. In this paper, a possible method for protection of catheter surface is hypothesized. Using octenidine as an effective antiseptic agent for creating an antimicrobial layer might prove effective against bacterial adhesion and consequent catheter contamination. Additionally, using octenidine as catheter coating further facilitates the catheterization procedure. An uncontaminated catheter throughout the whole catheterization process is the main goal of the procedure. Achieving it would prove beneficial to both patients and the healthcare system due to the absence of infections, increase in patients’ quality of life and an overall cost reduction."

Saponin, a naturally occurring chemical in several plant species was discovered to be an alternative compound that may parallel the effects of sodium lauryl sulphate, yet exude less ill effects. This article highlights the benefits of saponin and its presence in a heavily consumed and exported fruit in Jamaica (ackee, Blighia sapida). The possibility of extracting saponin from ackee, and its use in the toothpaste industry as an alternative to sodium lauryl sulphate are discussed. Through consideration of this alternative, the potential exists to improve the safety of toothpastes and consequently improve oral health."

Environmental and policy strategies with fear appeals are important contributors to reductions in smoking prevalence. Fear appeals are persuasive messages—often using graphic and emotionally evocative imagery and language—that attempt to scare their audiences into tobacco cessation. While the intentions of fear appeals are benign, their effects are not necessarily so; here, we argue that some fear appeals carry a significant risk of backfiring by eliciting nocebo effects among its viewers. In this context, it is important to recognize that there is currently no justification for disregarding potential nocebo effects. Therefore, we should improve our understanding of nocebo effects in the field of preventive medicine, as well as the impact of strategies aimed at mitigating their negative health effects."

PCSK9 interferes with LDL metabolism and causes dyslipidemias in hematological malignancies particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nutraceuticals like berberine, curcumin and polydatin have been found effective in modulating PCSK9 expression by lowering LDL levels. Eugenol, a nutraceutical has shown a promising role in cancer due to its antioxidant and antihypercholesterolemic effects. In the present study, PCSK9 expression was measured in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and was found to be significantly induced. Based on the results of expression analysis, a plausible hypothesis was made. Eugenol being an antioxidant will prevent oxidation of LDL. In the absence of ox-LDL, LOX1 scavenger receptor, which regulates PCSK9 expression, will not be activated. As the circulating LDL is reduced, it will no longer be able to support leukemia cell growth. The hypothesis was validated by an in silico and in vitro study. Molecular docking revealed hydrophobic interactions between ligand eugenol and macromolecules PCSK9 and LOX1. Expression of both PCSK9 and LOX1 were significantly reduced by eugenol in Jurkat cells. To conclude, PCSK9 could therapeutically be targeted by eugenol in leukemia cells."

Our innovative approach describes sound detection in a completely different way from the one currently adopted. It requires analyzing the inner ear system in the form of a bent spiral and assuming that perilymph in such a small system behaves like a non-Newtonian fluid. The necessity of analyzing the system in the form of a bifilar spiral results from the need to compensate the head movements, so far omitted in the analysis. We suggest that the construction and the role of the oval window and the stapes are different than just a simple piston that converts mechanical signals to hydrokinetic ones. Stapes provides uniform distribution of the hydrokinetic signal in the spiral cochlear system, and the conversion of momentum to angular momentum creates a force perpendicular to the vestibular membrane, which causes the effect of its deflection, what has not yet been explained."

Knowledge on their pathophysiological mechanisms may direct us towards treatment or a cure. Although these diseases are caused by two totally different gene-mutations and cause different clinical pictures, in this article I propose a common disease mechanism in the two. This common mechanism is induced by defects in the response to cellular stress and injury.
The hypothesis
Depletion of iPLA2β in INAD and increased activity of iPLA2β in DMD eventually lead to similar defects in the response to cell stress and injury. According to this hypothesis, the depletion of iPLA2β in INAD primarily blocks repair mechanisms by the inability to form a mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). Forming of the PTP is necessary to release mitochondrial coenzyme A (CoA) into the cytoplasm for activation of palmitoylation and massive endocytosis as a repair response. In DMD the increased activity of iPLA2β causes exhaustion of the stress signalling cascade by increased and prolonged PTP opening. Continuous leaking of mitochondrial CoA through the PTP leads to the inability of the cell to build a sufficient mitochondrial:cytoplasmic CoA gradient, also causing insufficient release of mitochondrial CoA as a response to cell stress and injury. Decreased palmitoylation capacity and decreased endocytosis and membrane remodelling are implicated in proven pathophysiological mechanisms in INAD and DMD. The described mechanism in INAD and DMD, may be considered a common mechanism of repair in case of cell stress and injury. Beside their role in INAD and DMD, they may therefore be implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases as well. Available research shows involvement of iPLA2β in other neurodegenerative diseases. We might be able to divide neurodegenerative diseases in “INAD-like disease-mechanism” or “DMD-like disease-mechanism”, depending on decreased or increased iPLA2β activity."

abstract = "Background
More than half of stroke patients present with a sleep-related breathing disorder including both central and obstructive forms of sleep apnoea. A cerebral infarction in different brain areas can disrupt sleep regulating pathways and cause insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm disturbances and other sleep disorders. Therefore, there is a need of objective data about various sleep disorders arising after ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke in order to implement practical recommendations how to suspect, diagnose and treat these conditions. Our medical hypothesis is that non-breathing sleep disorders are common among patients with acute ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke.
Objective
To investigate the subjective and objective sleep parameters in the patients with an acute ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke.
Methods
In the acute period (from 3 to 10 days after the first symptoms) of stroke all the patients completed questionnaires about sleep complaints and symptoms experienced before and after stroke, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Modified Rankin Scale. Patients were included for further polysomnography (PSG) and sleep electroencephalography according to these criteria: (1) patients expressing severe sleep related complaints and/or symptoms that are new or have exacerbated after the stroke; and/or (2) patients having the ESS score equal or >10.
Results
66 patients were examined in the acute period of stroke. 33 (50%) patients had at least one or more new or exacerbated sleep complaints and/or symptoms, mostly related to obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and insomnia. Finally, 13 (19.7% of the whole sample) patients were selected for performing PSG. 12 of 13 patients were diagnosed with sleep disorder: 1 patient got the diagnosis of mild OSA, 1 – central sleep apnoea (CSA), 2 – combination of OSA and CSA, 1 – combination of mild OSA, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) and REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), 1 – combination of mild OSA and PLMD, 3 – combination of PLMD and insomnia, 3 – insomnia. There were no significant relations between type, location or treatment of stroke and various PSG measures, as well as type of a diagnosed sleep disorder.
Conclusions
Half of our acute stroke patients had at least one or more new or exacerbated sleep complaints and/or symptoms, mainly related to OSA or insomnia. In the selected PSG group almost all patients were diagnosed with a sleep disorder, half of them having non-breathing sleep disorder, such as PLMD, RBD and insomnia."

Topiramate, a new anticonvulsant, is widely used in the treatment of numerous psychiatric conditions. It can antagonize α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate (KA) glutamate receptors and enhance the inhibitory activity of γ-amino butyric acid (GABA). Inhibition of AMPA and KA receptors and increased GABA activity has been proved to have an inhibitory effect on prolactin release. Thus, topiramate may be an effective agent in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia."

SPS can be very painful due to unpredictable muscle spasms which can be triggered by various stimuli, such as noise, touch, or emotional experiences. There is thought to be an autoimmune component to the disorder. We present the case of a 59-year-old woman diagnosed with SPS who appears to have experienced a dramatic reduction in her symptoms after being treated with Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN). Prior to this treatment regimen, she had tried many treatments with only limited derived benefit. She was started on LDN and after 6 weeks, reported reductions in pain, anxiety, depression, agoraphobia, and muscle tightness. Upon multiple follow-ups, leading up to 12 months, she continually displayed reduced symptoms and improved quality of life. We conclude that LDN may have some utility in treating and managing the symptoms of SPS. We hypothesize that this may be possible due to LDN operating via anti-inflammatory pathways as well as acting as an opioid antagonist. We assert that further research as it relates to LDN and SPS in addition to other chronic pain conditions is warranted."

Having multiple biosynthetic pathways for each of these important signaling molecules would provide greater assurance that they are available in sufficient quantities for their various physiological roles in the body. This paper puts forth the hypothesis that a number of common dietary factors—including sucrose and glucose, fats, plant components, and even ethanol—are substrates in novel biosynthetic pathways for the monoamines. A major aspect of this hypothesis is that in a range of multicellular organisms, D-glucose in particular may participate in novel biosynthetic pathways for the monoamines, where this sugar has already been linked with synthesis of the neurotransmitters acetylcholine, glutamate, and GABA through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Another major aspect of the hypothesis is that phenol or polyphenol molecules, found in various plants, may combine with particular fats or even ethanol to form dopamine, which can then be converted to norepinephrine through the already established step involving the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase. If such a biosynthetic pathway exists for converting ethanol to dopamine in humans, it could be a major factor in substance abuse, including early onset alcoholism. Further, if the above biosynthetic pathways exist in a range of organisms, they may be associated with appetitive processes regulating consumption of particular dietary factors, such as fruits and vegetables, to maintain internal “set points” of, for example, elevated noradrenergic signaling. In this scenario, exposure to psychological stress, which could eventually deplete neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, may result in craving for sucrose, fats, or alcohol to help replenish the depleted cellular levels of this signaling molecule. An alternative to the overall biosynthetic hypothesis put forth here is that animal cells do not possess these pathways, but the animal microbiome harbors bacteria that do carry out these reactions and helps supply the body with monoamines and other signaling molecules."

CO2 is an end-product of metabolism of all body cells. When CO2 accumulates, it is recommended to consider measures to reduce its endogenous production. One such measure relates to the sources of energy ingested as nutrition. It is recommended to increase the intake of dietary lipids and reduce carbohydrates, as the former produces less endogenous CO2 when metabolized. Our hypothesis focuses on a different mechanism for reducing the availability of carbohydrates, especially glucose, as a fuel for body cells metabolism. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a new class of oral anti-hyperglycemic agents. Physiologically, glucose filtered through kidney glomeruli is reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule; SGLT2i inhibit this mechanism. Therefore, glucose is secreted in the urine (glucosuria) and as a result glucose serum level is reduced. If glucose serum level is reduced, less glucose is available for metabolism, less CO2 is endogenously produced, and less CO2 must be expelled from the diseased lungs. It is hypothesized that these agents may be beneficial for patients with diabetes and concomitant pulmonary disease who retain CO2."

Using our G-Lymphatic clearance hypothesis, these results can be explained theoretically. The presence of two modes can be related to the order of ISF-CSF cleaning of brain parts. The reduced activity can be ascribed to neuronal ingredients deficiency brought about by the seizure related excess brain activity and by an over cleaning by the G-Lymphatic system."

It thus brings out a hypothesis that hyperuricemia, a pathological elevation of blood UA, might be a risk factor for periodontitis. Namely, periodontitis individuals with Hu might acquire more severe periodontal destruction compared to those without Hu. To support the hypothesis, four aspects of evidences are proposed. First, hyperuricemia and periodontitis share many metabolic and inflammatory comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases which are commonly related to elevated UA levels and gout. Second, observational and interventional studies have found altered UA levels in blood and saliva in periodontitis patients or after periodontal treatment, suggesting an epidemiological connection between hyperuricemia and periodontitis. Third, plausible immuno-metabolic mechanisms by which hyperuricemia might promote the progression of periodontitis are suggested, such as impaired immune response, oxidative stress, pathological bone remodeling and dysbiosis. The last, our empirical data exhibited elevated UA levels in gingival tissue in periodontitis mice compared to controls. If the hypothesis is true, given the high prevalence of the two conditions, hyperuricemia would be a significant risk factor increasing the global burden of periodontal diseases. Evidences on a directional correlation between hyperuricemia and periodontitis are sparse. Longitudinal and experimental studies would be necessary to determine the magnitude of periodontal risk, if any, exacerbated by hyperuricemia and the underlying mechanisms."

One important factor affecting the vascularization is the interfragmentary movement in the fracture-healing zone. Many studies have demonstrated that stable fixation with predominatly moderate interfragmentary compression movement can stimulate vascularization and the healing process whereas unstable fracture fixation delays the vascularization and bone healing process. Instability of fracture fixation, in particular large shearing interfragmentary movement, can cause delayed healing or non-unions. We hypothesize that the direction of interfragmentary movement affects vascularization in the fracture-healing zone. Cyclic compressive strain stimulates greater vessel formation than tensile or shearing strain. This is due to differences in the local mechanical environment which are not delineated by the direction-independent characterization of interfragmentary movement typically reported. We propose that new vessel formations buckle under compressive loading without significant load transfer across endothelial cell junctions while both tensile and shearing deformations result in disruptive loads despite a biochemically angiogenic environment. From a clinical perspective, this means that the optimal conditions for rapid vascularization result from fracture fixation that minimizes cyclic tensile and shearing movements in the healing zone while allowing moderate compressive movements"

There are also several benign/genetic diseases whose natural course can result in infertility without gonadotoxic therapy. Considering the fact that most of these people are cured and survive with the advent of modern medicine, infertility is related to serious psychological and relationship implications and parenthood is a significant issue for those patients. Semen cryopreservation option is available for postpubertal adolescent and adult men, while children do not have this storing option since they do not have mature spermatozoa. However, their testes contain spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), which are initiators of spermatogenesis. Promising findings in animal studies and human cell lines have encouraged scientists that SSCs may be hope for restoring fertility option of patients who cannot produce functional sperm and who have no other choice to preserve their future fertility. For this reason, several centers around the world already began to collect and cryopreserve testicular tissue or cells with anticipation that SSC-based therapies will be available in the near future; however, an optimal transplantation design in humans is yet to be developed.

When 60–80%of these cells are lost, then enough dopamine is not produced and Parkinson’s motor symptoms appear. It is thought that the disease begins many years before the motor (movement related) symptoms and therefore, researchers are looking for ways to recognize the non-motor symptoms that appear early in the disease as early as possible, thereby halting the progression of the disease. In this paper, machine learning based diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease is presented. The proposed diagnosis method consists of feature selection and classification processes. Feature Importance and Recursive Feature Elimination methods were considered for feature selection task. Classification and Regression Trees, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines were used for the classification of Parkinson's patients in the experiments. Support Vector Machines with Recursive Feature Elimination was shown to perform better than the other methods. 93.84% accuracy was achieved with the least number of voice features for Parkinson’s diagnosis."

They presented with significant vestibular and headache symptoms similar to individuals who experience vestibular migraine (VM). As such, we hypothesize that VM may be a possible explanation for the Havana cohort’s presenting symptoms. To evaluate this hypothesis, we compared symptoms reported by the affected individuals in Havana, Cuba, to symptoms reported by corresponding patients from a tertiary academic neurotology clinic with a chief complaint of vertigo or disequilibrium, who met the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria for VM. The prevalence of the Havana subjects experiencing various symptomatic domains was compared with the VM cohort, leading to 26 unique domains and statistical comparisons between the cohorts. Of the 26 domains compared between the two cohorts, 18 were not significantly different. This included the two most important components of meeting criteria for VM, namely the co-existence of headache and vestibular symptoms. On regression analysis, the only feature which kept its significant difference between the two cohorts was acute intense head pressure (P = 0.007). The domains with similar occurrence ratios included dizziness, headache, light sensitivity, hearing reduction, and tinnitus. In other words, multiple headache and vestibular symptoms, consistent with VM criteria, were similar between the two cohorts. The considerable similarities across various domains between VM patients and Havana subjects could be due to migraine as a possible common etiology for both groups. We propose VM as a potential etiology for the symptomatology in the U.S. diplomats in Cuba."

When a supersaturation status is reached, oxalates combine with calcium and crystallize to form 80% of the urinary stones. Several cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease and stroke are thought to be associated with the formation of urinary stones via sharing the same pathogenesis and/or risk factors. This review investigated the evidence linking oxalates/urinary stones to cardiovascular diseases. Eventually, two theories can explain the possible association between urinary stones and cardiovascular diseases: the theory of common origin and the theory of common risk factors. While the first theory is based on the common vascular pathophysiology of urinary stones and cardiac events, the later suggests that metabolic syndrome traits increase the risk of urinary stones and cardiovascular diseases independently. A few cohort studies showed a higher risk of coronary heart disease and stroke among people with history of urinary stones than people without it while other cohort studies did not. These studies had different definitions for cardiovascular diseases, used various methods to assess urinary stones, and some of them did not control for potential confounders. When they were pooled together in meta-analyses, a significant heterogeneity across studies was observed. In conclusion, although there is some evidence indicating that urinary stones could increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, a substantial causal relationship cannot be settled."

In order to reduce toxicity and improve tumor specificity, we propose a CAR T cell targeting glioblastoma multiforme utilizing the synNotch receptor pathway linked to a tandem CAR T cell. The extracellular domain of the synNotch receptor is replaced by a single chain fragment variable specific for the EGF receptor variant III (scfv-EGFRvIII), and covalently bonded to a IL-13Rα2-CD133-tandem CAR. This would produce an AND-gate CAR-T cell, which requires activation of both signals from synNotch receptor binding to EGFRvIII and then binding of the tandem CAR to either of the two IL-13Rα2 or CD133 ligands-specific antigens for glioblastoma stem cells. SynNotch receptor activation along with the 4-1BB costimulatory domain results in CAR T cell expression under the TRE promoter, culminating in a tri-specific and effective tumor stem cell recognition and elimination of glioblastoma multiforme."

To evaluate the local distribution and activity of sympathetic nerves in myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) and explore the pathological mechanism of myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) using a rat model of disease.
Methods
MPS was modeled in the model group (MG) by a combination of blunt trauma and eccentric exercise in Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8). Eight rats were randomly assigned to the control group (CG). Histopathology was applied to detect the local conditions of the MTrPs. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), nerve growth factor (NGF), and norepinephrine (NE) were detected in the MTrPs to evaluate sympathetic remodeling.
Results
Muscle fiber rupture, atrophy and shape irregularity were universally observed in the MTrPs. TH expression was significantly increased in the MG, as detected by immunofluorescence, and NGF and TH expression was also higher in MTrPs in the MG than in MTrPs in the CG, as determined by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the expression of NE was significantly increased in MTrPs, as determined by ELISA.
Conclusion
There was sympathetic hyperinnervation in MTrPs, which could partially explain the symptoms of MTrPs and is an interesting and useful new perspective regarding the diagnosis and treatment of MPS.
Perspective
The sympathetic nerves in MTrPs are remodeled, leading to sympathetic hyperinnervation. Sympathetic hyperinnervation can partially explain the symptoms of MPS. The pathological mechanism of sympathetic hyperinnervation may be a new perspective for the diagnosis and treatment of MPS."

Then, ELM was executed to the ECG samples. Lastly, DEA on software ELM was developed for the assign of the number of hidden neurons, which were used in the ELM algorithm. The performance criterions were used in order to compare the performance of the classification exerted. Concordantly, it was realized that the highest classification achievement values were reached to Accuracy 97.5% and values 93 of number of hidden neurons, with the practice improved with the DEA compared to conventional ELM."

Antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR showed in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons and in a mouse model pathogenic effects including cross-linking and internalization of the target receptors (NMDAR). Several studies demonstrated that not only neurons, but also astrocytes express functional NMDA receptors including GluN1 subunit. It is conceivable that the pathogenic antibodies against the NMDAR causing the anti-NMDAR encephalitis affect not only the neuronal receptors, but also the NMDAR on astrocytes. We hypothesize that antibodies against NMDAR can lead to cross-linking and internalization of the target receptors in astrocytes similar to neurons with disruption of the calcium release within the astrocytes and consequently blocking release of inhibitory gliotransmitters. Further, we assume influence on expression of aquaporin 4 channels and gap-junctional communication due to modification of the astrocytic NMDAR. The disruption of these interactions and dysbalance could result in impairment of CNS homeostasis and co-determine the severity of clinical disease manisfestation and recovery."

Vascular degenerative disorders of posterior eye are the vision threatening disorders, involving inflammation as one of the main pathological mechanisms. Use of current treatment regimens for PSED is significantly limited on account of unique environment of the eye that offers a major barrier to the delivery of efficient drug doses to the posterior segment. Sirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor, acts by inhibiting the T-cell proliferation and the release of inflammatory cytokines, have been widely investigated for its potential role in the treatment of PSED. Clinical application of the sirolimus, however, has been limited due to its poor physico-chemical properties like poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailable, high molecular weight and high instability. Although nanocarriers like liposomes have shown a great promise in shuttling the cargo to the target site for various applications, yet, due to distinct anatomical and physiological barriers of the eye, these conventional liposomes are inefficient to shuttle the cargo to the posterior segment. Therefore, in this hypothesis, we propose to incorporate edge activators (polyol) in the liposomal bilayer thereby to enhance the liposomal fluidity and deformability. Such polyol modified liposomes would successfully penetrate the blood retinal barrier and would efficiently shuttle the sirolimus to the posterior segment of the eye making this a promising strategy for the treatment of PSED."

However, its effectiveness and validity could be impeded by lack of relationship to the patients’ neuronal changes in their brain. The aim of our theoretical-empirical paper is to propose a novel brain-based quantitative objective measurement of the self and how it shapes the drawing process. We discuss recent data that how the autocorrelation window (ACW) is related to the temporal continuity of self in current neuroscience and further develop a method to use ACW to measure the temporal continuity of the drawing process, probing it in two case studies. As expected, the schizophrenic subject shows lower ACW values compared to the healthy subject and reflects the well-known deficit in the temporal continuity of the self in schizophrenia. We concluded that ACW and eventually other measures of the brain’s spatiotemporal structure might be able to serve as objective markers of the self in the drawing process. As our approach connects brain, self, and drawing process, it provides the theoretical basis for the future development of a brain-based assessment of the self in the drawing process and art therapy."

Every time we attack the tumor, the tumor neutralizes our attempts. Carcinogenesis can be presented as a tree whose branches are different pro-tumor mechanisms and whose trunk is a biological phenomenon that “feeds” those branches. A tree can be destroyed in two ways: either by cutting a branch for a branch without a guarantee that new branches will not grow, or cutting down the trunk and letting the branches wither away. To cut down the trunk, it is necessary to understand the nature of the biological phenomenon, which helps the tumor to avoid attack by the immune system, drugs and immunotherapy. The clue is that the pro-tumor mechanisms are united by one goal – to increase the resistance of the tumor cell to immune factors and drugs. A phenomenon that improves cell resistance is well known in biology – adaptation. If the immunity does not immediately destroy the tumor cell, the cell begins to adapt to it. Our hypothesis is that short range adaptation to immune factors plays a role in the formation of tumor tolerance for immunity and immunotherapy. This gives rise to the idea of reducing the survival of tumor cells by disrupting adaptation mechanisms. Indeed, “turning off” the immune system for a period of time before therapy and applying immunotherapy only to tumor cells that have lost their increased resistance could be a new approach to increase the effectiveness of immunotherapy."

Our preliminary results showed that performing complex finger tapping task resulted in enhanced activities in the primary motor cortex and precuneus, ipsilateral to the moving hand in the mirror therapy paradigm. We hypothesise the following: (a) complex finger tapping would result in stronger top-down motor facilitation and higher demand on visuo-motor memory than simple finger tapping in the mirror therapy paradigm, and (b) observing a blurred mirror image would result in increased top-down motor facilitation and higher demand on visuo-motor memory than a clear mirror image.

Pregnancy is characterized by multiple metabolic processes to allow proper foetal development and ensure adequate stores. Little is known about the interactions between maternal and foetal metabolism during the last phase of pregnancy. Metabolomic offers potential to discover changes in maternal metabolism in pregnancy and their relation to the newborn metabolic status.
Objective
In this study we tested the hypothesis that metabolomic status in newborns at birth depends upon the metabolomic profile of their mothers in the last phase of pregnancy.
Study design
Urine samples were collected from 36 pregnant women three weeks before delivery and from 21 healthy term newborns within 48 h after birth. Urines were analysed using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy and NMR urine spectra were evaluated through Principal Components Analysis.
Results
The first component of the PCA analysis showed two distinct metabolic groups: pregnant women and newborns. A significant correlation was found between urine metabolic profiles of newborns and those of their mothers.
Conclusion
Urine metabolomic profiles of newborns at birth mirrors that of their mothers in the last phase of pregnancy. The metabolomic approach appears to be crucial to understand the maternal effects on foetal programming and infant outcomes."

For each subject, whole-brain functional and effective connectivity networks such as coherence, generalized partial direct coherence and directed directed transfer function, are constructed for the lie-telling and truth-telling conditions. The classification results demonstrate that lying could be differentiated from truth-telling with an accuracy of 86.25% with the leave-one-person-out method. Results show functional and effective connectivity patterns of lying for the average of all frequency bands are different in regions from that of truth-telling. The current study may shed new light on neural patterns of deception from connectivity analysis view point."

Various mechanisms have been postulated, such as immunological, hormonal, mechanical, environmental, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Our hypothesis favours immunological mechanisms because some cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-17A, are responsible for orchestrating low-grade systemic inflammation associated with obesity; however, these cytokines are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as gene promoter methylation."

abstract = "Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) operates to achieve the optimum physiological functioning and maintains homeostasis in a tonic and continuous manner. Evaluation of ANS profile is crucial in assessing autonomic dysfunction. Conventional ANS evaluation procedures fail to capture minute dynamic alterations of ANS activities. The ANS output pattern is appropriately reflected in the fine alteration of the resting heart rate (HR). HR is a non-stationary variable, results from the dynamic interplay between the multiple physiologic mechanisms. The control of cardiac rate or the chronotropic regulation of heart is considered as a coupled network of oscillators, each representing a specific facet of the cardiovascular reflex. The slower vasomotor oscillation via sympathetic system is combined with rapid respiratory oscillation by parasympathetic system to modulate the intrinsic oscillation pattern of the SA Node. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is used to understand the autonomic influence on cardiovascular system in health and disease. Fourier decomposition of HRV offers us mainly two different frequency components. High frequency (HF) variation indicates parasympathetic variability due to respiration and Low frequency (LF) mainly implicates tonic sympathetic influence, due to slower vasomotor modulation of heart rate. However, different studies show conflicting results and direct recording of sympathetic nerve activity also failed to correlate with LF power in either healthy subjects or in patients with increased cardiac sympathetic drive. A scatter-plot where each R-R interval is plotted against the preceding R-R interval forms a distributed elliptic point cloud in two dimensional plane. The phase space realization of this plot with dimension two and delay one is referred to as Poincaré plot analysis, an emerging quantitative-visual technique where the shape of the plot is categorized into different functional classes. The plot provides summary as well as detailed beat-to-beat information of the heart. This plot can be extended to three dimensions and with multi-lag, offering more insight and information. A mathematical expression was developed by an interventional study by Toichi et al., using pharmacological blockers during different physiological variables that calculated the lengths of transverse and longitudinal axes of the Poincaré plot to derive two quantitative expressions of sympathetic and vagal influence on HRV: ‘cardiac sympathetic index’ (CSI)) and ‘cardiac vagal index’ (CVI). In the present study, we emulate Poincaré plot patterns seen in normal range of sympatho-vagal balances and also in Diabetes Mellitus (DM), known to cause autonomic dysfunction. The emerging pattern of R-R interval time series would provide valuable insight into the altered temporal dynamics and also extract crucial features embedded within. DM is a major public health crisis globally and particularly in Indian population. We hypothesize that, CSI and CVI will effectively segregate the two arms of ANS and can be utilized as an effective evaluation tool to explore the disease status in patients of Diabetes Mellitus. We also propose that, the dynamics of fluctuations in physiological rhythms that exhibit long-term correlation and memory, can also be explored and expressed quantitatively by incorporating various degrees of ‘lag’ in these recurrence plots."

This hypothesis explores recently arisen evidence for each step of this process, as well as pre-existing, yet unexplored overlapping pathophysiological characteristics of sPD with mycobacterial and IAV infections.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family cytokines are important regulators of cell fate affecting both neurogenesis and neurodegeneration. Several studies demonstrate that TGF-β signalling protects neurons from glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, a recognized mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders such as ALS. Recent studies report dysregulations of the TGF-β system as a common feature of neurodegenerative disorders. The upregulation of this system has been linked with ALS progression. We have quantified TGF-β1, TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 serum levels in 23 ALS patients and 12 healthy controls, our preliminary results support the hypothesis that TGF-β3 levels can be a marker disease severity ALS.

abstract = "Background
The hierarchical model of stem cell genesis is based on the idea that the number of cell divisions between the zygote and fully differentiated epithelial cells is kept close to the minimum, which is log to the base 2 of the total number of cells produced in a human lifetime. The model assumes the orderly progression of stem cell divisions requires precise control at every stage in development. If the orderly progression is maintained then cancer will be rare. A prediction of the model is that if the orderly progression of the stem cell hierarchy is disturbed by trauma, ulceration or inflammation then cancer will occur.
Hypothesis
Bacterial induced inflammation in breast ducts disturbs the stem cell hierarchy and is a cause of breast cancer.
Evidence
Mammalian milk is not sterile. It contains a range of bacteria, derived endogenously by the entero-mammary circulation. The dominant flora consists of lactose fermenting bacteria. Pregnancy and breast feeding reduce the risk of subsequent breast cancer. The implication is that a lactose fermenting bacterial flora in breast ducts is protective. Malignant and benign breast tissue contains bacteria derived endogenously, but studies so far have not revealed a specific flora associated with malignancy. Periodontitis is associated with oral, oesophageal, colonic, pancreatic, prostatic and breast cancer. The pathogenic bacteria which cause periodontitis spread endogenously to cause inflammation at other epithelial sites. Meta-analysis of epidemiological studies shows that the consumption of yoghurt is associated with a reduction in the risk of breast cancer.
Conclusion
The hypothesis, although not proven, is supported by the available evidence. Lactose fermenting bacteria protect but pathogenic bacteria which induce inflammation raise the risk of breast cancer. The consumption of yoghurt also appears to be protective."

Surplus either vagal or sympathetic activity may rarely induce the development of AF; however, typically loss of balance between the both systems mediates the induction and maintenance of AF. Vagal stimulation has been proposed as a novel treatment approach for AF because the anti-arrhythmic effects of low-level vagus nerve stimulation have been shown both in patients and animal models. We hypothesize that in typical cases of AF without any clear trigger by either autonomic nervous system, significant changes in vagus somatosensory evoked potentials and a smaller cross-sectional area of CNX could be detected, representing functional and structural changes in CNX, respectively."

The disease originates from the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra in the brain, resulting in unregulated activity of the basal ganglia. Αlpha-synuclein (α-syn) is a protein found to aggregate in the substantia nigra region of patients with PD, forming Lewy Body inclusions; its aggregation may contribute to neuronal cell death in PD. This work hypothesizes about the synergistic relationship between α-syn aggregation and neuroinflammation to up-regulate expression of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). The protease, plasmin, has been shown to cleave extracellular α-syn (including its monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillary forms), resulting in less aggregation and Lewy Body formation. The zymogen plasminogen is converted to its active serine protease form, plasmin, either by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or by urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) bound to urokinase receptor (uPAR). Both tPA and uPA/uPAR are inhibited by PAI-1. Thus, when PAI-1 levels increase, less plasmin is generated, which would lead to reduced proteolysis of α-syn. Expression of PAI-1 is increased both in inflammatory environments and in the presence of extracellular α-syn aggregates. This scenario suggests a pathological amplification loop: increased extracellular α-syn aggregation activates an inflammatory response from microglia and astrocytes, increasing PAI-1 levels, and decreasing the generation of plasmin. With reduced plasmin, less α-syn can be cleaved, and aggregation continues, sustaining the pathological process. Understanding this putative pathogenic loop could provide insight into the means by which neurodegeneration progresses in PD, and it may offer possible novel therapeutic strategies."

In recent years, the importance of producing microarray data from tissue and cell samples and analyzing these microarray data has increased. Machine learning and deep learning methods have been started to use in the diagnosis and classification of microarray data of cancer diseases. However, it is challenging to analyze microarray data due to the small number of sample size and high number of features of microarray data and in some cases some features may not be relevant with the classification. Because of this reason, studies in the literature focused on developing feature selection/dimension reduction techniques and classification algorithms to improve classification accuracy of the microarray data. This study proposes hybrid methods by using Relief and stacked autoencoder approaches for dimension reduction and support vector machines (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for classification. In the study, three microarray datasets of Overian, Leukemia and Central Nervous System (CNS) were used. Ovarian dataset contains 253 samples, 15,154 genes and 2 classes, Leukemia dataset contains 72 samples, 7129 genes, and 2 classes and CNS dataset contains 60 samples, 7129 genes and 2 classes. Among the methods applied to the three microarray data, the best classification accuracy without dimension reduction was observed with SVM as 96.14% for ovarian dataset, 94.83% for leukemia dataset and 65% for CNS dataset. The proposed hybrid method ReliefF + CNN method outperformed other approaches. It gave 98.6%, 99.86% and 83.95% classification accuracy for the datasets of ovarian, leukemia, and CNS datasets, respectively.

Severe primary brain injury and subsequent secondary brain injury cascade events are thought to be involved in the development of NPE.

We hypothesize that sevoflurane may be an effective treatment for preventing the development of NPE. Sevoflurane may play a role in protecting brain and lung tissue after acute brain injury through its sympatholytic, antioxidative, ion channel stabilizing, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and pulmonary protection effects. It has the potential to be used as a sedative in the neurosurgical intensive care unit (NICU), which can help maintain nervous system and cardiopulmonary function in patients with acute brain injury to improve prognosis. Sevoflurane also has the advantages of fast induction of anesthesia, rapid drug metabolism, little interference to the cardiovascular system, and controllable depth of anesthesia. If our hypothesis is supported by further experiments, use of sevoflurane may open a new door for the treatment of acute brain injury and NPE."

In an attempt to reverse colonic inflammation, endogenous systems involved in intestinal physiology are studied and the cholinergic system is fundamental for this process. In addition, this system has anti-inflammatory action in experimental models of IBD. Another important endogenous system in regulating the exacerbated inflammatory response in the gut is mediated by endocannabinoids, which play an important role in restoring bowel functionality after the onset of the inflammatory process. There are several reports in the literature showing the interconnection between the cannabinoid and cholinergic systems in different tissues. Considering that the activation of the cholinergic system stimulates the production of cannabinoid agonists in the intestine, our hypothesis is that the interaction between the muscarinic system and the cannabinoid in the control of intestinal inflammation is mediated by endogenous cannabinoids, since they are stimulated by the activation of muscarinic receptors."

Two postnatal phases of the disease are distinguished, the first phase is thought to be caused by hyperoxia. One of the most relevant ROP risk factor in routine clinical practice is blood transfusion which leads to the introduction into the neonatal circulation of ‘non-physiological’ adult haemoglobin (HbA) rather than the physiological foetal haemoglobin (HbF). Due to their different affinities for oxygen, HbA will release into retina more oxygen than HbF. It can be expected that this much greater influx of oxygen from HbA may be sensed by the relevant retinal receptors as hyperoxia. Based on the above considerations, I propose that the introduction of non-physiological HbA from adult donors during blood transfusion for anaemia is of key importance in the development and progression of ROP. This hypothesis predicts that there is an HbA limit, beyond which the sequence of events described in the pathogenesis of ROP is triggered. To prevent ROP, I propose launching a new medical field: neonatal transfusion medicine. This system would involve the collection and preparation of umbilical cord blood from the placenta of healthy newborns (containing almost 100% HbF), which would then be administered to premature newborns (who are at risk of ROP) instead of adult blood."

These fear avoidance beliefs in individuals with pain are usually acquired through previous pain experiences, observation, and threating verbal input from others that movement is harmful to the spinal structures. Observational learning of fear has been recently demonstrated in several experimental studies, where participants acquired fear of pain after observing the distressed painful expressions of the volunteers performing a painful cold pressor task. The primary purpose of this paper is to propose action observation, a cognitive rehabilitation technique, as one of the treatment options for reducing fear avoidance behavior in chronic spinal pain. Action observation involves the visualization of others performing a movement or an action to influence motor behavior positively and is mainly used in stroke rehabilitation. The paper hypothesizes that the pain-related fear of movement may be reduced through observation of others performing threatening movements successfully without displaying pain or discomfort. Action observation of others successfully executing a strenuous task may break the preexisting cognitive association between movement and pain among patients with high pain-related fear. Other possible mechanisms through which observation may influence pain-related fear could be the activation of mirror neuron systems and subsequent modulation of nociceptive information through the interconnections between the amygdala (one of the brain centers for fear), descending pain modulatory system and higher cortical centers. Few initial studies that investigated the effects of action observation on other outcomes of pain, such as pain severity are described to review the hypothesis. Considering the influence of observational learning on pain-related fear, action observation may be explored as potential adjunctive treatment to reduce fear avoidance behavior in chronic spinal pain."

Studies have shown that matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12) may be involved in the pathogenesis of IS. Because of the higher incidence of stroke in obese patients than that in normal weight people, it is urgent for obesity to forecast stroke early. Considering high levels MMP-12 in obesity, we put forward that MMP-12 may be a potential biomarker for IS in obese patients."

However, the isolation surface area of the device is invariant, while the LV size of each patient is different. Thus, we designed a novel inflatable LV partitioning device. The functional volume of our ventricular isolation device can be adjusted by inflating and exhausting the device via the stomata based on a patient’s ventricle size. The novel design could potentially reduce ventricular functional volume and improve the LV hemodynamic environment, thus resulting in favorable outcomes with reassuring safety and efficacy."

However, a complete theory on the disease mechanism of AD, including and connecting all known pathological elements of AD in a conceivable context and order of occurrence, is still lacking. In this article I describe a hypothesis on the entire pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease, based on the most wellknown pathological elements in AD, filling the gaps with hypothetical mechanisms. This proposed mechanism of derailed repair starts with an insufficiently increased level of injury signalling in the axon by ApoE, DLK, APP, BACE-1, Aβ and iPLA2β, followed by an excessive repair response induced by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, release of mitochondrial CoA and activation of palmitoylation and massive endocytosis. Excessive compounds, associated with injury signalling and repair, start to accumulate, adding to axonal injury. This increased activation of the repair mechanism causes exhaustion of the repair response by lack of mitochondrial CoA. A vicious circle of increased injury signalling and insufficient repair ensues. Based on this hypothesis, I propose possible markers for early diagnosis and disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer’s disease."

abstract = "Underlying any complex relational intersubjectivity there is an inherent urge to connect, to have proximity, to engage in an experience of interpersonal contact. The hypothesis set out here is that this most basic urge to connect is dependent on circuits based in three main components: the midbrain superior colliculi (SC), the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine systems originating in the midbrain ventral tegmental area. Firstly, there is orienting towards or away from interpersonal contact, dependent on approach and/or defensive/withdrawal areas of the SC. Secondly, there is an affective response to the contact, mediated by the PAG. Thirdly, there is an associated, affectively-loaded, seeking drive based in the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine systems. The neurochemical milieu of these dopaminergic systems is responsive to environmental factors, creating the possibility of multiple states of functioning with different affective valences, a polyvalent range of subjectively positive and negative experiences. The recognition of subtle tension changes in skeletal muscles when orienting to an affectively significant experience or event has clinical implications for processing of traumatic memories, including those of a relational/interpersonal nature. Sequences established at the brainstem level can underlie patterns of attachment responding that repeat over many years in different contexts. The interaction of the innate system for connection with that for alarm, through circuits based in the locus coeruleus, and that for defence, based in circuits through the PAG, can lay down deep patterns of emotional and energetic responses to relational stimuli. There may be simultaneous sequences for attachment approach and defensive aggression underlying relational styles that are so deep as to be seen as personality characteristics, for example, of borderline type. A clinical approach derived from these hypotheses, Deep Brain Reorienting, is briefly outlined as it provides a way to address the somatic residues of adverse interpersonal interactions underlying relational patterns and also the residual shock and horror of traumatic experiences. We suggest that the innate alarm system involving the SC and the locus coeruleus can generate a pre-affective shock while an affective shock can arise from excessive stimulation of the PAG. Clinically significant residues can be accessed through careful, mindful, attention to orienting-tension-affect-seeking sequences when the therapist and the client collaborate on eliciting and describing them."

Leukemia is the most common childhood cancer. While infections are a frequent and potentially severe complication while on treatment, less is known about the risk for infections following therapy completion. In this article, we propose that leukemia survivors might be at increased risk of infections following therapy completion than the general population, independently of potential confounders such as age, sex and Down syndrome. This association is conceivably due to several factors. First, therapy-induced immune dysfunction of both the humoral and cellular compartments appears to last for several years following anti-cancer therapy and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Second, clinical and epidemiological research has shown leukemia survivors are disproportionally affected by comorbidities related to leukemia treatment and its complications, such as diabetes and obesity, which may induce secondary immunodeficiency and infections. Last, differences in health-related behaviors between leukemia survivors and the general population (such as re-vaccination practices) may affect the baseline risk of infections. Although under-represented in the epidemiological literature as a possible late effect of childhood leukemia and its treatment, it is plausible that leukemia survivors are at increased risk of infections for several years when compared to the general population and their siblings. Further research is needed to empirically test these hypotheses."

abstract = "One of the main risk factors influencing patient survival after heart transplantation is cardiac allograft vasculopathy, the leading cause of death after the first year of transplantation. It is an entity of multifactorial origin including both humoral and cellular alloimmune responses as well as immunologic-independent factors such as graft injury, ischaemia-reperfusion injury, oxidative stress, cytomegalovirus infection, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. A fundamental characteristic of cardiac allograft vasculopathy is vascular remodelling, initially driven by the injury and apoptosis of endothelial cells, then by the migration of smooth muscle cells leading to intimal thickening and ultimately allograft vessel occlusion. Since cardiac allograft vasculopathy occurs within the first year of transplantation, prevention strategies should be implemented early. The disease could be partially prevented with overall cardiovascular risk reduction, mainly by controlling diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension that can be related to the recipient but also induced or augmented by immunosuppressive drugs used. Current therapeutic options are only partially effective in postponing the development of vascular lesions. Diabetes is an important issue in the management of patients following cardiac transplantation. Although it is highly prevalent among heart transplant recipients (23% at 1 year increasing to 37% at 5 years after the procedure), no specific therapeutic protocols have been recommended yet. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are a novel class of antidiabetic drugs that produce glycosuric and natriuretic effects by inhibiting glucose and sodium reabsorption from the renal proximal tubules and have already shown benefits in cardiovascular outcome trials. Our hypothesis is that SGLT-2 inhibitors could prevent or delay the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy targeting various mechanisms underpinning its pathogenesis due to their antidiabetic, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, antioxidative and antiapoptotic effects, as well as through amelioration of endothelial dysfunction, ischaemia-reperfusion injury and modification of neurohumoral system. All the segments of the proposed theory that could interfere with evolution of vasculopathy are discussed separately within the main text. The implications for the science if the hypothesis were to be confirmed are as follows: prolongation of lifespan in heart transplant patients with diabetes, reduction of polypragmasia in posttransplant patients while targeting several mechanisms with one drug, and the possibility of spreading the indications even to patients without diabetes."

The proposed multilevel EEG classification method consists of pre-processing, feature extraction, feature concatenation, feature selection and classification phases. In order to create levels, Tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT) is chosen and 25 frequency coefficients sub-bands are calculated by using TQWT in the pre-processing. In the feature extraction phase, quadruple symmetric pattern (QSP) is chosen as feature extractor and extracts 256 features from the raw EEG signal and the extracted 25 sub-bands. In the feature selection phase, neighborhood component analysis (NCA) is used. The 128, 256, 512 and 1024 most significant features are selected in this phase. In the classification phase, k nearest neighbors (kNN) classifier is utilized as classifier. The proposed method is tested on seven cases using Bonn EEG dataset. The proposed method achieved 98.4% success rate for 5 classes case. Therefore, our proposed method can be used in bigger datasets for more validation."

There are several risk factors that could predispose to bowel perforation, but the surgeon’s experience and the difficulty of each case play the most important role. Delayed bowel injuries happen due to conduction of electrical energy through the abdominal cavity, and in the majority of cases require reoperation. Early bowel injuries are caused by thermal injury of an electrosurgical instrument or during the insertion of the laparoscopic instruments inside the peritoneal cavity. Such injuries are recognized during the operation and are usually fixed by placing sutures. TISSEEL™ is a fibrin sealant with various applications in several surgical specialties, that simulates the latter stages of the coagulation cascade, and could be used as an alternative treatment for confined bowel perforations during laparoscopy. The efficacy of fibrin sealants in closing bowel gaps has been tested in some experimental models as well as its adequacy in enhancing bowel anastomoses performed with sutures. In addition, there is scarce evidence that fibrin sealants enhance the healing process after bowel enclosure either combined to suturing or not, which is supported by an experimental pilot study, that was conducted by our study group. The present study tries to combine all the available data in order to propose an effective alternative treatment for confined bowel injuries or controversial cases, that happen during laparoscopic surgery. In that way, every surgeon could face them even without huge expertise, conversions to open surgery would diminish and the disadvantages of suturing would disappear. Future experimental studies should be designed in the terms of extensive comparison of the two methods, with the purpose of this comparison to be tested in humans in the future."

We hypothesized that antibiotic consumption might be a contributing factor of gut microbiome dysbiosis in PD, favoring curli-producing Enterobacteria. Curli is a bacterial α-synuclein (αSyn) which is deposited first in the enteric nervous system and amyloid deposits are propagated in a prion like manner to the central nervous system. In addition, antibiotics result in a low-grade systemic inflammation, which also contributes to damage of neurons in enteric- and central nervous system. To support our hypothesis, by comparing PD prevalence change with antibiotic consumption data in EU countries, we found significant positive correlation between use narrow spectrum penicillin + penicillinase resistant penicillin and increased prevalence of the disease."

Indeed, thymus is highly sensitive to wide spectrum of stressors that initiate acute structural changes.

The aim of risk assessment is to predict how likely a woman is to develop breast cancer in the future. Several studies suggest that computerized parenchymal analysis of mammograms can be utilized as an independent imaging biomarker of breast cancer. Parenchymal analysis consists of the quantitative assessment of visual texture patterns in mammograms to infer the level of risk. In spite of substantial evidence of the association between parenchymal patterns and breast cancer risk, its biological foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we draw a hypothesis that links the field cancerization (FC) with breast cancer risk assessment based on the parenchymal analysis. In the literature, the FC is interpreted as a biochemical anomaly amplification in otherwise healthy cells due to the effect of pre-cancerous transformed cells in surrounding regions. Our hypothesis is that these biochemical anomaly amplifications change the cellular micro-environment which, in turn, alter tissue responses to X-ray radiation. As a result, it is reasonable to think that these changes influence the interaction of X-rays with parenchymal – the functional – breast tissue thus enabling cancer prediction by analyzing X-ray images of the breast. We believe that our hypothesis provides an actionable explanation as to how computerized parenchymal analysis of apparently normal mammograms can be successfully utilized for the stratification of breast cancer risk."

Herein, the fundamental assumptions of this conjecture are disputed from the thermodynamic point of view, and subjectivity is scrutinized in more details. Throughout this paper, the word “observer” implies a conscious observer."

abstract = "Thermography is an entirely non-invasive and non-contact imaging technique that is widely used in the medicinal field. Since the early detection of cancer is very important, the computer-aided system can increase the rate of diagnosis, cure, and survival of the affected person. Considering the high cost of treatment in addition to the high prevalence of affected persons, early diagnosis is the most important step in reducing the health and social complications of this disease. Currently, mammography is the main method used for screening breast cancer. However, for young woman, mammography is not recommended due to the low contrast that results from the dense breast, and alternative techniques must be considered for this purpose. Breast cancer is the main cause of cancer-related mortality among women. Early detection of cancer-especially breast cancer-will aid the treatment process. Our goal is to develop software for detecting breast cancer automatically that uses image-processing techniques and algorithms to analyze thermal breast images to detect the signs of the disease in these images, allowing the early detection of breast cancer. A new algorithm is proposed for the extraction of the breast characteristic features based on bio-data, image analysis, and image statistics. These features have been extracted from the thermal images captured by a thermal camera, and will be used to classify the breast images as normal or suspected by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) optimized by Bayes algorithm. By using our proposed algorithm, a 98.95% of accuracy rate was obtained for the thermal images in the dataset belonging to 140 individuals."

IgG antibodies to four common periodontal pathogens; Tannerella forsythia (TF), Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG), and Treponema denticola (TD) all termed collectively the “red complex”, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans(AA) were analysed. The study sample consisted of 1172 men drawn from a cohort of 6,530 men who participated in the Oslo II-study, where they provided information on medical and dental history. Of the study sample, 548 men had reported prior myocardial infarction (MI) at baseline whereas the remaining 624 men were randomly drawn from the ostensibly healthy participants for comparative analyses. Dental anamnestic information included tooth extractions and oral infections. An inverse relation was found for trend by the quartile risk level of TF predicting CVD mortality, p-value for trend = 0.017. Comparison of the first to fourth quartile of TF antibodies resulted in hazard ratio (HR) = 1.82, 95% confidence interval 1.12–2.94, p = 0.015, adjusted for age, education, diabetes, daily smoking, and systolic blood pressure. Specificity comparing decile 1 to deciles 2–10 of TF predicting mortality was 92.3%. We found an increased HR by low levels of antibodies to the bacterium T. forsythia predicting CVD mortality in a 12 ½ years follow-up in persons who had experienced an MI but not among non-MI men. This novel finding constitutes a plausible causal link between oral infections and CVD mortality."

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 62 consecutive patients administered for HBOT after the ischemic stroke episode. All patients received 60 daily hyperbaric sessions consisting of 90 min of exposure to 100% oxygen at a pressure of 0.2 MPa. The results of the treatment were assessed in correlation with SPECT/CT-detected changes of volumes of the penumbra area around the stroke zone. Patients who significantly benefitted from HBOT (n = 24) by an improvement of their clinical neurologic status and quality of life had the large penumbra zone (363 ± 20.5 ml) that was significantly diminished during HBOT. Patients who did not benefit from HBOT (n = 20) had a relatively small volume of the penumbra zone (148 ± 29.3 ml) and its further diminishing during HBOT was insignificant. The HBOT results were unclear in 18 patients with penumbra volumes between these values. These findings support our hypothesis that the large volume of the penumbra area around the stroke zone can serve as a significant predictor for positive clinical outcome following HBOT in post-stroke patients. The SPECT/CT-based assessment procedure of the volume of the penumbra may serve as an effective selecting tool when HBOT is administered for patients with ischemic stroke."

The complex process of MC development and progression seems to involve interplay between mechanical, infective, inflammatory, and degenerative processes that cannot be clearly differentiated. Based on signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans, MCs can be divided three types: Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3. Predominantly Type 1 MCs are commonly associated with chronic low back pain that is unresponsive to classic treatment options. Infection with low-virulent anaerobic microorganisms, most commonly Propionibacterium acnes, has been implicated in MC development following a disc herniation when a tear enables bacteria to enter the disc. Recent studies in patients with chronic low back pain following a lumbar disc herniation associated with Type 1 MCs have reported promising results following prolonged systemic antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, as primary or adjuvant treatment in association combination with systemic antibiotics or anti-inflammatory therapy, could offer important advantages in treating patients with suspected low-virulent disc infections due to anaerobic microorganisms associated with Type 1 MCs. We believe that hyperbaric oxygenation could contribute to faster resolution of Type 1 MCs and associated pain through multiple effects—including direct antimicrobial effects through formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), altering the favorable low oxygen tension milieu such that it becomes unfavorable for bacterial growth and survival, and anti-biofilm effects. Additionally, hyperbaric oxygenation could contribute to faster pain resolution via direct and indirect anti-inflammatory effects. As an adjuvant treatment administered in combination with systemic antibiotics, HBOT could increase the sensitivity of Propionibacterium acnes to antimicrobial drugs under hyperoxic conditions, resulting in faster MC resolution. Overall, the faster infection resolution, diminished bacterial load, and anti-inflammatory effects due to reduced cytokine expression and levels of infectious by-products could lead to faster pain resolution following HBOT, and a significant improvement of quality of life in these patients."

Although the pathophysiology of the disease is least understood, studies in animal models revealed oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation to be the major contributors. Dopamine replenishment therapy by oral administration of L-DOPA, the precursor of dopamine remains to be the therapeutic gold-standard for symptomatic treatment of PD. In addition, use of inhibitors of dopamine metabolizing enzymes (viz. monoamine oxidase-B: MAO-B; and catechol-O-methyltransferase: COMT) are the other strategies for amelioration of the motor abnormalities. Further, PD is associated with non-motor behavioural abnormalities as well, including cognitive impairment and mood disorders, which are caused due to cholinergic neurodegeneration, and thus inhibition of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is suggested. However, the currently used drugs against the three crucial enzymes (MAO-B, COMT and AChE) elicit several side effects, and thus the search for novel compounds continues, and plant-based compounds have promising potential in this regard. In the present study, we have used computational modeling to determine the efficiency of 40 plant-based natural products in inhibiting the three anti-Parkinsonian drug targets. Further, statistical analysis was performed to identify the properties of the compounds which are crucial for inhibition of the enzymes. While all the phytochemicals showed potential in inhibiting the enzymes, Rutin, Demethoxycurcumin and Acteoside were found to be most effective inhibitors of MAO-B, COMT and AChE respectively. Since most of the compounds are established anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory molecules, they are surmised to confer neuroprotection in PD, and prevent progression of the disease."

In contrast to expectations, the high frequency of schizophrenia, coupled with the existence of differing but analogous high schizophrenia risk polymorphisms across the globe, suggest that high risk schizophrenia genotypes could have experienced some positive rather than negative selection pressures. Indeed, the set of cellular and tissue processes influenced by schizophrenia – including manipulations of oligodendrocyte development, complement mediated immunity, VRK2, sulfation of heparin, IL-18, availability of glutamate, and interactions with sex hormones – overlaps with the set of cellular and tissue processes affected during Vaccinia encephalitis. Many schizophrenia-associated influences appear to oppose orthopoxvirus related influences; and many of the proteins suppressed in the schizophrenia phenotype are proteins either produced by or necessary for Vaccinia. Accounts from the early part of the 20th century affirm that Vaccinia encephalitis resembles Variola encephalitis; and genomic sequencing studies confirm significant homology between the species. On the basis of similarity of Variola to Vaccinia, and on the basis of evidence derived from studies on Vaccinia and other orthopoxviruses, it is proposed that high schizophrenia risk genotypes may have served a protective function against smallpox."

Moreover, women affected by Asherman syndrome, often struggle with fertility problems such as difficulty in spontaneous conceiving as well as complications including recurrent pregnancy loss and invasive placentation. The abnormality of the endometrial line consisting in insufficient thickness and/or endometrial trauma damaging the decidua basalis, are characteristic elements of the disease. Several studies have been conducted during the last ten years to find a solution restoring the regular endometrial line solving the fertility issue in Asherman women. Hormonal therapy as well as the use of stem cells seem to represent valid options to regenerate the endometrium opening a new scenario in the fertility treatment of these women.

Therefore, in theory, when severe bleedings occurred, the fingolimod-treated patients could not compensate for the loss of lymphocytes induced by bleedings because of the retention in the secondary lymphoid tissues. In addition, because most of the fingolimod is reported to be distributed in the erythrocytes, and the erythrocytes are the main regulator of serum sphingosine-1 phosphate concentration, bleeding may also affect metabolism of fingolimod and prognosis of multiple sclerosis. However, no study had focused the relationship between fingolimod and bleedings in multiple sclerosis. We encountered the first case in which fingolimod-associated lymphopenia worsened synchronously with gynecological bleeding, and was improved by the bleeding prophylaxis, uterine myomectomy. This case had statistically significant positive correlation between the serum hemoglobin level and peripheral lymphocyte count (P = 0.0000000507). We then had three similar cases. In these 4 correlative patients out of the 14 fingolimod-treated patients in our institution, the importance of the bleeding in fingolimod-treated patients was indicated by line graphs, point diagrams, and statistically significant correlation coefficients. Bleeding should be focused on by all of physicians treating multiple sclerosis with fingolimod."

Surgical methods are generally preferred for the treatment of the brain tumor. Recently, models of deep learning in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in the biomedical field have gained intense interest. In this study, we propose a new convolutional neural network model named BrainMRNet. This architecture is built on attention modules and hypercolumn technique; it has a residual network. Firstly, image is preprocessed in BrainMRNet. Then, this step is transferred to attention modules using image augmentation techniques for each image. Attention modules select important areas of the image and the image is transferred to convolutional layers. One of the most important techniques that the BrainMRNet model uses in the convolutional layers is hypercolumn. With the help of this technique, the features extracted from each layer of the BrainMRNet model are retained by the array structure in the last layer. The aim is to select the best and the most efficient features among the features maintained in the array. Accessible magnetic resonance images were used to detect brain tumor with the BrainMRNet model. BrainMRNet model is more successful than the pre-trained convolutional neural network models (AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGG-16) used in this study. The classification success achieved with the BrainMRNet model was 96.05%."

However, a few of them are being prescribed (at under-therapeutic doses) for sleep, in non-depressed persons, when there are relative contraindications for sedative-hypnotics. Following previous studies regarding the antinociceptive mechanisms of various antidepressants, we suggest that the involvement of the opioid system in some of the antidepressants’ mechanism of action may contribute to these medications’ use for the induction and maintenance of sleep. The mostly prescribed antidepressants for sleep are trazodone (a weak, but specific inhibitor of the synaptosomal uptake of serotonin, that also binds to alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoreceptor sites) and mirtazapine (a postsynaptic drug which enhances noradrenergic and 5-HT1A-mediated serotonergic neurotransmission via antagonism of central alpha-2-auto- and hetero-adrenoreceptors). In our previous studies when ICR mice were tested with a hotplate analgesia meter, both trazodone and mirtazapine induced, a naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effect following i.p administration. Summing up the various interactions of trazodone and mirtazapine with opioid, noradrenergic and serotonergic agonists and antagonists, we found that the antinociceptive effect of trazodone is influenced by the opioid receptor subtypes mu and delta (and a clear 5-HT mechanism of antinociception), while the antinociceptive effect of mirtazapine is mainly influenced by kappa and mu opioid receptor subtype (combined with both serotonergic and noradrenergic receptors). This opioid profile of the two drugs may be one of the explanations to their efficacy in the treatment of insomnia, when sedatives (either benzodiazepines or the non-benzodiazepine “Z-compounds”) cannot be prescribed."

Similarly, significantly fast and robust fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm (FRFCM) is a novel and fast algorithm which can display a high performance. In the present study, a brain tumor segmentation approach is proposed based on extreme learning machine and significantly fast and robust fuzzy C-means clustering algorithms (BTS-ELM-FRFCM) running on Raspberry Pi (PRI) hardware. The present study mainly aims to introduce a new segmentation system hardware containing new algorithms and offering a high level of accuracy the health sector. PRI’s are useful mobile devices due to their cost-effectiveness and satisfying hardware. 3200 training images were used to train ELM in the present study. 20 pieces of MRI images were used for testing process. Figure of merid (FOM), Jaccard similarity coefficient (JSC) and Dice indexes were used in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. In addition, the proposed method was compared with brain tumor segmentation based on support vector machine (BTS-SVM), brain tumor segmentation based on fuzzy C-means (BTS-FCM) and brain tumor segmentation based on self-organizing maps and k-means (BTS-SOM). The statistical analysis on FOM, JSC and Dice results obtained using four different approaches indicated that BTS-ELM-FRFCM displayed the highest performance. Thus, it can be concluded that the embedded system designed in the present study can perform brain tumor segmentation with a high accuracy rate."

abstract = "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a pervasive and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a gradual decline in memory, leading to significant impairments in cognition, language, and social functioning. An early-onset variant of the disease is a substantial source of morbidity in individuals with trisomy 21, the main cause of Down syndrome (DS), with clinical evidence of the disease seen in roughly one-half of those 50 years and older. Current pharmacologic therapies are limited to a handful of medications that offer only modest improvement in cognition and overall functioning. There is growing consensus in the literature that lithium salts, well-established as efficacious in the treatment of select affective disorders, may also provide neuroprotection from the development and progression of AD by targeting multiple processes implicated in the disease. These include beta-amyloid production, tau hyperphosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. While complex, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) appears to be the primary mechanism by which lithium exerts its disease-modifying effects. Reduced rates of dementia have been described in bipolar patients chronically treated with lithium. Additionally, “micro-dose” lithium (300 µg daily in one study) demonstrated stabilization of cognitive decline in AD patients with mild cognitive impairment. With encouraging data suggesting that lithium confers a clinically significant benefit in AD by impeding accumulation of the aberrant proteins central to the putative pathogenesis, it follows to reason that a population with a genetic predisposition rooted in this disease mechanism may benefit from it. After a thorough review of the literature and currently active clinical trials, no studies have looked at using lithium to slow or prevent the development of Alzheimer’s disease in the Down syndrome population. Because those with DS have such reliably high rates of developing AD, many 20–30 years younger than those in the general population, they represent an exemplary subject population to investigate the effect that lithium has on progression to disease. Furthermore, the specific factors that make those with Down syndrome prone to developing AD, including enhanced ability to synthesize beta-amyloid, mitochondrial dysfunction, and elevated oxidative stress, correlate quite well with the model by which lithium is thought to disrupt Alzheimer’s pathogenesis, making the DS population ideally suited to study this intervention. Demonstrating reduced progression of Alzheimer’s pathology with micro-dose lithium in those with trisomy 21 could function to reinforce our current understanding of the pathogenetic mechanism underlying early-onset AD, and ultimately, establish a preventative treatment for the disease."

abstract = "Introduction
Chronic illnesses are a major research challenge due to its implications in aging and quality of life of adults and elders, and it can be associated with chronic illnesses and other complaints. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of morbidities (chronic diseases with or without somatic unexplained symptoms) and somatic unexplained complaints in a hypothetical model of a multimorbidity painful syndrome. Our hypothesis is that chronic pain should be considered part of a syndrome that includes other chronic diseases and pathological states, especially conditions with somatic unexplained symptoms, and fibromyalgia is one of the evidence on that.
Methods
A pilot sample of 306 subjects was investigated in this study (254; 83.0% with chronic pain). The following features were investigated: demographic data, chronic diseases (classified as with or without somatic unexplained symptoms), medications in use, pain characteristics, fulfillment of diagnostic criteria of fibromyalgia, and somatic unexplained complaints (gastric complaints, sleep disturbances, numbness, and the dry mucosa score). Statistical analysis included descriptive data, tested with chi-square, Fisher’s exact, nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnoff, Student’s t test; data normalization with Z-score; Pearson’s coefficient for correlation, two-steps cluster classification, multivariate linear regression, LASSO and logistic regression.
Results
Both groups of chronic diseases were more prevalent in the group of patients (p < 0.001 and p = 0.013, respectively), which had higher frequency of somatic unexplained complaints (gastrointestinal, dry mucosa and numbness) than controls. There was a high positive correlation between number of pain areas and somatic unexplained symptoms score (R2 = 0.626; p < 0.001), and diseases with these symptoms were a risk factor for chronic pain (R2 = 0.5748) and fibromyalgia (AIC = 5.8952).
Conclusions
Diseases with somatic unexplained symptoms and somatic unexplained complaints were associated with chronic pain, including fibromyalgia. They may be risks factors for pain spread. The findings support that chronic pain could be further investigated as part of a multimorbid syndrome, which should be better assessed to improve aging and quality of life of patients."

Also, new findings suggest that GV plays an important role in the development of complications related to impaired glucose metabolism and oxidative stress. On the other hand, although treatment for diabetes can reduce HbA1c in a similar extent their effectiveness over GV can be radically different. Patients in the acute setting of a coronary syndrome should be strictly monitorized to maintain glucose within recommended values; avoiding values lower than 90 mg/dL (5 mmol/L) and higher than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). Also, evidence suggests the importance of not only maintaining glucose within certain values but also decreasing short-term GV as it has been associated with an increase in MACE in these patients. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) have demonstrated a decrease in GV and oxidative stress; therefore, the aim of this paper is to hypothesize the beneficial effect of GLP-1 RA in short-term GV and oxidative stress during the initial period of an ACS."

There are several indices used to differentiate IDA from β-thalassemia disease. Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a rapid, inexpensive and accessible test for the diagnosis of anemia and is used as a primary test. However, since CBC cannot fully distinguish between IDA and β-thalassemia, more advanced testing is required. These tests are not available in small centers and are performed on higher-cost devices. Moreover, it is important to differentiate between anemia and β-thalassemia medically for two reasons (IDA). First, if a patient with β-Thalassemia is diagnosed with IDA, the patient is given unnecessary iron supplementation as a result of the treatment, which is recommended by the doctor. Secondly, when the patient with β-thalassemia is diagnosed with IDA, children will have β-thalassemia patients in marriages. A decision support system to distinguish between β-Thalassemia and IDA has been developed. Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Learning Machine and Regularized Extreme Learning Machine classification algorithms were used in the proposed system.

Furthermore, oxytocin stimulates the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway (AMPK) in numerous of cell types which promotes the maintenance of different cell structures. This involves autophagic processes and, in particular, may support the renewal of mitochondria. Mitochondrial fitness may protect against oxidative and inflammatory stress - a well-documented effect of oxytocin. The combined specific trophic and protective effects oxytocin may delay several degenerative phenomena including sarcopenia, type-2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. These effects may be exerted both on a central level supporting the function and integrity of the hypothalamus and peripherally acting directly on blood vessels, pancreas, heart, skeletal muscles and adipose tissue etc. Furthermore, in the capacity of being both a hormone and neuromodulator, oxytocin interacts with numerous of regulatory mechanisms particularly the autonomic nervous system and HPA-axis which may reduce blood pressure and affect the immune function. The potential of the oxytocin system as a behavioral and molecular target for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease is discussed.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can not only offer a noninvasive treatment modality for many of these patients but can also specifically and beneficially affect involved neuronal areas. TMS stimulation of various brain areas including supplementary motor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex has been found to be beneficial in alleviating OCD symptoms in various studies. Low frequency and less often high frequency TMS of these areas has been found to be effective. High frequency deep TMS, as opposed to conventional TMS, of medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex was found to be effective and is approved as an adjunctive treatment option for severe OCD. There is no consensus as to the target stimulation site and optimal TMS stimulation protocol that can achieve maximum improvement in OCD symptoms.

The fundamental role of the dynamic semi-permeable BBB is selective and stringent transport of molecules from circulating blood and surrounding extracellular matrix across brain. Disruption of BBB has critical implications that can lead to various neuropathological disorders (NPDs) namely multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, traumatic brain injuries and neuropsychiatric disorders, etc. Therapeutic management of NPDs is still a daunting challenge in the field of neuromedicine and there is a great need for identifying novel drug targets and biomarkers. Recently, noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) have emerged as promising prognostic markers in NPDs. Piwi interacting RNAs (piRNA), a family of short noncoding RNAs which in association with PIWI-like proteins have shown to regulate neuronal function and memory formation. In addition, piRNAs are differentially expressed in Alzheimer’s brain tissues and studies also revealed the association of denovo mutations in PIWI genes with autism. Moreover, the role of PIWI-like proteins in neuronal long-term potentiation and neurite outgrowth is now evident, confirming their importance in normal physiology of the brain. Notably, we have reported the significance of PIWI-like proteins in the maintenance of Blood Retinal Barrier (BRB) and its potential role in diseases like diabetic retinopathy through modulation of tight junction proteins. Further studies in hydra and cancer cells confirmed the important function of PIWI-like proteins in the organization of tight junctions. Interestingly, we also observed that loss of PIWI-like proteins affected the activity of Ephrin receptors which have an established functional link to tight junction assembly. Collectively, the evidences profoundly support the novel concept that piRNAs/PIWI-like proteins may have a potential role on the governance of BBB by altering the tight junctions through Ephrin effectors, commotion of which could be the preceding event to various NPDs. Here, we propose PIWI-like proteins and associated piRNAs as potential restorative drug targets for combating neuropathological conditions."

abstract = "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined as elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure secondary to e.g. congenital heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It elevates right ventricular afterload that eventually leads to cor pulmonale and right heart failure. Experimental research has shown that cardioprotective strategies may improve morbidity and reduce mortality in PH patients. PH and consequent right heart failure are underpinned by dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics, and therefore mitochondrial regulators may be targeted as cardioprotective agents in PH. Mitochondrial regulators such as the metallothioneins (MTs) confer cardioprotection against several forms of heart/lung disease. Furthermore, MT expression is up or downregulated in biopsies or blood from patients with PH. However, despite the overwhelming evidence that MT has potential as cardioprotective agents in PH, MT-induced cardioprotection has not been tested in experimental models of PH. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the attributes of MTs that make them candidates for cardioprotection in PH. The hypothesis presented in this paper is that upregulation of cardiac MTs can confer cardioprotection in PH and associated right ventricular remodelling. Mainly due to their ability to detoxify the myocardium of excess heavy metals, scavenging of free radicals and modulation of mitochondrial dynamics. These processes are instrumental in the development of PH and right ventricular remodelling. With this hypothesis we propose that the upregulation of cardiac MTs can confer cardioprotection in PH by detoxifying the myocardium of heavy metals and improving cardiac mitochondrial efficiency (i.e. reducing ROS, reducing oxidative stress, and improving antioxidant capacity and improving mitochondrial respiration)."

Specific cognitive impairments, alterations in associated brain areas, a significant decrease in telomere length and expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase, oxidative and nitrosative stress, neuroinflammatory machinery, deficiency of growth factors (BDNF, IGF-1) in the brain of MDD patients resemble those that occur in aging. A decrease in the brain IGF-1 expression has been proven to disrupt mechanisms of neuroplasticity and promote cerebral inflammatory pathways, leading to morphological deterioration in the brain areas responsible for emotional and cognitive processing. From this point of view, the increase in systemic IGF-1 levels observed in most patients with MDD can be considered as a compensatory mechanism of enhancing the hypothalamic-pituitary-somatotropic axis activity in response to insufficient cerebral IGF-1 concentrations. Nevertheless, this compensatory mechanism may have a pathogenic value, improving the aging process in this patients population. This point of view has been confirmed by the evidence on the IGF-1-induced stimulation of the intracellular kinase-dependent pathways (Rho/ROCK kinase) involved in proliferation and telomere attrition in various organs, which can be considered as the underlying mechanism of aging. In line with these data, there is evidence that decreased IGF-1 signaling extends longevity in a wide range of biological species, including humans. Therefore, we hypothesized that systemic IGF-1 overexpression could be one of the pathological factors of accelerating aging in MDD patients. In this article, we analyzed data supporting this hypothesis."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between pain intensity, disability, exercise time, and computer use time and depression in office workers with nonspecific chronic low back pain.
Study Design/Setting
A cross-sectional correlational study.
Subjects
Sixty-one office workers diagnosed with nonspecific chronic low back pain
Methods
The participants' body mass index was calculated using their height and weight. The amount of time the participants spent using a computer or exercising per week was analysed. The Beck Depression Inventory was used to determine the degree of depression in the participants. The Oswestry disability index and the numeric pain rating scale were used to assess the severity and pain intensity of the participants.
Results
There was a significant correlation between the Beck Depression Inventory, the Oswestry disability index (r = 0.419, p < .05), and the computer use time (r = 0.369, p < .05) of the participants. There was a correlation between the Oswestry disability index and the numeric pain rating scale (r = 0.677, p < .01). There were significant correlations among the sub items of the Oswestry disability index with the Beck Depression Inventory, in the order of personal management activities (r = 0.539, p < .01), standing (r = 0.519, p < .01), social activities (r = 0.421, p < .05), travelling (r = 0.381, P < .05), and walking (r = 0.357, p < .05).
Conclusion
Our hypothesis as a results of this study is that the depression of office workers with non-specific chronic low back pain is correlated with the computer using time and the degree of disability. Especially among their various disabled items, personal management activities, standing, social activities, travelling, and walking is related to depression."

This procedure might associate with different complications, the most important of which is surgical site infection (SSI). Among the major SSI categories, incisional type is more common than the others. Regardless of its notable expense, the use of prophylactic wound healing technics (such as negative pressure therapy) has been advised for the patients with high SSI risk. Herein, use of patient’s own human amniotic membrane in an autologous form (as a free of charge treatment) would be suggested for prevention of SSI in CD wounds. Human amniotic membrane (hAM) has been used for treatment of acute and chronic wounds and shown to be able to reduce the infection and the pain along with accelerating the healing process. Moreover, it has been shown in a systematic review and meta-analysis that hAM could significantly improve the treatment rate in comparison to the standard of care dressing (RR 2.057–3.665, P < 0.001) during a set time of six weeks. Wound duration on the other hand, has been shown to negatively associate with SSI. Furthermore, there is data supporting the critical role of tissue perfusion in the acceleration of wound healing along with decreasing the rate of wound infection. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from their existing capillaries, is among the most crucial pathways involved in increasing tissue perfusion and wound healing. Interestingly, hAM is a rich source of pro-angiogenic and other tissue growth factors with the ability of inducing angiogenesis as well as strong antibacterial peptides. Taken together, authors suggest autologous application of hAM in the high (even low) risk patients undergoing CD in order to decrease wound related complications such as SSI and accelerate the healing time as a free wound healer. However, further randomized clinical trials are necessary."

This physical theory predicts conscious phenomena happen at all scales and differ only by the size and complexity of material organizations involved. At the scale of the human “Brain” consciousness is predicted to happen where the processing loop of activity in the Glial network interfaces with the real world input-output processing loop of the Nuronal network. This happens at the Tripartite synapses creating an intersection plenum in biological systems that produces the experience of empty space and the objects it contains. Analysis of the transmitter-receptor strengths implementing the control and feedback between the Glial and Neuronal networks indicate imbalances can be directly related to schizophrenia, mania, epilepsy, and depression. This paper addresses three topics supporting the above mechanisms for normal consciousness functioning and its medical deviations. First we preset the architecture of a pan-psychic physical theory, which supports the hypothesis that tri-partite synapses are the location of human conscious experience. Second we discuss the inner workings of the Glial network to support long term memory and control functions corresponding to the inner feeling of the “I” self.

Demyelination of white matter (WM) is one of the most common sites of abnormalities in patients with DNS, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are myelinated cells that ensure the rapid conduction of neuronal axon signals and provide the nutritional factors necessary for maintaining nerve integrity in the central nervous system (CNS). OLs readily regenerate and replace damaged myelin membranes around axons in the adult mammalian CNS following demyelination. The ability to regenerate OLs depends on the availability of precursor cells (OPCs) in the CNS of adults. Multiple injury-related signals can induce OPC expansion followed by OL differentiation, axonal contact and myelin regeneration (remyelination). Therefore, OL dysfunction and regeneration failure in the deep WM of the brain are the key pathophysiological mechanisms leading to delayed brain injury after CO poisoning. CO-induced toxicity may interfere with OL function and render OPCs unable to regenerate OLs through some unclear mechanisms, leading to progressive demyelinating damage and resulting in DNS. In the future, combination therapies to reduce OL damage and promote OPC differentiation and remyelination may be important for the prevention and treatmentof DNS after CO poisoning."

abstract = "Background
There is an increasing awareness to ankyloglossia (tongue-tie) in infants, with marked increase in its report in the medical literature. Some reports indicate increase in prevalence. Whether the increase ankyloglossia rate is a real phenomenon or merely reflects increased awareness and reports has to be determined. One explanation for the increasing ankyloglossia rates is the growing trend of breast feeding initiation, often impaired by ankyloglossia, which brings it to medical attention. We propose an alternative hypothetical explanation based on increasing utilization of periconceptional folic acid supplementation for the prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs). Inadequate folic acid supply during organogenesis impairs cell division, and the mid-line structures are at the highest risk. We postulated that higher folic acid supply during organogenesis might enhance tissue synthesis with tighter closure of mid-line structures including the lingual frenulum, resulting in ankyloglossia.
Methods
To assess this hypothesis, we undertook an observational case control study comparing folic acid utilization before pregnancy in mothers of infants with and without ankyloglossia. Infants with ankyloglossia (n = 85) were compared to a control group without ankyloglossia (n = 140).
Results
There was a slight, insignificant elevated frequency of reported utilization of folic acid (“any intake”) among mothers of infants with ankyloglossia compared with controls (74.1% and 66.4%, respectively). This difference was slightly higher, yet insignificant when folic acid intake “in most days” was considered (65.9% and 53.6%, respectively, OR = 1.67, 95%CI = 0.93–3.05, P = 0.07). In contrast, the reported intake of pre-conceptional folic acid “on a regular basis” was significantly higher among mothers of infants with ankyloglossia compared with controls (54.1% and 25.7%, respectively, OR = 3.41, 95%CI = 1.85–6.27, p < 0.0001).
Interpretation
The reported association between higher frequency of regular pre-conceptional folic acid intake and ankyloglossia, supports the hypothesis for this association. More studies are required to test this hypothesis."

abstract = "Neural tube defects (NTDs) originate from a failure of the embryonic neural tube to close. The pathogenesis of NTDs is largely unknown. Fortunately, adequate maternal folate application is known to reduce the risk of human NTDs. However, why folate reduces NTDs is largely unknown. The main cause for NTDs is the disturbance of the cell growth in the neuroepithelium. Of course, rapid cell growth needs enough synthesis of nuclei acids. Interestingly, folate is used as a source for the synthesis of nucleic acids. Furthermore, glycine cleavage system (GCS) is essential for the synthesis of nucleic acids from folate, and very strongly expressed in neuroepithelial cells, suggesting that these highly proliferating cells need enough synthesis of nuclei acids and high amounts of folate. Taken together, I speculate the following hypothesis; (1) The closure of the neural tube requires rapid growth of neuroepithelial cells. (2) High rates of nuclei acids synthesis are needed for the rapid growth. (3) GCS, which is requisite in nucleic acid synthesis from folate, is expressed very strongly and functions robustly in neuroepithelial cells. (4) Pregnant women require 5–10-fold higher amounts of folate compared to non-pregnant women. (5) So, folate-deficient situations are easy to occur in neuroepithelial cells, resulting in NTDs. (6) Thus, folate is effective to prevent NTDs."

abstract = "Despite decades of research on Parkinson’s disease (PD), the etiology of this disease remains unclear. The present manuscript introduces a new hypothesis proposing a hyper-serotonergic state as the main mechanism leading to axonal impairment both in dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons in PD. The strong serotonergic connection between the raphe nuclei and the dorsal raphe nuclei with the basal ganglia, all important brain structures associated with the pathophysiology of PD, emphasize a potential role for this neurotransmitter in PD. Importantly, a hyper-serotonergic state can lead to axonal growth impairment, an effect that seems to be selective to axons that can respond to this neurotransmitter. Serotonin seems to be a promising candidate to explain several of the poorly understood early symptoms of PD, including sleep impairment, anxiety, altered gastrointestinal motility and hallucinations. The hypothesis proposed here emphasizes that a hyper-serotonergic state would initially cause disruption of axonal transportation, an acute state in which axonal changes are reversible and the neurodegenerative process can be halted. As the hyper-serotonergic state persists, the accumulation of neurotoxic products and a sustained impairment in axonal transportation would lead to axonal death and culminate in an irreversible neurodegenerative process. The potential implications of this hypothesis are discussed, as well as how future research can be employed to further elucidate the role of serotonin on PD progression."

abstract = "Background
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can arise as a reaction to a traumatic experience. While many data concerning PTSD in severely injured patients are available, little is known about this disease in slightly injured patients after road traffic accidents. It is rather assumed that PTSD does not exist after objectively slight injuries.
Methods
In total, 36 patients (Injury Severity Score < 16) after road traffic accidents were included in this prospective cohort study. Next to demographic and accident-specific data, the PDI (Peritraumatic Distress Inventory: individual experienced distress directly during or immediately after the traumatic event), THQ (Trauma History Questionnaire) and the BDI-II (Beck Depression Inventory-II: self-report measurement tool to examine the severity of depression) were assessed immediately after trauma (t0). Six weeks (t1) and 3 months (t2) after trauma the Impact of Event Scale – Revised (IES-R), a screening instrument for PTSD, and the BDI-II were collected.
Results
Overall 2 patients showed critical measurement values in IES-R after 6 weeks. A strong correlation between PDI and IES-R at t1 and t2 could be detected (p < 0.05). Furthermore, a significant correlation of BDI-II and IES-R after 6 weeks and 3 months was found (p < 0.05). Neither age or sex showed a significant correlation to IES-R (p ≥ 0.05).
Conclusion
The present study showed that symptoms of PTSD can also occur after minor trauma. Especially high peritraumatic distress is associated with developing a PTSD. The occurrence of PTSD should be considered not only in severely injured patients, but also in slightly injured patients after road traffic accidents."

abstract = "Added sugars are ubiquitous in contemporary Western diets. Although excessive sugar consumption is now robustly associated with an array of adverse health consequences, comparatively little research has thus far addressed its impact on the risk of mental illness. But ample evidence suggests that high-dose sugar intake can perturb numerous metabolic, inflammatory, and neurobiological processes. Many such effects are of particular relevance to the onset and maintenance of depressive illness, among them: systemic inflammation, gut microbiota disruption, perturbed dopaminergic reward signaling, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and the generation of toxic advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Accordingly, we hypothesize that added dietary sugars carry the potential to increase vulnerability to major depressive disorder, particularly at high levels of consumption. The present paper: (a) summarizes the existing experimental and epidemiological research regarding sugar consumption and depression vulnerability; (b) examines the impact of sugar ingestion on known depressogenic physiological processes; and (c) outlines the clinical and theoretical implications of the apparent sugar-depression link. We conclude that the extant literature supports the hypothesized depressogenic impact of added dietary sugars, and propose that an improved understanding of the effects of sugar on body and mind may aid in the development of novel therapeutic and preventative measures for depression."

Nevertheless, the attempts to counteract COVID-19 interference with this enzymatic cascade are frustrating, and the results have thus far been inconclusive. Let's start again by considering the involved factors in an alternative way: we could postulate that COVID-19 could be more aggressive/fatal due to a high level of “basal” inflammation with low Nitric Oxide (NO) levels in hypertensive, diabetic and obese patients. Interestingly, the “protective” effects of several factors (such as estrogens) may play a role by increasing the formation of endogenous NO. From a therapeutic point of view, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors such as oral Tadalafil, could be used in order to increase the basal NO levels. In this way, we don't fight the virus, but we may be able to mitigate its effects."

Recently, it has been reported the incidence of Kawasaki-like disease among children with COVID-19. Since, children had been known to be less severely affected by the virus in part due to the higher concentration of Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptor, this presentation has emerged concerns regarding the infection of children with SARS-COV2. ACE2 has anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-proliferative characteristics through converting angiotensin (Ag)-II to Ang (1–7). ACE2 receptor is downregulated by the SARS-COV through the spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-S) via a process that is tightly coupled with Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production. TNF-α plays a key role in aneurysmal formation of coronary arteries in Kawasaki disease (KD). Affected children by COVID-19 with genetically-susceptible to KD might have genetically under-expression of ACE2 receptor that might further decrease the expression of ACE2 due to the downregulation of the receptor by the virus in these patients. It appears that TNF- α might be the cause and the consequence of the ACE2 receptor downregulation which results in arterial walls aneurysm. Conclusion: Genetically under-expression of ACE2 receptor in children with genetically-susceptible to KD who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 possibly further downregulates the ACE2 expression by TNF-α and leads to surge of inflammation including TNF-α and progression to Kawasaki-like disease."

We propose the hypothesis that MD is a migraine-related phenomenon which may have implications for future treatment options for both diseases. The association between MD and migraine is both an epidemiological and a mechanistic one, with up to 51% of individuals with MD experiencing migraine compared to 12% in the general population. The presence of endolymphatic hydrops in those with MD may be the factor that unites the two conditions, as hydropic inner ears have an impaired ability to maintain homeostasis. Migraine headaches are theorized to cause aura and symptoms via spreading cortical depression that ultimately results in substance P release, alterations in blood flow, and neurogenic inflammation. Chronically hydropic inner ears are less able to auto-regulate against the changes induced by active migraine attacks and may ultimately manifest as MD. This same vulnerability to derangements in homeostasis may also explain the common triggering factors of both MD attacks and migraine headaches, including stress, weather, and diet. Similarly, it may explain the efficacy of common treatments for both diseases: current migraine treatments such as anti-hypertensives and anti-convulsants have shown promise in managing MD. Though the etiology of both MD and migraine is likely multifactorial, further exploration of the association between the two conditions may illuminate how to best manage them in the future. MD is likely a manifestation of cochleovestibular migraine, which occurs as a result of migraine related changes in both the cochlea and vestibule."

Any progress made towards earlier diagnoses could significantly increase the chance of successful intervention for these patients. We here suggest that a wide retrospective investigation on family photo albums and home movies of children diagnosed with Autism might provide useful data about early behavioral signs of this condition. We hypothesize that an atypical trajectory in maternal cradling might be one of the early signs of interference in dyadic socio-emotional communication, and thus of potential neurodevelopmental dysfunctions."

In this study, a statistical pooling method is proposed to recognize Parkinson’s disease using the vowels. The used Parkinson's disease dataset contains the features of vowels. In the proposed method, the features of dataset are increased by applying statistical pooling method. Then, the most weighted features are selected from increased feature vector by using ReliefF. The classification is applied using the most weighted feature vector obtained. In the proposed method, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms are used. The success rate was calculated as 91.25% and 91.23% with by using SVM and KNN respectively. The proposed method has two main contributions. The first is to obtain new features from the Parkinson's acoustic dataset using the statistical pooling method. The second one is the selection of the most significant features from the many feature vectors obtained. Thus, successful results were obtained for both KNN and SVM algorithms. The comparatively results clearly show that the proposed method achieved the best success rate among the selected state-of-art methods.

Nutrition surveys reveal that amounts of copper proved insufficient for men and women in controlled studies are readily available to the general population. Observations on eye anatomy of animals deficient in copper and on decreased retinal superoxide dismutase, an enzyme dependent on copper for activity, in people with AMD support this hypothesis.

Although many people receive significant improvement in their ability to understand speech with CI, there can be variability in patients’ ability to understand open-set speech and some people may not get the expected degree of benefit after CI surgery. Currently, the patient-related factors that appear to correlate with CI outcomes are limited to age and duration of deafness. Recent work has suggested cognition, specifically, cognitive decline, may be an additional patient-related factor that contributes to poor CI outcomes. This work is based on the concept that processing of sound requires intact central processing and neurocognitive function. While the relationship between cognition and hearing is evolving, it is well-established that olfactory dysfunction is an early indicator of cognitive decline. Given this relationship, it stands to reason that olfaction may provide information regarding one’s ability to process auditory information, which relies heavily on central functioning and cognition. We hypothesize that olfaction and smell identification scores on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) may correlate with CI outcomes. More specifically, we hypothesize that olfactory dysfunction may serve as a potential predictor of poor CI outcomes. Evaluating this relationship has the potential to change the standard evaluation for CI candidates and may offer simple and efficient prognostic information for patients who are considering CI."

Regular monitoring of uncomplicated type B aortic dissection is essential because 25–30% will progress to aneurysmal form. The predictive factors of this evolution are not clearly defined, but they seem to be correlated with hemodynamic data.
Hypothesis
Our goal is to create a patient-specific and real-time model of numerical simulation of the hemodynamics of uncomplicated type B aortic dissections in order to predict the evolution of these pathologies for earlier treatment.
Method
This model consists in a coupling 0D (hydraulic-electric analogy) – 3D (CT angiography segmentation) of the aortic arch with optimization by comparison to the 2D Phase Contrast MRI data and using Reduced Order Models to drastically reduce computing times. We tested our model on a healthy and a dissected patient. Then we realized different systolic blood pressure scenarios for each case, which we compared.
Results
In the dissected patient, the blood pressure at the false lumen wall was less important than the true lumen. Furthermore, the aortic wall shear stress and the velocity fields in aorta increase at the entry and re-entry tears between the two lumens. The simulation of different blood pressures scenarios shows a decrease in all these three parameters related to the decrease of the systolic blood pressure.
Conclusion
Our model provides reliable patient-specific and real-time 3D rendering. It has also allowed us to realize different flow variation scenarios to simulate different clinical conditions and to compare them. However, the model still needs improvement in view of a daily clinical application."

abstract = "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images can be used to diagnose brain tumors. Thanks to these images, some methods have so far been proposed in order to distinguish between benign and malignant brain tumors. Many systems attempting to define these tumors are based on tissue analysis methods. However, various factors such as the quality of an MRI device, noisy images and low image resolution may decrease the quality of MRI images. To eliminate these problems, super resolution approaches are preferred as a complementary source for brain tumor images. The proposed method benefits from single image super resolution (SISR) and maximum fuzzy entropy segmentation (MFES) for brain tumor segmentation on an MRI image. Later, pre-trained ResNet architecture, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, and support vector machine (SVM) are used to perform feature extraction and classification, respectively. It was observed in experimental studies that SISR displayed a higher performance in terms of brain tumor segmentation. Similarly, it displayed a higher performance in terms of classifying brain tumor regions as well as benign and malignant brain tumors. As a result, the present study indicated that SISR yielded an accuracy rate of 95% in the diagnosis of segmented brain tumors, which exceeds brain tumor segmentation using MFES without SISR by 7.5%."

Like SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 exploits the ACE2 receptors to enter the host cells; nevertheless, recent bioinformatics insights suggest a potential interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the «moonlighting protein» CD26/DPP4, exactly how MERS-CoV works. CD26/DPP4 is overexpressed on T-helper type 1 (Th1) cells and its expression increases with aging, all factors which could well explain the Th1 immune lockdown, especially in the elderly, during fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections. Facing with this scenario, it is possible that Th1 and T-cytotoxic lymphocytes are the immune cells most affected by SARS-CoV-2, and that the immune system is forced to mount a T-helper type 2 (Th2) response, the only one still mountable, in the attempt to counteract the viral load. However, in this way, the symptomatic patient experiences all the negative effects of the Th2 response, which can seriously aggravate the clinical picture."

While most genes expressed “in the remaining” oligodendrocytes are downregulated in schizophrenia, only a few are upregulated. To the latter group belong prohibitin 2 and DISC 1, which were recently identified as mitochondria-located mitophagy receptors. Their overexpression, together with greatly reduced numbers and densities of oligodendroglial mitochondria and the structurally “normal appearance of the remaining mitochondria” in these cells as reported by Uranova’s group (Uranova et al., 2001, 2004, 2018), point to enhanced mitophagy in oligodendrocytes in schizophrenia, which is possibly even cell protective by preventing apoptosis. Since massive loss of white matter oligodendrocytes is a characteristic feature of schizophrenia, we assume that increased mitophagy is a late event in the development and/or further progression of white matter pathologic changes. Moreover, altered oligodendroglial mitophagy might in part result from antipsychotic treatment. Further studies are clearly needed to substantiate our hypothesis on enhanced mitochondrial autophagy in schizophrenia, whereby the “drug-naïve state” and the possible influence of antipsychotic treatment could be elegantly simulated using animal models of the disease."

These are physiologic responses to PS but the Ebola virus displays PS molecules on its membrane’s surface and the huge numbers of viruses cause a pathologic inflammatory cytokine storm and a hemorrhagic consumptive coagulopathy.

As a consequence, there is an urgent need to develop non addictive drug treatments with equivalent efficacy. Preclinical evidence suggests that selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are likely to be effective in ADHD, however clinical reports suggest that SSRIs are of limited therapeutic value for the treatment of ADHD. We propose that this disconnect can be explained by the pattern of drug administration in existing clinical trials (administration for short periods of time, or intermittently) leading to inadequate control of the autoregulatory processes which control 5-HT release, most notably at the level of inhibitory 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors. These autoreceptors reduce the firing rate of 5-HT neurons (limiting release) unless they are desensitised by a long term, frequent pattern of drug administration. As such, we argue that the participants in earlier trials were not administered SSRIs in a manner which realises any potential benefits of targeting 5-HT in the pharmacotherapy of ADHD. In light of this, we hypothesise that there may be under-researched potential to exploit 5-HT transmission therapeutically in ADHD, either through changing the administration regime, or by pharmacological means. Recent pharmacological research has successfully potentiated the effects of SSRIs in acute animal preparations by antagonising inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptors prior to the administration of the SSRI fluoxetine. We suggest that combination therapies linking SSRIs and 5-HT1A antagonists are a potential way forward in the development of efficacious non-addictive pharmacotherapies for ADHD."

Virchow-Robin spaces (VRS) are perivascular spaces in the brain and can normally be visualized in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Dilated VRS (dVRS) are defined on the basis of their shape, and can rarely be observed in healthy subjects, or found in various diseases. A judgement of their role may derive from the appearance of the adjacent cerebral tissue and from the clinical context.
Objective
To define a correlation between the presence of dVRS and the clinical, EEG and MRI features in children with seizures.
Materials and methods
We retrospectively analyzed the clinical, electroencephalographic and additional neuroradiological features of a group of 30 children with seizures and dVRS. Six patients repeated the MRI because of persistent drug-refractory seizures.
Results
26/30 patients had epilepsy, 4/30 patients had febrile seizures. dVRS were localized in basal ganglia in 10/30 cases and in supratentorial white matter in 16/30 cases. In 4/30 cases dilated VRS were present in both the zones. Associated MRI anomalies were reported in 11/30 patients, not necessary involving the adjacent tissue. A correlation between epileptic focus and side of VRS was present in 5/30 patients only. Unmodified VRS were observed in the 6 patients who underwent a second MRI.
Conclusion
In children with seizures, dVRS may be observed in basal ganglia or, mainly, in supratentorial white matter. However, also in this class of patients dVRS appear to be a non-progressive findings and not connected with the main seizures-related features of the patients."

Melatonin is an endogenously-produced molecule that functions as a copper chelator, a potent antioxidant, and as a suppressor of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response in both the liver and the brain, while also reducing fibrosis/cirrhosis in the liver. Melatonin is inexpensive, non-toxic and can be administered via any route.

Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a serious and common phenomenon which has been linked with emotion or affect regulation. The capacity for top-down emotion regulation has also been linked to vagal tone. Vagal tone is known to be low in groups with a propensity to engage in NSSI.
Hypothesis
Some forms of NSSI, both direct and indirect, may result in vagal stimulation. The resulting increase in vagal tone may be linked to activation of prefrontal areas and improved top-down emotion regulation. This may be a maintaining factor in NSSI.
Evaluation
Cutting with the sight of blood, the use of ligatures, eating disorders and risky sexual behaviour, behaviours that could be considered direct or indirect forms of NSSI, are all plausible methods of vagal self-stimulation.
Conclusion
NSSI may increase vagal tone. This may result in improved top down emotion regulation and result in a calmer emotional state. These vagal effects may be important maintaining factors in self-harm. This has important implications for the study and possible management of a common and serious issue."

The mechanism of lymphopenia in COVID-19 is uncertain.

Additionally, we postulate that prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is a key meditator of lymphopenia in COVID-19. First, SARS-CoV infection is known to stimulate the production of PGD2 in the airways, which inhibits the host dendritic cell response via the DP1 receptor signaling. Second, PGD2 is known to upregulate monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) via the DP2 receptor signaling in group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2). We propose targeting PGD2/DP2 signaling using a receptor antagonist such as ramatroban as an immunotherapy for immune dysfunction and lymphopenia in COVID-19 disease."

Furthermore, although there is strong support for life stress as a major predictor of MDD, there are also considerable individual differences in susceptibility and resilience that remain poorly understood. Efforts to identify specific gene-by-environment risk factors produced results that were initially encouraging, but that were not supported by later large-scale studies. Here I propose a novel mechanism that could address the “missing heritability” of MDD, the role of environmental risk factors, and individual differences in susceptibility and resilience. This mechanism focuses on a class of transposable elements, Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs), which make up approximately 8% of the human genome as the result of ancient retroviral infections that entered mammalian germ lines throughout the course of evolution. My primary hypothesis is that exposure to either exogenous viruses or traumatic experiences can activate HERVs in the brain to cause depressive (and possibly other psychiatric) symptoms. My secondary hypothesis is that individual differences in vulnerability or resilience result from the balance of activated HERVs with pathogenic versus protective functions in the brain. Future research can test these hypotheses by analysis of postmortem human brain tissue from donors with known viral or trauma histories; animal studies manipulating HERV expression; cell culture studies examining regulatory mechanisms of HERV expression; and from brain imaging studies of individuals with known HERV-expression. Such research may reveal novel functions of HERVs in neural tissue and may lead to a new generation of psychiatric interventions designed to target aberrant HERV activation."

This paper presents a hypothesis challenging this paradigm - that the carotid sinus functions by detecting oscillations at the vessel wall which result from shear stress due to vortical flow. This is contrary to conventional thinking which presumes that the carotid sinus responds to blood pressure or wall pressure. Our hypothesis is based on anatomy, physiology and physical properties of fluid which make the sinus the area of highest vorticity. Utilizing magnetic resonance angiograms of undiseased carotid vessels, we computed the oscillatory shear index (OSI) via a computational fluid dynamics simulation of flow. This region of highest OSI coincides with the area where the nerve to the carotid sinus lies within the vessel wall. Accordingly, the hypothesis is that the carotid sinus acts as a mechanotransducer of wall shear stress oscillation and not as a baroreceptor."

However, the National Institutes of Health official guidance states that the use of Scutellaria “has been implicated in rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury” and that “the onset of symptoms and jaundice occurred within 6–24 weeks of starting skullcap, and the serum enzyme pattern was typically hepatocellular”, with marked increases in serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels. Careful perusal of all such published case reports showed that in each case the patient was concurrently taking at least one other supplement which had an established association with hepatic dysfunction. The authors hypothesised that long-term supplementation with Scutellaria baicalensis does not lead to hepatic dysfunction. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by assessing liver function before and after starting supplementation with Scutellaria baicalensis. Pre- and post-supplementation serum assays of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin were carried out in 17 patients (16 female) of average age 38.6 (standard error 4.4) years who had each taken 1335 mg dried root daily for an average of 444 (71) days. The mean baseline versus follow-up values for each liver function test were: alanine transaminase: 25.7 (2.6) IU/L v. 25.1 (1.7) IU/L; aspartate transaminase: 22.1 (1.1) IU/L v. 23.5 (1.3) IU/L; alkaline phosphatase: 63.7 (4.6) IU/L v. 63.3 (3.9) IU/L; and bilirubin: 6.1 (0.6) μM v. 6.0 (0.7) μM. None of these changes was statistically significant; indeed, three of the four parameters showed a non-significant decrease over time. Furthermore, none manifested clinical symptoms or signs of hepatic dysfunction during Scutellaria supplementation. These results suggest that daily intake of a relatively high level of Scutellaria baicalensis for over a year is not associated with any biochemical or clinical evidence of hepatic dysfunction. Indeed, Scutellaria baicalensis has been shown in murine experiments to have hepatoprotective actions."

Grip and pinch strength are relevant functional variables for various activities of daily life and are related to the quality of life of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).
Objective
The main aim was to analyze the relationship between grip and pinch strength and the educational level in women with CTS.
Study design
Cross-sectional study.
Methods
Thirty-one female patients with CTS awaiting surgery were assigned to the low education group if they only had primary education level (completed or not) and the high education group for those having higher education level. The assessments included: grip strength, pinch strength, Visual Analogue Scale, Quick DASH Questionnaire, Pain Catastrophizing Scale and the Tampa scale of kinesiophobia.
Results
A statistically significant difference was obtained for grip strength (p = 0.027), pinch strength (p = 0.002) and catastrophizing (p = 0.038) between the two groups. No significant differences were observed for the other variables studied (p < 0.05). Grip strength was not related to individual factors: type of work, age, body mass index.
Conclusion
CTS patients with a low educational level exhibited reduced grip and pinch strength and more catastrophic thinking. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms involved in the loss of strength in patients with lower educational levels."

The study employed 10 different FS algorithms to reduce the classification cost by using fewer features and to improve the classification performance of the model by removing the irrelevant features. In doing so, the classification performance of each FS algorithm on each EEG channel difference was also evaluated. The dataset used in the study included EEG measurements and visual EEG annotations that were recorded from 79 term neonates. Multiple features were extracted from each channel difference using the Feature extraction (FE). Subsequently, a novel feature subset was generated for the classification using FS algorithms. The classification performance of each selected feature was assessed based on multiple criteria. The use of features extracted by the combined use of FS algorithms showed higher performance compared to the use of all features. In this study, 18 channel differences were analyzed. Better performance was achieved by using 3 of the selected 14 features or 2 of the selected features. The C4-P4 channel difference showed the highest classification performance (98.8%) among all channel differences. In the literature, FE has already been performed for the classification of the dataset used in the present study. The primary aim of the present study was to perform the same classification with the minimum number of features. The results indicated that feature reduction reduced the cost and also improved the performance of the classification. These results seem to be highly promising and thus can be used in clinical practice and shed light for future studies."

The echinoderms, which share the earliest common ancestor with us, began to protect the body by making an endoskeleton out of calcium and carbon dioxide dissolved in the sea. In subsequent vertebrates, aerobic respiration supported strong muscle activity, but an occasional shortage of oxygen led to low pH due to the accumulation of lactate produced by anaerobic respiration, increasing the risk of melting bones composed of calcium carbonate. So, all vertebrates used calcium phosphate to increase bone strength, having a stronger ionic bonding than calcium carbonate. But otoliths, which are in the inner ear and thereby not connected to muscles, still use calcium carbonate. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a disorder in which otoliths detached from the utricle enter the semicircular canals and cause a sense of rotation. Otoliths, the calcium carbonate ear bones retaining a long evolutionary history, can be easily broken at low pH. During sleep, shallow breathing produces mild respiratory acidosis and low pH in the blood. Since otoliths are corroded at low pH during nighttime, BPPV occurs frequently in the morning. In addition, diabetes mellitus or gout often decreases pH in the blood and increases the occurrence of BPPV."

Through this observation, this study introduces a new CNN model, namely Densely Connected and Concatenated Multi Encoder-Decoder (DCCMED) network. DCCMED contains concatenated multi encoder-decoder CNNs and connects certain layers to the corresponding input of the subsequent encoder-decoder block in a feed-forward fashion, for retinal vessel extraction from fundus image. The DCCMED model has assertive aspects such as reducing pixel-vanishing and encouraging features reuse. A patch-based data augmentation strategy is also developed for the training of the proposed DCCMED model that increases the generalization ability of the network. Experiments are carried out on two publicly available datasets, namely Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE) and Structured Analysis of the Retina (STARE). Evaluation criterions such as sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), accuracy (Acc), dice and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) are used for verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method. The obtained results are compared with several supervised and unsupervised state-of-the-art methods based on AUC scores. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed DCCMED model yields the best performance compared with the-state-of-the-art methods according to accuracy and AUC scores."

This hypothesis is based on two facts: a) in women with PCOS is found sympathetic hyperactivity and b) recent data showing a stimulatory effect of the sympathetic system on cancer initiation, progression, and development of metastases. If our hypothesis is correct, then new preventive approaches might be used to reduce cancer risk in women with PCOS."

Subjects with CTE can have a wide range of emotional, cognitive and physical symptoms. The cognitive group patients had a significantly higher probability of developing dementia in later years. Currently, there are no disease modifying regimen for CTE. Timely intervention of head blow could diminish the development of CTE. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) is a common adjunct used to promote bone healing for fresh fracture. Recent reports suggest that LIPUS can noninvasively modulate the cortical function and have neuroprotective effect in various animal models of traumatic brain injury, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease and major depressive disorder. The multifunctional mechanisms of LIPUS neuroprotective effect include several trophic factor stimulations, anti-inflammatory properties and reduction of brain edema. From the above evidence, LIPUS intervention could be a strategy for the prevention of the clinical CTE sequelae of repetitive head blows. We hypothesized that due to its neuroprotective effects, the non-invasive and easy-to-use method of LIPUS brain stimulation could have a preventive effect on players who have head blows during the match. The development of a time sensitive protocol, resembling the therapeutic algorithm for traumatic brain injury, would potentially prevent the development of subsequent CTE adverse outcome. Further long-term longitudinal studies of LIPUS stimulation are warranted to verify the prevention efficacy of this intervention for CTE."

In a Charcot foot, there is movement between bones. In an attempt to prevent this movement, the small muscles of the foot contract continuously when the foot is weight bearing. This contraction takes energy in the form of ATP. However, the reduction of glucose transport into the muscle cells due to insulin resistance / insufficiency, leads to reduction in the ATP producing capacity of the mitochondria. The ATP depletion affects the cell membrane gradient leading to mitochondrial and cellular swelling. These early cellular changes could then be picked up with MR imaging as muscle oedema."

Patients often have underlying risk factors for poor healing and the procedure itself often reduces vascularity to the anterior chest with internal mammary artery (IMA) dissection. Currently unrelated is the surgical delay procedure. It is a well-established technique for augmenting vascularity and ultimatelytissue survival. It involves partial disruption of the blood supply to a flap for a period of time prior to fully elevating the flap (usually between 3 and 21 days). Recently, endoscopic robotic IMA dissection has become possible as a part of totally endoscopic CABGs for left-sided vessel disease. We are proposing a new technique, using surgical delay for patients who require open sternotomies for CABGS to reduce the rate of postoperative sternal wound complications. To delay the CABG, the majority of a robotic internal IMA dissectionwould be performed prior to an open CABG via a midline sternotomy. We hypothesize that this may decrease sternal wound complication rates. Potential pitfalls include consequences of disrupting the normal anatomic location of the IMAs and causing inflammation before the open CABG. Animal models will be the next step, as they will evaluate the feasibility of the delay as well as help to determine the optimal timing for the procedure."

We hypothesize that regulation of m6A mRNA methylation levels of cardioprotective mRNAs will result in stable expression of the cardioprotective proteins, rendering ischemic cardiac preconditioning more robust and reducing infarct size. To test this hypothesis, we will test the effects of introducing m6A methylases/demethylases into ischemic preconditioned/post conditioned hearts and subjecting them to myocardial infarction. We will assess the half-life of key cardioprotective mRNAs (e.g., eNOS, SOD, and HO-1) and cardiac apoptosis to determine which m6A methylases/demethylases have a synergistic effect on cardiac preconditioning."

abstract = "Atherosclerosis develops gradually as a subclinical condition and eventually becomes clinically apparent as heart disease or stroke. The degree of decreased arterial compliance affects both pulse pressure (PP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). These relations would be clear in the distal periphery. We propose that the ankle PP/ankle DBP ratio (APPD) can uncover the ongoing subclinical vascular risk. Based on the elastic chamber theory, APPD = (Cs-Cd)/(Cd-C0) in which Cs, Cd, and C0 represent arterial compliance at systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and zero-pressure. For a given ventricular ejection, the value of Cs-Cd (i.e. PP) positively differs in the same person from brachium to ankle based on the distance from the heart, degree of arterial stiffness, and the local arterial function. On the other hand, the decreased arterial compliance increases the speed of reflected pulse waves to the heart resulting in earlier ventricular ejection by which the value of Cd-C0 (i.e. DBP) decreases over the arterial tree. In the same person, studies of ankle-brachial blood pressure (BP) differences revealed that PP greatly differed from brachium to ankle while DBPs were of minimal change or almost equivalent. However, DBP would be lower in those with arterial stiffness compared to others of the same age. Accordingly, APPD increases as arterial compliance decreases. Moreover, decreased APPD after a certain limit would reflect either local arterial stenosis or a compromised left ventricular function. When we divided ankle PP by ankle DBP, we could control the diversity of ankle PP as being not related to the BP level and possibly fluctuates in the same person. Additionally, APPD will indicate the extra rapid reflected pulse wave given in decreased DBP. Since increased common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a well-established marker of atherosclerosis, we initially studied 115 subjects apparently free form vascular diseases and had not taken a drug that can affect BP on the day of the study, aged 40–60 years, without a history of stroke, coronary heart disease or peripheral vascular disease to evaluate the relation between APPD and CIMT. The association was statistically significant even after adjusting for age, sex and important covariates and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.902 ± 0.031. Therefore, the potential applicability of APPD as a tool for subclinical atherosclerosis was greatly proven."

During CEA cerebrovascular hemoglobin oxygen saturation decreases and when this decrease reaches critical levels it leads to cerebral hypoxia that causes neuronal damage. One of the proposed mechanism that affects changes during CEA and contribute to acute brain ischemia (ABI) is oxidative stress. The increased production of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species during ABI may cause an unregulated inflammatory response and further lead to structural and functional injury of neurons. Antioxidant activity are involved in the protection against neuronal damage after cerebral ischemia. We hypothesized that neuronal injury and poor outcomes in patients undergoing CEA may be results of oxidative stress that disturbed function of antioxidant enzymes and contributed to the DNA damage in lymphocytes."

Tamoxifen and other anti-estrogen drugs are used in breast cancer patients who have a positive estrogen receptor (ER). While angiotensin II plays a key role in breast cancer etiology and causes tamoxifen resistance, angiotensin 1–7 has been reported to may reduce the spread and invasion of breast cancer. During the COVID-19 infection, the virus blocks ACE2, and angiotensin 1–7 production discontinued. Angiotensin III production may increase as angiotensin II destruction is reduced. Thus, aminopeptidase upregulation may occur. Increased aminopeptidase may develop resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Estrogen can have a protective effect against COVID-19. Estrogen increase causes ER-α upregulation in T lymphocytes. Thus, estrogen increases the release of interferon I and III from T lymphocytes. Increasing interferon I and III alleviates COVID-19 infection. Tamoxifen treatment causes down-regulation, mutation, or loss in estrogen receptors. In the long-term use of tamoxifen, its effects on estrogen receptors can be permanent. Thus, since estrogen receptors are damaged or downregulated, estrogen may not act by binding to these receptors. Tamoxifen is a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, independent of its effect on estrogen receptors. It suppresses T cell functions and interferon release. We think tamoxifen may increase the COVID-19 risk due to its antiestrogen and P-glycoprotein inhibitory effects."

Increasing the resolution of a vital image in terms of the information it contains such as brain magnetic resonance image (MRI), makes the important information in the MRI image more visible and clearer. Thus, it is provided that the borders of the tumors in the related image are found more successfully. In this study, brain tumor detection based on fuzzy C-means with super-resolution and convolutional neural networks with extreme learning machine algorithms (SR-FCM-CNN) approach has been proposed. The aim of this study has been segmented the tumors in high performance by using Super Resolution Fuzzy-C-Means (SR-FCM) approach for tumor detection from brain MR images. Afterward, feature extraction and pretrained SqueezeNet architecture from convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and classification process with extreme learning machine (ELM) were performed. In the experimental studies, it has been determined that brain tumors have been better segmented and removed using SR-FCM method. Using the SquezeeNet architecture, features were extracted from a smaller neural network model with fewer parameters. In the proposed method, 98.33% accuracy rate has been detected in the diagnosis of segmented brain tumors using SR-FCM. This rate is greater 10% than the rate of recognition of brain tumors segmented with fuzzy C-means (FCM) without SR."

The concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), a condition of abnormal proliferation of the small intestine microbiota, has been proposed as a form of small intestine dysbiosis. In Parkinson’s disease patients, weight loss and metabolic disorders such as lipid abnormalities are frequently encountered. This was a prospective investigation of the presence of SIBO using the lactulose breath test, Parkinson’s disease symptoms, medications, abdominal symptoms, and blood data involving 39 Parkinson’s disease patients. Of the 39 patients, 19 were positive for SIBO, 16 were negative, and 4 were equivocal. SIBO-positive patients had a significantly smaller dopaminergic drug load (dopamine replacement of Parkinson’s disease drug potency) (P = 0.009) and significantly lower serum triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.024) and total bilirubin (P = 0.019) levels. No relationship was seen between the presence or absence of SIBO and motor or abdominal symptoms. The following hypothesis was developed with regard to the possibility that intestinal bacterial overgrowth has various effects that are exhibited via bile acid metabolism in Parkinson’s disease patients. Serum bilirubin levels become higher as bilirubin metabolism declines with decreases in the intestinal bacteria. At the same time, bile acid is broken down due to increased intestinal bacteria, and lipid absorption decreases. This induces low serum TG levels and leads to weight loss. By a similar mechanism, there is less absorption of vitamin D as bile acid levels decrease, leading to osteoporosis and fractures. The possibility that some of the non-motor manifestations accompanying Parkinson’s disease are caused by intestinal dysbiosis needs to be considered."

In aging, there is an alteration in microbiota, gut microbiota diversity is perturbed with an increase in pathogenic bacteria at the expense of beneficial ones. Dysbiosis may lead to chronic inflammation, and a decrease in bacteria metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids which have been related to an upregulation of neurotrophic factors.

Having the ability to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli in addition to the biochemical ones makes them crucial for such a composite-like and tension-preserving tissue. Over the last decade, the investigation of the role of these cells in tumor progression was a hot topic of research in tumor biology. Literatures almost unanimously describe the re-education of stromal fibroblasts by tumor cells in favor of tumor progression, which resulted in the birth of a new nomenclature, the cancer-associated fibroblasts. On the other hand, some studies reported anti-tumor roles for these cells. Herein, author suggests that the previously described pro-migratory and pro-contractile contexts, which respectively results in divergent and convergent distribution of fibroblasts by changing Rho-Rac1 balance, could be applied for cancer-associated fibroblasts as well. Based on this proposed concept, stromal fibroblasts could represent different roles, either pro-tumor or anti-tumor, during the course of tumor progression. In the earlier phases, they tend to assemble along tumor-stroma interface in the form of tumor capsules in order to resist tumor growth and to maintain tensional homeostasis in stroma. But in later phases, after being chronically subjected to tumor-induced chemical and mechanical stimuli, they will gradually lose their substantial abilities to oppose tumor expansion and, in contrary, will promote tumorigenesis. In summary, this paper redefines tumor capsule from chemical and mechanical standpoints as Rho-dependent clustering of cancer-associated fibroblasts in favor of tensional homeostasis. Furthermore, it proposes that stromal fibroblasts will undergo some irreversible epigenetic changes in Rac1- and Rho-related proteins through tumor-stroma crosstalk, which irreversibly diminish their ability of capsule formation. Finally, the author discusses the possible researches helping us to assess the proposed concept and its clinical implications."

However, most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with oral vitamin D supplementation give mixed results or are inconclusive. It has been said that “discovery commences with the awareness of anomaly”. The “anomaly” between our preclinical and clinical data provides the opportunity to propose an alternative paradigm to the vitamin D endocrine system: the vitamin D autacoid paradigm. In the vitamin D autacoid paradigm, the extra-skeletal effects of vitamin D depend on the tissue reserves of vitamin D metabolites. These vitamin D autacoid systems are inducible oscillatory ecosystems in which 1,25D is produced, acts and is inactivated locally. In the vitamin D autacoid paradigm, attaining adequacy of vitamin D in the systemic circulation is necessary but not sufficient; we must also ensure the repletion of the tissue stores. The co-existence of two different vitamin D systems, endocrine and autacoid, with different functions and regulations leads to “significant shifts in the criteria determining the legitimacy both of problems and of proposed solutions”. With respect to our clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation for unconventional effects, the proposed solution is administering and quantifying vitamin D metabolites directly to the target tissue."

Ex hypothesi, we predict a priori that controlled psilocybin interventions exert quantifiable positive impact on leucocyte telomere length (telomeres are a robust predictor of mortality and multifarious aging-related diseases). Our hypothesising follows the Popperian logic of scientific discovery, viz., bold (and refutable) conjectures form the very foundation of scientific progress. The ‘psilocybin-telomere hypothesis‘ is formalised as a logically valid deductive (syllogistic) argument and we provide substantial evidence to support the underlying premises. Impetus for our theorising derives from a plurality of converging empirical sources indicating that psilocybin has persistent beneficial effects on various aspects of mental health (e.g., in the context of depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, addiction, etc.). Additional support is based on a large corpus of studies that establish reliable correlations between mental health and telomere attrition (improved mental health is generally correlated with longer telomeres). Another pertinent component of our argument is based on recent studies which demonstrate that “meditative states of consciousness” provide beneficial effects on genetic aging. Similarly, psilocybin can induce states of consciousness that are neurophysiologically and phenomenologically significantly congruent with meditative states. Furthermore, prior research has demonstrated that a single dose of psilocybin can occasion life-changing transformative experiences (≈ 70% of healthy volunteers rate their experience with psilocybin amongst the five personally most meaningful lifetime events, viz., ranked next to giving birth to a child or losing a loved one). We postulate that these profound psychological events leave quantifiable marks at the molecular genetic/epigenetic level. Given the ubiquitous availability and cost effectiveness of telomere length assays, we suggest that quantitative telomere analysis should be regularly included in future psilocybin studies as an adjunctive biological marker (i.e., to facilitate scientific consilience via methodological triangulation). In order to substantiate the ‘psilocybin-telomere hypothesis’ potential neuropsychopharmacological, endocrinological, and genetic mechanisms of action are discussed (e.g., HPA-axis reactivity, hippocampal neurogenesis, neurotropic growth factors such as BDNF, 5-HT2A receptor agonism, neuroplasticity/synaptoplasticity, brain-wide alterations in neuronal functional connectivity density, involvement of the SLC6A4 serotonin transporter gene, inter alia). The proposed research agenda is thus intrinsically highly interdisciplinary, and it has deep ramifications from a philosophy of science perspective as it connects the epistemic level (qualitative experiential phenomenology) with the ontic level (quantitative molecular genetics) of analysis. In the long term, multidisciplinary and innovative investigations of the ‘psilocybin-telomere hypothesis‘ could contribute to the improvement of senotherapeutic psychological interventions and the identification of novel geroprotective and neuroprotective/restorative pharmaceutical targets to decelerate genetic aging and improve well-being and quality of life during the aging process."

abstract = "Background
Minimally invasive mitral valve repair or replacement (MIMVR) approaches have been increasingly adopted for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, allowing a shorter recovery time and improving postoperative quality of life. However, inadequate positioning of the right mini thoracotomy access (working port) translates into suboptimal exposure, prolonged operative times and, potentially, reduction in the quality of mitral repair. At present, we are missing tools to further improve the positioning of the working port in order to ameliorate surgical exposure in a patient- specific fashion.
Methods and evaluation of the hypothesis
We hypothesized that computation of relevant anatomical measurements from preoperative CT scans in patients undergoing MIMVR may provide patient-specific information in order to propose the surgical access that best fits to the patient’s morphology. We hypothesized that this may systematize optimal mitral valve exposure, facilitating the procedure and potentially ameliorating the outcomes. We also hypothesized that preoperative simulation of the working port site and surgical instruments’ insertion using a three-dimensional virtual model of the patient is feasible and may help in the customization of ports positioning. The hypothesis was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team including cardiac surgeons, experts in medical image processing and biomedical engineers. CT scans of 14 patients undergoing MIMVR were segmented to visualize 3D chest bones and heart structures meshes. The mitral valve annulus is pointed manually by the expert or extracted automatically when contrast-enhanced CT scan was available. The valve plane was then calculated and the optimal incision location analyzed according to a) the perpendicularity and b) the distance between the intercostal spaces and the valve plane. An angle-chart representation for the 4th, 5th and 6th intercostal spaces and a color map illustrating the distance between the skin and the mitral valve were created. We started the development of a simulation tool for preoperative planning using 3D Slicer software.
Conclusions
Several patient-specific factors (including the orientation of the mitral valve plane and the morphology of the chest cage) may influence the performance of a MIMVR procedure, but they are not quantitatively considered in the current planning strategy. We suggest that the clinical results of MIMVR can be improved through preoperative virtual simulation and computer-assisted surgery (through determination of working port and surgical instruments insertion positioning). Further research is justified and the development of a software tool for clinical evaluation is warranted to verify the current hypothesis."

A typical example is medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) which can cause massive necrosis and defects of the jaws. Thus, the dosage and effects of anti-osteoporosis drugs should be re-examined. Our hypothesis is that primary moderate osteoporosis itself is beneficial for bones and should not be excessively treated other than vitamin D, calcium supplementation and functional exercises. The self-repair and anti-infection abilities of bone depend on its organic tissues including stem cells, blood vessels, osteoclastic and osteogenic factors in bone, which jointly fight against invading pathogens and repair bone damage. Recent evidence supports age-related changes in mesenchymal stem cell including loss of self-renewal and increases in senescent cell numbers. Thus, the number of MSCs and vessels need to be increased to achieve functions similar to those in young people. This requires dissolving a portion of inorganic materials and providing extra space to hold more cells and blood vessels. In contrast, anti-osteoporosis drugs prevent bone destruction, and increase mineralization that occupies the space of organic materials, reduces bone immunity and self-repair. Moreover, long term use of anti-osteoporosis drugs also have negative effects on long bones and cartilages. Therefore, moderate age-related osteoporosis is natural in humans to protect bones. Excessive treatment of osteoporosis weakens immunity and self-repair."

abstract = "Vectorcardiogram (VCG) represents the trajectory of the tip of cardiac vectors in three dimensional space with varying time. It is a recurring, near-periodic pattern of cardiac dynamics that is constructed by drawing the instantaneous vectors from a zero reference point according to direction, magnitude and polarity in the space. Being a three dimensional entity, it is more informative and more sensitive than conventional ECG as an evaluation tool of the physiology of cardiac dynamics, because of its extra degree of freedom. Accordingly, it is possible to find out even a minute and early electrophysiological alteration in diseases. Each cardiac cycle primarily consists of three loops in VCG corresponding to P, QRS, and T wave activities. The morphological assessment of the QRS loop was carried out in three dimensional space in order to analyze the spatial vectors of the ventricles and their patho-physiological correlation in various cardiac diseases. Spatial Velocity (SV) is a virtual velocity that represents the rate of movement of the tip of the cardiac vector through space, coordinated by three orthogonal leads, and can be estimated by using simple mathematical formula. It is the rate of change in amplitude and the directionality of instantaneous vectors in seriatim in the three dimensional space to quantify their the temporo-spatial characteristic pattern. We propose to evaluate this novel VCG descriptor SV, in normal individuals and patients of ventricular dysfunction. The possible mechanisms consistent with the patho-physiological basis of ventricular dysfunction or heart failure with altered SV would enrich the current understanding of the disease. Heart failure is the final common pathway of multitude of cardiac pathologies. Despite etiological heterogeneity, there are common mechanisms involved in the complex electrophysiological alteration of the failing myocardium. The changes observed as a consequence of ventricular dysfunction involve ion channel remodeling, intercellular uncoupling, myocardial ischemia, alterations in calcium handling, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, the presence of scars, activation of the sympathetic & the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, dilatation as well as stretch of viscous etc. The source modulation of the depolarization wave and its propagation in the heart and body fluid volume conductor also influence the visual pattern of cardiac vectors. In addition, patients with heart failure receive pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies that also influence the electrophysiological changes. We hypothesize that the spatial velocity of ventricular depolarization and repolarization vectors of the VCG loop alters with a characteristic pattern in the patients with ventricular dysfunction and can differentiate healthy individuals from patients with ventricular dysfunction and also differentiate various categories, gradations and severity stratifications of the patients with ventricular dysfunction."

Despite being a near universal problem in adolescence, the reason why such troublesome sebaceous glands exist at all is not well understood. Some interesting theories have been postulated including roles for skin maintenance, immunological function and perhaps even pheromones, but pre-pubertal skin which has sebaceous glands that are largely inactive, is healthy. Dystocia, obstructed labour, is unique to humans and no other animal has as much trouble giving birth. This is thought to reflect the relatively large human foetal head and proportionally small maternal pelvis. Noting the high density of sebaceous glands on the face, chest and back; these are exactly the same structures that pose the greatest obstruction during childbirth. Sebaceous glands develop after the fourth month of gestation and are large and well-developed at birth. Sebum production is also relatively high at birth. Having extra lubrication at these sites would help make the baby more slippery for birth conferring a selective advantage to successful delivery, as does the presence of the vernix caseosa, a white creamy substance, unique to humans that coats new-born infants. It is proposed that the sebaceous glands that cause acne are present on the face and forehead as they confer a selective advantage by ‘lubricating’ the widest parts of the new born baby to ease the passage of childbirth. Later in life, sebaceous glands may be inappropriately and pathologically primed, driven by a combination of hormones, diet and lifestyle to create acne."

There are five types of WBC. These are called Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils and Neutrophils. The number of WBC types and the total number of WBCs provide important information about our health status. Diseases such as leukemia, AIDS, autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, blood diseases can be diagnosed based on the number of WBCs. In this study, a computer-aided automated system that can easily identify and locate WBC types in blood images has been proposed. Current blood test devices usually detect WBCs with traditional image processing methods such as preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Deep learning methodology is superior to traditional image processing methods in literature. In addition, traditional methods require the appearance of the whole object to be able to recognize objects. Contrary to traditional methods, convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning architecture, can extract features from a part of an object and perform object recognition. In this case, a CNN-based system shows a higher performance in recognizing partially visible cells for reasons such as overlap or only partial visibility of the image. Therefore, it has been the motivation of this study to increase the performance of existing blood test devices with deep learning method. Blood cells have been identified and classified by Regional Based Convolutional Neural Networks. Designed architectures have been trained and tested by combining BCCD data set and LISC data set. Regional Convolutional Neural Networks (R – CNN) has been used as a methodology. In this way, different cell types within the same image have been classified simultaneously with a detector. While training CNN which is the basis of R – CNN architecture; AlexNet, VGG16, GoogLeNet, ResNet50 architectures have been tested with full learning and transfer learning. At the end of the study, the system has showed 100% success in determining WBC cells. ResNet50, one of the CNN architectures, has showed the best performance with transfer learning. Cell types of Lymphocyte were determined with 99.52% accuracy rate, Monocyte with 98.40% accuracy rate, Basophil with 98.48% accuracy rate, Eosinophil with 96.16% accuracy rate and Neutrophil with 95.04% accuracy rate."

In addition to reduced cardiac output, a series of impairments in pulmonary and vascular systems leads to decreases in oxygen delivery and availability in locomotor muscles. This contributes to exercise intolerance in heart failure. The oxy-hemoglobin dissociation curve is essentially a graph illustrating the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2, X-axis) and oxygen saturation (SaO2, Y-axis) of hemoglobin. The rightward shift of the curve indicates that hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen decreases and in turn, it may allow the release of more oxygen to tissues. In the present study, we discuss the pathophysiological impairment, which causes exercise intolerance in heart failure patients and suggest a strategy to improve exercise capacity without altering cardiac output via modulating the oxy-hemoglobin dissociation curve."

NSAIDs decrease prostaglandin synthesis through cyclooxygenase inhibition (COX-1 or COX-2). The effects of NSAIDs on survival and outcomes from global ischemia reperfusion events and specifically from cardiac arrest (CA) remain controversial. We hypothesized that NSAIDs prior to global whole-body ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury impairs survival and outcomes. We explored this hypothesis in our swine model of Cardiac Arrest (CA) which involves global I/R with pretreatment using a predominantly COX-1 inhibitor (Indomethacin [COX-1/min COX-2 Inh], a COX-2 Inhibitor [COX-2-Inh, (Celecoxib)] or placebo control. We determined the effects of each inhibitor on a) survival, b) myocardial injury biomarker (Troponin 1), and c) Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) injury marker (heart rate variability [HRV]) up to 3 h after resuscitation. There were no survivals in COX-1/min COX-2-Inh pretreated animals and, 87% survived in both COX-2 Inhibited and control animals. COX-2 Inh pretreated animals had an 1800 fold increase of Troponin 1 compared to baseline whereas control animals had a 90 fold increase (p < 0.001). These results along with literature review of focal I/R in animal models with COX-2 overexpression, human studies of CA, and post myocardial infarction treatment with NSAIDs, support the hypothesis that NSAIDs prior to an I/R event impairs survival and outcomes. Specifically, predominantly COX-1 inhibition impairs survival, and COX-2 inhibition induces myocardial damage, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and increases the risk for all-cause mortality and morbidity in humans post-MI which has significant implications for the nearly 10% of the population who are taking NSAIDs."

abstract = "The precise means whereby mammals recognize and respond to changing day length so as to adjust their physiology to the seasons (photoperiodism) remains enigmatic. We present a new hypothesis according to which aerobic glycolysis (AG) within selected astrocytic syncytia plays a central role in photoperiodism. We focus on the response of the mammal breeding in longer days (LD) to the shorter days (SD) of autumn. It is posited that AG in the brain of the SD organism is activated within a specified circuitry and temporal window. The circuitry involves regions targeted by the medullary norepinephrine (NE) system including but not limited to the anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; the temporal window in question is defined by the autumnal extension of darkness into a segment of the organism’s circadian activity cycle that was illuminated on the previous day. Lactate generated from glucose during SD serves primarily as a signaling entity as opposed to a fuel, instructing astrocytes, for example, gradually to replace the LD genome with one specific to SD. The requirement to provision glucose to the brain for AG through SD accounts for the frequent findings of mild autumnal hyperglycemia and elevated carbohydrate appetite across many different mammalian species including human beings. So long as the sidereal environment enveloping life on earth featured its extraordinarily predictable pattern of photoperiodic change, the dangers of exposing the organism to augmented glucose and lactate within a strictly delimited window were easily outweighed by the benefits of a precision mechanism ensuring the alignment of the animal’s reproductive cycle with the seasonal one. With “light pollution,” that delicate balance may now be at risk."

abstract = "In placental mammals, a poor fit between the physical dimensions of the fetus and maternal pelvis increases the likelihood of obstructed labour. This problem is especially relevant to humans, as our species demonstrates both unique adaptations in pelvic shape and structure associated with bipedalism, and fetal encephalization. Natural selection is expected to have favoured adaptations that reduce the chances of such mismatch within individual mother-offspring dyads. Here, I hypothesise that the cultural practice of consanguineous marriage may have been favoured, on account of increasing the genetic similarity between mothers and offspring and hence the correlation between maternal and fetal physical dimensions. These benefits could be amplified if consanguineous marriage was accompanied by assortative mating for height. An additional benefit of consanguineous marriage for childbirth is the slight reduction in birth size of such offspring compared to non-consanguineous unions. Although the offspring of consanguineous unions have elevated risks of morbidity and mortality, these risks are moderate and the practice could still have been favoured by selection if the reduction in maternal mortality was greater than the increased mortality among individual offspring. This hypothesis could be tested directly by investigating whether rates of obstructed labour are lower in individuals and populations practising consanguineous marriage. At a broader level, phylogenetic analysis could be conducted to test whether consanguineous marriage appears to have originated in the areas where intensive agriculture was first practiced, as adult height typically fell in such populations, potentially exacerbating the risk of obstructed labour."

The general hypothesis says that deep learning methods produce improved results on medical image segmentation. This paper formulates the segmentation of liver tumor in CT abdominal images as a classification problem, and then solves it using a cascaded classifier framework based on deep convolutional neural networks. Two deep encoder-decoder convolutional neural networks (EDCNN) were constructed and trained to cascade segments of both the liver and lesions in CT images with limited image quantity. In other words, an EDCNN segments the liver image as the input for the training of a second EDCNN. The second EDCNN then segments the tumor regions within the liver ROI regions as predicted by the first EDCNN. Segmenting the hepatic tumor inside the liver ROI also significantly reduces false-positives. The proposed model was then tested using a public dataset (3DIRCADb), and several metrics were used in order to quantitatively evaluate its performance. The proposed method produced an average DICE score of 95.22% for the test set of CT images. The proposed method was then compared with some of the existing methods. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed EDCNN achieved improved performance in segmentation accuracy over some existing methods."

abstract = "Metformin, a drug widely used in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has been the focus of interest as a potential therapeutic agent for certain types of malignancies, including gynaecological cancers [i.e. endometrial cancer (EC)]. Although the exact mechanism behind the potential anticancer activity of metformin is still not completely understood, certain studies have suggested that different effects on cell functions, such as inhibition of cell migration, apoptosis and tumor cell proliferation, are involved in its preventive and therapeutic effects in certain types of malignancies, including EC. In contrast, midkine (MK), a heparin-binding growth factor and cytokine, which induces carcinogenesis and chemoresistance, promotes the development and progression of many malignant tumours by increasing diverse cell functions such as cell proliferation, cell survival and antiapoptotic activities via mainly the activation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. The same pathways are also subject to certain therapeutic effects of metformin, although this cytokine and this drug have some different mechanism of action pathways as well. Taken together, MK and metformin appear to have opposite effects in various biological processes such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell survival, cell migration, and angiogenesis. On the other hand, MK activates PI3K and MAPK cell signal pathways, whereas metformin inhibits these two pathways. It seems likely that almost all the pathways and cell functions, which play important roles in malignancies, are inhibited by metformin and activated by MK. Given the opposite relationship between the actions of metformin and MK, we hypothesize that metformin may act like a novel MK inhibitor in some malignancies. We also discuss the possible relationship between metformin and MK in the context of EC, the most common gynecological cancer worldwide, which incidence is rising rapidly, in parallel with the increase in obesity, T2DM and insulin resistance. In this respect, the therapeutic use of metformin may improve the survival of EC or other cancers, via inhibiting or overcoming the unwanted effects of MK in carcinogenesis."

Her musical career was terminated at age 28, allegedly due to multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with axonal involvement, characterized by the dissemination in time and space of the lesions (plaques). Diverse neurological symptoms may occur in MS, and a variety of symptoms relentlessly accumulated in her case after the diagnosis in 1973, which is concordant with primary progressive rather than relapsing-remitting form of MS. No radiological confirmation was however possible in her days and the diagnosis should be reconsidered, because her symptoms had some unusual features in MS. First, her principal symptoms, aside from transient visual and urological problems noticed earlier, began in the upper and lower limbs, often only in the upper limbs, then followed by the involvement of lower cranial nerves, and by the cognitive decline with changes in character. Hence the pattern of progression was ascending from the cervical spinal cord to the brainstem and to the cerebrum, which is not the pattern of dissemination in space typical of MS. Her clinical status appeared steroid-dependent temporarily in the early stage of the disease, which is also unusual in MS and some different etiology deserves consideration. We suppose that Uhthoff phenomenon, i.e. worsening of symptoms by the elevation of body temperature, may have been negative contrary to the previous interpretation, and if we are correct the absence of this sign does not support the demyelinating pathophysiology of her disease. Now that there is no objective medical information sufficiently disclosed, another scenario may be hypothesized, although MS is still a likely possibility. We discuss that syringomyelia/syringobulbia associated with Chiari malformation type I and obstructive hydrocephalus can be an alternative diagnosis."

abstract = "Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) represents a distinct disease entity with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) as the main risk factor, even though the reasons for why the IOP is elevated remains to be elucidated. It is considered that normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is a subtype of POAG, comprising a special form of glaucomatous neurodegeneration or glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) almost exactly the same as that seen in POAG, but the IOP, as named, remains in the statistically normal range. Actually the disease entity of NTG has been a profound confusion and it is difficult to be accurately conceptualized. One of the reasons is that the IOP is closely linked to the occurrence of GON in POAG but not in NTG, and for the latter, it seems that GON is secondary to a number of local or systemic disorders. In recent years, increasing evidences suggest that NTG or IOP independent GON is a non-glaucomatous disease with different disease entities from POAG and with more diverse and complex etiologies. Here we hypothesized that NTG, at least for those with recognizable primary diseases, is not a glaucomatous disease; instead, it represents a group of disorders with GON as a characteristic clinical feature or phenotype."

Several pathophysiologic pathways have been proposed as potential regulators of its severity; however, to date, the processes that trigger the onset and that influence the severity of the disease are not fully understood; hence, leading to disease recurrence in approximately 10–67% of cases. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21/WAF1) is a protein that is a major target of p53 and is related to cell cycle arrest (it regulates transition from the G1 to the S phase) when DNA damage is detected. Its activity has been also linked to the angiogenic potential of tumors as it promotes the expression of various kinases that are responsible for endothelial development and function. Although several articles have underlined the importance of this protein in cancer cell development and tumor growth, there are no relevant data in the field of endometriosis. Indirect evidence suggests, however, that it may be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis as it inhibits the activity of various kinases which have been correlated with the course and severity of the disease. The present article investigates the background theory that implies the potential role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21/WAF1) in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Implications for future research are also provided given that indirect evidence seem to associate downregulation of p21 with decreased growth and invasiveness of human endometrial stromal cells."

abstract = "Purpose
Sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis involves sickling within hepatic sinusoids leading to vascular stasis and localized hypoxia resulting in ballooning of the hepatocytes causing a direct back pressure effect with resultant intracanalicular cholestasis. Vascular stasis may ultimately lead to portal hypertension. We proposed to document findings suggestive of portal hypertension evolving from hepatopathy in steady-state sickle cell disease (SCD) patients using hepatic venous Doppler ultrasound.
Methods
This is a prospective case series of 6 SCD subjects in steady-state (median age, 30 years; range, 19–43), comprising of 3 males and 3 females, who underwent a routine Doppler ultrasound evaluation of their hepatic veins and were discovered to have an abnormal biphasic waveform pattern. Venous blood was obtained from all subjects to evaluate for P-selectin, homocysteine, foetal haemoglobin, haematocrit levels, white cell and platelet counts. Doppler ultrasound was also carried out on all subjects to evaluate for the hepatic waveform, right renal artery RI and PI along with the hepatic artery velocities.
Results
All the 6 subjects had reduced haematocrit (median value of 21.5%; range, 18–25%) and some degree of renal dysfunction (plasma cystatin-C ranged from 1.6 to 12.2 mg/L). Elevated white cell count, hyperhomocysteinemia, reduced SpO2(<94.0%) and reduced estimated GFR (eGFR < 90 ml/min) was also noted in 4 subjects (66.7%). Similarly, 4 subjects (66.7%) had elevated RI in the right kidneys while 3 subjects (50.0%) had elevated PI in the right kidney.
Conclusion
Doppler ultrasound Hepatic vein waveform analysis may be a useful examination in the evaluation of patients with SCD as it may elicit feature of portal hypertension. Further studies are suggested to confirm this in a larger population of SCD patients using the gold standard."

Yet, beliefs about one’s environment have remained relatively understudied. A recent comprehensive empirically-driven effort has led to the identification of 26 primal world beliefs, or primals, (e.g., the world is: harmless vs. threatening, stable vs. fragile, just vs. unjust, meaningful vs. meaningless, improvable vs. too hard to improve, beautiful vs. ugly). Primals have been theorized to influence many outcomes of interest to different psychological subdisciplines, and a psychometrically rigorous effort has developed a Primals Inventory to measure them. In this brief report, we aim to introduce primals’ potential implications for health psychology research and practice. After summarizing primals’ theorized general function, we illustrate their connection to health processes and outcomes via five illustrative hypotheses. These hypotheses concern how primals might influence (a) the cardiotoxic stress axis; (b) conserved transcriptional response to adversity gene expression patterns; (c) health behaviors; (d) treatment effectiveness; and (e) risk of developing chronic diseases. Further research on primals in relation to health processes and outcomes might lead to new avenues of scientific inquiry and innovative methods of improving the trajectory of our society’s health and well-being."

In this, we hypothesize that the combination therapy of adapalene and flavonoid could improve the efficacy and thereby it can also decrease the treatment time. Since, flavonoids possess multiple activities we assume that it can improve the action of the drug by showing a synergistic activity. Moreover, when we incorporate these two drugs in nanoemulgel, it can easily penetrate into the skin and produce its therapeutic action. Hence, we assume that if this hypothesis proves to be correct then this method will be an effective one in treating acne (pustule)."

Although serum Pi is still not acknowledged as a clinical tumor biomarker, abnormally high Pi concentration in serum or tumor lesions is gradually recognized as a characteristic of malignancy. On the other hand, phosphate binder (e.g. La2 (CO3)3, Fosrenols) has been clinically approved to treat hyperphosphatemia, a metabolic disease characterized by a high serum phosphate level. We hypothesize that, if reducing phosphate burden comes to benefit tumor therapy, could systemic or intratumoral administration of phosphate binder effectively deprive tumor Pi concentration, and then inhibit tumor growth and metastases? From the past clinical and preclinical outcomes, we’d conclude that Pi is not only a metabolite during tumor growth but also a force to trigger tumor progression and metastases. Two types of cancer models were developed to initiate this study. Firstly, a patient-derived xenograft mouse model of colorectal cancer was designed, where mice were administered systemically or intratumorally with lanthanum acetate (a molecular phosphate binder), and the serum or intratumoral Pi concentration levels were found to a dropdown. Secondly, a rabbit VX2 liver tumor was set up for the local-regional therapy model, where lanthanum acetate was intratumorally administered by the standard transcatheter arterial chemoembolization procedure, and it significantly reduced intratumoral Pi concentration. Therefore, Pi deprivation by phosphate binder might be a new anticancer strategy if reducing phosphate burden could effectively arrest tumor growth and delay metastatic progression."

Hence, there is an urgent need to further elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms. Herein, we propose that the neural lymphatic vasculature and lymphangiogenesis play an essential role in both peripheral nerve injury and regeneration and discuss hypothetical mechanisms implementing the current literature. Finally, specific research approaches to test our hypothesis are introduced."

Surgical site infection (SSI) remains a hazardous complication after vascular surgery. In this pilot study we investigated the inguinal microbiome in skin biopsies using histology and 16S-23S rDNA Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Our hypothesis was that causative microorganisms of SSI are present in the inguinal microbiome.
Methods
Data on surgical site infections and skin samples from the Percutaneous in Endovascular Repair versus Open (PiERO) trail were evaluated. Two patients with SSI were matched for age and comorbidity to eight matching patients of the PiERO trial. All patients were treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm with endovascular repair. Nasal and perineal cultures were taken preoperatively to detect Staphylococcus aureus carriage. After disinfection with chlorhexidine, groin biopsies were taken to identify bacteria in deeper skin layers. All samples were subjected to histological analysis and culture-free 16S-23S rDNA NGS.
Results
Staphylococcus aureus species were cultured in 5 out of 20 preoperative nasal and perineal swaps. Histology detected only a few bacteria. NGS of the 16S-23S rRNA regions identified DNA of bacterial species in all biopsies (20/20). Most identified genera and species proved to be known skin flora bacteria. No relation was found between SSIs and the preoperative microbiome.
Conclusion
In this pilot study, an innovative analysis of the preoperative microbiome using 16S-23S rDNA NGS did not show a relation with the occurrence of a surgical site infection. No pathogenic bacterial species were present in the inguinal skin after disinfection with chlorhexidine."

It is known that the final mechanism of tissue mineralization involves three processes, all of which are highly pH dependent. Calcium interacts with phosphate in its trivalent form, but this step is inhibited by pyrophosphate, itself a source of phosphate when hydrolysed by alkaline phosphatase. Separately, matrix vesicles create nucleation sites and may indirectly disrupt vascular smooth muscle cells. Metabolic acidosis acts at every point to delay mineralization. The diuretic acetazolamide creates a sustained mild acidosis with some phosphate loss and, though usually ineffective in the experimental model, has been used with success in certain clinical conditions. We suggest that acetazolamide, well studied and tolerated, might inhibit progression of vascular calcification in subjects at risk through its dual action of lowering tissue pH and local phosphate concentration."

Adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR), expressed by a wide range of immune cells, as well as endothelial cells and platelets, exert cAMP-mediated anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects that potentially could be highly protective in this regard. The venerable drug pentoxifylline (PTX) exerts both anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects that reflect its ability to boost the responsiveness of A2AR to extracellular adenosine. The platelet-stabilizing drug dipyridamole (DIP) blocks intracellular uptake of extracellularly-generated adenosine, thereby up-regulating A2AR signaling in a way that should be functionally complementary to the impact of PTX in that regard. Moreover, DIP has recently been reported to slow the cellular replication of SARS-CoV-2 in clinically feasible concentrations. Both PTX and DIP are reasonably safe, well-tolerated, widely available, and inexpensive drugs. When COVID-19 patients can be treated within several days of symptom onset, using PTX + DIP in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and an antibiotic – azithromycin (AZM) or doxycycline – might be warranted. HCQ and AZM can suppress SARS-CoV-2 proliferation in vitro and may slow the cell-to-cell spread of the virus; a large case series evaluating this combination in early-stage patients reported an impressively low mortality rate. However, whereas HCQ and AZM can promote QT interval lengthening and may be contraindicated in more advanced COVID-19 entailing cardiac damage, doxycycline has no such effect and exerts a potentially beneficial anti-inflammatory action. In contrast to HCQ, we propose that the combination of PTX + DIP can be used in both early and advanced stages of COVID-19. Concurrent use of certain nutraceuticals – yeast beta-glucan, zinc, vitamin D, spirulina, phase 2 inducers, N-acetylcysteine, glucosamine, quercetin, and magnesium – might also improve therapeutic outcomes in COVID-19."

abstract = "Recent research has revealed that patients with neurodegenerative disease sleep longer in the supine position, while healthy controls prefer sleeping in the lateral decubitus position. Thus, sleeping in the lateral position seems to be protective against neurodegeneration. It has also been suggested that a protective role of this body position could be associated with better cerebral venous drainage in this body position, which results in more active glymphatic system of the brain (the system responsible for clearance of the cerebral tissue from waste products, e.g. amyloid-β). Since no published evidence exists regarding venous outflow from the cranial cavity in the lateral decubitus position, we performed a pilot sonographic study of the internal jugular veins in 3 young healthy volunteers and 2 patients presenting with abnormal jugular valves. In all healthy volunteers both internal jugular veins were opened in the supine position and collapsed in the sitting one. In the right lateral decubitus position the right internal jugular vein was opened, while the left one was partially collapsed; and—vice versa—in the left lateral decubitus position the right internal jugular vein was partially collapsed and the left one opened. In patients with abnormal jugular valves both internal jugular veins were opened in both lateral decubitus body positions. We hypothesize that in the lateral decubitus body position, because of decreased flow resistance in the extracranial veins, cerebral venous outflow is optimal, which in turn optimizes the activity of the glymphatic system. Therefore, people intuitively prefer this body position during sleep, while other positions are associated with a higher risk of neurodegenerative disorders. Yet, it should be emphasized that our results need to be interpreted with caution, since only a few individuals have been assessed and this discovery should be confirmed in more patients and healthy controls, and by precise quantitative measurements."

Quercetagetin (Que) is a natural flavonoid, which has been exhibited to have anti-HCV property through inhibition of RNA binding to NS5B. The last few decades have witnessed a growing interest in the extraction of natural flavonoids with a plethora of different biological activities. Considering the high therapeutic potential of Que, the aim of this study is to explore wide structure entities with potent activity using Que as a prototype. A virtual screen protocol involving docking and molecular dynamics has been performed to examine the potency of forty-three natural flavonoids which recently extracted from plants for inhibition of NS5B. During two screening stages, two compounds 24 and 41 were identified to have more favorable binding affinity to NS5B as compared to Que. The comparative analysis showed that there is a significant difference in the binding free energy of Que and 41 (ΔΔGbind = −11.17 kcal/mol). It was revealed that van der Waals (vdW) interaction drives the binding process of both 24 and 41 and plays an important role in increasing their activities relative to Que. PHE162 serves as a crucial residue in both the NS5B-24 and NS5B-41 systems, contributing the most vdW energy by π-π interaction, suggesting that aromatic interactions are critical for the binding of 24 and 41 to NS5B. Moreover, hydrogen bond analysis indicates that the hydrogen bonds formed by LYS98, THR137, ASP164 and ARG168, can play important roles in the increased binding affinity of 41 to NS5B relative to Que. The findings of this study will provide useful structure-activity relationship (SAR) guidelines for the design of novel inhibitors with improved/enhanced therapeutic activities in the treatment of hepatitis C."

abstract = "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease with an unknown mechanism of onset that predominantly impairs the upper and lower motor neurons. Components of the sensory and autonomic nervous system were once thought to be spared in the disease, but more recently they have been identified to be impaired at various levels. However, some of the motor neurons such as oculomotor, abducens, or pudendal nerves are spared even in the later stages of ALS. The mechanism of such complex and heterogeneous neuronal loss in typical ALS is still unknown. In this study, the characteristics of the nervous system involved in the pathogenesis of ALS were comprehensively reviewed. As a result, the direction of the axon in the anatomical position, rather than the functional type or length of the axon, was suggested to contribute the most to the onset of ALS. This finding suggested that downward directed axons, represented by motor neurons, require extra energy to move waste or unnecessary substances from the synapse side to the neural cell body with retrograde fast axonal transport. Based on this theory, the extra energy that is required in vertically directed axons due to the effect of gravity was mathematically estimated. As a result, several percent more adenosine triphosphate molecules were suggested to be consumed in vertical axonal transport by gravity, compared to those consumed in transverse axonal transport. Because most of the motor neurons project downward in the anatomical position, unretrieved waste will gradually sediment in axon terminals by gravity, which could eventually result in motor neuron-dominant neuronal loss. Although the theory that gravity is one of the mechanisms responsible for ALS is still hypothetical, it is theoretically reasonable and compatible with the clinical manifestations of the disease. Further basic research studies with cultured neurons or animal models are necessary to confirm the association between gravity and the onset of ALS."

Fluid dynamics theory, which is a fundamental underlying concept applied to fluid management, has not been introduced to analyze the human respiratory system. We hypothesized that one of the potential mechanisms that promotes airflow limitation in patients with airway obstructive disease would be elucidated by using fluid dynamics theory.
Methods
We calculated the values of pressure loss and static pressure change under virtual tracheal stenotic conditions using the fluid dynamics approach.
Results
Under normal conditions, the absolute values of pressure loss and static pressure change are very low. However, once airway stenosis occurs, it is confirmed that they would be dramatically elevated.
Conclusions
The fluid dynamics approach to airway obstruction is very constructive. The treatment strategy for airway obstruction and the reasons for airflow limitation are well explained by using this approach."

Normally, a range of surviving and propagating host factors must be employed for the completion of the infectious process including RPs. Viral protein biosynthesis involves the interaction of numerous RPs with viral mRNA, proteins which are necessary for viruses replication regulation and infection inside the host cells. Most of these interactions are crucial for virus activation and accumulation. However, only small percentage of these proteins is specifically responsible for host cells protection by triggering the immune pathway against virus. This research proposes RPs extracted from bacillus sp. and yeast as new forum for the advancement of antiviral therapy. Hitherto, antiviral therapy with RPs-involving viral infection has not been widely investigated as critical targets. Also, exploring antiviral strategy based on RPs could be a promising guide for more potential therapeutics."

abstract = "Surgical site infection (SSI) is a most serious postoperative complication, associated with increased morbidity and mortality, as well as extended therapy and elevated healthcare costs. In open clean surgery, e.g. orthopedic and cardiothoracic operations, the risk of SSI is strongly correlated with the amount of airborne bacteria being present in the operating room and the surgical field. The source of these bacteria is the surgical team itself, as we all emit thousands of bacteria-carrying skin particles every minute into the air. Although the risk of airborne contamination has decreased over the years, thanks to modern surgical clothing and advanced operating room ventilation, airborne bacteria are still detected and cause SSI. However, during the past thirty years there has been a simple and potentially effective preventive method waiting to be noticed. In 1986 Hall, Mackintosh and Hoffman found in a controlled experimental study that the application of regular unperfumed skin lotion to a person’s body reduced the emission of airborne bacteria-carrying particles by approximately 90%. Moreover, the effect lasted at least 4 hours, which corresponds to a major surgical procedure. Thus, in the light of those results the present paper puts forth the hypothesis that this method can decrease the incidence of airborne bacterial contamination and SSI in open clean surgery. The paper also discusses the rationale and advantages of the method, and questions why it has escaped scientific attention for so long. In healthcare, difficult problems rarely have a simple and cheap solution. However, the use of ordinary skin lotion in open surgery may just be one, as it could potentially help prevent surgical site infection, and thereby increase patient safety and reduce healthcare costs."

abstract = "Our observations question both the current doctrine of spatial orientation as processed by vestibular, visual and proprioceptive impressions as well as the horizontal alignment of the eye axis. Indeed our observations suggest spatial orientation as a physically based, largely mechanically transmitted interaction between individual and environment. It is controlled by an interface defined by the baseline of upper teeth. It simultaneously constitutes both body and environment acting as an integral part of that environment. Consequently, the baseline of upper teeth is part of the aforementioned environment. Instead of the eye axis during spatial orientation it aligns the true horizontal absolutely. This was tested by fixing a cross to upper teeth. While walking, running and jumping it did not deviate by more than 2° from the external axis. Subsequently, we inclined the baseline of upper teeth by inserting an asymmetric wafer so that it angulated the eye axis. Immediately, head, visual and vestibular axes tilted unstably with misaligned body posture. Only the indicative cross remained stably aligned to the external axes. The person felt “upright”, not noticing his posture had changed. He was then instructed to straighten his shoulders and trunk until his posture was objectively nearly upright again. The voluntary correction caused the indicative cross to tilt. The person felt uneven while being more upright. We concluded that the automatic posture works by “synchronizing” the baseline of upper teeth to the external axis and that the synchronized position is supported by the vestibular system. Benefit of an interface is that the body’s movements in the environment simultaneously happen within the baseline of upper teeth. Therein the vectors of the body and the environment are calculated to remain in balance. This model introduces the transmission of the vector information to postural muscles by the dura mater, controlled by tension between C0-C2. The information is skewed by bony dislocations between C0-C2 caused by an inclination of the interface. The resulting misalignments of posture are foreseeable and specifically correspond to the type of inclination. They occur in a broad section of the population. Diagnosed as muscular weakness, they may cause therapy resistant common diseases like back and joint pain after 5–10 years. Following our observations, the inclination of the baseline of upper teeth originates from inattentive changes in the length of upper teeth in dental treatment. Multiple treatments optimizing teeth length in long term patients improved the patients’ situation."

abstract = "Oxytocin is a nonapeptide consisting of a cyclic six amino-acid structure and a tail of three amino acids. It was originally known for its ability to induce milk ejection and to stimulate uterine contractions. More recently, oxytocin has been shown to stimulate social behaviors, and exert pain-relieving, anti-stress/anti-inflammatory and restorative effects. We hypothesize that oxytocin is a principal hormone that, in part, exerts its effects after degradation to active fragments with more specific effect profiles. Experimental findings on rats show that administered oxytocin exerts biphasic effects. For example, after an initial increase in pain threshold, a second more long-lasting increase follows. Blood pressure and cortisol levels initially increase and then reverse into a long-lasting decrease in blood pressure and cortisol. Whereas the initial effects are, the second-phase effects are not blocked by an oxytocin antagonist, but by an opioid mu-antagonist and by an alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist, respectively, suggesting that other receptors are involved. Repeated administration of oxytocin induces multiple anti-stress effects, which are mediated by alpha 2-adrenoreceptors. Repeated administration of linear oxytocin and linear oxytocin fragments with a retained C-terminal reduce spontaneous motor activity, a sedative or anti-stress effect, suggesting that alpha 2-adrenoreceptors have been activated. In contrast, linear mid-fragments stimulate motor activity. Low-intensity stimulation of cutaneous nerves in rats, as well as breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact between mothers and babies, trigger immediate anti-stress effects. Some of these effects are likely caused by open ring/linear C-terminal fragments activating alpha 2-adrenoreceptors. Oxytocin fragments may be pre-formed and released in the brain or created by metabolic conversion of the principal hormone oxytocin in the central nervous system. Oxytocin and its fragments may also be released from peripheral sites, such as peripheral nerves, the gastrointestinal tract, and blood vessels in response to decreased sympathetic or increased parasympathetic nervous tone. Smaller fragments of oxytocin produced in the periphery may easily pass the blood-brain barrier to induce effects in the brain. In conclusion, oxytocin is linked to many different, sometimes opposite effects. The intact cyclic molecule may act to initiate social interaction and associated psychophysiological effects, whereas linear oxytocin and C-terminal fragments may induce relaxation and anti-stress effects following social interaction. In this way, the principal hormone oxytocin and its fragments may take part in a behavioral sequence, ranging from approach and interaction to calm and relaxation. Linear fragments, with an exposed cysteine-residue, may exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and thereby contribute to the health-promoting effects of oxytocin."

The main focus in surgical treatment had, for decades, been the amount of correction in the coronal plane whereas corrections in sagittal and rotational (axial) planes have also been recognized as almost as important as the coronal over the recent decades. The hypotheses presented and discussed in this study is the virtual adversity between the rates of correction in these two (sagittal and axial) planes. Namely, we are suggesting that due to an elongated anterior spinal column as an intrinsic component of AIS, posterior surgery cannot correct both the axial plane deformity and the thoracic hypokyphosis in the sagittal plane at the same time, unless the posterior spinal column is substantially lengthened. This hypothesis is supported by 3D modeling of the AIS spine as well as the relative inability in changing the sagittal alignment of the thoracic spine demonstrated by a literature search by us. Understanding and internalization of this hypothesis by AIS surgeons is important as it suggests that by posterior instrumentation, unless a riskier approach of substantially lengthening the spinal column is taken, surgeons need to make the choice of correcting the hypokyphosis OR axial rotation."

abstract = "COVID-19 is now recognized as a pandemic throughout the world, leading to a scramble in order to gather knowledge as well as evidence regarding the ‘novel’ corona virus which causes this disease. Chemokines are a family of cytokines which are chemotactic in nature and cause the recruitment of cells of inflammation. Periodontitis has long been attributed to having its pathophysiology rooted in a cytokine response. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has been reported to have adverse outcomes related to the establishment of a cytokine storm, many of the components of which are common with the cytokine expression profile of periodontitis. This communication explores the connection between COVID-19 and periodontal disease through their cytokine connection to form a translational basis for recommending maintenance of oral hygiene in the COVID era and to red flag patients with periodontitis as having an increased risk of exhibiting COVID related adverse outcomes."

By working in silos, the similarity of these disorders is overlooked. Close inspection of these disorders reveals the presence of signs and symptoms triggered by fluid under high pressure within relatively closed chambers. There is a similarity in the capillary production of fluid, which then circulates and drains into the venous system. Management practices that reduce fluid production, decrease fluid pressure or enhance fluid drainage are employed for the treatment of all three disorders. A search for a unifying mechanism explaining the pathophysiology of all three disorders may unlock effective and perhaps curative measures for these disorders."

After material implantation, protein adsorption at the interface is the first occurring biological event, which influences subsequent cell response.

Upon infection, the parasite forms life-long cysts in fetal brain and eyes which are resistant to the currently accepted therapy of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. These cysts commonly reactivate later in life causing chorioretinitis and visual impairment, and rarely cause neurological complications. I hypothesize that adjunctive, bradyzoite-directed therapies have the potential to alleviate a significant burden of disease by reducing cyst burden in neonatal brain and eyes. Atovaquone is perhaps the most promising drug for further evaluation given its low side-effect profile, established safety, and efficacy in animal models reducing cyst burden. Very limited observational data in humans suggests atovaquone may prevent Toxoplasma-associated chorioretinitis recurrence. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate it and other potential drugs as adjunctive treatment in congenital toxoplasmosis."

Recently, low intensity exercise performed with blood flow restriction has been shown to induce hypoalgesia. The purpose of this manuscript is to discuss the mechanisms of exercise-induced hypoalgesia and provide rationale as to why low intensity exercise performed with blood flow restriction may induce hypoalgesia. Research into exercise-induced hypoalgesia has identified several potential mechanisms, including opioid and endocannabinoid-mediated pain inhibition, conditioned pain modulation, recruitment of high threshold motor units, exercise-induced metabolite production and an interaction between cardiovascular and pain regulatory systems. We hypothesise that several mechanisms consistent with prolonged high intensity exercise may drive the hypoalgesia effect observed with blood flow restriction exercise. These are likely triggered by the high level of intramuscular stress in the exercising muscle generated by blood flow restriction including hypoxia, accumulation of metabolites, accelerated fatigue onset and ischemic pain. Therefore, blood flow restriction exercise may induce hypoalgesia through similar mechanisms to prolonged higher intensity exercise, but at lower intensities, by changing local tissue physiology, highlighting the importance of the blood flow restriction stimulus. The potential to use blood flow restriction exercise as a pain modulation tool has important implications following acute injury and surgery, and for several load compromised populations with chronic pain."

The viral spike (S) glycoprotein is the key molecule for viral entry through interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor molecules present on the cell membranes. Moreover, it has been established that COVID-19 interacts and infects brain cells in humans via ACE2. Therefore in the light of these known facts we hypothesized that viral S protein molecule may bind to the other overexpressed receptor molecules in glioma cells and may play some role in glioma tumorogenesis. Thus we leverage docking analysis (HEX and Z-DOCK) between viral S protein and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptors (HGFR/c-MET) to investigate the oncogenic potential of COVID-19. Our findings suggested higher affinity of Viral S protein towards EGFR and VEGFR. Although, the data presented is preliminary and need to be validated further via molecular dynamics studies, however it paves platform to instigate further investigations on this aspect considering the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic in oncogenic perspective."

abstract = "Mammalian oviducts contain smooth muscles and inward-facing ciliated epithelium. Muscular contractions, not ciliary beating, propel oocytes through the oviduct towards the uterus. In crawling gastropods (unique models for studying the functioning of phasic smooth muscles), muscular contractions, propagating along the foot sole, play a principal role in determining the crawling rate. We have described the muscular mechanisms controlling the crawling rate and hypothesize here that the same mechanisms provide embryo transportation through the human fallopian tube. The data collected for gastropods were transferred to the human fallopian tube, using embryo speed and tube length (tonus) instead of crawling speed and sole length. Smooth muscle active states: tonic contraction/relaxation and rhythmic contractions (peristalsis) are involved in ovum transport. The ovum/embryo speed is linearly correlated with the tonus of the longitudinal and/or the circular muscles of the tube. Some known bioactive substances control muscular tonus and we suppose embryo speed through the contraction force of muscle cells involved in peristaltic waves. Other known substances facilitate peristalsis and we suppose that they have no effect on muscular tonus and increase dose-dependently embryo speed through the number of muscle cells recruited in peristaltic waves (at a constant wave frequency). This number depends on the physiological state of the woman. The combination of all possible effects and the ability of muscles to contract rhythmically determine the embryo speed and its implantation site. This hypothesis is the first description of the tubal muscular mechanisms that determine normal and any type of ectopic pregnancy at chronic disorders of tubal contractility. How to predict ectopic pregnancy? We have reason to assume that the intensity of rhythmic uterine contractions reflects that in the fallopian tube. It is known that uterine contractility significantly increases during the preovulatory phase and decreases during the mid-luteal phase. The hypothesis supposes that in women with increased risk of ectopic pregnancy, decreased uterine contractility during the preovulatory phase in comparison with the norm indicates a future tubal/abdominal gestation; increased uterine contractility during this phase and/or the mid-luteal phase as compared to the norm points to a future cervical pregnancy. The optimal methods for recording uterine activity are up to clinicians."

This approach, while promising, overlooks the fact that the evolutionary adaptation to bipedalism puts the human body in a distinctively vulnerable biomechanical and functional position. Orthograde human posture places unusually-high axial compressive loads on the weight-bearing joints of the skeleton, resulting in arthritic deterioration with aging. The effects are particularly robust in the lumbar spine were age-related degeneration, most commonly lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), is ubiquitous among the elderly. It is postulated that re-establishing a favorable mechanical environment via interventions that unload the affected spinal joint complex may mitigate and potentially reverse the structural damage that is the cardinal pathoanatomical feature of this disease. The hypothesis of this paper is that a minimally-invasive surgical procedure, interspinous process decompression (IPD), which utilizes a stand-alone intervertebral spacer, effectively unloads the diseased spinal motion segment providing a healthy micro-environment to reverse and repair age-related and genetic deterioration of the spinal motion segment. Several lines of supporting evidence are provided from long-term follow-up results of a randomized controlled trial of IPD safety and effectiveness of the Superion® device including clinical outcomes, reoperation rates, opioid analgesic usage and advanced imaging utilization. All of these outcomes show uniquely-favorable trends with time that imply that the benefits of IPD are structural. The compendium of evidence suggests that IPD offers both a durable palliative effect due to direct blocking of back extension and a disease-modifying effect due to unloading of the spinal joint complex."

About the latter, hypertension and coronary heart disease are among the most common comorbidities recorded in infected patients, together with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data from Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS, Italy) show that more than 68.3% of patients had hypertension, 28.2% ischemic heart disease, 22.5% atrial fibrillation, while 30.1% T2DM. Several authors suggested that cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus are linked to endothelial dysfunction, and all of them are strictly related to aging. Considering the impact of the gender on the COVID-19 epidemic, even if confirmed cases from each nation are changing every day, epidemiological data clearly evidence that in men the infection causes worse outcomes compared to women. In Italy, up to 21 May, in the age range of 60–89 years, male deaths were 63.9% of total cases. The reason behind this difference between genders appears not clear; however, the diversity in sex-hormones and styles of life are believed to play a role in the patient's susceptibility to severe SARS-CoV-2 outcomes. It is known that the activation of endothelial estrogen receptors increases NO and decreases ROS, protecting the vascular system from angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction, inflammation, and ROS production. During the pandemic, joining forces is vital; thus, as people help doctors by limiting their displacements out of their houses avoiding hence the spread of the infection, doctors help patients to overcome severe SARS-CoV-2 infections by using multiple pharmacological approaches. In this context, the preservation of endothelial function and the mitigation of vascular inflammation are prominent targets, essential to reduce severe outcomes also in male older patients."

In PLAM patients, with and without clinical tuberous sclerosis, mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex involving the proteins hamartin and tuberin have been found. These proteins are key regulators of the mTOR pathway. mTOR activation is a key step in normal cellular senescence. The hypothesis proposed here is that mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex leading to mTOR activation result in the specialized LAM cells acquiring many of the cellular characteristics of the normal senescent cell, a state that I propose to characterize as a state of neoplastic senescence. Using this hypothesis as a theoretical basis, many of the enigmatic features of the pathogenesis and clinical behavior of PLAM can be explained. In addition, the hypothesis may lead to new insights into possible therapeutic interventions for this disease."

Exposure can lead to abnormal brain EEG, convulsions, and death, the time to onset of each stage of pathology decreasing with increase in oxygen pressure. We provide evidence that hyperoxia, through oxidative phosphorylation, increases the energy state ([ATP]/[ADP][Pi]) of cells critical to providing glucose to cells behind the blood brain barrier (BBB). Brain cells without an absolute dependence on glucose metabolism; i.e. those having sufficient ATP synthesis using lactate and glutamate as oxidizable substrates, are not themselves very adversely affected by hyperoxia. The increased energy state and decrease in free [AMP], however, suppress glucose transport through the blood brain barrier (BBB) and into cells behind the BBB. Glucose has to pass in sequence through three steps of transport by facilitated diffusion and transporter activity for each step is regulated in part by AMP dependent protein kinase. The physiological role of this regulation is to increase glucose transport in response to hypoxia and/or systemic hypoglycemia. Hyperoxia, however, through unphysiological decrease in free [AMP] suppresses 1) glucose transport through the BBB (endothelial GLUT1 transporters) into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); 2) glucose transport from CSF into cells behind the BBB (GLUT3 transporters) and (GLUT4 transporters). Cumulative suppression of glucose transport results in local regions of hypoglycemia and induces hypoglycemic failure. It is suggested that failure is initiated at axons and synapses with insufficient mitochondria to meet their energy requirements."

abstract = "With progress in neurosciences, neuroimaging and brain stimulation techniques, mental illnesses are now being seen as development anomalies at the molecular-structural level of synapses, resulting in abnormal cross wiring in areas responsible for complex cognitive and emotional processing. These include the multimodal association cortices situated in the prefrontal lobes, the insula in the temporal lobes, midline cortical structures, and their connections to the thalamus, amygdala and the basal ganglia. Three key networks have been identified which are considered the brain hubs for complex perceptual, emotional and behavior processing as well as introspection, theory of mind and self-awareness; namely the salience network (SN), the central executive network (CEN) and the default mode network (DMN). They function in an interconnected manner and involve in higher information processing of the entire internal and external milieu of the organism to determine the behavior strategies to be adopted. A triple network model of aberrant saliency mapping and cognitive dysfunction in psychopathology has been put forward recently and an attempt is being made to understand core cognitive networks and their dysfunction across multiple disorders including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, autism and dementia. Against this background, the author would like to take the triple network dysfunction model a step further to hypothesize the following. 1. All or some of the three core networks (CEN, SN & DMN) are affected variably in psychiatric disorders, the severity and the nature of the clinical symptoms depending upon the degree of damage and the number of networks that are dysfunctional and whether that dysfunction is reversible or permanent. For example, in a condition like schizophrenia, all three networks would more or less be affected giving rise to plethora of symptoms like executive deficits, negative symptoms, abnormal salience and mood states. In milder conditions like anxiety and depressive disorders, on the other hand, the dysfunction is of a lesser degree and reversible. 2. These networks are the final common pathway through which a variety of internal or environment insults to the brains may act, the degree of damage and reversibility being determined by the critical period of brain development in which these occur. 3. The harmonious functioning of these core networks is what gives rise to the complex phenomenon of the mind in the brain."

Hypokinetic movements present with rigidity, resting tremors, postural instability and bradykinesia, as seen in parkinsonism, while hyperkinetic movements typically present with chorea, ballismus, tic, athetosis and dystonia. Nonetheless, movement disorders are thought to be a continuum. Long-term therapy of parkinsonism with L-DOPA or dopamine (DA) agonists leads to late-onset dyskinesia – a hyperkinetic movement disorder, while patients with late-stage Huntington disease (HD) often develop non-DOPA responsive parkinsonism. In this paper, it is proposed that late-onset parkinsonism is driven by the overactivity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. The excessive synthesis, storage, release, reuptake and degradation of dopamine in the presynaptic terminal and synaptic clefts lead to cellular stress and damage, resulting to progressive neuroapoptosis aggravated by pro-parkinsonism drugs used to treat hyperkinesia. Glutamate excitotoxicity may provide initial stress to neurons during early HD – but as the disease advances, lower glutamate levels are observed, making it less likely to cause the hypokinetic shift on its own. Over time, dopaminergic neurons are depleted and cholinergic influence to striatal GABA release is unopposed, leading to late-onset parkinsonism that is unresponsive to DOPA challenge, due to drastic DA neuron loss previously masked by the dominating choreic presentation. This paper thus provides a mechanism of action to a common clinical sequela and complication of long-term choreic diseases, whose pathophysiologic mechanism is presently lacking."

In such ulcers, losing a large part of skin causes a chronic infection due to the entrance of various pathogens in the wound bed. Moreover, poor vascularization, uncontrolled inflammation, and delayed re-epithelialization increase the healing time in patients suffering from such wounds. In this light, tissue engineering provides a wide range of strategies using a variety of biomaterials, biofactors and stem cells to decrease the healing time and restore the function of the damaged site. A suitable wound healing agent should possess some critical parameters such as inducing re-epithelialization, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties, and angiogenic capability. The Lacto-n-Neotetraose (LNnT) with chemical formula C26H45NO21 is an oligosaccharide present in human milk and soluble antigens extracted from Schistosoma mansoni eggs. It is reported that LNnT induces type 2 immune response (Th2 immunity). Th2 immunity promotes re-epithelialization, angiogenesis and wound contraction by recruiting the cells which produce Th2-related cytokines. Moreover, LNnT shows some special characteristics such as angiogenic capability, anti-inflammatory, and anti-bacterial effects which can address the mentioned challenges in the treatment of non-healing and full-thickness wounds. Here, we hypothesize that utilizing LNnT is an appropriate biofactor which would improve the healing process in full-thickness and non-healing wounds."

Prospectively, 36 patients with spinal trauma who underwent PSS were randomly divided into an experimental group (n = 18) and a control group (n = 18). The experimental group was treated with LMWH after the operation. Changes in the vascular endothelial function, inflammatory factors and other blood indexes, and the incidence of deep venous thrombosis in lower extremities were compared between the two groups before and after the surgery. Compared to pre-surgery, the levels of endothelin (ET) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in the experimental group decreased significantly after surgery (all P < 0.001), while the levels of ET increased and tPA decreased significantly in the control group (all P < 0.001). In addition, compared with pre-surgical levels, interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-6 and procalcitonin (PCT) decreased significantly in the experimental group after surgery while there was a significant increase in these cytokines in the control group (all P < 0.001), with a significant difference in the cytokine levels between the two groups post-surgery (P < 0.01). After the surgery, plasma viscosity, erythrocyte electrophoresis time and platelet aggregation rate in the control group were significantly increased from pre-surgery levels (all P < 0.001), and these levels were also significantly higher than in the experimental group (P < 0.01). The D-dimer (D-D) level in both groups also increased significantly after surgery (all P < 0.001), and the level post-surgery was significantly higher in the experimental group as compared to the control group (P < 0.01). Finally, the incidence of deep venous thrombosis in the experimental group was significantly lower than in the control group (P < 0.05). LMWH is beneficial in reducing the degree of hypercoagulability, hyperviscosity and inflammatory reaction in patients with spinal trauma who underwent PSS. It also effectively reduced the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis in lower limbs after surgery. Thus, it is a candidate for further clinical development."

To date, numerous studies have shown that the FDA-recommended doses of folic acid (400 mcg/d) render a protective effect against ASD. Yet, a recent prospective study has claimed that while self-reported folic acid supplementation was associated with decreased risk of ASD, very high levels of maternal plasma folate levels (<60.3 nmol/L) were associated with 2.5 time increased risk of ASD. This study has led to high levels of public anxiety because many women use high dose folic acid to prevent neural tube defects. We hypothesize that because ASD children have been documented to be much more likely to be first or second born, and women consume significantly more folic acid during their first and second pregnancies, the claim that high dose folic acid causes ASD is based on a previously unrecognized birth order bias. This article presents evidence for the wrong claim that high dose folic acid causes ASD. The question whether high exposure level of folic acid is associated with increased risk of ASD is not merely a theoretical issue, because many women at increased risk for NTD in their offspring need substantially higher daily doses of folic acid (1 mg, or 5 mg), than the FDA-recommended 400 mcg daily."

Studies of postmortem gene expression in zebrafish and mice and in the myocardium, liver, prostate, pericardial fluid, and blood of human cadavers have identified genes whose expression is increased after organismal death. Cancer can be considered a form of “un-death” since excessively proliferating cells are typically unusually resistant to apoptosis (programmed cell death), and are subject to strong selective pressure for “uncontrolled life.” The changes in gene expression observed in organismal death, particularly in mammals (mice and humans), can be compared to that observed in human neoplasia, and the comparison of these expression patterns can inform us about human cancer. Here we present a hypothesis based on the following three tenets: (a) there will be distinct and opposing patterns of gene expression between the postmortem state and cancer with respect to key physiological outputs such as growth, apoptosis, invasion, and prognosis; (b) cancer cells considered more aggressive (e.g., derived from a metastasis and/or resistant to agents that suppress growth or induce apoptosis) will exhibit expression of relevant genes more unlike that of the postmortem condition while less aggressive neoplastic cells will exhibit gene expression more similar to the postmortem condition; and (c) targeting gene expression in cancer to produce a more postmortem-like pattern will promote less tumorigenic and less aggressive cell phenotypes. To evaluate components (a) and (b) of our hypothesis, we focus on previously published gene expression data from colorectal cancer (CRC) and colonic adenoma cells and compare that to postmortem expression data. This preliminary analysis in general supports our hypothesis, with more aggressive neoplastic cell types exhibiting gene expression patterns most unlike that found in the postmortem condition; this suggests that cancer and the postmortem condition represent opposing ends of a gene expression spectrum in the balance between life and death. Subsequently, we discuss the possibilities for further testing of the hypothesis, particularly for part (c), and we also discuss the possible implications of the hypothesis for cancer therapeutics."

Sulphoraphane, a naturally occurring isothiocyanate derivative has been investigated for its numerous potential biological activities including anticancer effects. The present hypothesis aims to put forward in which Tamoxifen is combined with a natural bioactive Sulphoraphane, both incorporated into a novel lipid based nanocarrier at a reduced dose, which would eventually shuttle the cargo to the target site. At the breast cancer, Sulphoraphane sensitizes the estrogen receptors and ameliorates the binding affinity of Tamoxifen to these receptors, thereby potentiating the anticancer efficacy and reducing the offsite toxicity of Tamoxifen. This dual loaded zero-dimension lipid carrier would be a value addition to the current treatment regimen for breast cancer management."

abstract = "Hypothermia is a condition in which the body’s core temperature drops below 35.0 °C. Hypothermia is the opposite of hyperthermia, which the metabolism and body functions are abnormal. Severe hypothermia is a life-threatening problem that may cause atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias, coagulopathy, cardiac, and central nervous system depression. What is worse, it is fatal when untreated or treated improperly. Accidental deaths due to hypothermia resulting from immersion in cold water, especially involving naval fighters and maritime victims have occurred continually in the past years. Currently, the treatment of hypothermia has become a research focus. Rewarming is the only approach that should be considered for hypothermia treatment. However, the treatment is of low efficiency, and few active rewarming cases have been reported. It is well known that timely reperfusion is the best way to save the lives of patients with ischemia. Similarly, reoxygenation is effective for hypoxia. However, several studies have identified that improper reperfusion of ischemic tissues and reoxygenation of hypoxic tissues give rise to further injury. Analogically, this study attempts to propose the hypothesis that hypothermia-rewarming injury may also exist. When suffered from hypothermia, both the blood circulation and the oxygen supply in the body will be affected in a deficient state, an injury may also appear in the improper rewarming process. In a word, hypothermia-rewarming may be a double-edged sword."

Previous studies have pointed out that disruption of the proteolytic cleavage of proteins can promote infectious and non-infectious diseases. The last few weeks have been marked by an important revelation concerning the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2. This new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and transmissible acute respiratory infectious disorder. SARS-CoV-2 is composed of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and structural proteins including Spike protein (S protein). Interestingly, the FURIN, one of the proproteins of the convertase family, plays a crucial role in the maturation of viral glycoproteins. In addition, many viruses including coronaviruses, exploit FURIN for the activation of their glycoproteins. Recent data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Subsequently, the S protein is cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 with the help of FURIN which facilitates the entry of the virus into the cell after binding. Furthermore, it seems that FURIN is implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially in the increased rates of human-to-human transmission."

Although problems in the astrocytic system have already been suggested as a major player in this malfunction, the termination phase is not really understood. Here it is assumed to arise from a G-lymphatic clearance system. Our biophysical mechanism provides a coherent explanation of the phenomenon, offers support for the previously published mathematical model, and can shed light on the conflicting results encountered in norepinephrine measurements in epilepsy treatment."

An insight into the pathophysiology of the periodontitis reveals that the promising amelioration could only be envisaged with the 4-D/multi-pronged approach of combining antibiotic along with the host modulating agents. The complications of the disease itself suggest that the use of antibiotic alone is not able to cater the symptoms completely. There is a need of other host modulatory agents too, such as Cyclo-oxygenase –II (COX II) enzyme inhibitors, Matrix metalloproteinase’s (MMPs) inhibitors and osteo-integrating agents. Also, there is an unmet need of singular treatment modality through which all these agents can be sequentially and directly delivered into the periodontal cavity. The current hypothesis takes it a step forward wherein an antibiotic is combined with other three host modulatory agents in a singular drug delivery system. The encapsulation of multiple therapeutic agents with controlled release would therefore allow for reduced drug dose thus minimizing side effects; contributing to enhanced patient compliance and treatment efficacy. Hence this approach can be presented as a 4-D/multi-pronged approach for circumvention of periodontitis."

abstract = "Background and aims
Nowadays it is recommended to use risk scores to evaluate the magnitude of cardiovascular risk in healthy people, most popular being SCORE (Europe) and Framingham and ASCVD (US). Unfortunately, they are not enough motivating in young and old population, don’t consider protective factors and cannot be used in cardiovascular patients always included in very high risk category. To improve the evaluation everytime of individual cardiovascular risk we described a new score – CVRISK (cardiovascular relative individual risk).
Methods
It uses 15 items and can be used also in cardiovascular patients. The first seven items are clinical – age and gender, heredity, smoking, hypertension, obesity, psychosocial stress, previous cardiovascular disease. For items refer to laboratory data – LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, fasting plasma glucose (diabetes mellitus). The last two are protective factors – physical activity and healthy diet.
Results
Every item has a number of risk points and protective factors decrease with 25% and 15% the calculated risk. The risk can be automatically calculated after the introduction of the required data through an algorithm available at www.cvrisk.ro. Here, the calculated risk is compared with optimal and maximal risk. Thus the user is motivated to initiate or to continue preventive measures also suggested at www.cvrisk.ro, to improve cardiovascular health.
Conclusion
CVRISK is not a substitute of current risk scores, but a complimentary tool to appreciate and modulate the individual cardiovascular risk. It can be useful to prevent CV disease or to improve its evolution. Individuals themselves can calculate it in order to maintain or improve their health."

abstract = "In parallel with the auditory afferent system, the auditory efferent system is active in all parts of the auditory pathways from auditory cortex to the cochlea. The auditory efferent system has two main segments: the rostral and the caudal parts. The rostral part, which starts from the cortical centers to thalamic nuclei and continues into collicular pathways in rostral brainstem, which sends its neural fibers to the main collicular nuclei especially inferior colliculus. The caudal part includes the olivocochlear bundle, which originates from the superior olivary complex and terminates on the cochlear hair cells. Most studies about the auditory efferent system have focused only on the caudal part using otoacoustic emission suppression test. Speech-evoked auditory brainstem response (S-ABR) as an electrophysiologic test that uses speech stimuli to simulate real-life auditory conditions, reflects the performance of rostral brainstem centers, so structurally seems to be an appropriate candidate to examine the rostral part of the auditory efferent system. Our hypothesis is that S-ABR in noisy condition, a typical condition for stimulating the auditory efferent system, has the potential to be used as an objective noninvasive electrophysiologic test for studying the rostral auditory efferent system in diagnosis and treatment/rehabilitation follow-ups. In addition, S-ABR can potentially reflect higher-order auditory functions and the effects of their dysfunctions on the lower brainstem. This characteristic makes S-ABR even more suitable tool for evaluation of the efferent system. To evaluate our hypothesis, Eighteen normal hearing subjects in the age range of 18–25 were tested in a pilot study for S-ABR in quiet mode and three signal to noise ratios of +10,0 and −10 for both ears. Then we checked the correlation between the results of S-ABR in different conditions and scores of auditory behavioral tests that auditory efferent system is involved in them: Consonant-Vowel perception in noise, dichotic Consonant-Vowel-Consonant and sound lateralization in noise. The results of our pilot study showed a significant correlation between S-ABR changes in noise with the scores of the behavioral tests in noisy or dichotic situations. Findings of the current study suggest that S-ABR with specific contralateral noise can be an appropriate option for evaluating the performance of rostral part of the auditory efferent system and may be suitable for top-down auditory training follow-ups, although the generalization of these results needs further studies in different groups with different auditory processing abnormalities or skills."

It is therefore postulated that female night workers when pregnant may expose the offspring to unwanted health threats. This may be explained by the fact that melatonin is essential for regulating energy metabolism and can influence reproductive activity. Moreover, the circadian misalignment caused by shift work affects fertility and the fetus, increasing the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and low birth weight, phenomena observed in night workers. Thus, we hypothesize that light-induced melatonin suppression as a result of night work may alter intrauterine metabolic programming in pregnant women, potentially leading to metabolic disorders in their offspring."

abstract = "Background context
Nonspecific low back pain (LBP) is a common disorder with a high economic, social and psychological burden. Many systems have been developed for evaluating the severity of LBP, though these are mainly based on scoring questionnaires for the functional status of the patients. Objective quantifiable methods relating LBP with anthropometric factors are scarce.
Purpose
To find the correlates of nonspecific LBP with spine shape variables and demographic characteristics. To investigate the possible relationship between the latter and the result of a questionnaire subjectively quantifying the severity of LBP.
Study Design/Setting
This is a pragmatic observational prospective cohort study.
Patient sample
218 subjects participated in this study. A first group of participants were 160 patients consulting at an osteopathic outpatient clinic for back pain complaints. The second group consisted of 58 healthy pain-free volunteers.
Outcome measures
The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used to quantify the degree of functional impairment due to low back pain. The surface topography of the back was registered statically with the Diers-4D formetric® system.
Methods
Multivariate analyses of the DIERS 4D formetric system recordings in the subjects with or without nonspecific, acute or chronic LBP.
Results
Different patterns between female and male subjects were found. Age, coronal and sagittal imbalance correlated with LBP in female subjects, whereas pelvic inclination, the trunk torsion and apical deviation correlated with LBP in male. Multivariate analyses allowed creating an algorithm to predict the functional disability (predicted LBP-score, PLBP), based on the above variables for females and males. Logistic stepwise regression analysis indicated the probability of a patient having a LBP-score above or below ODI 20 (P= <0.0001), which is considered the clinically relevant threshold value for justifying absence from work.
Conclusions
In this study LBP was correlated with spine shape variables leading to an algorithm predicting the functional disability of a patient due to LBP. Discrepancies between the model and the ODI result may suggest elements that are clinically relevant."

abstract = "The gaseous physiological modulator hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has recently been shown to exert a variety of neuroprotective effects. In particular, the treatment of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with agents that release H2S aids preservation of cognitive function, suppresses brain production of amyloid beta, and decreases tau phosphorylation. The possible physiological relevance of these findings is suggested by the finding that brain and plasma levels of H2S are markedly lower in AD patients than matched controls. Hence, nutraceutical strategies which boost brain synthesis or levels of H2S may have potential for prevention of AD. The chief enzyme which synthesizes H2S in brain parenchyma, cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), employs cysteine as its rate-limiting substrate, and is allosterically activated by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Supplemental taurine has been shown to boost expression of this enzyme, as well as that of another H2S source, cystathionine gamma-lyase, in vascular tissue, and to enhance plasma H2S levels; in rats subjected to hemorrhagic stroke, co-administration of taurine has been shown to blunt a marked reduction in brain CBS expression. Brain levels of SAM are about half as high in AD patients as in controls, and this is thought to explain the reduction of brain H2S in these patients. These considerations suggest that supplementation with cysteine, taurine, and agents which promote methyl group availability – such as SAM, folate, vitamin B12, and betaine – may have potential for boosting brain synthesis of H2S and thereby aiding AD prevention. Indeed, most of these agents have already demonstrated utility in mouse AD models – albeit the extent to which increased H2S synthesis contributes to this protection remains unclear. Moreover, prospective epidemiology has associated low dietary or plasma levels of folate, B12, and taurine with increased dementia risk. Rodent studies suggest that effective nutraceutical strategies for boosting brain H2S synthesis may in fact have broad neuroprotective utility, possibly aiding prevention and/or control not only of AD but also Parkinson’s disease and glaucoma, while diminishing the neuronal damage associated with brain trauma or stroke."

Nowadays, the initial adjustment of DBS parameters and their automatic matching proportion to the progression of the disease is viewed as one of the research areas discussed by the researchers, which is called closed-loop DBS. Various studies were conducted regarding finding the signal(s) which reflects different symptoms of the disease. Local Field Potential (LFP) is one of the signals that is suitable for using as feedback, because it can be recorded by the same implemented electrodes for stimulation. The present study aimed to identify the distinguishing features of patients from healthy individuals using LFP signals.
Methods
In the present study, LFP was recorded from the rats in sham and parkinsonian model groups. After evaluating the signals in the frequency domain, sixty-six features were extracted from power spectral density of LFPs. The features were classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM) to determine the ability of features for separating parkinsonian rats from healthy ones. Finally, the most effective features were selected for distinguishing between the sham and parkinsonian model groups using a genetic algorithm.

The results indicated that the frequency domain features of LFP signals from rats have capacity of using them as a feedback for closed-loop DBS. The accuracy of the Support Vector Machine classification using all 66 features was 80.42% which increased to 84.41% using 38 features selected by genetic algorithm. The proposed method not only increase the accuracy, but it also reduce computation by decreasing the number of the effective features. The results indicate the significant capacity of the proposed method for identifying the effective high-frequency features to control the closed-loop DBS.
Conclusions
The ability of using LFP signals as feedback in closed-loop DBS was shown by extracting useful information in frequency bands below and above 100 Hz regarding LFP signals of parkinsonian rats and sham ones. Based on the results, features at frequencies above 100 Hz were more powerful and robust than below 100 Hz. The genetic algorithm was used for optimizing the classification problem."

As we know, METH through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), specially type 4, and NF-κB signaling pathway causes neuro-inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Neuroprotective approach for management of METH-induced neurodegeneration, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, through a novel neuroprotective agent is continuously being superior to any kind of other therapeutic strategy. Therefore, the clarification, introduction and development of efficacious novel neuroprotective agent are demanded. During recent years, using new neuroprotective agent with therapeutic probability for treatment of METH-induced neuro-inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction has been astoundingly increased. Previous studies have stated the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory roles ofcannabinoid derivate such as cannabidiol (CBD) and delta–9–tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9–THC) in multiple neurodegenerative events and diseases. According to literature cannabinoid derivate, by inhibition of TLR4 and activation of NF-κB signaling pathway, exerts their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and cause mitochondrial biogenesis. Thus we hypothesized that by using cannabinoids in METH dependent subject it would provide neuroprotection against METH-induced neurodegeneration, neuro-inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction and probably can manage sequels of METH-induced neurochemical abuses via modulation of TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. In this article, we tried to discuss our hypothesis regarding the possible role of CBD and Δ9–THC, as a potent neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agents, in inhibition or treatment of METH-induced neurodegeneration, neuro-inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction through its effects on TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway."

The effects of the simultaneous administration of the SnMNA complex at extremely low concentrations and exposure to its rEMFs was also investigated. The emission of the 1H NMR spectrum of the complex alone or in a combination with low ineffective doses of the complex decreased LMS cell viability mainly through apoptosis. Moreover, the results from the in vivo experiments showed a significant prolongation of life expectancy in tumor-bearing rats exposed to the rEMFs alongside a deceleration in tumor growth rate.

In this hypothesis-based manuscript, I provide several lines of evidence that peptidase neurolysin (Nln) is one of the brain’s potent, self-protective mechanisms promoting preservation and recovery of the brain after acute injury. Based on published experimental observations and ongoing studies in our laboratory, I posit that Nln is a compensatory and cerebroprotective mechanism in the post-stroke/TBI brain that functions to process a diverse group of extracellular neuropeptides and by that to reduce excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, edema formation, blood brain barrier hyper-permeability, and neuroinflammation. If this hypothesis is correct, Nln could potentially serve as a single therapeutic target to modulate the function of multiple targets, the involved neuropeptide systems, critically involved in various mechanisms of brain injury and cerebroprotection/restoration. Such multi-pathway target would be highly desired for pharmacotherapy of stroke and TBI, because targeting one pathophysiological pathway has proven to be ineffective for such complex disorders."

From the collected data of 11 pairs of the diseased and clinically healthy skin, the healthy skin displayed lower Entropy values with mean μ = 2.56 ± 0.10 while skin affected by psoriasis displayed higher Entropy values with mean μ = 3.30 ± 0.19."

The peritoneal space has shown promising results, and in one of our studies we detected glucose changes in the peritoneal space already at the same time as in the femoral artery. The peritoneal lining is highly vascularised, covered by a single layer of mesothelial cells and therefore easily accessible for proper sensor technology, e.g. optical technology. We hypothesize that the rapid intraperitoneal glucose dynamics observed in our study was possible because the sensors were located directly at the peritoneal lining, at the point where the glucose molecules entered the peritoneal space. Glucose travels slowly in fluids by diffusion, and a longer distance between the sensor and the peritoneal lining would consequently result in slower dynamics. We therefore propose to place the glucose sensor in an artificial pancreas as closely to the peritoneal lining as possible, or even utilize appropriate sensor technology to measure glucose in the peritoneal lining itself."

Hypothesis of cancer immunostimulation after active immunization against carcinogens is based on a high cancer risk in persons with high levels of serum Abs specific to environmental carcinogens coupled with high levels of Abs to endogenous steroids stimulating the proliferation of target cells, for example, Abs to benzo[a]pyrene together with Abs to estradiol.

There are several mechanisms by which bacteria exhibit resistance to some antibiotics. These include drug inactivation or modification, elimination of antibiotics through efflux pumps, drug target alteration, and modification of metabolic pathway. However, it is difficult to treat infections caused by resistant bacteria by conventional existing therapy. In the present study binding affinities of some glitazones against ParE and MurE bacterial enzymes are investigated by in silico methods. As evident by extra-precision docking and binding free energy calculation (MM-GBSA) results, rivoglitazone exhibited higher binding affinity against both ParE and MurE enzymes compared to all other selected compounds. Further molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed to validate the stability of rivoglitazone/4MOT and rivoglitazone/4C13 complexes and to get insight into the binding mode of inhibitor. Thus, we hypothesize that structural modifications of the rivoglitazone scaffold can be useful for the development of an effective antibacterial agent."

abstract = "Recent clinical studies show a positive correlation between elevated plasma TMAO and increased cardiovascular risk. However, the mechanism of the increase and biological effects of TMAO in the circulatory system are obscure. Plasma TMAO level depends mostly on the following three factors. First, the liver produces TMAO from TMA, a gut bacteria metabolite of dietary choline and carnitine. Second, plasma TMAO increases after ingestion of dietary TMAO from fish and seafood. Finally, plasma TMAO depends on TMAO and TMA excretion by the kidneys. Ample evidence highlights protective functions of TMAO, including the stabilization of proteins and cells exposed to hydrostatic and osmotic stresses, for example in fish exposed to hydrostatic stress (deep water) and osmotic stress (salty water). Osmotic stress and hydrostatic stresses are augmented in cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. In hypertensive subjects a diastole-systole change in hydrostatic pressure in the heart may exceed 220 mmHg with a frequency of 60–220/min. This produces environment in which hydrostatic pressure changes over 100,000 times per 24 h. Furthermore, cardiovascular diseases are associated with disturbances in water-electrolyte balance which produce changes in plasma osmolarity. Perhaps, the increase in plasma TMAO in cardiovascular diseases is analogous to increased level of plasma natriuretic peptide B, which is both a cardiovascular risk marker and a compensatory response producing beneficial effects for pressure/volume overloaded heart. In this regard, there is some evidence that a moderate increase in plasma TMAO due to TMAO supplementation may be beneficial in animal model of hypertension-related heart failure. Finally, increased plasma TMAO is present in humans consuming seafood-rich diet which is thought to be health-beneficial. We hypothesize that increased plasma TMAO serves as a compensatory response mechanism which protects cells from hydrostatic and osmotic stresses."

Management of PHN is often suboptimal while using current conventional treatments. Antiviral therapy was used to reduce PHN-associated pain in two small trials which showed conflicting results. We hypothesize the analgesic efficacy of antiviral therapy on PHN is affected by patient characteristics including pathophysiology of the participants and serum vitamin D levels. Pathophysiology of PHN includes neuronal excitability and chronic VZV ganglionitis (persistent active VZV infection in ganglions). VZV-DNA positivity or a positive IgG coupled with a positive IgM indicates recent or current VZV infection. Positive VZV-DNA or IgG/IgM tests are used to confirm whether the patients experience chronic VZV ganglionitis. Antiviral therapy decreases pain in PHN patients with chronic VZV ganglionitis; whereas, antiviral therapy shows no effects in PHN patients with negative VZV-DNA or IgM. Vitamin D is a natural antiviral mediator. Studies show a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in hepatitis B/C virus-infected patients. Serum vitamin D levels and vitamin D supplementation are factors which affect the antiviral efficacy on hepatitis B/C virus infection. Serum 25-OHD levels of hospitalized patients with shingles were significantly lower compared to healthy controls. Accordingly, PHN patient may have a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency which negatively affects the antiviral efficacy. Vitamin D supplementation may improve the antiviral efficacy on PHN. Future trials regarding antiviral therapy on PHN should consider patient characteristics and should be conducted among different subgroups of PHN patients."

Although this disease is characterized by the demyelination process, the most important feature of the disease is its degenerative nature. This nature is clinically manifested as progressive symptoms, especially in patients’ walking, which can even lead to complete debilitation. Therefore, finding a treatment to prevent the degenerative processes is one of the most important goals in MS studies. To better understand the process and the effect of drugs, scientists use animal models which mostly consisting of mouse, rat, and monkey. In evolutionary terms, octopuses belong to the invertebrates which have many substantial differences with vertebrates. One of these differences is related to the nervous system of these organisms, which is divided into central and peripheral parts. The difference lies in the fact that the main volume of this system expands in the limbs of these organisms instead of their brain. This offers a kind of freedom of action and processing strength in the octopus limbs. Also, the brain of these organisms follows a non-somatotopic model. Although the complex actions of this organism are stimulated by the brain, in contrast to the human brain, this activity is not related to a specific region of the brain; rather the entire brain area of the octopus is activated during a process. Indeed, the brain mapping or the topological perception of a particular action, such as moving the limbs, reflects itself in how that activity is distributed in the octopus brain neurons. Accordingly, various actions are known with varying degrees of activity of neurons in the brain of octopus. Another important feature of octopuses is their ability to regenerate defective tissues including the central and peripheral nervous system. These characteristics raise the question of what features can an octopus show when it is used as an organism to create experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Can the immune system damage of the octopus brain cause a regeneration process? Will the autonomy of the organs reduce the severity of the symptoms? This article seeks to provide evidence to prove that use of octopuses as laboratory samples for generation of EAE may open up new approaches for researchers to better approach MS."

abstract = "Background
The hypotheses of autoimmune, allergic or infectious etiology of severe mental illness have been reported in the scientific literature repeatedly. The main objective of this work is to study the relationship of inflammatory, autoimmunity or recent infection markers with the fact of suffering Severe Mental Disorders (SMD).
Methods
In the present case-control study, adult patients with a diagnosis of SMD were compared with controls who underwent routine health checks that included analytical control. Cases with psychosis substance-induced and controls with diagnosis of any psychiatric illness were excluded. In both groups, patients with chronic inflammatory diseases or intercurrent infectious disease were also excluded. A set of common analytical parameters, markers of infectious diseases and inflammatory markers were retrieved for both groups, as well as demographic and clinical data.
Results
A total of 212 subjects (81 cases and 131 controls) were recruited. From cases, 70 (86.4%) have a diagnosis of Schizophrenia Disease (SD) and 11 (13.6%) of Schizoaffective Disorder (SAD). In the multivariate model the female sex (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.12–0.46) and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.91–4.70) were associated with the fact of being case.
Conclusions
Patients with SMD seem to have higher inflammatory markers compared to the general population, being the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, the marker associated with more strength. The role of inflammatory processes in the etiology of this type of disorders, if confirmed, opens interesting and innovative therapeutic possibilities."

abstract = "Metabolic targeting of liver 5-aminolevulinate synthase (5-ALAS) by inhibition of heme utilisation by tryptophan (Trp) 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) or the use of tryptophan is proposed as a therapy of acute hepatic porphyrias. 5-ALAS, the rate-limiting enzyme of heme biosynthesis, is under negative feedback control by a small regulatory heme pool in the hepatic cytosol. Acute porphyric attacks, precipitated by fasting, certain hormones and some drugs, involve induction of 5-ALAS secondarily to depletion of the above pool, and the resultant elevation of 5-ALA levels initiates the abdominal and neurological symptoms of attacks. By utilising the regulatory heme, cytosolic TDO undermines the feedback control, thus allowing 5-ALAS induction to occur, e.g. upon glucocorticoid induction of TDO during fasting (starvation) and exogenous glucocorticoid administration. Currently, glucose therapy is the preferred strategy for reversing moderate attacks induced by fasting (calorie restriction), with more severe attacks being treated by intravenous heme preparations. Reversal of fasting-induced attacks by glucose is explained by the previously demonstrated reversal of increased heme utilisation by TDO. Inhibitors of this utilisation are therefore potential therapeutic targets in acute attacks and also for maintenance of a symptomless state. Existing TDO inhibitors other than glucose include allopurinol, nicotinamide and recently developed potent inhibitors such as LM10 used in cancer therapy. Based on studies in rats, the hypothesis predicts that the safety or otherwise of drugs in the hepatic porphyrias is determined by their ability to inhibit TDO utilisation of heme under basal conditions or after glucocorticoid induction or heme activation of TDO, in parallel with reciprocal changes in 5-ALAS induction. Tryptophan is also proposed as a potential therapy of acute attacks either alone or as an adjunct to the recently proposed 5-ALAS1 gene silencing. Trp increases heme biosynthesis by enhancing 5-ALA dehydratase activity and, based on a Trp-5-ALA model presented herein, Trp offers several advantages over heme therapy, namely rapid conversion of 5-ALA into heme, a greatly enhanced heme availability, a near complete inhibition of 5-ALAS induction, assumed rapid clearance of 5-ALA and hence accelerated resolution of symptoms of attacks, and finally provision of the neuroprotective metabolite kynurenic acid to neutralise the neurological symptoms. The hypothesis also addresses heme regulation in species lacking the TDO free apoenzyme and its glucocorticoid induction mechanism and proposes detailed assessment of heme biosynthesis in these species. Detailed proposals for testing the hypothesis are presented."

Short-term acute care public county hospitals in the US were a mainstay of much “safety net” medical care in the early twentieth century. The private sector currently provides much of what was in the past public medical care. Does this transition affect health care indices?
Methods
The presence of public hospitals was determined for the 50 largest metropolitan areas using the American Hospital Directory databases. Health care indices assessed included birth rate, death rate, infant mortality, the American Fitness Index, and a derived Composite Health Index. Co-variables included size of population and geographic location. Data were compiled in 2017, using databases between 2006 and 2017.
Results
Over half (56%) the largest fifty metropolitan areas in the US still have acute care public hospitals, less often in the East. Birth rates were higher (Kruskal-Wallis, P = 0.02) and death rates lower (KW, P = 0.03) in metropolitan areas with such public hospitals, infant mortality (P = 0.09), the AFI (P = 0.73) and the Composite Health Index (P = 0.64) did not differ by their presence. With a multivariable analysis, geographic area most affected the Composite Health Index.
Conclusion
By this model, health care indices do not differ by the presence of an acute care, publically funded and administered governmental hospital and the future of acute-care public hospitals in their traditional format is in doubt."

The physics-based analysis demonstrates that the morphology and physical attributes of the major thoracic veins, and their tributary confluent veins, together with the attributes of the flowing blood, predict transition from laminar to non-laminar flow, primarily vortex flow, at select vein curvatures and junctions. Non-laminar, vortex flow results in the development of immobile stenotic valves and intraluminal flow obstructions, particularly in the internal jugular veins (IJVs) and in the azygos vein (AV) at their confluences with the SVC or BVs. Clinical trials’ observations of vascular flow show that regions of low and reversing flow are associated with endothelial malformation. The physics-based analysis predicts the growth of intraluminal flaps and septa at segments of vein curvature and flow confluences. The analysis demonstrates positive correlations between predicted and clinically observed elongation of valve leaflets and between the predicted and observed prevalence of immobile valves at various venous flow confluences. The analysis predicts the formation of sclerotic plaques at venous junctions and curvatures, in locations that are analogous to plaques in atherosclerosis. The analysis predicts that increasing venous compliance increases the laminarity of venous flow and reduces the prevalence and severity of vein malformations and plaques, a potentially significant clinical result. An over-arching observation is that the correlations between predicted phenomena and clinically observed phenomena are sufficiently positive that the physics-based approach represents a new means for understanding the relationships between venous flow in MS and clinically observed venous malformations."

We located Heschl’s gyrus (HG) in utero during antenatal development. The antenatal location of the HG will allow us to evaluate adaptations of the human foetal cortex in response to auditory stimuli.
Methods
We classified 244 human foetuses between 18 and 41 weeks’ gestation using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) ultrasounds according to foetal neurological development: Foetal Stage, Extremely Preterm, Very Preterm, Moderate to Late Preterm, and Term. We considered two HG shapes: single gyrus (SG) and duplicated gyrus (DG). We studied two subtypes of the DG shape: partial and complete duplicated gyrus.
Results
We found 156 cases (63.9%) of single gyrus and 88 cases (36.1%) of duplicated gyrus, of which 39 (44.3%) showed a partial duplication and 49 (55.7%) showed complete duplication. SG appeared in 93.5% of cases in the Foetal Stage and represented 75% of the Term group. DG increased during foetal life. In the Very Preterm group, the relation between SG and DG was detected in 50%, so that DG (59.1%) was more prevalent than SG (40.9%) in the Moderate to Late Preterm group, and the majority of foetuses were found to exhibit SG (75%) in the Term group. The observed increase in DG was due to the complete duplicated gyrus subtype. We did not find differences between hemispheres in any of the groups.
Conclusion
We located the foetal Heschl’s gyrus and the SG and DG shapes. The peculiar pattern in each foetal neurological stage could show a functional sign in a cortical area with a remarkable adaptation capacity."

abstract = "Background
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating CNS disease. Most MS cases are sporadic, however about 20 percent of them are hereditary (Ramagopalan and Sadovnick, 2011). The incidence of familial MS is greater in regions with the highest prevalence of this disease (in North America, Europe) (Ramagopalan and Sadovnick, 2011). It is still unclear whether heredity affects the progression and severity of the disease. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of heredity on the development of multiple sclerosis and on the course of disease by analyzing the results of disability and severity scales, as well as clinical studies, and comparing them with sporadic cases.
Methods
Our study included 104 patients with MS. The study group was comprised of 38 patients with history of first degree relative also affected by MS; the control group consisted of 66 patients with no family history (sporadic case). The anonymous survey included questions about demographic and clinical characteristics. Diagnostic results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), oligoclonal bands (OCBs) and visual evoked potentials (VEP) were evaluated retrospectively from medical records. Disability assessment was made according to expanded disability status scale (EDSS). Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS) score was calculated using conversion table based on EDSS score and duration of disease in years.
Results
MS patients with first degree relative affected by MS tend to have slower onset of the disease, while control group is more likely to have an acute onset (p < 0.001). The majority of MS with family history considered that their disease is caused by certain factors, while patients in the control group considered that the disease started without any identifiable cause (p < 0.05). Study group more often complained of pyramidal disorders (74% vs. 50%), symptoms related to brainstem (68% vs. 20%) and cortical lesions (47% vs. 20%), headache (37% vs. 9%), back pain (32% vs. 9%) than those in control group, p < 0.05. The degree of disability according to EDSS and MSSS scores were higher in the group of patients with first degree relative with MS (p < 0.05). The number of exacerbations per year was also higher in study group than in the control group (1.4 vs. 0.8; p < 0.05). Patients with a family history have a higher incidence of MRI changes in brainstem (74% vs. 30%) and cerebellum (58% vs. 30%) than the control group (p < 0.01).
Conclusions
MS patients with a family history of MS tend to have slower onset of the disease, while control group is more likely to have an acute onset. Patients with a family history of MS more often complained of brainstem and cortical dysfunction, and pain in head or back. Both the degree of disability according to EDSS and MSSS scores were higher in familial cases. They also have a higher number of exacerbations per year. Patients with a history of first degree relative with MS have a higher incidence of MRI changes in brainstem and cerebellum."

In addition, β-catenin expression is significantly decreased in more aggressive and metastatic melanoma. Multiple observational studies have shown smokers to have significantly lower rates of PD as well as melanoma implying that tobacco may contain one or more elements that protect against both conditions. In support, smoker’s brains have significantly reduced levels of α-synuclein, a pathological intracellular protein found in PD brain and melanoma cells. Tobacco contains very high lithium levels compared to other plants. Lithium has a broad array of neuroprotective actions, including enhancing autophagy and reducing intracellular α-synuclein levels, and is effective in both neurotoxin and transgenic preclinical PD models. One of lithium’s neuroprotective actions is enhancement of β-catenin-mediated activity leading to increased Nurr1 expression through its ability to inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3 β (GSK-3β). Lithium also has anti-proliferative effects on melanoma cells and the clinical use of lithium is associated with a reduced incidence of melanoma as well as reduced melanoma-associated mortality. This is the first known report hypothesizing that inhaled lithium from smoking may account for the associated reduced rates of both PD and melanoma and that this protection may be mediated, in part, through lithium-induced GSK-3β inhibition and consequent enhanced β-catenin-mediated activity. This hypothesis could be directly tested in clinical trials assessing lithium therapy’s ability to affect β-catenin-mediated activity and slow disease progression in patients with PD or melanoma."

The mutation alone is not sufficient for the occurrence of HO since flare-ups are triggered by inflammation and activation of the innate immune system. A number of cellular and humoral mediators have been implicated in animal and in vitro models. Observations in humans support the inflammatory nature of the condition, but data on the involved mediators are variable. We hypothesize that for induction of flare-ups in patients with FOP increase in at least one of the pro-inflammatory cytokines is both essential and sufficient to trigger the entire process of the inflammatory cells influx resulting in the novel ectopic bone formation and we suggest that C–C motif ligand 5 (CCL5), a pro-inflammatory chemokine also known as Regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), might be the key candidate. CCL5 is a chemoattractant for all cellular types implicated in HO and is produced by the cells of the tissue microenvironment at the sites of HO as well as by the pro-inflammatory cellular mediators. CCL5 induces ossification in cultured human pluripotent mesenchymal cells (hMSCs) and in the primary culture of monocytes from FOP patients (but not from their healthy relatives), stimulation with lipopolysaccharide induces CCL5 expression. Finally, in a pilot study we used a panel of 23 cytokines and chemokines to screen the plasma samples of three subjects: a female patient with FOP during a flare-up; a female patient with hyperostosis corticalis generalisata (van Buchem disease), another rare disease characterized by excessive bone formation at the sites where it regularly occurs that does not include inflammatory events; and a healthy woman without bone disorders. There appeared a rather clear-cut signal of a 2-fold higher level of CCL5 in the FOP patient vs. the healthy subject and the van Buchem patient. Evaluation of the hypothesis would require an international prospective study, with main motivation being the lack of a conclusive treatment as the major unmet need in FOP. A treatment targeting CCL5 receptor already exists and is used in HIV-infected patients."

abstract = "Tarlov cysts (TCs) consist of dilated nerve root sheaths filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and are most frequently found in the sacrum. It is estimated that 25% of detected TCs cause chronic pain and intestinal and urogenital symptoms due to compression of the sacral nerve root fibers inside the TC. Unfortunately, symptomatic TCs are frequently overlooked. It is assumed that TCs result from pathologically increased hydrostatic pressure (HP) in the dural sac that forces CSF into the nerve root sheaths. We hypothesize that in patients with TCs, increased spinal hydrostatic pressure is always associated with increased intracranial pressure. This hypothesis of increased cerebrospinal pressure might explain why patients with sacral TCs frequently report distant symptoms, such as headaches and pain in the neck and arms. In this paper, we describe a case report that provides evidence for this hypothesis. A 30-year-old man presented for the first time in our clinic complaining of lower back, leg, thoracic, neck, and arm pain; headaches; and bladder, bowel, and sphincter symptoms. He was born prematurely and suffered cerebral intraventricular bleeding followed by progressive hydrocephalus. Progression was stabilized with acetazolamide and lumbar punctures. At 19 years of age, his head circumference had further increased and he reported back pain and headaches. Fundoscopy showed no papilledema, and lumbar puncture for CSF evacuation improved the headaches and back pain. The former medical team chose not to insert a ventriculo-external shunt. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed significant dilation of all the ventricles. No CSF flow obstruction between the ventricles was observed. Surprisingly, MRI of the lumbar and sacral spine showed multiple large TCs. This case report indicates that hydrocephalus with a patent aqueduct may be associated with TCs because the increased intracranial pressure is transferred to the spinal canal. While increased intracranial pressure causes dilation of the ventricles, the associated increased spinal pressure may cause dilation of multiple spinal nerve root sheaths to form TCs. Furthermore, while the increased volume of the ventricles gradually compresses the neurons and axons of the brain against the bony skull, simultaneously, the increased pressure inside the nerve sheaths may also gradually compress the neurons and axons located inside the dorsal root ganglia and spinal nerves, resulting in neuropathic pain, sensory abnormalities, and neurogenic bladder and bowel symptoms. Hydrocephalus patients reporting neuropathic pain should be screened for the presence of TCs."

The endocannabinoid system represents a potential target for IC treatment and management. Activation of cannabinoid receptor 2 (CBR2) with various agonists has previously been shown to reduce leukocyte differentiation and migration, in addition to inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines at the site of inflammation. These receptors have been identified in the detrusor and sensory nerves of the urothelium in various mammalian species, including humans. We hypothesize that by inhibiting the enzymes responsible for the catabolism of endogenous cannabinoids locally, bladder concentrations of CBR2 agonists will increase, particularly 2-arachidonyl glycerol, resulting in a diminished inflammatory response."

In this case, a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet is effective for the amelioration or prevention of symptoms. However, the reason is not fully explained. This report proposes a hypothesis regarding the entire process in which inflammatory bowel disease with IBS-like symptoms (IBD-IBS) causes symptoms. A detailed process was assumed, starting from high pressure in the lumen and finally to abdominal symptoms. In this process, relationships were linked based on interactions such as ischemia, compliance, pain threshold, visceral hypersensitivity, mast cells, and permeability reported in IBD-IBS. In the process mapping, to understand the relationship between the amount of gas increased by FODMAP and ischemia, the hydrodynamic hypothesis and Ritchie’s hypothesis were adapted. Ischemia in dilated intestines due to an increase in gas volume can induce excessive spasms via the mast cells and show the whole process of lowering the pain threshold. From the standpoint of the mechanism of IBD-IBS, the origin trigger may be FODMAP. Therefore, a low-FODMAP diet is recommended to relieve and prevent IBD-IBS symptoms."

Identifying socioeconomic contexts and parental behaviors in early life that may be associated with negative outcomes in the child’s future and their causal mechanisms can contribute to planning early interventions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose and discuss possible ways to explain how early childhood stimulation may be associated with future oral health status, based on the life-course theory of chain-of-risk model and accumulation of risk model. Two hypotheses were suggested: (1) each social exposure or parental behavior in the child’s first years of life increase the risk of chronic diseases, such as dental caries in primary dentition, in a simply additive effect; (2) parental factors could negatively influence the establishment of the pattern of child stimulation (child care) or lead to a modification of the established behavior on the risk of dental caries in the child primary dentition. Prevention of dental caries seems to be the most feasible way of solving this serious public health problem. It therefore justifies the importance of identifying exposures in the child’s early life that may lead to the occurrence of chronic diseases in the future. The evidence seem to converge to the idea that child stimulation in early life may be associated with future health problems related to behaviors and care by parents, including caries."

Moreover an ideal vaccine must cover all individuals in a population that is dependent to the kinds of human leukocyte antigen alleles. Concerning these issues, our study was aimed to in silico design of a multi-epitope tetanus vaccine (METV) in order to improve population coverage and protectivity of tetanus vaccine as well as reduction of complications. Concerning these issues, a novel rational filtration was implemented to design a novel METV using immunoinformatics and surface epitope mapping approaches. Prediction of epitopes for tetanus toxin was performed in the candidate country in which the frequency had been gathered from almost all geographical distributions. The most strong binder epitopes for major histocompatibility complex class II were selected and among them the surface epitopes of native toxin were selected. The population coverage of the selected epitopes was estimated. The final candidate epitopes had highly population coverage. Molecular docking was performed to prediction of binding affinity of our candidate epitopes to the HLA-DRB1 alleles. At first, 680 strong binder epitopes were predicted. Among them 11 epitopes were selected. Finally, 4 epitopes had the most population coverage and suggested as a tetra-epitope tetanus vaccine. 99.41% of inessential strong binders were deleted using our tree steps filtration. HLA-DP had the most roles in epitope presentation. Molecular docking analysis proved the strong binding affinity of candidate epitopes to the HLA-DRB1 alleles. In conclusion, we theoretically reduced 99.41% of unwanted antibodies using our novel filtration strategies. Our tetra-epitope tetanus vaccine showed 100% population coverage in the candidate country. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that HLA-DP and HLA-DQ had more potential in epitope presentation in comparison to HLA-DRB1."

Studies have found that the balance of Th1/Th2 determines the development trend of TPE. High concentrations of IFN-γ and TNF-α in pleural effusion are associated with pleural adhesion in patients with TPE. Interleukin-27 is a member of the IL-12 family, and IL-27 has a dual regulatory effect on Th1 immunity. On one hand, IL-27 can promote the initial CD4+ T cell proliferation by inducing the expression of T-bet, IL-12Rβ2 and ICAM-1 in the initial CD4+ T cells, and also promote its differentiation into Th1 cells and IFN-γ production in the early infection. On the other hand, in the case of high Th1 polarization, IL-27 induced STAT3 phosphorylation and inhibited TNF and IL-12 production in activated peritoneal macrophages, indicating a novel feedback mechanism by which IL-27 can modulate excessive inflammation, thereby preventing damage to the body caused by excessive immune response. Studies haves confirmed that after stimulation of antigen by mononuclear cells in TPE, the Th1 and Th2 cell subsets and Th1/Th2 ratio markedly increase, and the increase of Th1 is more obvious than that of Th2. Therefore, compared to patients with TPE in the high-level IL-27 group, we hypothesized that pleural effusion is absorbed more slowly, pleural thickening is more obvious, pleural adhesions are more extensive, and the incidence of thoracic collapse is higher in the low-level IL-27 group under the same conditions of anti-tuberculosis treatment. However, exogenous intrapleural injection of IL-27 may induce Stat3 phosphorylation and inhibit TNF and IL-12 production, finally reduces the secretion of IFN-γ and TNF-α. This negative regulation inhibits the excessive inflammatory reaction caused by tuberculosis infection, reduces pleural adhesion, pleural thickening and local pleural tissue damage, thereby improving the prognosis of patients."

Many studies have shown that tinnitus perception and its correlations are not limited to the activity of a single brain area, but there are several networks involved in tinnitus generation, perception, and interpretation. One of the most important complications and comorbidity of tinnitus is tinnitus distress. Various studies have revealed that tinnitus distress is the product of multiple networks activity, namely the tinnitus distress network; some of them overlap with the perception and cognitive networks. Such an overlapping between the tinnitus perception network and the distress network brings to mind the role of stress on tinnitus perception. Moreover, tinnitus perception networks overlap the auditory perception network leading to the hypothesis that tinnitus distress might affect the functional status of the auditory cortex indexed by the auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), and consequently, the diversity in findings of studies concerning the AEPs in tinnitus sufferers could be interpreted by the amount of stress they have."

Conversion of plant derived thiocyanates into cyanide and isocyanic acid occurs by the activity of neutrophil-derived enzyme myeloperoxidase. Therefore, increased intake of cyanogenic glycoside rich plant based diet may lead to increased isocyanic acid induced protein carbamylation in chronic inflammatory states (increased myeloperoxidase activity). As there is a close relationship between non-enzymatic post-translational modification and protein function, carbamylation induced structural changes also affect the functions of proteins. Carbamylation induced structural alterations of proteins have recently drawn a great attention in the current literature, especially regarding the alterations of proteins with long half-life such as type I collagen, elastin, α-crystallin. We hypothesize that a plant-based natural diet, rich in cyanogenic glycosides, may have unintended consequences on native protein structure/function in individuals with chronic inflammatory diseases such as chronic kidney and rheumatological diseases because of the higher rate of transformation of plant derived thiocyanates into isocyanic acid by the increased activity of neutrophil-derived enzyme myeloperoxidase. Regulation of myeloperoxidase activity or moderation of cyanogenic glycoside rich diet might be important in the prevention/modulation of dangerous protein carbamylation process, especially in this patient group."

Purpose
In this opinion article intermittent exposure is presented as the stimulus for development and evolutionary conservation of circadian rhythm, an endogenous, entrainable oscillation of approximately 24 h, to counteract/balance the cells’ natural tendency to attenuate their response during long-term exposure to different endogenous substances.
Results
The concept of Yin and Yang duality is an allegory on which the avoidance of attenuation of the cells’ responses hypothesis is presented as an explanation for the circadian rhythmicity, which is integrated in all human cells, with the exception of stem and cancer cells.
Conclusions
We hypothesize, that circadian rhythmicity has evolved, during evolution, into a mechanism that prevents disruption of the organism's negative-feedback-loop homeostasis."

abstract = "Cancer is the second cause of death worldwide, but current therapies are often insufficient or linked with toxicity. Initial evidence in scientific literature seems to support the role of non-pharmacological strategies, including hypoglycemia, in cancer treatment. The biological rationale for hypoglycemia-based treatment of cancer resides in the evidence that cancer cells predominantly utilize glucose as an energy source; notably, cancer cells seem to have damaged glycolysis regulation and few, defective mitochondria showing impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Preliminary data arising from both preclinical and human studies support the role of hypoglycemia in inducing apoptosis on cancer cells. In this paper, we describe how to induce and maintain severe hypoglycemia without causing damage to either the brain or the heart. Our hypothesis is that ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) and selective glucose perfusion of the carotid vessels are able to maintain severe hypoglycemia without causing cardiac or brain damage. This will allow physicians to study the effect of severe hypoglycemia on cancer cell apoptosis in vivo."

Despite the innovation of several new procedures in the last few years, the cure rate of complex anal fistula has not improved much. This points out that there is some flaw with our current understanding of the disease pathogenesis as well as its management. All the surgical procedures described to treat anal fistulas in complex anal fistulas were analyzed. The reasons were sought as why most of the procedures don’t work well in complex fistulas. Based on that, the pathophysiology of complex anal fistula was understood from a totally new perspective. The new hypothesis has been categorized in three cardinal principles-Intersphincteric tract is like an abscess in a closed space (ISTAC), draining all pus and ensuring continuous drainage (DRAPED) and healing occurs progressively till it is interrupted irreversibly by a collection (HOPTIC). The surgical procedures which take care of all these three principles have a high success rate in complex fistulas. The success rate falls in the procedures which ignore one or more of these principles. These principles are logical and are basics of wound healing process anywhere in the body but were somehow ignored in the management of complex anal fistulas. These principles fill the void in the understanding of complex anal fistula and when integrated in the management, the cure rate improves drastically."

Although there are ongoing clinical trials to test the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis, there has not been any proposal to test the efficacy of IFN α-2b together with hydroxychloroquine to increase protection against COVID-19. Since the two act on two different mechanisms, we strongly believe that the two could have additive effects in prophylaxis against COVID-19. We recommend using a randomized control study to prove efficacy and safety."

Hypnosis is an appealing and valuable model to manipulate subjective experience and get an insight on both the physiology and the pathophysiology of the mind-brain functioning; it and has been closely connected with DIDs and possession since its origin in 18th century and as recently proved the capacity to yield a loss of sense of agency, mimicking delusions of alien control and spirit possession. In this study we report on five very uncommon “hypnotic virtuosos” (HVs) free from any psychiatric disorder, spontaneously undergoing the emergence of multiple identities during neutral hypnosis; this allowed us to check the relationship between their experience and fMRI data. During hypnosis the subjects underwent spontaneous non-intrusive experiences of other selves which were not recalled after the end of the session, due to post-hypnotic amnesia. The fMRI showed a significant decrease of connectivity in the Default Mode Network (DMN) especially between the posterior cingulate cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex. Our results and their contrast with the available data on fMRI in DIDs allows to draw the hypothesis of a continuum between healthy mind – where multiple identities may coexist at unconscious level and may sometimes emerge to the consciousness – and DIDs, where multiple personalities emerge as dissociated, ostensibly autonomous components yielding impaired functioning, subject’s loss of control and suffering. If this is the case, it seems more reasonable to refrain from seeking for a clear-cut limit between normality (anyway a conventional, statistical concept) and pathology, and accept a grey area in between, where ostensibly odd but non-pathological experiences may occur (including so-called non-ordinary mental expressions) without calling for treatment but, rather, for being properly understood."

Colon cancer is the 4th most common cancer causing death in both male and female equally, mainly caused due to the improper diet plans, consumption of the red meat and lack of exercise. Although the design of the chemotherapeutic drugs is well advanced, many of them developed resistance towards the cancer cells. The major reason behind the drug resistance in the colon cancer cells is due to the action exhibited by P-gp, which belongs to a member of ABC transporter family. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) effluxes the drug from its entry into the cancer cells, by treating it as a foreign body and hence decreases the therapeutic concentration of chemotherapeutic drugs inside the cancer cells. For overcoming this scenario, we posit the use of the curcumin (as a flavonoid) along with the lipid and the chemotherapeutic drug to provide an effective therapy and to overcome the possible issues associated with the failure in the therapy. Curcumin possesses dual mode of actions as a chemosensitizing agent and also as a chemotherapeutic drug. It generally acts as a chemosensitizer which can alter or inhibit the efflux pump exhibited by P-gp and provide a pathway for the entry of the chemotherapeutic drug into the cancer cells. Lipids have the potential to overcome the Multidrug resistance (MDR) and related issues; in addition, lipids are used for targeting colon cancer cells and also can act during the metastatic condition of the cancer which is hypothesised to be proven by using various studies. If our hypothesis is proven, the use of curcumin with lipids and the chemotherapeutic drug in a novel combination will reduces the majority of the issues related to the multidrug resistance, the recurrence and the spread of cancer could be overcome in a safe and effective manner."

In this study, we aimed to determine speech laterality via EEG signals by using noninvasive machine learning techniques. The retrospective study included 67 subjects aged 18–65 years who had no chronic diseases and were diagnosed as healthy based on EEG examination. The subjects comprised 35 right-hand dominant (speech center located in the left hemisphere) and 32 left-hand dominant individuals (speech center located in the right hemisphere). A spectrogram was created for each of the 18 EEG channels by using various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet, MobileNet, NasNet, and DenseNet. These architectures were used to extract features from the spectrograms. The extracted features were classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the classification performances of the CNN models were evaluated using Area Under the Curve (AUC). Of all the CNN models used in the study, VGG16 had a higher AUC value (0.83 ± 0.05) in the determination of speech laterality compared to all other models. The present study is a pioneer investigation into the determination of speech laterality via EEG signals with machine learning techniques, which, to our knowledge, has never been reported in the literature. Moreover, the classification results obtained in the study are promising and lead the way for subsequent studies though not practically feasible."

abstract = "The function of sleep in mammal and other vertebrates is one of the great mysteries of biology. Many hypotheses have been proposed, but few of these have made even the slightest attempt to explain the essence of sleep – the uncompromising need for reversible unconsciousness. During sleep, epiphenomena – often of a somatic character – occur, but these cannot explain the core function of sleep. One answer could be hidden in the observations made for long periods of time of the function of the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is faced with conflicting requirements on stability and excitability. A high level of excitability is desirable, and is also a prerequisite for sensitivity and quick reaction times; however, it can also lead to instability and the risk of feedback, with life-threatening epileptic seizures. Activity-dependent negative feedback in neuronal excitability improves stability in the short term, but not to the degree that is required. A hypothesis is presented here demonstrating how calibration of individual neurons – an activity which occurs only during sleep – can establish the balanced and highest possible excitability while also preserving stability in the CNS. One example of a possible mechanism is the observation of slow oscillations in EEGs made on birds and mammals during slow wave sleep. Calibration to a genetically determined level of excitability could take place in individual neurons during the slow oscillation. This is only possible offline, which explains the need for sleep. The hypothesis can explain phenomena such as the need for unconsciousness during sleep, with the disconnection of sensory stimuli, slow EEG oscillations, the relationship of sleep and epilepsy, age, the effects of sleep on neuronal firing rate and the effects of sleep deprivation and sleep homeostasis. This is with regard primarily to mammals, including humans, but also all other vertebrates."

abstract = "Caffeine is a well-established ergogenic aid, with its performance-enhancing effects replicated across a variety of exercise types. Caffeine exerts its performance-benefits through many mechanisms, including acting as an adenosine receptor antagonist, and serving to reduce sensations of fatigue and pain. One potential mechanism that is currently underexplored is whether caffeine’s bitter taste mediates some of its ergogenic effects, which is discussed in this article. Previous research has demonstrated that bitter tastants have the ability to enhance performance, and this effect is mediated by bitter taste receptors in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, the ability to detect bitter tastes is subject to individual variation, raising the potential that the demonstrated inter-individual response to a standardised caffeine dose is potentially driven by differences in taste response. Finally, it appears that some of caffeine’s performance-enhancing effects are driven by expectancy. As bitter taste may serve as a signal that caffeine has been ingested, it is possible that some of the expectancy effects of caffeine ingestion are driven by its bitter taste. These aspects all have potentially important implications for future research, as well as for how athletes and coaches utilise caffeine around competition, both of which are explored in depth here."

Novel antidiabetic drugs, such as glucagone-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists have demonstrated benefitial effect on weight reduction. Nevertheless, in the last decades the need for new therapeutic strategies in the management of adiposity have emerged. Both adiposity and T2DM have negative effect on hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Conversely, it has been known that sex hormone replacement therapy improves metabolic parameters in hypogonadal subjects. Recent research has found potential therapeutic effect of combination therapies with sex hormones and GLP-1 agonists in reducing body weight. Based on the aforementioned, we hypothesize that there is a possible synergistic effect of GLP-1 agonists and sex hormones on body mass reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes. The possible additional effect of sex hormones on weight loss could contribute to more effective treatment of T2DM and its complications."

This prospect, if methodically probed, could further pave way for the discovery of novel anti-AD drugs with improved pharmacokinetics and therapeutic potential. To this effect, for the first time, we employed a four-step paradigm that integrated our in-house per-residue energy decomposition (PRED) protocol coupled with molecular dynamics, cheminformatics and analytical binding free energy methods. This was geared towards the screening and identification of new leads that exhibit modulatory potentials towards mATPase in a J147-similar pattern. Interestingly, from a large-scale library of compounds, we funnelled down on three potential hits that demonstrated selective and high-affinity binding activities towards α-F1-ATP synthase (ATP5A) relative to J147. Moreover, these compounds exhibited higher binding propensity with a differential ΔGs greater than −1 kcal/mol comparative to J147, and also elicited distinct modulatory effects on ATP5A domain structures. More interestingly, per-residue pharmacophore modeling of these lead compounds revealed similar interactive patterns with crucial residues at the α-site region of ATP5A characterized by high energy contributions based on binding complementarity. Recurrent target residues involved in high-affinity interactions with the hit molecules relative to J147 include Arg1112 and Gln426. Furthermore, assessments of pharmacokinetics revealed that the lead compounds were highly drug-like with minimal violations of the Lipinski’s rule of five. As developed in this study, the most extrapolative pharmacophore model of the selected hits encompassed three electron donors and one electron acceptor. We speculate that these findings will be fundamental to the reformation of anti-AD drug discovery procedures."

We hypothesise that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition is a logical intervention in the treatment of idiopathic oedema, having effects on obesity, blood pressure, impaired glucose tolerance, sympathetic overdrive, and reduction in swelling – the most common and distressing complaint. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition by promoting greater electrolyte-free, but glucose driven, water clearance with preferential fluid clearance from the interstitial space, without compromising intravascular volume, may provide symptomatic relief of swelling and bloating. The consequent weight reduction secondary to caloric loss from renal glycosuria and decreased adiposity would prevent disease progression of type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes. With diminished adrenergic output from central and peripheral autonomic influences, reduction of blood pressure occurs, and by similar mechanisms, anxiety may be reduced."

However, recent experimental researches with motor learning paradigms are consistently showing that increasing cardiorespiratory capacity is not the only mechanism able to promote positive outcomes in GMD with exercise. In the present study, we present a theoretical suggestion that expanding one’s motor repertoire is another primary mechanism related to the increases in GMD. Motor repertoire can be understood as the number of movement possibilities and motor skills that can be performed by a person. Supporting our suggestion, professional athletes present higher GMD than controls, and experimental protocols repeatedly observes positive changes in GMD following motor learning. The relationship between physical inactivity, amputation, and lower GMD values also gives further support for the hypothesis. Follow-up studies monitoring GMD before and after training programs that stimulate new motor skill learning are essential to confirm this proposition. The brain regions related to sensory processing of the motor tasks and the cortical areas related to motor control (e.g., primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area) are probably the ones most affected by plastic changes. If the hypothesis turns out to be reliable, dancing, gymnastics, and other movement-rich activities are thoroughly encouraged for this purpose. Therefore, this approach might be used to attenuate GMD loss related to aging or another condition, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s."

The theory proposes that following a positive response, homeostatic changes in brain circuits may function to go opposite to the positive response, thus a cognitive deterioration may incur in later life in the individuals who exposed to amphetamine earlier. Along with the hypothesis, amphetamine is also highly associated with the working hypothesis updated for dementia in terms of beta-amyloid cascade, tau protein, oxidative stress and neural inflammation. Finally, we presented two practical methods to evaluate the hypothesis. In non-human approach, rat model of amphetamine dependence would be employed together with evaluations of behavioral performance of memory test and neurochemical markers associated with oxidative stress. In human approach, a matched-cohort design observational study would be highly recommended."

In mammalian cortical and subcortical neurons, small to modest acidification (<0.4–0.5 pH-units) is belonging to the key strategies for controlling local excitability and is associated with neuroprotection, e.g. by limiting excitotoxicity. Such acidifications are furthermore involved in the mechanisms of some anticonvulsants and antidepressants. As AA-transport and regulation of intracellular pH (pHi) are closely interwoven on the level of special transmembrane solute carriers, I suppose that the aforementioned beneficial AA-effects might be based upon a discrete “hormetic” acidification of cortical and or subcortical neurons via an AA-mediated weakening of their pHi-regulation. This assumption is supported by findings in non-neuronal cells suggesting both, intracellular acidification and inhibition of a core-element of the pHi-regulation apparatus by millimolar AA. In mammalian subcortical neurons, there is already first evidence of a modest acidification after adding low millimolar AA."

Furthermore, since serum NO level is an early marker of atherosclerosis and related CV disorders, which are commonly present and follow hypothyreosis and greatly contribute to overall QoL, we further hypothesized that NO level would correlate with Thyroid Symptom Questionnaire (TSQ) and General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ12) scores in hypothyroid patients. A collaterally of our hypothesis was that levothyroxine (LT4) treatment would affect serum NO levels as well as TSQ and GHQ12 scores. Therefore, we have analyzed lipid profile, the level of NO and QoL scores in female patients diagnosed with SCH and CH in order to determine the correlation between NO and generic and thyroid disease symptoms in treatment naïve SCH and CH patients and after LT4 treatment and laboratory euthyroidism achievement. As a consequence of our hypothesis is that measurement of serum NO level in SCH and CH patients may be an innovative way to improve LT4 treatment efficacy. This assumption could have a practical significance for future investigations regarding the management of hypothyroidism treatment protocols in current guidelines."

New research, however, clarifies that cancers evoking cachexia release microvesicles rich in heat shock proteins 70 and 90, and that these extracellular heat shock proteins induce cachexia by serving as agonists for toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in skeletal muscle, macrophages, and adipocytes. Hence, safe nutraceutical measures which can down-regulate TLR4 signaling can be expected to aid prevention and control of cancer cachexia. There is reason to suspect that phycocyanobilin, ferulic acid, glycine, long-chain omega-3s, green tea catechins, β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, carnitine, and high-dose biotin may have some utility in this regard."

abstract = "There is large support in literature linking tinnitus to dental occlusion and temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD). However, there is no model to explain such a link. This hypothesis explains how the fusimotor system of the muscles innervated by the trigeminal motor nucleus is affected by inadequacies in the occlusion of the teeth that cause changes in posture and movement of the mandible. Reptile to mammal evolution shows that stomatognathic structures underwent changes related to mastication. Among several changes, there was the appearance of a new articulation between the mandible and skull: the temporomandibular joint. The bones of the old reptile joint, quadrate-articular, have detached from the mandible and are part of the middle ear bone chain. The former becomes the incus and the latter the malleus. This bone change also carried the tensor tympani and its trigeminal motor innervation. Inadequate occlusal contacts give rise to an adapted function of the mandible and the most common compensatory muscular response is hypertonia involving all mandibular muscles, including the tensor tympani. A fundamental clinical feature that demonstrates the involvement of the trigeminal fusimotor system is the characteristic pain by palpation, but no pain on the mandibular movement. Muscle pain is always felt in the dermatome innervated by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, which carries the motor fibers, reported as tightening, similar to cramp, and has regular behavior in intensity, duration and frequency. In addition, the patient has increased musculature volume, detected by palpation of certain anatomical landmarks, but with loss of functional efficiency. The neuromotor control of the mandibular movements is poor and when asked to make lateral jaw movement touching the teeth, it is common to observe that the patient moves the lips, eyes, and even turns the head in the same direction as the movement. There is also difficulty eating hard foods and talking fast. Tongue biting while chewing is frequent, meaning that these non-physiological events surpass protective reflex circuits. The report of ear pain, tinnitus, blocked ear sensation and sudden hearing loss is common in such patients, compatible with the tonic contraction of the tensor tympani. The fusimotor system hypothesis is able to explain all events related to the symptoms and helps to establish a correct diagnosis for certain types of hearing disorders."

Firstly, fats, carbohydrates and proteins differ markedly in their resistivity, which offers a way to monitor them, especially when digestive enzymes cause consistent and distinctive changes. Secondly the state of iso-resistivity is in theory most likely to pass through the membranes of absorbing cells and be compatible with plasma in portal blood vessels. Hence, the theory proposes that the aim of the digestive process in the upper gut is to present digesta to absorption sites in a state at, or close to, iso-osmo-resistivity. It requires a method of monitoring resistivity which could be achieved by neuronal endings based in the upper gut mucosa. They could be simple nerve endings or, probably less likely, part of the structure of duodenal Brunner’s Glands. They would monitor the overall effect of the various digestive processes initiated by the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The combination of sensitive electroreceptor and osmoreceptor output would provide a system that would accurately monitor the overall progress of digestion to conserve enzyme production."

In recent years an accumulation of evidence for the beneficial effects of the ketotic state on the brain have heightened interest in its potential for use in neurological conditions. The ketogenic diet (KD) induces ketosis and is an effective treatment for medically resistant epilepsy. There is significant comorbidity between epilepsy and bipolar disorder (BD) and both conditions are treated by anti-convulsant drugs. In addition, reports on bipolar disease online fora have highlighted subjective mood stabilization effects associated with the KD. These KD reported effects could be explained if there was a disorder in the conversion of pyruvate into Acetyl-CoA (and subsequent impairment of oxidative phosphorylation) which was bypassed by ketones providing an alternative substrate for oxidative phosphorylation. This is consistent with growing evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a causal role in BD and explains the reported TCA cycle dysfunction and elevated pyruvate levels in BD. Reduced levels of ATP affects the normal operation of the Na, K-ATPase in the brain with differing levels of reduction either leading to reduced neuronal action potential and inhibition of neurotransmitter release (consistent with the depressed state in BD) or increased neuronal resting potential and hyper-excitability (consistent with a [hypo]manic mood state). We hypothesize that the mitochondrial dysfunction is due to a disorder of the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC) and/or Mitochondrial Carrier Protein (MCP) shuttle which moves intracellular pyruvate into mitochondria. The resultant reduction in ATP generation could explain mood instability and cycling in BD (through mechanisms such as those delineated by Mallakh and Peters). This proposed novel causal pathway could explain mood de-stabilization in BD and the reported positive effects of KD. If true, this hypothesis would suggest that there should be increased research attention to PDC (and in particular the E1 alpha subunit) as potential therapeutic targets and further study of a possible role of KD in BD to improve mood stability. Experimental approaches, such as through a clinical trial of KD on mood stabilization in BD, are required to further investigate this hypothesis."

The pragmatic systems view of biology has encountered problems and constraints on its explanatory power because pragmatic systems biologists still tend to view systems as mere collections of parts, not as “emergent realities” produced by adaptive interactions between the constituting components. As such, they are incapable of characterizing the higher-level biological phenomena adequately. The attempts of systems-theoretical biologists to explain these “emergent realities” using mathematics also fail to produce satisfactory results. Given the increasing strategic importance of systems biology, both from theoretical and research perspectives, we suggest that additional epistemological and methodological insights into the possibility of further integration between traditional experimental studies and complex modeling are required. This integration will help to improve the currently underdeveloped pragmatic-systems biology and system-theoretical biology. The “epistemology of complexity,” I contend, acts as a glue that connects and integrates different and sometimes opposing viewpoints, perspectives, streams, and practices, thus maintaining intellectual and research coherence of systems research of life. It allows scientists to shift the focus from traditional experimental research to integrated, modeling-based holistic practices capable of providing a comprehensive knowledge of organizing principles of living systems. It also opens the possibility of the development of new practical and theoretical foundations of systems biology to build a better understanding of complex organismic functions."

Retinal dialysis, detachment and other complications consequent to blunt trauma are often thought to be due to equatorial expansion of the globe following an antero-posterior compressive force. However, stretching of the globe along the primary anatomical equator may not hold true for the adjusted globe position as a consequence of the protective Bell’s phenomenon which gets activated before impact. The upward and outward rolling of the globe likely creates a new equator, with the compressive forces acting along this new plane, thereby leading to stretching along the ocular coats closer to the retinal periphery. Additionally, the coup and countercoup mechanisms with increased vulnerability of temporal sclera predisposes to retinal complications more commonly along the temporal and the nasal retina. Further, retinal complications involving other quadrants can also be explained through understanding of the Bell’s phenomenon."

abstract = "The major change in the United States and European diets associated with the increased rates of obesity was an increased consumption of refined carbohydrates. A feature of refined carbohydrates is their predisposition to cause increased fluctuations in plasma insulin and glucose levels and postprandial reactive hypoglycaemia. As the central nervous system is dependent on a stable supply of glucose this threatens the central nervous system functioning and these fluctuations also have a negative impact on the cardiovascular system. Phenotypic plasticity enables organisms to use adaptive phenotypes already in existence such as the increased insulin resistance and increased adiposity associated with pregnancy or the insulin resistance associated with infection, trauma and burns or to evolve new phenotypes to adapt to variations in the environment. This paper explores the evidence that increased insulin resistance that is commonly associated with increased adiposity possibly because of shared locations on the genome is a phenotypic plastic adaptation to the increased consumption of refined carbohydrates and their predisposition to cause increased fluctuations in plasma insulin and plasma glucose and post-prandial reactive hypoglycaemia both of which have negative impacts on the metabolism. Obesity, that is a relatively stable state of increased adiposity and insulin resistance has adaptive and defensive features to these fluctuations in plasma insulin and glucose in that metabolic disorders associated with refined carbohydrate consumption are often mitigated and modified as exemplified by the obesity paradox."

Indeed, a gene located on chromosome 21 controls the production of cystathionine-β-synthase, an enzyme involved in hydrogen sulfide production in the central nervous system. It has recently been demonstrated that excess cystathionine-β-synthase levels are needed and sufficient to induce cognitive phenotypes in mouse models of Down syndrome. Thus, two therapeutic options might be used in Down syndrome patients: the use of a specific cystathionine β-synthase inhibitor and the use of an effective antidote to reduce hydrogen sulfide toxicity. Prenatal treatment of Down syndrome fetuses is also suggested."

Although it is the most common syndrome of the elbow joint, the most affected structure is the tendon of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle. Several theories have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of lateral epicondylitis, however, there is no evidence to show that the sarcomere length and microanatomical features of the ECRB muscle can be affected by the elongated position of the muscle. We hypothesized that the tensile response may be the responsible mechanism in the pathophysiology of lateral epicondylitis due to the microanatomy of the ECRB muscle and its functioning in the elongated position. Elongated position leads to elongation of the sarcomere length by forming a functional traction angle in the ECRB muscle. The elongated sarcomere length negatively affects muscular microcirculation. Poor microcirculation triggers ischemia in the muscle and tendon and leads to an increase in immature Type III collagen synthesis. Disruption of the collagen continuity and the loss of load-bearing capacity initiate the neovascularization process. This situation accelerates the degeneration process in the tendon and prevents healing. Furthermore, based on our hypothesis, we recommend new physiotherapy approaches that may contribute to reducing the increased incidence of tendinopathy and to the healing process."

Bidirectional flow in the fine veins, over extended periods of time, will cause disorder in the veins’ endothelial morphology, and ultimately, result in the disruption of the blood-brain barrier as observed in multiple sclerosis. This physics-based analysis demonstrates a positive correlation between clinically observed MS attributes with the predicted flow patterns and venous malformations that are based on fluid dynamics principles that include venous compliance influences.

The study aimed to investigate the tumor-suppressing factor myogenicity differentiation factor (MyoD) against high metastatic colorectal cancer through its powerful transformation by which the tumor cells were converted into muscle cells or other cells to inhibit the malignant proliferation of tumor cells.
Methods
The roles of MyoD in colon cancer proliferation, invasion and migration were analyzed by CCK-8 assay and Transwell, and EMT by real-time PCR and Western blot. The secretion of TGFβ1 was assayed by ELISA and activation of p-Smad2/3 were assayed by western blot. The effects of MyoD on intestinal cancer growth and EMT in vivo were also analyzed.
Results
We found MyoD inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of colon cancer cell. Moreover, MyoD inhibited the expression of E-cadherin and promoted the expression of vimentin and α-SMA. The secretion of TGFβ1 increased and p-Smad2/3 was activated after MyoD expression. MyoD also inhibits intestinal cancer growth and promoted EMT in vivo.
Conclusion
Our findings indicate that MyoD inhibited cancer progression and metastasis by promoting EMT through TGF-β1/Smad2/3 activation, which provide new support for MyoD maybe as a novel anti-cancer method for the treatment of colon cancer in the future."

In this paper the authors propose the hypothesis that tumor-associated mast cells may switch to different polarization states, conditioning the immunogenic capacities of the different neoplasms. Anti-inflammatory polarized mast cells should express cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and then mast cells number should be inversely related to the intensity of inflammatory infiltrate. On the contrary, when mast cells do not express anti-inflammatory cytokines their number should be directly related to the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate. In this paper we briefly argue around feasible approaches, based on the retrospective studies of tumor tissue samples from neoplasms considered “immunologically hot” and neoplasms considered “immunologically cold”, through immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence techniques (confocal microscopy). The establishment of the actual existence of a polarization interchange of mast cells, could lead to a new vision in prognostic terms, useful to contrive new approaches in immunotherapy of tumors."

Environmental agents, including influenza, neurotoxic metals, and combustion smoke, have been implicated in the pathogenesis, especially in carriers of the human leukocyte antigen class II DQB1*06:02 allele. Sensitive experimental approaches have recently revealed hypocretin-autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the blood of narcoleptic patients. However, such potentially harmful cells are also detectable, to a lesser degree, in control DQB1*06:02 carriers, suggesting that the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) provides a neuroprotective effect. Here, we present the hypothesis that external toxic agents induce neuroinflammation in the olfactory bulb and concomitant overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ); this, in turn, compromises the BBB, allowing autoimmune cells to access and kill hypocretinergic neurons. Such sequential pathological alterations could occur insidiously, passing unnoticed and consequently being underestimated. The elevated number of autoreactive T cells in narcoleptics relative to controls might reflect externally induced immunomodulation rather than a direct disease trigger."

Decreased DHLA regeneration due to impairment of the E3 subunit or crossover of the swinging arms of the E2 subunit of PDC have been suggested as a cause of ME/CFS/SEID resulting in instantaneous fluctuations in lactate levels and instantaneous offset of the DHLA/LA ratio and defining the condition as an LA deficiency with chronic instantaneous hyperlactataemia with explicit stratification of symptoms. While instantaneous hyperlactataemia has been suggested to account for the PEM, the fatigue was explained by the downregulated throughput of pyruvate and consequently lower production of ATP with the residual enzymatic efficacy of the E3 subunit or crossover of the E2 as a proposed explanation of the fatigue severity. Functional diagnostics and visualization of instantaneous elevations of lactate and DHLA has been suggested. Novel treatment strategies have been implicated to compensate for chronic PDC impairment and hyperlactataemia. This hypothesis potentially influences the current understanding and treatment methods for any type of hyperlactataemia, fatigue, ME/CFS/SEID, and conditions associated with PDC impairment."

abstract = "Background
Among the most common autonomic signs visible in preterm neonates, apnea can represent the first sign of several neurologic and non-neurologic disorders, and seizure is a relatively infrequent cause. Herein authors present a case of neonatal autonomic apnea, discussing the polygraphic video-EEG features of this pathological entity and the differential diagnosis with central apnea and autonomic apnea.
Case report
A female preterm Caucasian infant (29 + 4 weeks' gestational age (GA)), first twin of a twin pregnancy, at birth was intubated and surfactant administration was performed. She was ventilated via invasive ventilation for three days, with subsequent weaning with non-invasive ventilation for other two days, when she stopped requiring any ventilator support. After one week the ventilation weaning, the child presented episodes of cyanosis associated with sudden oxygen desaturation, skin pallor, apnea, and bradycardia. Therefore, the child underwent a continuous video-eeg recording with polygraphic study. The exam showed the presence of apneic episodes with an abrupt and clear start, associated with oxygen desaturation at 70%, with minimal thoracic effort at onset, and then evolving into central apnea. Central apnea lasted about 16 s and presented clear start- and end-points. These episodes were also associated with suppression of the EEG trace in frequency and amplitude, and after about 10 s of central apnea an abrupt decrease of the child's heart rate (more than 50% variation, from 160 bpm to 65 bpm) was recorded. In the suspect of epileptic apneas of autonomic origin, a therapy with oral Levetiracetam, at a starting dose of 10 mg/Kg/day, then increased up to 40 mg/Kg/day, was initiated, and after about 48 h the first administration of the anticonvulsant therapy, no new episodes of cyanosis or electrical apneas were recorded.
Hypothesis
Herein the authors suggest to consider the diagnosis of autonomic seizures in those neonates with apneic events associated with EEG suppression. Considering that apnea events are not only present in preterm infants but also in term neonates, it is mandatory to diagnose in this context neonatal seizures for a correct diagnosis and a proper therapeutic choice."

Unfortunately, to date, there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Mast cells (MCs) are immune cells implicated in the pathogenesis of viral infections, where they mediate inflammation. Microbes, including virus, activate MCs through TLR releasing chemical pro-inflammatory compounds and cytokines. Although, in biomedical literature there are only few reports on MCs activation by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by MC viral activation leads to increase pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Sodium Chromo-Glycate (SCG) described as a MC stabilizer, prevents the release of inflammatory chemical compounds, improve mouse survival and respiratory pathological changes in lung viral infection and suppresses inflammation. Furthermore, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) a nuclear factor agonist, an endogenous fatty acid amide, which exerts a variety of biological effects, related to chronic inflammation and pain, is involved also in MCs homeostasis with an inhibitory and protective effect on the respiratory tract during viral infections. Here, we hypothesize for the first time, that SCG and/or PEA suppress MC activation and pro-inflammatory mediators release, playing an anti-inflammatory therapeutic role in the inflamed lung of patients with COVID-19."

abstract = "Although once considered by biologists almost exclusively for their toxicity, reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species produced within normal cells under baseline physiological conditions are now appreciated as redox regulators of a wide range of protein functions. Two families of enzymes, the NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), are major sources of ROS/RNS from molecular oxygen. Aquaporins (AQPs) are membrane channels capable of transporting some ROS/RNS, in particular hydrogen peroxide and perhaps nitric oxide. The activities of all these enzymes and channels are sensitive to variations in oxygen levels within the physiological range experienced by cells in the human body. Since ROS/RNS have important physiological roles and their endogenous production is affected by oxygen levels, we hypothesize that the synthesis of these proteins is increased at lower oxygen levels within the physiological range of most human cells in vivo, i.e. 2–5%, in order to facilitate the maintenance of ROS/RNS production rates. We further postulate that this is achieved, at least in part, by transcriptional stimulation mediated by the activity of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs), which are strongly regulated by oxygen levels over the same range of oxygen. Here we survey the evidence supporting this hypothesis, including induction of expression of NOXs, NOSs, and AQPs at lower oxygen levels, presence of hypoxia response elements in the corresponding human genes, and evidence from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments that HIF-1 and/or HIF-2 bind these regions. We find a significant amount of empirical data supporting the hypothesis that HIFs could function as physiological regulators of ROS/RNS homeostasis in the normoxic range in human cells."

Early in embryonic development, pre-macrophages arise from the fetal yolk sac and track through the bloodstream to reach diverse embryonic tissues, where they mature. Most of these macrophages exhibit an M2-like phenotype. The critical period for neural tube closure is contained within the period of yolk sac-derived pre-macrophage tracking and distribution, which poses a question: might these pre-macrophages or macrophages exert an influence on the closing neural tube? Evidence suggests that perturbations in macrophage polarization or M2 macrophage function might contribute to the failure of neural tube closure associated with diabetes mellitus, one carbon metabolism (including folic acid deficit), inositol, arachidonic acid, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, as well as in the teratogenicity of nitric acid, valproic acid, and fumonisin. The influence of each of these factors is interpreted in light of potential interactions with M2-like macrophages or macrophage progenitors on the developing neural tube. By placing these anti inflammatory macrophages at the center of various epigenetic, neurochemical, and signaling processes suspected to be involved in neural tube closure, potential associations are revealed between macrophages and embryonic structural developmental processes such as collagen and actin dynamics. The choice of this model is also an attempt to explain why some etiologies for failure of neural tube closure are rescued by folic acid, whereas other etiologies are rescued only by formate, inositol, or not at all."

Although surgery is a successful curative treatment for localized RCC, most patients are diagnosed with advanced or metastatic RCC, which has poor prognosis. RCC is classified by stage and grade using tissue samples. Whilst these provide good prognostic information, they are not very useful for early detection. Proteins that are dysregulated in patient’s serum can be a valuable alternative and less invasive biomarker for early detection of the disease. For this reason, a hypothesis was formed that leptin is a possible biomarker for early detection and prognostication of RCC. The literature has disparate results on the usefulness of leptin as a biomarker for the early detection of RCC. Hence, a systematic review and a meta-analysis was carried out to investigate whether serum leptin could be a reliable diagnostic and prognostic factor in RCC patients. Literature on the available cohort and case-control studies on serum leptin in RCC was searched in electronic databases and included to evaluate this adipokine in the progression of RCC. The relevant studies were evaluated for the diagnostic and prognostic value of leptin in RCC patients. Overall, only 6 original research studies matched selection criteria and were included for meta-analysis. This study was hypothesised that; leptin might be a useful biomarker for early detection and prognostication of RCC. However, the data were presented in this study did not support our hypothesis. Serum leptin levels in RCC patients do not strongly associate with the development or progression of RCC, thus cannot act as a biomarker for early detection in RCC in patients. Extending our hypothesis further to include levels of obesity and RCC development may be worthwhile, but studies are currently limited."

Studying complex systems is one of the approaches that can be taken for research on body systems. The dynamic variability of a complex system is estimated by nonlinear methods. Previous studies have identified how functional dynamic variability of organs differ in normal and disease conditions. Variation of electroencephalogram, heart rate, and respiratory rate are known examples of system dynamic fluctuation. If we consider the digestive tract as a complex system, the dynamic variation of the waves in the GI system could be analyzed by nonlinear methods to possibly help clinicians assess various conditions of the GI system in healthy subjects and patients."

The way pain is remembered seems to depend on certain factors, including the type of pain or, in other words, its cause, the context, and the meaning it has for the person suffering from it. For instance, episodes of chronic pain, as well as pain related to surgery, are often overestimated at recall. Interestingly, research shows that pain induced by parturition or marathon running is often underestimated at recall despite the fact that both are not only physically grueling but also emotionally intense experiences. However, both processes can likewise be considered positive events, as opposed to most that involve pain. On the neurophysiological level, one of the similarities between giving birth and running a marathon is the particular involvement of the oxytocin system. Oxytocin is involved both in parturition and intense exercise, for various reasons. During labor, oxytocin mediates uterine contractions, while in the case of extensive running it might be involved in the maintenance of fluid balance. It also has well-documented analgesic properties and plays an important role in memory formation and recall. It has been suggested that oxytocin modulates the output of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) during the fear recall. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that oxytocin can impair fear learning and influence the memory of both positive and negative emotionally salient stimuli. We propose that the reason for pain to be remembered in a more favorable light is the central action of oxytocin in the central nucleus of the amygdala, first and foremost during the encoding phase."

Sleep researchers at the University of Chicago, discovered the phase of rapid eye movement (REM) during sleep and connected it to the dream period. During this period, called the REM phase (after the American terminology), although the brain shows electrical activity, it is insensitive to external stimulations, including light, sound, contact and, a little unexpectedly, gravity. However, since this discovery was mаde there has been no definitive explanation of the rapid eye movements Many possible explanations have been offered, and yet, the causes and contributing factors of the REM sleep phase are inadequately understood. It has often been proposed that the eyes observe the images produced during dreams, but researchers are not convinced. It is proposed here that the movements of the eyes during REM sleep are due to a feeling of disorientation and a subjective loss of landmarks. During the REM sleep phase, the brain has a reduced sensation of gravity, and the sleeper is in a state similar to weightlessness. The instinctive search for the vertical or horizontal direction triggers movements of the eyes, looking for usual points of reference. This hypothesis is reinforced by an original experiment that was conducted in space. The frequency of the eye movements of astronauts during their first night in space is 10 times more than what is experienced on the ground, and that moment in time is when the feeling or the sensation of weightlessness is certainly the most disturbing. Upon the return to Earth, the frequency of the eye movements increases again the first night after landing. These two moments are when the effects of gravity are felt most drastically. The present assumption needs to be validated experimentally and may necessitate further research."

We previously showed that two-time-points weight growth velocities at age t, calculated by a commercial software product as [Weight(t) − Weight(t − X)]/X, with X = 448 days, were erroneous due to the long separation of 448 days. We were convinced that shorter X-values would solve this accuracy problem. However, our hypothesis is that: “shorter time separations than 448 days cause a decreased accuracy of numerical weight velocity equations in realistic infant weights until an age of about three years”. Supporting evidence comes from analyzing how shorter X-values will affect the accuracy of two-time-points weight velocity calculations. We systematically varied X between 1 and 448 days of various P50/0SD-related standard weight curves: (a) P50/0SD with the weights separated by 1 day and X = 1,28,224,448 days; (b) P50/0SD with the weights at variable ages and X = 14–448 days; and (c) case (b) and incorporating weight fluctuations typically occurring in infants. Cases (b) and (c) include details observed in a clinical case. Our results show that the combination of weight fluctuations and varying time intervals between consecutive weights make weight velocity predictions worse for shorter X values in children younger than three years. Because these two causes of failure occur naturally in infants whose weight is regularly measured, other weight velocity equations face the same causes for inaccuracy. In conclusion, our hypothesis suggests that any software that predicts weight velocities should be abandoned in infants < 3 years. Practically, it should require that when (commercial) software weight velocity prediction suggests a medical problem, careful clinical checking should be mandatory, e.g. by linking predicted and exact weight velocities at age t (the latter from the mathematical first derivative at age t of standard weight curves)."

abstract = "Background
Valve-in-valve is established as a safe and efficient alternative to redo surgery in the treatment of structural valve deterioration (SVD). In vitro models rely on the radiopaque landmarks of undeteriorated tissue valves to establish the optimal implantation level of the transcatheter heart valves inside the deteriorated valves. In computed assisted procedures, the radiopaque landmarks of the deteriorated valves may be used to guide valve implantation through image fusion. The purpose of this study is to determine whether SVD alters the radiopaque landmarks of stented tissue valves.
Methods
Our approach was based on the computation of relevant anatomical measurements from CT images. Radiopaque landmarks of degenerated bioprostheses and the corresponding undeteriorated valves were extracted to create surface meshes and cloud points using grey-level thresholding. 3D registration using an iterative closest point algorithm was used to align the corresponding cloud points, while the modified Hausdorff Distance was applied to determine the differences between them.
Results
The proposed evaluation was performed on 19 degenerated tissue valves. 15 valves were scanned from patients evaluated for valve-in-valve procedures, and 4 bioprostheses were scanned after surgical extraction during redo aortic valve replacement. All the degenerated valves were compared to the corresponding undeteriorated models. Overall, the mean difference between degenerated and undeteriorated valves was 0.33 ± 0.12 mm. The maximum observed registration error was 0.66 mm.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrates no significant difference between the radiopaque landmarks of deteriorated and undeteriorated bioprostheses after the occurrence of SVD. Our findings suggest therefore that SVD does not alter radiopaque landmarks of stented tissue valves. These results validate in-vitro studies of optimal transcatheter heart valves implantation inside deteriorated tissue valves based on their radiopaque landmarks, and allow the use of non-deteriorated valves’ imaging features in computer assisted valve-in-valve procedures."

However, many seniors still do not participate in high-intensity exercise despite the mounting evidence that it can improve a number of physiological functions and ultimately increase quality of life. As health, sport, and medical professionals, we must continuously ask ourselves how we can apply our lab-based findings in real-life scenarios, and in the case of older adults, we must find a way to circumvent some of their most common reasons for not exercising, which can include a lack of time, a lack of know-how, a lack of motivation, a fear that high-intensity exercise is unsafe, and a perception that high-intensity exercise is too difficult. Therefore, introducing quick, simple, safe, and perceptually easy exercises may result in immediate health and functional benefits and may serve as a gateway exercise to usher older adults into the realm of high-intensity training. Specifically, assisted jumping could serve this purpose. In this article, the ideas behind the theory and practice of assisted jumping are set forth, providing an evidence-based hypothesis from which future researchers can build on to implement high-speed, high-power, high-intensity exercise in older populations in both research and practical settings."

Like tocilizumab, Vitamin D appears to modulate the activity of an interleukin (IL-6), which may explain the seasonal variation in prevalence of influenza. While most cases of COVID-19 have, thus far, occurred in the Northern Hemisphere winter, limiting the ability to assess seasonal variation, there remains substantial variation in the severity of this condition that has yet to be explained. A retrospective comparison of Vitamin D levels in previously obtained blood samples between survivors and confirmed fatalities could establish a rationale for implementation of widespread Vitamin D supplementation. This would be far cheaper and simpler than tocilizumab as a therapeutic option to trial."

abstract = "A huge number of proteins that occur in the body have to be folded into a specific shape in order to become functional. Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids and the folding process is exquisitely complex. When this folding process is inhibited, the respective protein is referred to as being misfolded and nonfunctional. So the hypothesis that follows is in regard to the diseases that are caused by the misfolding of vital proteins and their reported relationship with thiamin metabolism. These diseases are termed proteopathies and there are at least 50 different conditions in which the mechanism is importantly related to a misfolded protein. In the brain, thiamin deficiency causes a cascade of events involving mild impairment of oxidative metabolism, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, including the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, all of which are examples of proteopathies. Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders related to the conformational alteration of the prion protein (PrP C) into a pathogenic and protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc). The physiological form (PrP C) is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed mainly in the central nervous system. Despite numerous efforts to elucidate its role, the exact biological function remains unknown. Prion-induced diseases, due to the conformational change in the protein, are a global health problem, with lack of effective therapy and 100% mortality. Thiamin and its derivatives bind the prion protein and intermolecular actions have been noted between thiamin and other thiamin-binding proteins, although the exact importance of this is conjectural."

abstract = "The gait cycle has been modelled for energetics and musculoskeletal health and disease, but little has been published in relation to the function of gait as a mechanism in maintaining haemodynamic homeostasis through the lower limb. Blood returns from the lower limb drawn to the heart by the low pressure at the vena cava through hydrodynamic forces. Resisting these hydrodynamics forces are gravitational and frictional forces. The deficit between the forces acting for venous return from the lower limb by hydrodynamics and those acting against antegrade flow, is filled by extrinsic mechanical mechanisms including the respiratory pump, skeletal muscle pumps and the foot pump. The efficiency of the lower limb skeletal muscle pump and foot pump are likely linked to gait kinetics and kinematics. A model is proposed that attempts to expand upon previous gait models of the foot pump as part of the kinetic and kinematic events that occur during gait, whilst also developing the argument that the foot pump needs to be divided into passive-pressure phases, and combined active-muscular/passive-pressure phases during gait. This model suggests that non-weightbearing arch profiles will have little influence on the combined active/passive-pressure phases of the foot pump, while the ability to develop compliance and stiffness within the foot at the requisite periods of the gait cycle is likely to influence foot pump efficiency."

Main Outcome Measures: ECLIA was used to analyse testosterone, FSH, LH, oestradiol, TSH, prolactin, insulin and SHBG. Fluorine content was analysed by potentiometry using ion selective electrode. Fluorine content in serum of women with PCOS did not statistically significantly differ from that of the control group and amounted to 0.224 ± 0.043 and 0.228 ± 0.023 ppm, respectively. There were significant differences in the levels of TSH and HOMA-IR between the groups. Based on the correlation matrix, a negative correlation with the level of SHBG protein and the level of glucose on fasting was showed for the group with a lower of fluorine, and a positive correlation with HDL level was observed in the group with higher concentration of fluorine. In the phenotype with a higher level of androgens, there was a negative correlation with triglycerides level and a positive correlation with HDL. Fluorine, even in concentrations regarded as proper, takes part in PCOS pathogenesis. It increases the synthesis of TSH and increases insulin resistance. Higher insulin resistance leads to the reduced synthesis of SHBG transport protein. Therefore, the key factor in PCOS pathogenesis is testosterone, but fluorine facilitates disruptions in carbohydrates and lipids metabolism leading to increased levels of androgens in blood."

Recent research has shown that depression is associated with impaired interoceptive accuracy. Treatments that can improve disturbed interoception are scarce in clinical practice and could complement established therapies. Accumulating evidence suggests that massage therapy significantly alleviates symptoms of depression. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects have remained unclear. We are going to propose a novel mechanism linking these antidepressive effects to a massage-induced modulation of interoceptive states. Particularly affective massage therapy applies slow, rhythmic, and caress-like touch that stimulates C tactile (CT) afferents in the non-glabrous skin. CT mediated touch elicits responses in interoceptive brain areas (e.g. the insular cortex) that have been associated with abnormal interoceptive representations in depressed subjects. Thus, we hypothesize that antidepressive effects of massage therapy are mediated by restoration of the impaired interoceptive functioning through stimulation of CT afferents or related interoceptive structures. If our proposed mechanism is valid, massage is probably one of the most ancient interoceptive treatments."

MSK pain is typically considered within the narrow framework of inflammatory extraintestinal manifestations of IBD, resulting in a limited scope for the nature and underlying mechanisms participating in MSK pain experiences in this population. Symptoms related to central sensitization have recently demonstrated association with active IBD and worse MSK pain experiences, suggesting a potential roll for central mechanisms in MSK-related pain. Current literature exploring persistent pain in chronic inflammatory and MSK populations propose complex pain models comprised of dynamic nervous system relationships influenced by primary disease features and concomitant pain states, as well as affective and cognitive components. Nervous system contributions in the development and maintenance of persistent pain are postulated to include mechanisms of peripheral and central sensitization, changes in descending central modulation, as well as structural brain changes. These models go beyond current MSK pain models described in IBD literature, highlighting the need for new frameworks for considering MSK-related pain in IBD. Consequently, this paper proposes a broader theoretical model whereby central mechanisms, such as central sensitization and grey matter changes, as well as psychological and disease factors are suggested to modulate pain experiences in this population. Exploration of relationships within the proposed framework may provide not only a deeper understanding of the generation and maintenance of persistent MSK pain in IBD, but also highlight the need for new targeted management pathways in this population. This paper hypothesizes that exploration of central sensitization in IBD patients will demonstrate altered somatosensory functioning in patients with MSK pain, and that IBD activity and psychological factors will be associated with altered somatosensory functioning and worse pain experiences."

The exact pathophysiology of SCAD remains elusive and may involve multiple predisposing or precipitating factors including genetic abnormalities, inherited or acquired vasculopathies, hormonal influences, inflammation, intense exercise, emotional stress, and recreational drugs. Accruing reports, including five case reports and one cohort study, have recently addressed the concurrence of SCAD and myocardial bridging (MB), an anatomic variant in which a segment of the epicardial coronary descends and traverses in the myocardium. Among the patients with coexisting MB and SCAD, the left anterior descending artery was the only artery that harbors both pathologies, with SCAD locating either within the tunneled segment or distal to the MB. No other predisposing factors or precipitating stressors for SCAD were noted. It is hypothesized that the predilection for vasospasm, impaired endothelial function, and disturbed coronary flow dynamics associated with MB bridging could collectively contribute to the development of SCAD. Future studies are warranted to explore the mechanistic implications of MB in patients with SCAD."

There exists evidence for central and peripheral neurological contribution to the symptoms but grasping the real source of abnormal nervous system sensitization remains an ongoing challenge. There exists an association between an injury/trauma and the onset of the symptoms, but a causal relationship has not been yet sufficiently supported by scientific evidence. I postulate a role for gadolinium-based contrast agents and retention of gadolinium in the body. This conjecture breaks the hypothesis of a direct role for a physical injury/trauma per se in favour of an indirect one by the subsequent diagnostic procedures. It creates a new link between retention of gadolinium in the body and painful conditions as FM and unexplained chronic widespread pain reported after a trauma, surgery, or medical illness. Experimental evidence demonstrates possible retention of gadolinium species in human body, still lacking conclusive answers on their pathological consequences. Notwithstanding, there exist some initial data that report unexplained chronic widespread pain and symptoms of FM in those patients: they are suggestive for pathological consequences associated with gadolinium retention. Besides clear compelling symptoms overlapping, biochemical findings are provided to sustain the hypothesis of a role for gadolinium in the disease process focusing on neurotransmitters, endogenous metal cations, cytokines, and muscle tissue. Experimental findings strongly support the hypothesis of impairment at the cellular, intracellular, and systemic levels in FM. And these data are highly compatible with collateral effects associated with the interference of the gadolinium ion and its pharmaceutical chelates into biochemical pathways in vivo. The hypothesis presented in this article, along with the support of scientific evidence, links FM and unexplained chronic widespread pain reported after a trauma, surgery, or medical illness to retention of gadolinium in the body. If the hypothesis is confirmed, it could improve diagnosis and prevention, while providing a ground for development of new treatments."

Acquisition and comparison of images of computerized axial tomography (CT) and thermography (IRT) of the distal limbs in 2 affected brothers.
Data and discussion
Important image correlations in the region of the thighs and the posterior region of the legs have been highlighted. The comparison between the CT and the thermography showed how the first results are encouraged and promising and open a possible new line of research on the evaluation and follow-up of this disease. Despite this, a larger number of studies are needed to validate the thermography as a diagnostic technique and follow-up of this pathology."

Dietary modifications are of paramount importance in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Hereby, calorie restriction and fasting diets as well as plant-based diets enjoy uninterrupted popularity. While cases of TIND have been reported with (very) low calorie diets, a case of TIND in the context of a whole-food plant-based diet has not been published to the best of my knowledge. Is this a simple coincidence or is there potentially a reason behind it? The hypothesis presented in this paper is that whole-food plant-based diets and TIND do not share a common denominator.

We hypothesize that femur length should be kept as long as possible considering construction of the knee unit beneath the socket. Evaluation of the hypothesis: Providing a comprehensive overview of considerations involved in choosing the optimal femur length in a trans-femoral amputation. This explorative study includes a scoping review, interviews with surgeons and certified prosthetists (expert opinions), and a biomechanical analysis. The scoping review resulted in 396 articles reduced to 6 articles after reviewing. All articles, the outcomes of the interviews with the experts and the biomechanical analysis suggest that it is important to maximize the length of the residual femur.
Conclusion
A longer residual limb length is more beneficial for gait parameters, prevention of contractures, and providing lever arm. Furthermore, the femur should be transected sufficiently proximal to the medial knee joint in order to fit a prosthetic knee at the same height as the contralateral knee. However, it remains unclear what the minimum length of the residual limb should be. This will require further research."

However, because the cerebellum is traditionally viewed as only involved in motor processing, the contribution of this major part of the brain in social processing has been largely ignored and its specific role in social cognition remains unclear. Nevertheless, recent meta-analyses have made its crucial contribution to social cognition evident. This raises the question: What is the exact function of the cerebellum in social cognition? We hypothesize that the cerebellum builds internal action models of our social inter-actions to predict how other people’s actions will be executed, what our most likely responses are to these actions, so that we can automatize our interactions and instantly detect disruptions in these action sequences. This mechanism likely allows to better anticipate action sequences during social interactions in an automatic and intuitive way and to fine-tune these anticipations, making it easier to understand behaviors and to detect violations. This hypothesis has major implications in neurological disorders affecting the cerebellum such as autism, with detrimental effects on social functionality, especially on more complex and abstract social cognitive processes. Because the fundamental anatomical organization of the cerebellum is identical in many species (cerebellar microcomplexes), this hypothesis could have major impacts to elucidate social interactions in social animals."

Sarcopenia increases the risk of falls, disability, and death. The biological basis for sarcopenia is not well understood. There are no specific preventive or therapeutic strategies for sarcopenia except exercise. The elucidation of biological pathways and identification of therapeutic targets for treating or preventing sarcopenia remain a high priority in aging research. Mitochondria play a critical role in skeletal muscle by providing energy in the form of ATP, regulation of signaling, calcium homeostasis, autophagy, and other functions. Cardiolipin, a unique dimeric phospholipid specific to mitochondria and an essential component of mitochondrial membranes, is involved in mitochondrial protein transport, maintaining structural organization of mitochondrial membranes, cellular signaling, regulating enzymes involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids, and facilitating normal electron transport chain (ETC) function and generation of ATP. The fatty acid species composition of cardiolipin is critical to mitochondrial bioenergetics, as cardiolipin affects membrane biophysical properties, binds and stabilizes ETC protein complexes, and shapes the curvature of the mitochondrial cristae. Tetra-linoleoyl cardiolipin (18:2)4 comprises ∼80% of cardiolipin in mitochondria in normal human skeletal and cardiac muscle and is optimal for effective ETC function and ATP generation. Aging is associated with a decrease in cardiolipin content, decrease in tetra-linoleoyl cardiolipin (18:2)4 and replacement of linoleic acid (18:2) with other fatty acids in cardiolipin composition, decline of ETC function, and increased generation of reactive oxygen species in muscle. Together, these findings from the literature prompt the hypothesis that depletion of the cardiolipin (18:2)4 species may be at the root of mitochondrial dysfunction with aging, in turn leading to sarcopenia. Corroboration of the tetra-linoleoyl cardiolipin depletion hypothesis suggests new leads for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia by enhancing the biosynthesis, accretion, and integrity of tetra-linoleoyl cardiolipin."

Histopathological study shows AD neuron has irregular cytoskeleton and aberrant synapse. Amyloid-β (Aβ) is believed as the trigger of AD, however, the detailed pathogenesis is not fully elucidated. Microtubule-actin crosslinking factor 1 (MACF1) is a unique giant molecule which can bind to all three types of cytoskeleton fibers, different linkers/adaptors, as well as various functional proteins. MACF1 is a critical scaffold for orchestrating the complex 3D structure, and is essential for correct synaptic function. MACF1’s binding ability to microtubule depends on Glycogen synthase kinase 3 Bate (GSK3β) mediated phosphorylation. While GSK3β can be regulated by the binding of Aβ and the receptor Paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB), possibly via Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). So based on literature search and logic analysis, we propose a hypothesis: Aβ binds to its receptor PirB, and triggers cytosol PP2A, which might activate GSK3β. GSK3β might further phosphorylates microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) of MACF1, causes the separation of microtubule and MACF1. Thus MACF1 might lose the control of the whole cytoskeleton system, synapse might change and AD might develop. That is Aβ-PirB-PP2A-GSK3β-MACF1 axis might give rise to AD. We hope our hypothesis might provide new clue and evidence to AD pathogenesis."

What happens if background EMF rise to critical levels, coinciding with increasing environmental pollutants? Two of the authors can look back over 50 clinical years and appreciate the profound changes in human morbidity across a range of disparate conditions – autoimmune diseases, asthma, earlier cancer incidence and reduced male sperm counts. In particular have been increased autism, dyslexia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and neurological diseases, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s Disease, Early Onset Dementia, Multiple System Atrophy and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. What might have caused these changes-whilst genetic factors are taken as given, multiple environmental pollutants are associated with neurological disease although the mechanisms are unclear. The pace of increased neurological deaths far exceeds any Gompertzian explanation - that because people are living longer they are more likely to develop more age-related problems such as neurological disease. Using WHO global mortality categories of Neurological Disease Deaths (NDD) and Alzheimer’s and Dementia deaths (Alz), updated June 2018, together they constitute Total Neurological Mortality (TNM), to calculate mortality rates per million for people aged 55–74 and for the over-75’s in twenty-one Western countries. Recent increases in American people aged over-75’s rose 49% from 1989 to 2015 but US neurological deaths increased five-fold. In 1989 based on Age-Standardised-Deaths-Rates America USA was 17th at 324 pm but rising to 539 pm became second highest. Different environmental/occupational factors have been found to be associated with neuro-degenerative diseases, including background EMF. We briefly explore how levels of EMF interact upon the human body, which can be described as a natural antennae and provide new evidence that builds upon earlier research to propose the following hypothesis. Based upon recent and new evidence we hypothesise that a major contribution for the relative sudden upsurge in neurological morbidity in the Western world (1989–2015), is because of increased background EMF that has become the tipping point-impacting upon any genetic predisposition, increasing multiple-interactive pollutants, such as rises in petro-chemicals, hormone disrupting chemicals, industrial, agricultural and domestic chemicals. The unprecedented neurological death rates, all within just twenty-five years, demand a re-examination of long-term EMF safety related to the increasing background EMF on human health.

It is also proposed how such a hypothesis could be tested by using already existent cognitive tasks in combination to traditional treatments of aphasia. The hypothesis may be framed as an attempt to give an application for the body of knowledge about the connections between language and action as well as to collect more evidence on the matter – evidence which could potentially be of fundamental importance for the field of study concerned and for the elaboration of new rehabilitation programs."

abstract = "Unlike other carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasizes to distant organs relatively rarely. In contrast, it routinely metastasizes to liver vasculature/liver, affecting portal veins 3–10 times more often than hepatic veins. This portal metastatic predominance is traditionally rationalized within the model of a reverse portal flow, due to accompanying liver cirrhosis. However, this intuitive model is not coherent with facts: 1) reverse portal flow occurs in fewer than 10% of cirrhotic patients, while portal metastasis occurs in 30–100% of HCC cases, and 2) portal vein prevalence of HCC metastasis is also characteristic of HCC in non-cirrhotic livers. Therefore, we must assume that the route for HCC metastatic dissemination is the same as for other carcinomas: systemic dissemination via the draining vessel, i.e., via the hepatic vein. In this light, portal prevalence versus hepatic vein of HCC metastasis appears as a puzzling pattern, particularly in cases when portal HCC metastases have appeared as the sole manifestation of HCC. Considering that other GI carcinomas (colorectal, pancreatic, gastric and small bowel) invariably disseminate via portal vein, but very rarely form portal metastasis, portal prevalence of HCC metastasis appears as a paradox. However, nature does not contradict itself; it is rather our wrong assumptions that create paradoxes. The ‘portal paradox’ becomes a logical event within the hypothesis that the formation of the unique portal venous system preceded the appearance of liver in evolution of chordates. The analysis suggests that the appearance of the portal venous system, supplying hormones and growth factors of pancreatic family, which includes insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide (HGFPF) to midgut diverticulum in the early evolution of chordates (in an Amphioxus-like ancestral animal), promoted differentiation of enterocytes into hepatocytes and their further evolution to the liver of vertebrates. These promotional-dependent interactions are conserved in the vertebrate lineage. I hypothesize that selective homing and proliferation of malignant hepatocytes (i.e., HCC cells) in the portal vein environment are due to a uniquely high concentration of HGFPF in portal blood. HGFPF are also necessary for liver function and renewal and are significantly extracted by hepatocytes from passing blood, creating a concentration gradient of HGFPF between the portal blood and hepatic vein outflow, making post-liver vasculature and remote organs less favorable spaces for HCC growth. It also suggested that the portal vein environment (i.e., HGFPF) promotes the differentiation of more aggressive HCC clones from already-seeded portal metastases, explaining the worse outcome of HCC with the portal metastatic pattern. The analysis also offers new hypothesis on the phylogenetic origin of the hepatic diverticulum of cephalochordates, with certain implications for the modeling of the chordate phylogeny."

Part A consisted of closed type questions made by The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition diagnostic criteria of migraine without aura. Part B was KAMST questionnaire. 298 patients were questioned. 209 (72%) of them were women and 89 (28%) - men. According to The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition migraine without aura diagnostic criteria, migraine was diagnosed for 42 (14,1%) patients, and according our KAMST questionnaire – 83 (27,9%). From 42 patients whom migraine was diagnosed with The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition criteria, 34 (81%) of these patients migraine was diagnosed with KAMST. From 256 patients whom migraine wasn‘t diagnosed with The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition criteria, 49 of them (19,1%) migraine was diagnosed with KAMST.

Recent evidences showed that genomic mosaicism could be a normal event. In brains, each neuron may harbor hundreds of genetic alterations, which may contribute to neuronal diversity. Thus, can mosaicism be a natural motor of diversity in asthma? Why this genetic event is little described in scientific literature? To discuss these questions, we perform a critical review about the normality of genomic mosaicism; moreover, we examine the difficulty of current experimental approaches to detect different genotypes in cell populations of one individual."

And it was been found a reverse of the dysbiosis after the effective treatment, but it failed to find a positive effect of antibiotic therapy on skin disease without significant clinical infection. The microbiomes were compared to the ‘second gene reservoir’, and indicated that their co-existing with the human being is a result of co-evolution. The current studies have shown that the microbial community on the skin surface should have an ideal optimal state, which can effectively regulate the immune tolerance and help to avoid the invasion of external pathogenic bacteria, then the body can be in a relatively healthy state. In this paper, we hypothesized that failing to maintain the harmonious relationship between microbes and human beings is the reason we suffering from most skin diseases, including chronic non-healing wounds.

Public health initiatives to tackle the rise in overweight and obesity in developed and developing nations have largely failed to tackle the problem and research into the underlying causes is of increasing importance. Central to understanding overconsumption of calories is an appreciation of the mechanisms of hunger and satiety. Research to date has revealed considerable detail regarding meal size, macronutrient composition of the diet and control of energy balance via adipose store derived signalling. It is clear however that such control mechanisms are overwhelmed in a significant proportion of the population. We hypothesize the hitherto under-researched possibility that micronutrient status may have an important role in energy balance. Poor vitamin and mineral profiles in the diets of the obese may potentiate overconsumption of calories due to an insufficiency of micronutrient intake relative to macronutrient consumption, a situation aggravated by increased requirements in the obese state. Amongst the multiplicity of metabolic and biochemical processes dependent upon micronutrients and which are impacted by their relative insufficiency, there may be triggers for increased food consumption in an attempt to bridge the gap between high energy consumption and low co-factor availability. This ‘hunger trap’ will continue as long as low nutrient density foods represent the mainstay of the diet. The accepted paradigm of variety seeking leading to vitamin and mineral adequacy of diets may not apply in the context of highly processed foods which use technological means to mimic organoleptic properties of nutrient density without delivering the same at the level of metabolism."

Drinking more liquids increases the frequency of urination and it is recommended as part of the prevention and/or management of UTI. The intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) is associated with obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. However, cola and other SSB increase liquid intake and diuresis and could, thus, affect the risk of UTI and its complications. We hypothesize that intake of cola has a protective effect on UTI and pyelonephritis. Using an animal model of UTI, we have confirmed that dehydration with minimal urine output leads to higher bacterial counts in the kidneys in comparison to control mice (p = 0.01). The intake of SSB increased liquid intake and thus also diuresis and decreased renal bacterial counts as a marker of induced pyelonephritis (p = 0.036). The preliminary results show that dehydration is a risk factor for UTI and that higher diuresis induced by drinking SSB might be protective against pyelonephritis. The underlying mechanisms could include increased voiding frequency but potentially also active compounds in cola such as caffeine. These findings might have implications for the management of individuals at high risk of UTI. Further studies should verify the hypothesis and evaluate the practical relevance of this concept."

They have been indicated in various diseases, including kidney stone formation, Alzheimer’s disease, and atherosclerosis. Nanoparticles contain calcium and apatite-binding protein fetuin-A, a calcification inhibitor. However, recent evidence indicates that fetuin-A can form nucleation seeds or nidi that grow in size through ion sedimentation to become larger amorphous nanoparticles in the presence of excess calcium and apatite ions. Fetuin-A also functions as an inhibitor of meprin, a metalloproteinase implicated in inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. During inflammation, meprin functions to regulate chemokine activity of monocyte chemotactic protein 1, which is associated with chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis, renal inflammatory diseases, and multiple sclerosis (MS). In addition, calcium phosphate nanocrystals that contain fetuin-A are pro-inflammatory to macrophages and promote vascular smooth muscle cell mineralization, potentiating a vicious cycle of inflammation and calcification. Thus, mineral stress and inflammation appear to be associated with each other. Furthermore, fetuin-A deficient mice exhibited reduced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis severity. Thus, fetuin-A plays a direct role in the neuroinflammatory response. Indeed, the level of fetuin-A in cerebrospinal fluid has been defined as a biomarker of disease activity in MS. MS is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating, and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with an unknown etiology. The “inside-out” model of MS, supported by recent data, states that the initial axonal degeneration in the CNS occurs before demyelination, which then stimulates an auto-immune attack. It was shown very recently that influx of calcium from the extracellular space through nanoscale ruptures of the axonal plasma membrane predict axon degeneration in neuroinflammation. Calcium is an activator of calpains, proteases that function to break down the cytoskeleton, leading to neurodegeneration. Nanoruptures of the plasma membrane were suggested to occur at the early stages of axon damage, especially at nodes of Ranvier, which are devoid of myelin. Here, I propose that calcifying nanoparticles may have a role in the etiology and/or pathophysiology of MS. The initial event causing neurodegeneration may be due to the nanoparticles that have been suggested to easily cross the blood-brain barrier. Following this, the nanoparticles may create nanoruptures in the axonal membrane and also increase the calcium concentration around and within the neurons by forming nidi for calcification, eventually causing neurodegeneration. Nanoparticles can self-replicate; hence, they may represent an infectious causative agent for the development of MS."

Current understanding of the etiology of autism is based on the interaction of multiple genes with each other and with environmental factors, leading to a neurodevelopmental process that results in the expression of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the child. This suggests that it might be possible to strengthen resilience to environmental stressors during the perinatal period to improve outcomes and possibly prevent the development of ASD.
Methods
We searched the MEDLINE database for multiple perinatal factors associated with the development of ASD published between January 1, 2005 and July 1, 2018. The search terms used were “autism” crossed with either “perinatal,” “prenatal,” “gestational,” or “pregnancy,” and crossed again with each perinatal risk factor highlighted in this review including topics on parental health, infections, medications, and environmental stressors. We then searched interventions that may improve neurodevelopmental outcome before and during pregnancy, including supplements, breastfeeding, and postpartum stress reduction. We identified recent or unique metanalyses and systematic reviews of the identified focus and on randomized controlled trials and summarized these using the most recent and comprehensive reviews.
Results
Folate, omega-3, vitamin D3, environmental toxin avoidance, correcting deficiencies, immune boosting, and prolonged breast feeding are all reported to be linked to the possible reduction of adverse pregnancy outcomes including ASD.
Conclusions
Studies of individual components for improving pregnancy outcomes and several uncontrolled preconception to infancy medical practices suggest that multiple interventions might improve the outcomes of pregnancies where there is risk for developing ASD."

abstract = "Hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy) is a biochemical alteration with plasma levels of homocysteine higher than 15 µmol/L, associated with atherosclerosis, and with vascular thrombosis by disrupting endothelial cells. Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid derived from methionine which is an essential amino acid. Excess homocysteine produced in the body is expelled out by liver and kidney from the systemic circulation. Hhcy is caused by the excess deficiencies of the vitamins like pyridoxine (B6), folic acid (B9), or cyanocobalamin (B12). High protein consumers are usually at risk for hyperhomocysteinemia because of low plasma B12 levels. It is approximated that mild Hhcy occurs in 5–7% of the general population and 40% in patients with vascular disease. Patients with heart failure, impaired renal function, and diabetes should be screened since the prevalence of Hhcy in these patients appears to be quite high.

If this strategy is validated, citicoline will be the cost-effective way to be administered for Hhcy. Many evidences are available which suggest that ignoring homocysteine levels in patients with the vascular disease would be unwise. Thus, there is an urgent need for health care providers to develop effective preventions and interventions program (folic acid, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12 supplementation as well as lifestyle change) to reduce this disorder."

Immune therapy-induced diarrhea (ITID) is one of the most commonly encountered irAEs and can lead to expensive and prolonged hospitalizations. The current standard of care for grade 3 or 4 ITID involves ICPi discontinuation, the initiation of steroids, and infliximab for refractory disease. This treatment regimen reverses the desired anti-tumor effect of ICPis, can lead to side effects, and is cost-ineffective. We report the first case of the successful treatment of grade 3 ITID with steroids and an amino acid-based oral rehydration solution (AA-ORS), enterade. Research suggests that AA-ORS may be used to reduce diarrhea and adequately hydrate patients, in contrast to glucose-based oral rehydration solutions, which have been implicated as a contributing factor to diarrhea in cancer patients. We hypothesize that an AA-ORS may mitigate ITID via safer and more economically viable means than the current standard of care, but more controlled trials are needed to test this hypothesis."

The number of DNA adducts and total DNA adduct concentrations were measured in 104 patients who underwent one or more of the three intervention programmes. DNA adduct assessments were carried out on extracted genomic DNA by gas-liquid chromatography, with any DNA adducts found being localised using DNA microarrays. The baseline median number of DNA adducts was 2. The follow-up median number of adducts was highly significantly lower at 0 (p < 0.000000000000003). The mean total DNA adduct concentration at baseline was 9.308 ng/mL, and highly significantly lower at follow-up at 1.553 ng/mL (p < 0.000000000000006). Of the three intervention programmes, only the intermittent whole-body hyperthermia was associated with a significant reduction in DNA adducts. This study offers support for the hypothesis that DNA adducts can be removed by intermittent whole-body hyperthermia. The intermittent hyperthermia used involved infrared-A (wavelength 700–1400 nm, or, equivalently, a frequency of 215–430 THz) being preferentially delivered to the whole body, apart from the head, for up to one hour per session, with gradual core body temperature elevation usually occurring during the first 20–30 min. These results may offer an explanation at the molecular level for other reported clinical benefits of intermittent whole-body hyperthermia."

Pentanethaquine hydrochloride (PHC), as a new type of anti-cholinergic drug, has been widely used. In clinical practice, many patients, especially elderly patients, have suffered from obvious postoperative cognitive dysfunction, but the incidence of pulmonary infection, reduced probably due to the decease of secretion production. Therefore, the effect of PHC on postoperative cognitive functions and inflammatory factors in elderly lung cancer patients under general anesthesia were mainly discussed to determine the clinical advantages and disadvantages. Ninety elderly patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer under general anesthesia were selected and divided into PHC group (group A, n = 30), atropine group (group B, n = 30) and normal saline control group (group C, n = 30). The incidence of postoperative blurred vision was higher in group A compared to group B and C (both p < 0.05). The incidence of other adverse reactions was higher in group A compared to group C (all p < 0.05), but there was no difference between group A and group B (all p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in preoperative and day 1 post-surgery mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores among the three groups (both p > 0.05), but the day 1 post-surgery MMSE scores of three groups were lower (all p < 0.05). PHC increased the incidence of postoperative cognitive impairment and postoperative delirium in elderly lung cancer patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery under general anesthesia, but reduced the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications possibly by reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines."

We suggest that there may be a positive feedback loop which perpetuates the inflammatory response in IBD patients. The loop is triggered by vitamin D deficiency which reduces calcium uptake. Lowered vitamin D and calcium interfere with anti-inflammatory pathways. Inflammation of the mucosa inhibits absorption of calcium and thus perpetuates the reduced anti-inflammatory response. A number of predictions follow from this hypothesis and are supported by geographic and lifestyle patterns in IBD incidence and prevalence."

Because it is considered as the most important clinical finding in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, accurate detection of these lesions bear utmost importance in the early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. The present study aims to accurately, effectively and automatically detect microaneurysms which are difficult to detect in color fundus images in early stage. To this aim, ant colony algorithm, which is an important optimization method, was used instead of conventional image processing techniques. First, retinal vascular structure was extracted from color fundus images in Messidor and DiaretDB1 data sets. Afterwards, the segmentation of microaneurysms was effectively carried out using ant colony algorithm. The same procedure was also applied to five different image processing and clustering algorithms (watershed, random walker, k-means, maximum entropy and region growing) in order to compare the performance of the proposed method with other methods. Microaneurysm images manually detected by a specialist eye doctor were used to measure the performances of above-mentioned methods. The similarities among microaneurysms which were automatically and manually segmented were tested using Dice and Jaccard similarity index values. Dice index values obtained from the study vary between 0.52 and 0.98 in maximum entropy, 0.55 and 0.88 in watershed, 0.75 and 0.86 in region growing, 0.55 and 0.78 in k-means, and 0.66 and 0.83 in random walker, and 0.81 and 0.9 in ant colony. Similar performance values were also obtained in Jaccard index. The results show that different performances were observed in the conventional segmentation of microaneurysms depending on the image quality. On the other hand, the ant colony based method proposed in this paper displays a more stabilized and higher performance irrespective of image contrast. Therefore, it is evident that the proposed method successfully detects microaneurysms even in low quality images, thus helping specialists diagnose them in an easier way."

Peripheral melanin, found in skin and hair, and neuromelanin appear to have some characteristics in common and share the same precursor for their synthesis; therefore, skin and hair features could be associated with PD. We hypothesize that earlier age at onset of hair greying, greater tendency to sunburn, difficulty tanning and dysregulation of sebum production are more common among PD patients due to genetically determined lower constitutive amounts of melanin and accumulation of α-synuclein in the skin, which leads to disrupted synthesis of peripheral melanin and dysregulated sebum secretion. In order to test this hypothesis 32 PD patients and 35 age and gender matched PD-unaffected individuals were included in a pilot study. The median of age at onset of hair greying was 30% lower in the PD group compared to the control group (35 and 50 years, respectively, p = 0.002). Age at onset of hair greying ≤ 41 years predicted the development of PD with 71.0% sensitivity and 70.6% specificity (area under curve = 0.725, 95% confidence interval = 0.601–0.850, p = 0.002). Significant differences were found when comparing skin types between PD patients and the control group (p < 0.001): dry (n = 14, 43.8%) and oily (n = 9, 28.1%) skin types were the most prevalent among individuals with PD, whereas the majority of control subjects reported having normal skin (n = 24, 68.6%). Differences in tanning ability were also found between the groups (p = 0.035): the majority of individuals in the control group (n = 24, 68.6%) and only 12 (37.5%) PD patients reported being able to tan easily. PD patients were also more likely to burn often in comparison to control subjects (n = 21, 65.6% vs n = 10, 28.6%, p = 0.001). Our results support the hypothesis that PD is associated with earlier age at onset of hair greying, greater tendency to sunburn, difficulty tanning and non-normal skin type; however these ideas should be evaluated in a large prospective study in order to draw final conclusions. If such work supports our hypothesis, skin and hair features could be included in a risk-score model to identify individuals at high risk of PD in order to diagnose patients prior to the manifestation of motor symptoms and initiate potential neuroprotective treatment when neuronal loss is minimal."

abstract = "Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Primary open-angle glaucoma, the most common type, is characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons in the optic nerve, resulting in progressive deterioration of visual fields. The optic nerve head is generally considered to be the primary site of axonal injury in glaucoma. Although the pathophysiology of glaucomatous optic neuropathy is not well understood, elevated intraocular pressure is considered the most important modifiable risk factor. However, in normal-tension glaucoma, intraocular pressure is not elevated and thus other risk factors must also be involved in the optic neuropathy of primary open-angle glaucoma. Several studies reported significantly lower intracranial pressure in patients with glaucoma compared with healthy subjects, suggesting that low intracranial pressure may result in a high pressure difference across the lamina cribrosa, influencing the physiology and pathophysiology of the optic nerve head by the effect of a mechanical force. Moreover, a rapidly evolving literature suggests the existence of an ‘ocular glymphatic system’. This opens up new ways to understand the mechanisms underlying a range of ocular diseases such as glaucoma. In the present paper, I hypothesize that an imbalance between intraocular pressure and intracranial pressure, apart from generating mechanical forces at the lamina cribrosa, may lead to a dangerous interplay between ocular fluid and cerebrospinal fluid resulting in impaired cerebrospinal fluid entry into the optic nerve subarachnoid space and optic nerve perivascular spaces, and the perivascular space surrounding the central retinal artery in particular, thereby inhibiting glymphatic clearance of waste products from the retrobulbar or retrolaminar portion of the optic nerve. Should further research demonstrate that the proposed viewpoint is largely correct, it would hold great potential for our understanding of glaucomatous optic nerve damage and would have important implications for diagnosis and therapy of this devastating disorder."

However, there are some data suggesting an (at least indirect) effect of ivabradine on the ANS. The pathomechanism behind is unclear. Based on the complex of plexuses and ganglia in the heart, the existence of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS), also known as the “little brain” of the heart, has been suggested. The ICNS is supposed to process information on the cardiac milieu and provide the central nervous system with these data. We put forward a hypothesis that part of ivabradine’s protective effects might reside in the modulation of the ANS by affecting the ICNS. Setting a new autonomic balance by ivabradine might be of benefit in the treatment of autonomic dysfunction-related pathologies."

However, the cause of this trend remains unknown and in addition, we have yet to be able to establish a reliable method for preventing the onset of myopia. Furthermore, previous myopia studies have not paid adequate attention to hyperopia. That is to say, it has been suggested that the development of refraction in infancy and the onset of myopia are distinct from emmetropization. However, myopia studies also need to focus on the development of refraction in infancy, which involves hyperopia. Based on this viewpoint, our new hypothesis is that the trend towards myopia is associated with changes during the infancy period. The supporting evidence for these changes can be found in four areas, epidemiology of hyperopia, relationship with body height, incidence of esotropia, and birth month research. If this hypothesis is true, we need to investigate why there has been a decrease in hyperopia patients rather than why there has been an increase in myopia patients."

For convenience, the two afflictions are considered together under the rubric traumatic brain injury. Despite the need for neuroprotective agents, no substances have shown efficacy in clinical studies. Thus, a deeper understanding of the neuropathological mechanism of such injury is still needed. Proposed here is a theory that microorganisms from within the brain and elsewhere in the body contribute to the long-term neurological deterioration characteristic of traumatic brain injury. The label, “The Beehive Theory”, is drawn from the well-known fact that disturbing a tranquil beehive with a blow can cause a swarm of angry bees to exit their dwelling place and attack nearby humans. Similarly, an impact to the head can initiate dislocations and disruptions in the microbiota present in the brain and body. First, since the normal human brain is not sterile, but is host to a variety of microorganisms, blows to the skull may dislodge them from their accustomed local environments, in which they have been living in quiet equilibrium with neighboring brain cells. Deleterious substances may be released by the displaced microbes, including metabolic products and antigens. Second, upon impact commensal microbes already resident on surfaces of the nose, mouth, and eyes, and potentially harmful organisms from the environment, may gain access to the brain through the distal ends of the olfactory and optic nerves or even a disrupted blood-brain barrier. Third, microbes dwelling in more distant parts of the body may be propelled through the walls of local blood vessels into the bloodstream, and then leak out into damaged areas of the brain that have increased blood-brain barrier permeability. Fourth, the impact may cause dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal microbiome, thereby disrupting signaling via the gut-brain axis. Possible preventatives or therapeutics that would address the adverse contributions of microbes to the late sequelae of traumatic brain injury include anti-inflammatories, antibacterials, antivirals, and probiotics."

abstract = "Decompressive craniectomy (DC) plays a significant role in treating refractory intracranial hypertension. During this surgical procedure, part of the skull is removed and the underlying dura mater is open, which can effectively release intracranial pressure. However, in some cases, the decision whether or not to remove the bone flap relies on the surgeon’s personal experience. Positive decisions are usually made to avoid massive postoperative cerebral edema and infarction, which can lead to overtreatment. The procedure is related to many side-effects, which may affect the recovery of neurological function. Patients who have survived have to be anesthetized and undergo secondary cranioplasty 3 or 6 months later. Despite its technical simplicity, complications associated with cranioplasty are hard to ignore. Therefore, there is a need for a new surgical procedure combining decompressive craniectomy and cranioplasty. Acute expansion of the skin flap is limited, and the compensatory capacity of the skull after DC depends on the volume of the bone flap at the early stage. The titanium mesh is thin and strong, does not take up extra space provided by bone flap. Therefore, we put forward the concept of Decompressive Bone Flap Replacement. During this procedure, neurosurgeons resect the massive bone flap, open the dura mater, remove the hematoma in a similar manner to a standard craniotomy and then use titanium mesh shaped appropriately to replace the bone flap. Compared with traditional DC, it can ensure the integrity of the skull without affecting the effect of decompression. This paper presents 2 cases of DC and reviews the literature sustaining our hypothesis."

Furthermore, the World Health Organization estimates that deaths from the complications of diabetes will increase by two thirds between 2008 and 2030. Since type 2 diabetes is a major public health crisis, why have the genetic variants for diabetes not been removed from the genome by natural selection? We hypothesize that insulin resistance, a predisposition to type 2 diabetes, and the associated elevation in sympathetic nervous system activity and arterial blood pressure provided an advantage to humans who lived as hunter-gatherers. Specifically, sympathetic hyperactivity stimulates the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, promotes sodium reabsorption, and increases blood volume, heart rate, stroke volume and peripheral vascular resistance, thus inducing hypertension. The hypertension in turn provides a hemodynamic advantage for hunter-gatherers. Specifically, sympathetic hyperactivity and increased blood pressure increases blood flow delivery to working muscles by increasing cardiac output and shunting blood from non-active tissue. This natural selection for hypertension occurred during the time in human evolutionary history when the lifespan of most individuals was probably 30–40 years, and morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disorders was limited. Thus, the selection pressure for elevation in sympathetic nervous system activity and blood pressure provided an advantage for hunting and gathering that would be greater than the selection pressure exerted by the manifestations of cardiovascular disease in aged individuals."

abstract = "Aim
The Gregorian calendar divides a common year into 12 months of irregular length. As a result, whenever time is measured in months, an unavoidable degree of inaccuracy exists. We hypothesize that the use of this unprecise measure of time has profound implications for the field of pharmacotherapy from practical and drug safety issues, to variations in drug budgets, and pharmacoepidemiological, industrial and drug regulatory considerations, such as price-fixing policies. In this paper, we have tried to gather evidence in favor of our hypothesis, focusing on the particular case of antipsychotics.
Methods
First, we examined all monthly prescriptions of long acting injectable aripiprazole or paliperidone in the Basque Country from January 1st to December 31st, 2017. Second, we investigated how the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics defines the defined daily dose (DDD) for these drugs. Third, we analyzed the pack size of oral solid formulations of antipsychotics on the market in Spain. Finally, we explored how evidence from clinical trials is transferred to clinical practice and how it may affect drug fixing-policies.
Results
We found that “monthly” and “every 4 week” injections were prescribed for approximately half of patients. We estimated that an extra cost of almost half a million euros (€495,420) would have been incurred if all prescriptions had been every 4 weeks. We also found that 21 additional adverse site reactions per year could be expected for aripiprazole. Besides, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics calculates the defined daily dose using a 30-day interval for these drugs. In addition, we found that pack sizes for currently available solid oral antipsychotic formulations are inconsistent, with 53% being sold as 28-day multiples and 46% as 30-day multiples. Finally, we found out that although the vast majority of clinical trials are performed in weeks, drug regulatory agencies frequently use the term “month” or “monthly” in the summary of product characteristics of marketed antipsychotics.
Conclusion
This study shows that the inconsistent definition of month has deep implications on various aspects of pharmacotherapy. Considering all the data given above, we urge drug regulatory agencies to specifically avoid the term “month” in the summary of product characteristics and adopt 4-week intervals instead. We also suggest that the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics establishes a new 28-day based DDD for “monthly” antipsychotics. Finally, healthcare providers worldwide should abstain from using “monthly” frequencies in drug prescription software tools."

Pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by hypothalamus is a primer step to initiate the release of pituitary gonadotropins. Kisspeptin and gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) are accepted as two major players in the activation and inhibition of GnRH regarding the neuroendocrine functioning of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis. Kisspeptin is known as the most potent activator of GnRH. Regarding the inhibition of GnRH, RF-amide-related peptide-3 (RFRP-3) is accepted as the mammalian orthologue of GnIH in avian species. RF9 (1-adamantane carbonyl-Arg-Phe-NH2) is an antagonist of RFRP-3/GnIH receptor (neuropeptide FF receptor 1 (NPFFR1; also termed as GPR147). In recent years, several studies have indicated that RF9 activates GnRH neurons and gonadotropins in a kisspeptin receptor (Kiss1r, formerly known as GPR54) dependent manner. These results suggest that RF9 may have a bimodal function as both an RFRP-3 antagonist and a kisspeptin agonist or it may be a kiss1r agonist rather than an RFRP-3/GnIH receptor antagonist. These interactions are possible because Kisspeptin and GnIH are members of the RF-amide family, and both possibilities are not far from explaining the potent gonadotropin stimulating effects of RF9. Therefore, we hypothesize that RF9 may be a new therapeutic option for the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to its potent GnRH stimulating effects. A constant or repeated administration of RF9 provides a sustained increase in plasma gonadotrophin levels. However, applications in the same way with GnRH analogues and kisspeptin may result in desensitization of the gonadotropic axis. The reasons reported above contribute to our hypothesis that RF9 may be a good option in the GnRH stimulating as a kisspeptin agonist. We suggest that further studies are needed to elucidate the potential effects of RF9 in the treatment of the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism."

Leydig cells are the predominant cell population in the testis interstitium and, when stimulated, they are capable of initiating immune responses playing crucial roles in the mechanisms related to testis’ homeostasis. These cells express TLR4, an innate immune receptor, which is known to be modulated by hyperglycemia in other cell populations and tissue types. Still, whether TLR4 contributes to hyperglycemia-associated testicular dysfunction remains elusive. Activation of TLR4 in response to high glucose levels involves redox imbalance and stimulation of transcriptional factors, especially nuclear factor (NF)-κB, which could be a potential pathological mechanism compromising the testis integrity. Additionally, emerging evidence shows crosstalk between TLR4 and Nrf2, an anti-inflammatory mediator that was previously shown to be reduced in diabetic testis. Therefore, we hypothesize that hyperglycemia-mediated TLR4 activation in testicular cells, especially Leydig cells might be a crucial event triggering oxidative stress and inflammation, which in turn, drives testicular dysfunction."

Lack of otoconia or otoconial loss may be the major reason for increasing imbalance with age, posttraumatic dizziness and residual dizziness as well as other so far unexplained imbalance affecting probably millions of people.
Background
It is written in every textbook that we need sensation of gravity for stable gait and stance, especially on two legs. Lack of otoconia is known to cause lifelong balance problems in animals. Loss of otoconia is happening in aging humans, like shown by increasing incidence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and in histological sections. While hundreds of papers have been published on BPPV, increasing imbalance with age and increasing falls, none has ever described the loss of otoconia as a major reason for this imbalance. Maybe this is due to the problems to proof this hypothesis in an individual patient. We will explain why otoconial loss may cause dizziness, postural and locomotor instability in patients with no other identifiable cause or in addition to other causes. Several reasons can cause otoconial loss and lead to the described symptoms. We will describe the symptoms and the tests which could in combination support the diagnosis.
Conclusion
Our hypothesis argues for the new diagnosis in many patients with so far undiagnosed or incorrectly or incompletely diagnosed dizziness or imbalance."

The main point of this theory is that the aging is rooted from an evolutionary competition, that is, a never ending coevolutionary race between host cells and mitochondria. Mitochondria are the descendants of bacteria. The host cells will inevitably sense their bacterial origin, particularly their circular mtDNA. The host intracellular innate immune pressure (HIIIP) aims to eliminate mtDNA as more as possible while mitochondria have to adapt the HIIIP for survival. Co-evolution is required for both of them. From biological point of view, the larger, the mtDNA, the higher, the chance, it becomes the target of HIIIP. As a result, mitochondria have to reduce their mtDNA size via deletion. This process has last for 1.5–2 billion yeas and the result is that mitochondria have lost excessive 95% of their DNA. This mtDNA deletion is not associated with free radical attack but a unique trait acquired during evolution. In the postmitotic cells, the deletion is passively selected by the mitochondrial fission-fusion cycles. Eventually, the accumulation of deletion will significantly jeopardize the mitochondrial function. The dysfunctional mitochondria no longer provide sufficient ATP to support host cells’ continuous demanding for growth. At this stage, the cell or the organism aging is inevitable."

The G-quadruplex (G4) and intercalated motif (I-motif or IM) DNA structures are formed as knots where, correspondingly, guanines or cytosines on the same strand of DNA bind to each other. There are grounds to believe that G4 and IM sequences play a significant role in regulating gene expression considering their tendency to be found in or near regulatory sites (such as promoters, enhancers, and telomeres) as well as the correlation between the prevalence of G4 or IM conformations and specific phases of cell cycle. Notably, G4 and IM capable sequences tend to be found on the opposite strands of the same DNA site with at most one of the two structures formed at any given time. The recent evidence that K+, Mg2+ concentrations directly affect IM formation (and likely G4 formation indirectly) lead us to believe that these structures may play a major role in synaptic plasticity of neurons, and, therefore, in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions including memory, learning, habitual behaviors, pain perception and others. Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms, which have an important role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation, were also shown to influence formation and stability of G4s and IMs. Our hypothesis is that non-canonical DNA and RNA structures could be an integral part of neuroplasticity control via gene expression regulation at the level of transcription, translation and splicing. We propose that the regulatory activity of DNA IM and G4 structures is modulated by DNA methylation/demethylation of the IM and/or G4 sequences, which facilitates the switch between canonical and non-canonical conformation. Other neuronal mechanisms interacting with the formation and regulatory activity of non-canonical DNA and RNA structures, particularly G4, IM and triplexes, may involve microRNAs as well as ion and proton fluxes. We are proposing experiments in acute brain slices and in vivo to test our hypothesis. The proposed studies would provide new insights into fundamental neuronal mechanisms in health and disease and potentially open new avenues for treating mental health disorders."

One major clue to understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of delusions is the emergence of false narratives from brain disease. In addition to delusions themselves, there are a range of other false narratives not due to deliberate lying and resulting from neurological disorders, including provoked confabulations, fantastic confabulations, false memories, magical thinking, dream delusions, and “fantastic thinking”. A comparison of their characteristics, similarities, and differences suggest a hypothesis: despite different sources for their false narrative experiences, such as unusual thoughts or perceptions, all false narratives from brain disease involve erroneous or mismatched “affective biases” applied to the experiences. Affective labels usually signal the sense of rightness, sense of familiarity, and the external vs. internal origin of an experience, and they can be altered by limbic neuropathology. The location and involvement of neuropathology that facilitates false narratives involves frontolimbic regions and their connections, particularly on the right. Future investigations can focus on frontolimbic mechanisms involved in the provision of the intrinsically-linked affective biases, which indicate the nature and external/internal origin of experiences."

abstract = "The multitude of terms associated with love has given rise to a false perception of love. In this paper, only maternal and romantic love are considered. Love is usually regarded as a feeling, motivation, addiction, passion, and, above all, an emotion. This confusion has consequences in the lives of human beings, leading not only to divorces, suicides, femicides but possibly also to a number of mental illnesses and suffering. Therefore, it is crucial to first clarify what is meant by emotion, motivation and love. This work aims to finally place love within the category of physiological motivations, such as hunger, thirst, sleep, or sex, on the basis that love is also essential for human survival, especially in childhood. Love is presented from an evolutionary perspective. Some other similarities between love and other physiological motivations are pointed out, such as its importance for appropriate human development, both its ontogeny and its permanence, and the long-lasting consequences of abuse and neglect. There are summarized reasons that account for this, such as the fact that physiological motivations are essential for survival and that love is an essential motivation for the survival of human offspring. Other reasons are that minimum changes in the quantity and quality of love alters development, that there can be a variety of neurophysiological and behavioural states within a motivation, and that motivations (also love) appear and change throughout development. Also, motivations and love sometimes may lead to an addictive behaviour. Finally, it is recognized that once physiological motivations (and love) appear, they become permanent. In a third section, some potential social, cultural, clinical and scientific consequences of the proposed consideration of love as a motivation are discussed. Accordingly, love’s recognition as a motivation in the clinical field would imply a better understanding of its disorders and its inclusion in classifications manuals such as The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), or in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Considering love as a motivation rather than an emotion could also impact the results of scientific research (an example is included). A comprehensive understanding of these questions could potentially allow for a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of mental illness, while offering an all-inclusive evolutionary explanation of cultural phenomena such as the origin and diffusion of both language and art. Love should be understood as a physiological motivation, like hunger, sleep or sex, and not as an emotion as it is commonly considered."

abstract = "The increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes transcends all cultures, largely due to populations transitioning from traditional diets and manual occupations, to sedentary, calorific lifestyles. Excess calorie intake leads to intramuscular fat accumulation and insulin resistance. Physical inactivity causes underutilization of mitochondria causing dysfunction and inflammation. Both insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction mechanisms are known to be closely related and to antagonise one another, although the precise nature of the relationship has eluded characterization. It is poorly understood why this mutual dysfunction progresses on to clinical diabetes in only some patients, why progression is often stepwise and why diabetes control only weakly predicts future cardiovascular disease in individuals. Clinical prediction in patients is therefore currently unsatisfactory and current linear assumptions require challenging. Cells contain networks of oscillating ionic fluxes. Cellular activity is characterised by complex patterns of fluctuation with sudden transitions between patterns. The non-linear nature of these oscillations is well characterised in neuronal activity, cardiac impulses and more recently mitochondria, but not previously in relation to diabetes. Cells under metabolic stress demonstrate complex fluctuations of mitochondrial distribution, coupling strength and synchronisation resulting in periodic or chaotic oscillations of function, causing accumulation of intracellular fat and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), which exacerbates insulin resistance. Glucose, insulin and HbA1c in patients are also known to oscillate in complex patterns but the mechanisms and significance are largely unknown. Drawing on existing evidence and models from other diseases, a nonlinear, dynamical hypothesis of diabetes onset and progression is proposed. Insulin receptor pathways and mitochondria are treated as two populations of coupled, phase oscillators. Health or disease states depend on system stability or instability and reflect the balance of substrate supply and energy demand. The implication of this novel mechanism is that diabetes and the complications are not the consequence of a distinct pathological agent or pathway, but more an evolving dysrhythmia of normal cellular energetics systems, resulting from accumulated adverse lifestyle conditions. This hypothesis is proposed with the intention of stimulating research into non-linear dynamical constructs as an alternative to current linear models, to improve risk prediction and trajectory analysis in type 2 diabetes."

In this study, our theory considers the photonic behavior on time control by some particular or some block of neurons. Photon emission by mitochondria has regular timing in intercellular process. In other words, due to the main mitochondrial function of cellular respiration as well as the source of photon emission, it is possible to deduce photon at a specific rate in TANs (Tonically Active Neurons). If photoreceptors exist in the neurons of the nervous system, photons can be received at a regulated time. Thereby, neurons can produce a constant-frequency signal for subsequent stimuli. Our studies conducted in the CNS (Central Nervous System) and TANs, and it seems that photoreceptors are present in TANs. Photons are interpreted by a series of neurons and produce an oscillating rhythm. These rhythms can be the basis of the body's chronological activity in different areas of the CNS. If this hypothesis is true, it can be deduced that an independent factor, excluding circadian activities, exists for living activities. Different neuronal structures will also be responsible for understanding the time. Although this hypothesis is far from a complete evaluation, it can compensate for some of the other problems. For instance, a series of inconsistencies that occur in some neurological diseases, such as Parkinson diseases can be well justified by this hypothesis."

abstract = "The theory that antibody (Ab) directed against the TSH receptor (TSHR) (TSHRAb) is the causal factor of Graves’ disease seems unlikely. Corticosteroids have not had a curative effect on the hyperthyroidism of Graves’ disease despite their effectiveness for other autoimmune diseases. Two kinds of TSHRAb, thyroid-stimulating Ab (TSAb) and thyroid-blocking Ab (TBAb), are known as causal factors of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, respectively. Previously, we reported that TSAb may be thyroid stimulating animal IgG-like hormone and TBAb may be the precursor of TSAb. In this paper we suggested that TBAb (precursor) converts to TSAb (active form) via the action of the protease, colloid antigen 2 (CA2). We speculate that the conversion of TBAb to TSAb is controlled by two factors: the protease and an anti-protease Ab. When anti-protease Ab levels are high, the patient exhibits hypothyroidism due to the increase in TBAb levels caused by neutralization of the protease. When anti-protease Ab levels are negative, the patient’s hypothyroidism disappeared by the negative serum TBAb due to increased protease. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) with enzyme activity is known as an abzyme, which may be an undeveloped form. IgG with hormone activity may be likewise called an abhormone, which could also be an undeveloped form. The tumor marker CEA is a known member of the IgG supergene family. Many ancestral versions of proteins may have been produced as an IgG form. Possible participation of colloid antigen 2 and abhormone for the etiology of Graves’ disease is suggested."

abstract = "Vectorcardiogram (VCG) is a recurring, near-periodic pattern of cardiac dynamics that graphically represents the trajectory of the tip of cardiac vectors in three dimensional space with varying time. VCG is constructed by drawing the instantaneous vectors from a zero reference point according to direction, magnitude and polarity in the space. It is more informative and sensitive than conventional ECG as an evaluation tool of the physiology of cardiac dynamics. Each heart cycle consists of three loops corresponding to P, QRS, and T wave activities in VCG. The morphological assessment of the QRS loop was carried out in order to analyze the spatial vectors of the ventricles and their patho-physiological correlation in various cardiac diseases. It was found that, the three dimensional QRS loop in healthy individuals lies in a plane. It is rather surprising that the normal spatial QRS loop lies in a single plane, considering the complex structure of the ventricular musculature together with the numerous possible pathways along which the depolarization impulse passes. The highly curious phenomenon of planarity of the spatial QRS loop was explained by uniform double layer (UDL) theory, which postulates the phenomenon of activation wave-fronts that propagate with a constant & uniform rate throughout the myocardium. Acute myocardial infarction results in loss of structural and functional integrity of the different layers of heart, perturbation of the uniformity in wave propagation due to the disturbance in directional symmetry, development of nonlinear relationships among the concerned variables, loss of homogeneity and complete loss of planarity of the 3D-QRS loop. The planarity of the 3D-QRS loop is a highly restricted and sensitive parameter and a characteristic feature of normal heart and can be utilized as a test for diagnostic screening of cardiac normalcy and the loss of planarity may be a conspicuous feature of AMI. It will be reasonable to study the morphology of the spatial QRS loop in patients of AMI throughout the course of disease and also in a regular interval through the long-term follow up period. It is expected that with the reperfusion, recovery and salvage of the diseased myocardium; the homogeneity and the intensity of the line density of the membrane current of the UDL would gradually recover with retrieval of the planarity of the spatial QRS loop. The temporal pattern of characteristics alteration of the QRS loop planarity with the natural course of the disease requires intensive evaluation. We propose that, the planarity of the spatial QRS loop, its loss, involution and reversal is a temporal series of events in AMI and also a crucial diagnostic and prognostic parameter."

abstract = "The underlining mechanism in neural mitochondrial dysfunction and consequences neurotoxicity, and cognitive behavior after methylphenidate (MPH) prolonged uses is unclear and proposing of therapeutic approaches for treatment of these types of neurotoxicity is one of the main goals of scientist in this manner. MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in neural cells caused induction of oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation and cognition impairment, which leads to neurotoxicity, was reported previously but role of key neural cells proteins and involved signaling pathway in this manner remained indeterminate. Tau protein aggregation is a biomarker for mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegenerative event and cognition impairment. Tau aggregation occur by stimulation effects of Glycogen synthase kinase-3(GSK3β) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) which activates protein kinase B(Akt) and causes inhibition of phosphorylation(activation) of GSK3β, thus Akt activation can cause inhibition of tau aggregation (hyper-phosphorylation). Management of mentioned MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and consequences of neurotoxicity, and cognitive behavior through a new generation neuroprotective combination, based on modulation of disturbed in Akt function and inhibition of GSK3β and tau hyper-phosphorylation can be a prefect therapeutic interventions. Therefore, finding, introduction and development of new neuroprotective properties and explanation of their effects with potential capacity for modulation of tau hyper-phosphorylation via PI3/Akt/GSK signaling pathway is necessitated. During recent years, using new neuroprotective compounds with therapeutic probability for treatment of psychostimulant-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive malicious effects have been amazingly increased. Many previous studies have reported the neuroprotective roles of minocycline (a broad-spectrum and long-acting antibiotic) in multiple neurodegenerative events and diseases in animal model. But the role of neuroprotective effects of this agent against MPH induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive malicious and also role of tau hyper-phosphorylation by modulation of PI3/Akt/GSK signaling pathway in this manner remain unknown. Thus we suggested and theorized that by using minocycline in MPH addicted subject, it would provide neuroprotection against MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive malicious. Also we hypothesized that minocycline, via modulation of PI3/Akt/GSK and inhibition of tau hyper-phosphorylation, can inhibit MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive malicious. In this article, we tried to discuss our hypothesis regarding the possible role of minocycline, as a powerful neuroprotective agent, and also role of tau hyper-phosphorylation related to PI3/Akt/GSK signaling pathway in treatment of MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive disturbance."

The most dangerous sleep disorder is obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), which manifests itself during sleep and can cause the sudden death of patients. Many important parameters related to the diagnosis and treatments of such sleep disorders are simultaneously examined. This process is exhausting and time-consuming for experts and also requires experience; thus, it can cause difference of opinion among experts. Because of this, automatic sleep staging systems have been designed. In this study, a decision support system was developed to determine OSAS patients. In the developed decision support system, unlike in the available published literature, patient and healthy individual classification was performed using only the Pulse Transition Time (PTT) parameter rather than other parameters obtained from polysomnographic data like ECG (Electrocardiogram), EEG (Electroencephalography), carbon dioxide measurement and EMG (Electromyography). The suggested method can perform feature extraction from PTT signals by means of a deep-learning method. AlexNet and VGG-16, which are two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, have been used for feature extraction. With the features obtained, patients and healthy individuals were classified by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithms.

Studies have shown that midazolam may have a detrimental effect on the developmental of the pediatric nervous system. Our previous study found that midazolam induced neuronal damage after CPR in young rats. It is speculated that: midazolam causes the potential injury of neurons by inhibiting mitochondrial autophagy expression and is an important factor for the poor prognosis in children after successful CPR. This project intends to adopt the modified asphyxiant CPR model in juvenile rats. Survival rate, neurological function and histopathological changes were evaluated to determine the protective effects of appropriate sedation depth on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in juvenile rats after CPR. Combined with cell biology and molecular biology related technologies, the mechanism by which the mitochondrial pinkl-parkin signaling pathway induces autophagy to inhibit neuronal apoptosis may be key factor in the protective effects of sedation depth on the brain. The aim of this study is to provide experimental evidence and elucidate the mechanisms of improvement of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by sedation depth in children after successful CPR and to lay a theoretical and experimental basis for clinical treatment."

Researchers from different fields have tried to classify emotions through physiological signals. Nonlinear analysis has been reported to be successful and effective in emotion classification due to the nonlinear and non-stationary behavior of biological signals. In this study, phase space reconstruction and Poincare planes are employed to describe the dynamics of electroencephalogram (EEG) in emotional states. EEG signals are taken from a reliable database and phase space is reconstructed. A new transformation is introduced in order to quantify the phase space. Dynamic characteristics of the new space are considered as features. Most significant features are selected and samples are classified into four groups including high arousal – high valence (HAHV), low arousal – high valence (LAHV), high arousal – low valence (HALV) and low arousal – low valence (LALV). Classification accuracy was about 90% on average. Results suggest that the proposed method is successful and classification performance is good in comparison with most studies in this field. Brain activity is also reported with respect to investigating brain function during emotion elicitation. We managed to introduce a new way to analyze EEG phase space. The proposed method is applied in a real world and challenging application (i.e. emotion classification). Not only does the proposed method describe EEG changes due to different emotional states but also it is able to represent new characteristics of complex systems. The suggested approach paves the way for researchers to analyze and understand more about chaotic signals and systems."

This technique may be a low-cost alternative for traditional scanning. The objective of this proof of concept was to evaluate the accuracy and precision in obtaining digital models (DM) from a plaster model (PM) using photogrammetry. Five DM were generated from 50 photographs taken surrounding the PM. The photographs were taken by a single operator on five consecutive days using natural light. The images obtained were processed on 3DF Zephyr Free software. The height and width of all teeth were recorded on both PM and DM, as well as the distance between the canine cusps (C–C) and between the mesiobuccal cusps of the first molars (1 M–1 M). For the PM the measurements were taken with a digital caliper, whereas the DM was measured using the software Blender. The DM and PM measurements presented a limit of agreement between −0.433 and 0.611 mm. The accuracy of DM measurements showed a SD of ±0.171 mm and a repeatability coefficient of 0.474. In the superimposition of all DM, it was possible to notice a greater discrepancy in the posterior region of the arch and palate, but this difference decreased when the region was segmented. It can be concluded that photogrammetry appears to be a viable technique for the digitization of dental models. Further studies need to be performed to evaluate its clinical application."

Although a growing body of literature has indicated high prevalence of anxiety in patients with psoriasis, it is unclear if the incidence of anxiety is correlated with severity of psoriasis. In this article, we hypothesize that anxiety is not correlated with severity of psoriasis, and therefore the issue of anxiety should not be neglected in patients with mild psoriasis. To testify this hypothesis, we performed a pilot study to investigate the correlation between anxiety questionnaires and severity of psoriasis. Thirty-two patients with psoriasis were recruited. The patients were further classified into mild or moderate to severe psoriasis according to their body surface area or Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI). Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and SF-36 were adopted to evaluate anxiety and quality of life, respectively. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated between SAS and each scale of SF-36 among these 32 patients. SAS is negatively correlated with role limitation due to emotional problems, vitality, emotional well-being of SF-36. Although SAS is not significantly different between mild and moderate to severe psoriasis, the detected levels of anxiety were higher than normative standards. Physicians should not neglect potential anxiety in patients who have mild psoriasis. Inter-discipline collaboration between psychiatry and dermatology is required to provide comprehensive patient care."

Historically, hunting-foraging and later agrarian communities often manifested a converse negative energy balance due to nutritional deficit and/or high physical energy demand – both potentially resulting in hypoglycaemia. Since hypoglycaemia impairs both reproductive fitness and cognitive function, it is proposed that that by expressing resistance to hypoglycaemia, T2D phenotypes were subject to positive selection. The insulin resistance present in often-associated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovarian disease may also explain their frequent coexistence and current prevalence."

The condition is associated with several other autoimmune diseases, but autoimmune thyroid diseases, especially Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), is the most prevalent organ-specific autoimmune disease with a co-morbidity up to 34%. Among the many hypotheses that have been proposed for the pathogenesis of both diseases, autoimmunity and oxidative stress-mediated toxicity in melanocytes or thyrocytes, respectively, have been the most widely accepted – with autoimmunity being the presumed consequence of oxidative stress-mediated toxicity. However, the predominant etiologic basis for impairment of redox balance has rarely been studied. The two autoimmune diseases are not only linked by a concordance of clinical presentations and an autoimmune/oxidative stress-mediated toxicity pathogenesis but also by an apparent biochemical commonality. The target molecules produced in the thyroid and skin, i.e., thyroxine and melanin, respectively, are derived from the same primordial parent molecule, tyrosine. On the basis of these similarities between Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and vitiligo, specifically with respect to the activation of oxidative stress, we propose a novel hypothesis accounting for the destruction of melanocytes or thyrocytes in VL and AT. We suggest a new therapeutic regimen of quinone derivatives to combat ROS-induced autoimmunity resulting from this common biochemical etiologic error."

Despite (over) a century of intensive research, the etiology is still largely unknown. One of the major problems in all existing AIS research is the fact that most patients come to medical attention after onset of the curve. Therefore, it is impossible to know whether current investigated parameters are causative, or an effect of the scoliosis. Moreover, up until now there is no known animal model that captures the core features of AIS. In order to identify causal pathways leading to AIS we propose another approach, which has been of great value in other medical disciplines: To use a subset of the population, with a higher risk for a certain disease as a “model” for the general population. Such a “model” may allow the identification of causative mechanisms that might be applicable to the general population. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common microdeletion syndrome and occurs in ∼1:3000–6000 children and 1:1000 pregnancies. Nearly half of the population of patients with 22q11.2DS develop a scoliosis that in most cases resembles AIS as far as age at onset and curve pattern. We postulate that within 22q11.2DS certain causal pathways leading to scoliosis can be identified and that these are applicable to the general population."

The functionality of the neurogenic process appears to be operated by neuroblasts, the multipotent immature neuronal population of the adult brain. While neuroblasts have been realized to play a major role in synaptic remodeling and immunogenicity, neurodegenerative disorders have been characterized by failure in the terminal differentiation, maturation, integration and survival of newborn neuroblasts. Advancement in understanding the impaired neuroregenerative process along the neuropathological conditions has currently been limited by lack of an appropriate experimental model of neuroblasts. The genetic reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent state offers a potential strategy for the experimental modeling of brain disorders. Thus, the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) based direct reprogramming of somatic cells into neuroblasts would represent a potential tool to understand the regenerative biology of the adult brain. Therefore, this concise article discusses the significance of iPSCs, the functional roles of neuroblasts in the adult brain and provides a research hypothesis for the direct reprogramming of somatic cells into neuroblasts through the co-induction of a potential proneurogenic marker, the doublecortin (DCX) gene along with the Yamanaka factors. The proposed cellular model of adult neurogenesis may provide us with further insights into neuropathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders and will provide a potential experimental platform for diagnostic, drug discovery and regenerative therapeutic strategies."

abstract = "The predominance of the genus Corynebacterium in the healthy male urogenital system contributes to the resident microbiome of not only the distal urethra, but potentially the proximal urethra and urinary bladder as well. However, for certain species in this genus, pathogenic potential was described, and the salient representative is Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum (C. glucuronolyticum) implicated in cases of urethritis and prostatitis in men. Nonetheless, some still question whether C. glucuronolyticum can actually be considered pathogenic or rather just a commensal species fortuitously isolated in patients with urogenital symptoms and/or syndromes. Although pathogen/commensal dichotomy is not always clear-cut, we hypothesize that specific genetic markers may expose C. glucuronolyticum as a convincingly pathogenic Corynebacterium. More specifically, characteristic pathogenic gene constellation inherent to this species (most notably the presence of specific sortase/SpaA-type pili gene clusters, but also the augmentative role of type VII secretion system) may significantly facilitate host tissue adhesion, with subsequent suppression/evasion of the immune response and acquisition of vitally important nutrients. Consequently, these genetic markers differentiate C. glucuronolyticum from its commensal counterparts, and give this species a pathogenic facet, which can be even further influenced by the Allee effect. In this paper we also propose a specific methodological approach on how to analyze C. glucuronolyticum epithelial colonization capacity and explore inceptive host cell-pathogen interactions that manipulate host environment and immune responses. This entails moving from approaches based primarily on overall homology of primary sequences towards specific structure-function studies to precisely evaluate all stakeholders involved in pili assemblage, cell adhesion and the expression of other virulence traits. In the era of high precision medicine, the hypothesized roles of C. glucuronolyticum adhesion systems in both virulence and nutrient acquisition may also reveal promising targets for future drug developments."

Based on our experience in managing acute globe and orbital injuries and cases of strabismus, we propose the probable mechanism involved in the occurrence of extraocular muscle flap tear and a complete rupture of the muscle. During high-velocity injuries when the forces are equally transmitted along the orbital bony framework and the globe, then due to differential shearing forces created between the global and the orbital fibres leads to a flap tear. In the second scenario, if the forces are only directed along the bony framework, then the globe continues to be in continuous motion leading to increased tension between the muscles and the globe. Thus the weaker portions between these two structures are at risk of complete separation, that is along the insertion of muscle onto the globe or the musculotendinous portion."

abstract = "Chronis rhinosinusitis is considered as a widespread public health issue with a prevalence of 10%. The disease significantly reduces quality of life and increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases as well as certain forms of cancer. Alteration of mucociliary clearance frequently observed in the patients and plays a significant role in disease pathogenesis. Certain studies have demonstrated that patients with chronic rhinosinusitis are characterized by significant reduction of essential trace elements and toxic metal overload. However, the particular mechanisms of the role of trace element dysbalance in chronic rhinosinusitis are unclear. We hypothesize that exposure to toxic trace elements (arsenic, nickel, cadmium) damages ciliary mucosal epithelium thus affecting mucociliary transport. In turn, altered mucociliary transport results in reduced removal of the inhaled metal-containing particles from nasal mucosa leading to their absorption and further aggravation of toxicity. Essential trace elements (zinc, selenium) play a significant role in regulation of mucociliary transport and immunity, thus their deficiency (either dietary or due to antagonism with toxic metals) may be associated with impaired functions and increased toxic metal toxicity. Therefore, a vicious circle involving metal accumulation and toxicity, essential element deficiency, impairment of mucociliary transport and metal particle removal, resulting in further accumulation of metals and aggravation of toxic effects is formed. The present hypothesis is supported by the findings on the impact of trace elements especially zinc and arsenic on mucociliary clearance, the role of mucociliary transport in heavy metal particles elimination from the airways, trace element dysbalance in chronic rhinosinusitis, as well as toxic and essential metal antagonism. The data from hypothesis testing and its verification may be used for development of therapeutic approach for management of chronic rhinosinusitis. Particularly, the use of essential elements (zinc, selenium) may reduce toxic metal toxicity thus destroying the vicious circle of heavy metal exposure, toxicity, alteration of mucociliary clearance, and aggravation of chronic rhinosinusitis. Essential element supplementation may be considered as a tool for management of chronic refractory rhinosinusitis. In addition, analysis of essential and toxic trace element status may provide an additional diagnostic approach to risk assessment of chronic rhinosinusitis in highly polluted environments."

abstract = "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which is the most prevalent cause of dementia in the western world. Currently, it is the most expensive disease in America, costing more than heart diseases and cancer and as the world population is getting older it is expected to become the most expensive medical disorder in the world. AD is characterized by three core pathologies: accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and sustained inflammation. It is now believed that inflammation provides the link between Aβ and NFT. The immune system is therefore, a major player in the pathogenesis of AD. Here we propose that Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) could affect the incidence of AD. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis preparation first developed as a vaccine against M. tuberculosis. It has been shown to be moderately effective in preventing tuberculosis, while noted to induce modifications in inflammatory response and to regulate the immune system. Intra-vesical administration of BCG is used successfully in the past four decades to prevent recurrence of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In this manuscript we investigate the hypothesis that exposure to BCG decreases the prevalence of AD in elderly population and that this occurs through modulation of the immune system. Our hypothesis is based on several lines of evidence: lower prevalence of AD in countries with high BCG coverage, ability of BCG to ameliorate several conditions involving the immune system like type 1 diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis, animal models of AD in which BCG shows therapeutic potential and a plausible molecular mechanism which may be the basis for this hypothesis. Namely, elevated systemic levels of IL-2 (as found when BCG is given intra-vesically) that amplify Treg cells that inhibit AD associated inflammation, decreased plaque formation and restore cognitive function. To test this hypothesis one may study cognition in the large available “natural adult population” exposed to high dose of BCG through the bladder. Bladder cancer survivors not given BCG can serve as control group. This population can be used without adding any medical intervention."

Latest evidence supports the hypothesis of a genetic component in the aetiology of PCOS that seems to be inherited through an oligo-genic mechanism and cluster in families. Recent studies identified the existence of a male PCOS correspondent syndrome in which the genes responsible for PCOS susceptibility in women may be inherited by male relatives of women with PCOS. The same hormonal, clinical and metabolic alterations of women with PCOS have been found in their male relatives suggesting a relation between the syndrome in its male equivalent. Considering clinical manifestations of male PCOS equivalent, the early onset andro-genetic alopecia (AGA) is considered a clinical marker of insulin resistance, supported by the findings of a case-control study that reported an increased prevalence of hyperinsulinemia and insulin-resistance-associated disorders such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension and obesity, in men with early onset of alopecia (<35), compared with age-matched controls. Moreover, AGA and insulin resistance show higher levels of active androgens, highlighting that low SHBG levels occur in both the diseases and that the two conditions may concur to a worsening of the disease. With regards to the existence of a male PCOS equivalent syndrome, in particular with refer to its phenotypic hallmark of early onset AGA, our hypothesis supposes a beneficial effect of diet restriction used for PCOS as therapy for male patients affected by PCOS equivalent syndrome. Several observational studies and some randomized trials reported that modest reductions of body weight decrease the risk of development of many diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease and contributes to increase insulin sensitivity in PCOS women. Weight reduction may be adopted for men affected by PCOS equivalent syndrome in order to reduce both levels of circulating androgens, insulin resistance and related-complications such as CVD and DM II."

These weaknesses have been suggested to result in poor movement patterns, which results in the clinical presentation of pain due to increased stress on the patellofemoral joint. While quadriceps weakness have been identified as a risk factor for the development of PFP, prospective studies have not found gluteal muscle weakness to be a risk factor. Therefore, gluteal muscle weakness may in fact be a consequence of PFP. This muscle weakness is often combated with traditional strengthening programs. These interventions improve both short-term subjective function and improve strength, yet their relationship to long-term outcomes are less than optimal. Strength training of the gluteals also does not transition to improved movement patterns in this population. The presence of hip muscle inhibition may be the explanation for both poor long-term function and altered movement patterns. Assessment methods for muscle inhibition have been studied in the quadriceps, commonly conducted with the superimposed burst technique to calculate an activation ratio. The use of this method may be used on the gluteus medius and gluteus maximus muscles to determine if inhibition of the hip musculature is present in females with PFP. This knowledge would provide clinicians with a more complete picture of muscle dysfunction and lead to a paradigm shift in clinical treatment strategies for this chronic condition. We hypothesize that muscle inhibition is present in the gluteal muscles of females with PFP compared to healthy controls and it is associated with both decreased subjective function and longer duration of symptoms."

Their assertion, however, like the findings of the neural correlates of consciousness, does not explain subjectivity, but rather describes necessary conditions for it. Many scientists, including Panksepp, Demasio, and Tononi, have each made great contributions to the field, but none explains how material biological processes acquire subjectivity. Yet, the fact is that subjectivity exists and is and of great importance to evolution. Penrose argues that understanding, which involves subjectivity, must be brought into physics, perhaps an undiscovered aspect. Subjectivity is always of or about certain living brain information even though most brain functions do not have subjectivity. Many quantum fields are known to exist and follow Dyson's definition: “a kind of tension or stress which can exist in empty space in the absence of matter. It reveals itself by producing forces, which act on any material objects that happen to lie in the space the field occupies.” My hypothesis is that there may be undiscovered quantum fields, which unlike known fields, induce subjectivity when they interact with certain brain information. They emit quantum particles that exert force and cause changes to material objects (brain patterns conveying information) with which they interact. Information that transports meaning to living material exerts force through the understanding it conveys. There is a continuous interplay between experience and brain information. Experiences profoundly inform the brain and alter brain structure, function, and behavior, and local and integrated brain functions process information and initiate multiple associated experiences. Most experience is non-conscious, as discussed by Wright and others, like the soundtrack of a movie to which our brains respond continuously and emotionally even though, we are only intermittently consciously aware of it. I will explore how non-conscious experience may relate to the self, and how it might become conscious. I will offer present support and directions for testing this plausible hypothesis, as well as potential clinical applications in psychology."

Gaining access is the most critical step of this procedure, which can affect the rest of the operation. Although previously described techniques, eye of the needle and triangulation techniques, are being used for gaining access, urologists (especially novice ones) can still have problems during this step. Some navigation concepts have been developed in order to make the access safer, easier and more successful, however, none of them has been incorporated in daily routine practice till now because of either complicated techniques or requirement of sophisticated equipment.

Psychopathological or biological relationships between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have also been revealed. Therefore, in addition to depressive and manic states, psychosis may also be considered a manifestation resulting from additional impairments to neuronal plasticity. In the present manuscript, we hypothesize that moderate and more severe impairments to neuronal plasticity cause depressive and manic states, respectively, and that more serious impairments to neuronal plasticity cause psychosis. Many studies have suggested that impairments in neuronal plasticity contribute to schizophrenia and other mental disorders with psychotic features, and that the impairment of neuronal plasticity in schizophrenia is more severe than that in bipolar disorder. Therefore, we hypothesize more specifically that impairments in neuronal plasticity may be more severe in the order of the cases featuring psychosis, mania, and depression. This progression notably overlaps with the arrangement of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depressive disorder in the DSM-5. Psychotic symptoms are thought to appear further towards the base of the psychopathological hierarchy than are manic or depressive symptoms. If impairments to neuronal plasticity contribute to this psychopathological hierarchy, as we contest that they do, our hypothesis may serve as a bridge between clinical psychopathology, diagnosis, and biological psychiatry."

A brief historical and current state of endorsing knowledge summarizing its plausibility is presented. Both DTME and HAW are commonly encountered conditions in clinical practice. It is estimated that up to 30–70% of hospitalized patients will develop DTME and/or HAW. The currently available explanations in the pathophysiology of these conditions vary widely, and there is no consensus explanation on their etiopathogenesis. The disease state itself, inflammation, exo- and endo-toxins and decreased use of the synapse leads to their dysfunction which likely extends to other key cells in the micromilieu such as microglia, astrocytes, capillaries, Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes, and the blood brain barrier, all of which participate in the homeostasis and wellbeing of the synapses. Additional disruption of the micromilieu or presence of synaptotoxins (such as benzodiazepines, cytokines, anesthetics, and others) would allow entry into the neural tissue that could induce, aggravate or accelerate the synaptic dysfunction. As we enter the era of the connectome and synaptome, the Hebbian-endorsed synapse-centered hypothesis (heterogenous neuronal microdisconnections) attempts to unify the hypotheses of delirium/toxic-metabolic encephalopathy and hospital-acquired weakness into a single etiopathomechanism."

The mechanism of anticancerous activity is hypothesized that RISUG® involves its lipid membrane destabilizing activity. This activity is modulated by both, the cellular microenvironment and lipid bilayer composition. Acidic environment along with the significantly higher fluidic nature of lipid bilayer of the cancerous cells make them more prone to lipid solubilisation effect of RISUG®.

Standard E. coli therapy still entails antibiotic consumption, but urinary tract infections tend to recur at a very high rate. Due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of UPEC, as well as high infection recurrence rates, there is a need for new approaches to efficiently treat and prevent urinary tract infections. Since aforementioned adhesive organelles are the principal virulence factors in UPEC, anti-adhesion strategy seems to be the most promising (and hitherto unexplored) treatment option. Here we propose an antiadhesive dual targeting approach towards FimH and PapG adhesive proteins placed on two key virulence factors for UPEC – type I fimbriae and P pili. Such dual antagonists will contain appropriate pharmacophores (mannose and natural cranberry-containing polyphenol) joined together and will more efficiently block the infection and prevent the progression of the disease in comparison to FimH and PapG as isolated targets. More specifically, polyphenol mannosides (due to the structural similarities with the most potent biaryl inhibitors) can act as high-affinity FimH ligands, while cranberry-associated polyphenol moiety can additionally inhibit the PapG-mediated adhesion. Proposed compound may also contribute to the antioxidant capacity of the human organism. In conclusion, this dual-target hypothesis for the prevention and treatment of UPEC infections represents an important foundation for further research on this topic."

It is argued that increased treatment efficacy for depression may be achieved by utilising integrative or adjunctive treatments. As depression is influenced by an array of psychological, biological, social, environmental, dietary, and lifestyle factors, it is hypothesised that treatment outcomes will only be improved when integrative interventions are utilised. The research supporting the potential of several of these factors are reviewed in this article including those associated with diet, exercise, sleep, sunshine/light, nature, herbs and nutraceuticals, social connections, meditation, religion/spirituality, and alcohol and nicotine use.

abstract = "Carbamylation (or carbamoylation) is a non-enzymatic post-translational modification process of lysine residues and protein N-termini, which occurs throughout the lifespan of both various plasma proteins and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Carbamylation results from the binding of isocyanates spontaneously derived from high levels of blood urea, environmental pollutants, nutritional sources and leads to the formation of potentially atherogenic carbamylated-LDL (c-LDL) particles. The carbamylation of LDL apolipoproteins is associated unfavorable downstream effects. Ornithine is a non-proteinogenic amino acid, which plays a central role at the urea cycle function. The primary use of ornithine in supplements is to support athletic performance, liver function and wound recovery. Ornithine is structurally highly similar to lysine, and is only one carbon atom shorter in its side-chain. Therefore, we hypothesize that supplemented ornithine could compete with ε-amino groups of lysine residues found in apolipoproteins of native LDL particles in their binding to isocyanates and decrease c-LDL formation. This issue still remains unresolved in current literature and needs to be elucidated in experimental studies."

abstract = "Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are an uncommon vascular anomaly that carry the risk of rupture and hemorrhage. Several factors have been implicated in the propensity of an AVM to bleed. One such factor is stenosis of AVM draining veins, as impairment of the AVM venous drainage system is associated with increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Currently, our understanding of the pathogenesis of AVM venous outflow stenosis is limited, as there is insufficient data on the blood flow patterns and local hemodynamic parameters of these draining veins. The angioarchitecture of AVMs features a nidus lacking a high resistance capillary network. Accordingly, our previous studies on AVM arterial feeders have demonstrated an abnormally high flow volume rate along with low pulsatility and resistance indices on quantitative magnetic resonance angiography. As such, AVM vessels endure high, non-physiologic levels of flow that may partially contribute to ectasia or stenosis depending on whether wall shear stress (WSS) is high or low, respectively. We hypothesize that AVM venous outflow stenosis occurs most commonly near the junction of the draining vein and the dural venous sinus. Increased flow volume rate through the AVM circuit coupled with the variation in compliance and rigidity between the walls of the draining vein and the dural venous sinus likely create turbulence of blood flow. The resulting flow separation, low WSS, and departure from axially aligned, unidirectional flow may create atherogenic conditions that can be implicated in venous intimal hyperplasia and outflow stenosis. We have previously found there to be a significant association between intimal hyperplasia risk factors and venous outflow stenosis. Additionally, we have found a significant association between age and likelihood as well as degree of stenosis, suggesting a progressive disease process. Similar conditions have been demonstrated in the pathophysiology of stenosis of the carotid artery and dialysis arteriovenous fistulas. In both of these conditions, the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been employed to characterize the local hemodynamic features that contribute to the pathogenesis of intimal hyperplasia and stenosis. We recommend the utilization of CFD to characterize the anatomic and hemodynamic features of AVM venous outflow stenosis. An improved understanding of the possible causative features of venous outflow stenosis may impact how clinicians choose to manage the treatment of patients with AVMs."

abstract = "Receptor-mediated activation of NADPH oxidase complexes commonly occurs in endosomes; the hydrogen peroxide produced by the dismutation of superoxide generated within the endosomes often functions to boost receptor function by reversibly inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatases or by promoting formation of signaling complexes. NADPH oxidase-mediated formation of superoxide entails transfer of two electrons (provided by NADPH) from the cytosol to the endosomal lumen, where two molecules of superoxide are generated. This charge transfer must be balanced if NADPH oxidase activity is to be sustained. In many cells, this balance is achieved by ClC-3, a chloride-proton antiporter which can extrude two chlorides from the endosome to balance the importation of two electrons. The efficiency of this chloride extrusion will evidently be contingent on the cytosolic chloride level. Pro-inflammatory hormones which stimulate NADPH oxidase activity in endosomes have been shown to promote chloride extrusion from the cell, thereby expediting endosomal chloride export. Conversely, high cytosolic chloride could potentially slow endosomal NADPH oxidase activity by impeding ClC-3-mediated chloride export. Glycine-activated, strychnine-inhibitable chloride channels, which boost intracellular chloride in cells which maintain intracellular chloride levels lower than that of plasma, have shown anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic activity in cell culture and rodent studies. It is proposed that many of these effects may be attributable to glycine-mediated suppression of endosomal NADPH oxidase activity. This model suggests that supplemental glycine may have utility for prevention and control of atherosclerosis, heart failure, angiogenesis associated with cancer or retinal disorders, and a range of inflammation-driven syndromes – including metabolic syndrome; and it might complement the suppression of NADPH oxidase activity achievable with phycocyanobilin-enriched spirulina extracts."

abstract = "The neural correlates of consciousness and the mechanisms by which general anesthesia (GA) modulate such correlates to induce loss of consciousness (LOC) has been described as one of the biggest mysteries of modern medicine. Several cellular targets and neural circuits have been identified that play a critical role in LOC induced by GA, including the GABAA receptor and ascending arousal nuclei located in the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, and brain stem. General anesthetics (GAs) including propofol and inhalational agents induce LOC in part by potentiating chloride influx through the GABAA receptor, leading to neural inhibition and LOC. Interestingly, nearly all GAs used clinically may also induce paradoxical excitation, a phenomenon in which GAs promote neuronal excitation at low doses before inducing unconsciousness. Additionally, emergence from GA, a passive process that occurs after anesthetic removal, is associated with lower anesthetic concentrations in the brain compared to doses associated with induction of GA. AMPK, an evolutionarily conserved kinase activated by cellular stress (e.g. increases in calcium [Ca2+] and/or reactive oxygen species [ROS], etc.) increases lifespan and healthspan in several model organisms. AMPK is located throughout the mammalian brain, including in neurons of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and striatum as well as in pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and cortex. Increases in ROS and Ca2+ play critical roles in neuronal excitation and glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain, activates AMPK in cortical neurons. Nearly every neurotransmitter released from ascending arousal circuits that promote wakefulness, arousal, and consciousness activates AMPK, including acetylcholine, histamine, orexin-A, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Several GAs that are commonly used to induce LOC in human patients also activate AMPK (e.g. propofol, sevoflurane, isoflurane, dexmedetomidine, ketamine, midazolam). Various compounds that accelerate emergence from anesthesia, thus mitigating problematic effects associated with delayed emergence such as delirium, also activate AMPK (e.g. nicotine, caffeine, forskolin, carbachol). GAs and neurotransmitters also act as preconditioning agents and the GABAA receptor inhibitor bicuculline, which reverses propofol anesthesia, also activates AMPK in cortical neurons. We propose the novel hypothesis that cellular stress-induced AMPK activation links wakefulness, arousal, and consciousness with paradoxical excitation and accelerated emergence from anesthesia. Because AMPK activators including metformin and nicotine promote proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells located in the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus, AMPK activation may also enhance brain repair and promote potential recovery from disorders of consciousness (i.e. minimally conscious state, vegetative state, coma)."

In- and outpatient care of patients with treatment resistant major depression remains very challenging for both patients and the health system. One reason is the limited knowledge on the etiology of treatment resistance in major depression resulting difficulties developing efficient treatment strategies for this group of severe depressed patients. Therefore, new focuses on research are needed. Biomarkers reliably reflecting neuropathological processes could help to understand the actual mechanisms in treatment resistance. Neurofilament light protein might be a reliable biomarker of axonal damage in the brain. Due to accumulating evidence that major depression is associated with axonal damage, it is our hypothesis that treatment resistant major depression is correlated with persistent axonal damage within circuits processing affective responses. Axonal damage is reflected by increased levels of neurofilament light protein in plasma. To evaluate our hypothesis, neurofilament light protein will be measured in a group of patients with homogeneous symptomatology of treatment resistant major depression."

The bursting and tonic modes of firing patterns found in many neuron types in the brain correspond to two separate modes of information processing, with one mode resulting in awareness, and another mode being subliminal. In such a coding scheme, a neuron in bursting state codes for the highest level of perceptual abstraction representing a pattern of sensory stimuli, or volitional abstraction representing a pattern of muscle contraction sequences. Within the 50–250 ms minimum integration time of experience, the bursting neurons form synchrony ensembles to allow for binding of related percepts. The degree which different bursting neurons can be merged into the same synchrony ensemble depends on the underlying cortical connections that represent the degree of perceptual similarity. These synchrony ensembles compete for selective attention to remain active. The dominant synchrony ensemble triggers episodic memory recall in the hippocampus, while forming new episodic memory with current sensory stimuli, resulting in a stream of thoughts. Neuromodulation modulates both top-down selection of synchrony ensembles, and memory formation. Episodic memory stored in the hippocampus is transferred to semantic and procedural memory in the cortex during rapid eye movement sleep, by updating cortical neuron synaptic weights with spike timing dependent plasticity. With the update of synaptic weights, new neurons become bursting while previous bursting neurons become tonic, allowing bursting neurons to move up to a higher level of perceptual abstraction. Finally, the proposed learning mechanism is compared with the back-propagation algorithm used in deep neural networks, and a proposal of how the credit assignment problem can be addressed by the current theory is presented."

abstract = "Introduction
The major neoplastic and proliferative component of GCTB is the stromal tumor cells; that they have shown no evidence of bone destruction, instead the massive tissue destruction appears to be a result of tumor induced osteoclastogenesis. The discovery of receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (RANK) and RANK binding ligand (RANKL) uncovered the bone homeostasis and molecular mechanism by which multiple compounds (including vitamin D) regulated osteoclast differentiation; a function mediated by osteoblastic cells and osteoclast-precursor cells.
Hypothesis
In a country burdened by vitamin D deficiency, causal relation between hypovitaminosis D and GCTB was hypothesized based on the vitamin D mediated RANKL expression and osteoclastogenesis, as India is also a population with higher incidence of GCTB as compared to Western populations described in the literature. The possibility of vitamin D regulated osteoclastogenesis in GCTB is postulated on the evidence from molecular research linking it to the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway. The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency in patients with primary GCTB and to elucidate any difference in serum Vitamin 25(OD)D3 levels amongst the matched control population data.
Materials and results
130 patients of primary GCTBs were matched to 310 controls from the general health check population and serum levels of 25(OH)D3 were analyzed. Statistical analysis performed on the non-parametric data and Mann Whitney U Test used to derive inference with significance set at p < 0.05. 56 females and 76 males with median Vitamin D level in the GCTB group was 15.9 ng/ml (Mean 19.41; Range 1.03 to 92) as compared to the control population with median level of 22.2 ng/ml (Mean 25.1; Range 2.6 to 87.9). The results were significant (p value < 0.05) as compared to the control population in all decades except the third decade (p value 0.0548).
Discussion
The differential expression of RANKL and OPG in response to levels of vitamin D has been established. The stromal cells of osteolytic GCTB express high levels of RANKL, which is a key signal regulator in development of this disease and bone destruction typical of GCTBs. This has resulted in research targeting this pathway for therapeutic approach in GCTBs. As vitamin D supplementation is simple and safe, increased awareness to assess and if necessary correct vitamin D status of patients is warranted, however the question as to whether patients with low vitamin D levels are more prone to develop GCTB and thus would profit from vitamin D supplementation remains unanswered. To conclude, it is essential to assess vitamin D levels in patients with GCTB as deficiency is pronounced. Future research on this hypothesis might lead to an association between Vitamin D deficiency and the onset/natural history of GCTB that may in the future help us cure or prevent GCTBs."

If those adjustments are surpassed, a kind of pregnancy MS (PregMS) could appear, characterized by excessive insulin resistance and vascular maladaptation. Skeletal muscle (SKM) must be a protagonist in the PregMS: SKM strength and mass have been associated inversely with MS incidence in non-pregnant patients, and in pregnant women muscular activity modulates metabolic and vascular adaptations that favor better outcomes. Of note, a sedentary lifestyle affects exactly in the other way. Those effects may be explained not only by the old paradigm of SKM being a great energy consumer and store, but because it is an endocrine organ whose chronic activity or deconditioning correspondingly releases myokines modulating insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular adaptation, by direct or indirect mechanisms not well understood. In this document, we present evidence to support the concept of a PregMS and hypothesize on the role of the SKM mass, fiber types composition and myokines in its pathophysiology.

abstract = "The currently available robotic systems rely on rigid heart stabilizers to perform totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass (TECAB) surgery on beating hearts. Although such stabilizers facilitate the anastomosis procedure by immobilizing the heart and holding the surgery site steady, they can cause damage to the heart tissue and rupture of the capillary vessels, due to applying relatively large pressures on the epicardium. In this paper, we propose an advanced robotic approach to perform TECAB on a beating heart with minimal invasiveness. The idea comes from the fact that the main pulsations of the heart occur as excursions in normal direction, i.e., perpendicular to the heart surface. We devise a 1-DOF flexible heart stabilizer which eliminates the lateral movements of the heart, and a 1-DOF compensator mechanism which follows the heart trajectory in the normal direction, thus canceling the relative motion between the surgical tool and the heart surface. In fact, we bring a compromise between two radical approaches of operating on a completely immobilized beating heart with no heart motion compensation, and operating on a freely beating heart with full compensation of heart motion, considering the invasiveness of the first and the technical challenges of the second approach. We propose operating on a partially stabilized beating heart with unidirectional compensation of the heart motion; the flexible stabilizer would exert much less holding force to the heart tissue and the robotic system with unidirectional compensator would be technically feasible. In the proposed approach, a motion sensor mounted on the stabilizer measures the heart excursion data and sends it into a control unit. A predictive controller uses this data to generate an automated trajectory. The slave robots follow this trajectory, which is superimposed on the surgeon’s tele-operation commands received from a master console. Finally, the tool-activation units in the slave robots actuate the articulated laparoscopic tools to perform the anastomosis procedure. The evaluation of the hypothesis showed that our solution for the robotic TECAB on beating heart is both practical and cost effective. We showed in an in-vivo study that the flexible stabilizer can effectively restrict the heart lateral movements, while allowing for its normal excursion. We found readily available linear motors which could afford the high forces, speeds and accelerations required for following the heart trajectory. Finally, we showed that the tool-activation unit is capable of providing the maneuverability and workspace required for the most challenging task of CABG procedure, i.e., anastomosis suturing."

During isolated blunt trauma to the orbital framework, the globe continues to move anteriorly without any active resistance, in contrast to the globe, the optic nerve with more delicate bony and soft tissue relations, likely to remain relatively static. Thus the junction between the optic nerve and ocular coat suffers the maximum distractive injury due to anteroposterior tractional forces.

This increase in muscle size is thought to be mechanistically important for the increase in muscle function. However, at present, there is no experimental evidence that would support any paradigm in which muscle hypertrophy is a mechanism for increasing strength with exercise. Therefore, it seems reasonable to also question the importance of changes in muscle size for changes in muscle strength (function) following exogenous drugs as well as aging, where both muscle size and strength decrease. The purpose of this paper is to discuss whether changes in muscle size contribute to changes in voluntary strength following exercise, pharmaceutical interventions, and aging. We also aim to provide potential mechanisms (central and peripheral) for the change in strength as well as outline study designs to better address this question. Herein, we suggest that there are dissociations between changes in muscle size and strength following exercise, anabolic drug administration, and aging (to a point). These dissociations occur throughout the literature, suggesting that these changes may be completely separate phenomena. We are not dismissing the potential importance of maintaining muscle mass, particularly in clinical populations. What we are suggesting, however, is that muscle function may not necessarily be improved by these exercise or pharmacological induced increases in muscle size. Exploring mechanisms and explanations beyond just changes in muscle size may improve therapy targeted at improving muscle function."

abstract = "Immunity to Plasmodium falciparum is contributed by many known and unknown factors. Lack of effective vaccine and rise in drug-resistant Plasmodium parasites leads to the major challenge in controlling the parasite. Determination of surface or secreted proteins which are essential for the survival of the pathogen is a very important step in finding potential vaccine candidates. Despite the discovery of several vaccine candidates against Plasmodium over the last decades, an effective vaccine is not available. The present study hypothesized that the PRE-binding protein (PREBP) could be a potential vaccine candidate against malaria pathogenesis. PREBP is highly conserved among the class Aconoidasida and exhibit high antigenicity and accessibility as a secretory protein. The present hypothesis was tested by employing in-silico translational genomics wherein the antigenicity, localization and the conservancy were determined."

abstract = "Inhalational anesthetics such as isoflurane, desflurane and halothane are the mainstay medications for surgical procedures; upon inhalation, they produce anesthesia described as reversible unconsciousness with the features of amnesia, sleep, immobility and analgesia. To date, how they produce anesthesia is unknown. This study proposes that carbonic anhydrase enzymes are likely targets mediating the actions of inhalational anesthetics. Carbonic anhydrase enzymes, commonly expressed in living organisms, utilize carbon dioxide (CO2) as a substrate and can generate H+ and HCO3− from CO2 with a great efficiency. There are remarkable lines of evidence for their likely roles in mediating anesthetic actions. Firstly, carbonic anhydrase enzymes are extensively expressed in the brain and spinal cord, and their importance in the brain activity, especially for the GABA and NMDA receptor signaling pathways, has been demonstrated in numerous studies. According to these studies, they provide HCO3− for GABA-A receptor activities and also buffer HCO3− excess resulting from NMDA receptor activation. Activation of GABA-A and inhibition of NMDA receptors are associated with the induction of anesthesia by the intravenous general anesthetics propofol and ketamine, respectively. Secondly, the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors topiramate and zonisamide are effectively used in the treatment of epilepsy for decades; their chronic use results in the requirement of increased levels of amobarbital in order to produce anesthesia in the epileptic patients during WADA test. In addition, given that CO2 is a substrate for these enzymes, their tertiary structure is likely has a hydrophobic pocket suitable for the anesthetic molecules to bind. Inhalational anesthetic molecules, which are lipophilic and inert in nature, have an ability to cross the membranes and inhibit carbonic anhydrases, which might not be accessible by topiramate and zonisamide. Unlike carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, they could bind to the hydrophobic pocket for CO2 molecules and produce a profound effect called anesthesia. Finally, there is a great deal of similarities between the physiological actions of inhalational anesthetics and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; moreover well-known side effects of inhalational anesthetics could be associated with the inhibition of carbonic anhydrases. Therefore, this article presents a hypothesis that the anesthetic actions of inhalational anesthetics could be due to their inhibitory effects on the carbonic anhydrases. Investigating this hypothesis might lead to the development of new safer anesthetics, and more importantly it might reveal an endogenous anesthetic pathway, in which the carbonic anhydrase system is a component along with the GABA-A and NMDA receptor systems."

Also in lower than ‘regular’ recreational doses, so-called micro-doses, without the typical effects on consciousness, users report beneficial effects on cognitive processes and well-being. The exact neurobiological mechanism underlying these persisting effects is not clear. While previous research has mainly focused on the central nervous system including the immune system and the neuroendocrine system, I propose a central role for sleep and the microbiome in the effects of regular and low doses of psychedelics respectively. It will be explained why this is hypothesized and studies to test this idea proposed. It is concluded that while these studies are needed to understand the biology underlying psychedelic medicine, it is also important to approach it in a holistic way, including all the above mentioned biological processes psychedelics are known to affect, and explore the role of other substance-related factors like route of administration and form, and factors like diet and lifestyle which are part of the psychedelic experience."

abstract = "Our paper briefly reviews the connection of the intestinal microbiome to the rise in non-communicable conditions related to atopic disease, obesity and mental health. We consider that the microbiome is best treated as if it were a single entity and have borrowed the terms semiochemical, allomone and kairomone (5) to describe interspecies relationship between the microbiome and ourselves (Fig. 1). We use the term dysbiosis to describe the breakdown of these relationships leading to disease (Fig. 2). As a result of this analysis we tentatively suggest that components of the microbiome assess microbial antigens in our food and pass this information back to our immune system via as yet undescribed chemical messengers: kairomones. We call these hypothetical microbial agents Sentinel Cells. Our suggestion is that atopic disease arises partly as a result of consuming processed food that has insufficient antigens to activate this kairomone feedback mechanism, which atrophies as a result. We note that this is potentially similar to the Old Friends concept of Rook and his co-workers (16). We suggest that obesity is a consequence of dysbiosis-induced waning of the output of allomone-like psychotropic compounds (including the known microbial metabolites dopamine and serotonin) leading to the weakening of the gut-brain axis and a negative effect on mental health. Although dysbiosis can occur in other ways, including antibiotic use and sterile caesarian section, we believe that all these problems can be overcome to provide a future free of these non-communicable diseases."

Reports by World Health Organization indicate that 31% of all death occurrences are due to heart attacks and strokes. Today, the most common medicines for treating atherosclerosis are statins which are HMG-coA reductase inhibitors. Beside their benefits in treating atherosclerosis, some side effects have been reported as well. Thus, therapeutic methods based on statins should be evaluated to result in more beneficial effects. Since atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder, an anti-inflammatory component can decrease the impact of this disease. Interleukin-38, a newly discovered anti-inflammatory cytokine, which acts as an Interleukin-36 receptor antagonist can block Nuclear Factor KB and Activator protein-1 signaling pathways, and block atherogenic core formation accordingly. This novel proposed immune gene therapy can be applied to atherosclerosis treatment in a trial study. In this hypothesis, Interleukin-38 gene is transferred into bone marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells of atherosclerotic mouse model Apo E-/- via an adenoviral vector. It is expected that Interleukin-38 gene expression by Mesenchymal Stem Cells can efficiently remedy atherosclerosis without the side effects of statins."

Nowadays, treatment strategies for osteoporosis are mainly aimed at increasing the mineral density of the bone. Some of these therapies, including vitamin D, calcium, bisphosphonates, Wnt signal activators and parathyroid hormone regulators, have been suggested to be capable of causing calcification of the cartilage endplate in the intervertebral disc. This alteration could block nutrient and oxygen transportation to the center part of the disc, thus lead to intervertebral disc degeneration. Consequently, we hypothesize that osteoporosis therapies might be a potential risk for IDD. This assumption indicates that we should take the alterations of the cartilage endplate into consideration in further osteoporosis treatment to avoid IDD in the patient."

abstract = "Modern massive transfusion protocols call for early plasma and platelets to patients presenting with hemorrhagic shock. The packed red blood cell (PRBC):plasma:platelet ratio generally ranges from 1:1:1 to 3:1:1, but the ideal ratio remains controversial. We aimed to determine the effects of different resuscitation strategies and blood product ratios on hematocrit, platelet and fibrinogen concentrations (FC) during resuscitation. Assuming: pre-insult blood volume 5 L; hematocrit 0.4, FC = 100%, platelet count 400 × 109/L; predetermined constant values for each blood product unit (volume, hematocrit, FC, platelet number); and transfusion rate to maintain euvolemia, we simulated different resuscitation strategies using a computer-based hemorrhage model. When crystalloids are administered to restore an acute 30% blood loss, the initial hematocrit, platelets and FC are adequate, and remain physiologic when further resuscitation is carried out with 1:1:1. Higher transfusion ratios increase the hematocrit at the expense of proportional drops in FC and platelets. When crystalloids and PRBCs (1500 mL) are administered to restore an acute 60% blood loss, the FC drops to 39%. Further resuscitation with 1:1:1 (but not with 2:1:1 or 3:1:1) increases the FC while maintaining the hematocrit and platelets within physiologic range. When blood products (1–3:1:1) are administered to restore an acute 60% blood loss, the initial hematocrit, platelets and FC are at adequate levels, but remain within physiologic range only when 1:1:1 (but not 2:1:1 or 3:1:1) is implemented for further resuscitation. Notably, platelet concentration consistently drops in all simulated scenarios reaching dangerously low levels particularly with high blood loss/transfusion rates and with higher transfusion ratios. The FC does not always drop by the same proportion with higher ratios probably because it is based on plasma concentration and is thus “cushioned” by the reduction in plasma volume as the hematocrit rises with higher transfusion ratios. In summary, computer simulation suggests that in non-severe shock hemorrhage, the differences between 1-3:1:1 transfusion ratios during initial resuscitation may be small. In severe shock, however, 1:1:1 results in the most physiologic hematocrit, FC and platelet concentration and is, therefore, desirable."

Clinicians apply PRP either topically (where it is activated ex-vivo before treatment by adding an external agent to trigger clotting and the release of growth factors that facilitate wound healing) or through injection (where it is activated in vivo at the injury site with no prior activation before injection). Because topical PRP activation typically utilizes bovine thrombin, which has significant potential side effects and high costs, recent studies have assessed the efficacy of combining extracellular calcium (EC) and electric pulses (EPs) to activate PRP. The potential to apply this novel technique to PRP both topically and internally via injection raises the question about the ability to tune the clotting time and growth factor release for a given application. While previous studies have assessed the impact of applying EPs of various durations either directly (conductive coupling) or indirectly (capacitive coupling) to PRP containing EC, no studies have assessed the tunability of this activation based on modifying EP parameters, EP delivery method (conductive or capacitive coupling), and the EC concentration. We hypothesize that tuning these parameters will modify intracellular calcium uptake to permit the control of growth factor release and clotting time, which are critical for optimizing PRP for either topical or internal clinical applications. A pilot study for a single donor demonstrates the potential for tunability as a function of the intensity of membrane manipulation and calcium concentration, which facilitate the increase of cytosolic calcium. This motivates future studies assessing EC and EP optimization and in vivo studies to determine the overall efficacy of this tunability for wound healing."

The habit of snacking and drinking soft beverages between breakfast, lunch and dinner, which is very widespread in the western world, could be a primum movens, thereby contributing to the development and subsequent persistence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
What does the proposed hypothesis based on?
The high prevalence of GERD suggests that it is very probably caused by factors, which are intrinsic and widespread in a western lifestyle. Ingesting snacks or imbibing soft drinks between breakfast, lunch and dinner causes additional gastric acid secretion, acid pocket formation, and additional transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) with acid reflux; the latter are proportional to the number of ingestions. Moreover, there is increased esophageal acid exposure, which can last up to several hours in a 24-h period. The majority of patients with GERD do not have a hiatal hernia, and TLESRs are the main pathophysiological factor, resulting in an increase in esophageal acid exposure and, therefore, symptoms and the disease. Overweight/obese people very frequently consume snacks and imbibe soft drinks between breakfast, lunch and dinner and they would, therefore, share according to the hypothesis of the authors of this paper. That is, the same eating habit can cause the two conditions obesity and GERD.
The hypothesis unfolded
Every time a snack is ingested or a soft drink imbibed between the three daily meals, gastric acid is re-secreted, the acid pocket reforms, the TLESRs are triggered again and acid reflux events recur. The greater the number of snacks and/or soft drinks consumed, the greater the esophageal engagement of the cleaning system with, over time, increasing impairment. This mechanism may account for disease onset. According to the hypothesis outlined in this paper, GERD patients should consume moderate portions constituting three meals a day, thereby limiting the quantity of acid reflux from TLESRs."

To successfully overwhelm this deficiency, we propose a promising hypoxic therapy and highlight its unique role in directly eliciting endogenous myocardial regeneration in vivo. In the hypothesis, sufficient oxygen could be a restrictive factor of myocardial growth, whereas a moderate hypoxia might stimulate cardiomyocyte proliferation and enhance myocardial regeneration, heart weight and cardiac function recovery. The potential involvements of the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and its downstream oncogenic signalings were hypothesized and evaluated in detail. Notably, the hypoxic treatment may initiate spontaneous proliferation of pre-existing cardiomyocytes in adult human body, which cannot (or hardly) be achieved by current MI-therapeutic approaches such as cardiovascular drugs, cardiac surgeries and aerobic exercise. The hypoxic therapy will lead to lower surgical risks compared with tissue regeneration in vitro and putative cardiac transplantation. With optimized moderately-low oxygen concentration, available therapeutic frequency and cycles, and controllable side effects, the hypoxic therapy will be a non-invasive, non-surgical, low-cost and low-risk approach to promoting myocardial regeneration in vivo and recovering cardiac function for MI patients who have large-area myocardial necrosis, in addition to other current MI-therapeutic methodologies."

Carcinogenesis is consequence of failure of tissue development. Tumor originates from tissue regeneration. The tumor cell is normal incomplete differentiated cell that stop in different phases of differentiation. Tumor promoter stimulates stem cell to proliferate. Carcinogen obstructs stem cell to differentiate. With tumor promoter and carcinogen, the tissue stem cells proliferate but cannot differentiate into mature cell, and form tumors. The disorder of biological signals cell proliferation and differentiation facilitates tumor development. CRF and CC are consequence of endocrine hypofunction and failure caused by persistent stress. Nature factors and psychological factors stimulate organic stress. The significant change of stress is the activation of endocrine system. The persistent stress exhausts the capacity of endocrine glands or hormone receptors of target cells, and leads to endocrine hypofunction even failure. CRF and CC are clinical manifestation of endocrine hypofunction and failure. Cancer is a local lesion, also is a systemic disease. As a local lesion, carcinogen obstructed stem cell to differentiate, developmental failure of local tissue forms tumor. As a systemic disease, cancer is related to natural physical, chemical, and biological factors, as well as negative spiritual factors. The material and spiritual factors induce persistent stress which eventually leads to endocrine hypofunction even failure and unbalance of homeostasis. The disorder of biological signals of cell proliferation and differentiation facilitates tumor development. CRF and CC, as clinical manifestation of endocrine hypofunction and failure, have nothing to do with tumor size and type, but facilitate tumor development. CRF and CC are through all the course of systemic cancerous disease, and commonly precede tumorigenesis. Many patients have been found tumors because of symptoms of CRF and CC. Even if no tumor be found at that time, various tumors would be found in the follow-up. For systemic cancerous disease, cachexia is the cause of death. Most cancer patients do not die of tumor, but of cancer cachexia. Eradicating tumor cell cannot cure systemic cancerous disease; on the contrary, the poisonous side effect of therapies usually speeds up the progress of CC and death. It is important for curing cancer cachexia and restoring the patient's constitution to prevent systemic cancer and improve the quality of life and prolong the survival."

Due to several clues, including the presence of lymphocytic infiltrates and the association of FFA with other autoimmune disorders, we hypothesised that FFA may be a new autoimmune condition, and future research must be focused on this possible origin."

The main diagnostic methods are examining the retinal nerve fiber layer through optical coherence tomography and investigating visual field defect, but these methods present disadvantages in clinical practice. Studies have shown that patients with glaucoma often suffer negative emotion like anxiety and depression which is related to abnormal or reduced amygdala. Moreover, selective reduction of fMRI responses to transient achromatic stimuli in the superficial layer of the superior colliculus was found in the early glaucoma patients. By summarizing previous studies, we developed a hypothesis: superior colliculus-pulvinar-amygdala subcortical visual pathway may be involved in the incidence or progression of glaucoma. Validating this hypothesis would further clarify the mechanism of glaucoma and lead to the development of a more sensitive method for making an early diagnosis of glaucoma."

Its use includes evaluating neurological disorders, investigating brain function and correlations between EEG signals and real or imagined movements. The Topographic Image of Cortical Activity (TICA) records obtained by the EEG make it possible to observe, through color discrimination, the cortical areas that represent greater or lesser activity. Percolation Theory (PT) reveals properties on the aspects of fluid spreading from a central point, these properties being related to the aspects of the medium, topological characteristics and ease of penetration of a fluid in materials. The hypothesis presented so far considers that synaptic activities originate in points and spread from them, causing different areas of the brain to interact in a diffusive associative behavior, generating electric and magnetic fields by the currents that spread through the brain tissue and have an effect on the scalp sensors. Brain areas spatially separated create large-scale dynamic networks that are described by functional and effective connectivity. The proposition is that this phenomenon behaves like a fluidic spreading, so we can use the PT, through the topological analysis we detect specific signatures related to neural phenomena that manifest changes in the behavior of synaptic diffusion. This signature must be characterized by the Fractal Dimension (FD) values of the scattering clusters, these values will be used as properties in the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) method, an TICA will be categorized according to the degree of similarity to the preexisting patterns. In this context, our hypothesis will consolidate as a more computational resource in the service of medicine and another way that opens with the possibility of analysis and detailed inferences of the brain through TICA that go beyond a simply visual observation, as it happens in the present day."

Combining cognitive training with physical training to improve balance is a new approach for reducing the risk of falls in patient populations who are at risk for falls. To determine if adding structured cognitive demands to conventional balance and coordination training we designed the Cognitive-coupled Intensive Balance Training (CIBT) program. We found that the more intensive and focused CIBT intervention reduced dual-task cost, improved balance, and reduced the number of falls in a sample of individuals with CA. We hypothesize that (1) CIBT will improve balance and reduce falls; and (2) CIBT will be a cost-effective treatment option for improving balance and reduce falls. To test these hypotheses, we propose conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with economic evaluation . This paper reports the findings of our study testing the feasibility of the CIBT program, rationale for testing our hypothesis and an overview of our future study design to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the CIBT program."

Both the preceding developmental conditions and the social impact of the episode become a starting point for the following states of human complex conditions, creating the extraordinary diversity that characterizes our complex society. In this evolutionarily carved landscape, genetic factors including stochastic epistasis, environmental modification, and gene-environment interactions are all active. In these processes, interactions between developmental social vulnerability and environmental influences can lead to the emergence and persistence of some derivative states with social maladaptation. In our model, every psychiatric condition including aberrant paranoid-hallucinatory states is classified as a derivative state. The probability distribution curve for these derivative states has a non-linear relationship with the liability in the population, and there is none with probability 1.0 or zero. Individuals with trivial social vulnerability or high resilience may develop the derivative states in tremendously stressful circumstances, and individuals with huge social vulnerability may not necessarily develop the derivative states in the presence of adequate social supports. Social skillfulness/unskillfulness and behavioral flexibility/inflexibility form the core of the vulnerability-related dimensions. The clinical picture of a derivative manifestation is profiled depending on the individual trait levels in the derivative-related dimensions. Each derivative state has a requisite lineup of dimensions and each dimension can contribute to multiple psychiatric conditions. For example, aberrant paranoid-hallucinatory states and bipolar condition may share some developmental conditions as the derivative-related dimensions. Therefore, multiple derivative states can co-occur or be sequentially comorbid. Although the ‘learned strategies’ can ostensibly mask the clinical manifestation of developmental deviations, the change of the true dimensional position to the socially skillful direction is efficiently obtained through social experiences in a supportive environment. The liability-probability model makes it impossible to discriminate individuals with psychiatric diagnosis from individuals without the diagnosis and allows all of us to reside in the same human complex diversity."

The limitation of current therapeutic strategies calls for an effective approach which can lower the postoperative liver metastasis rate in order to improve the overall prognosis and survival rate. Comprehensively considering the basic knowledge and clinical practice of tumor treatment worldwide, we proposed three points of hypotheses. Basically, the existing evidences indicated that tumor cells shedding from pancreatic cancer localized in the marginal liver preferentially through the Portal vein. Then, the percentage depth dose distribution of electron radiation is consistent with the marginal distribution of liver metastasis from pancreatic cancer. Based on the characteristics of liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer and the percentage depth dose of electron radiation, we provide a new propose of preventing postoperative liver metastasis in a way of prophylactic intraoperative electron radiation therapy on the surface of liver. Intraoperative electron radiation is relatively easy to control radiation dose and treatment area under direct vision, effectively inhibiting the metastasis and growth of cancer cells and preventing further deterioration of pancreatic cancer patients’ condition. Therefore, this hypothesis has an important clinical significance for postoperative rehabilitation and improvement of patients’ survival."

The information collected by sensory organs is converted to a digital current that enters the presynaptic neuron through axonal conductance. Digital waves are converted to analog waves in the synapses. The analog current of information flows into the postsynapse. The degree of Ca2+ influx in the postsynapse is proportional to the voltage of each wave of analog current. The activation (via dephosphorylation) of the phosphorylated phosphatase, Slingshot, is regulated by Ca2+ concentration in the spine. After dephosphorylation by Slingshot, activated cofilin binds the parallel actin bundle. The wide helical twist angle of an actin filament that has been decorated with cofilin confers high electric potential to the filament. Phosphorylation results in the deactivation of the actin filament bound to cofilin, which in turn results in the cleavage of cofilin and actin filament, followed by a decrease in the twist angle of the actin filament. Next, the electric potential energy is discharged by the actin filament as it returns to its non-cofilin bound state, resulting in the formation of additional analog waves in the postsynapse."

When a progressive rise in plasma osmolality occurs with age, it increases the effective viscosity of the circulating blood, and the thickened blood fails to perfuse the body systems and organs. If red blood cells fail to perfuse the central nervous system, the neuronal cells die from hypoxia and a lack of essential nutrients. This process is insidious but unavoidable. Hyperosmolality occurs in all mammals and it is a natural phenomenon of mammalian aging."

Significant effects of prenatal cannabis exposure have been found on children’s sleep, cognitive functions (memory and scholastic skills), as well as on executive (frontal lobe) functions (reasoning, attention, impulsivity, and motivation), and affective (depression) and anxiety symptoms throughout the stages of development. Following the presentation of two case vignettes, we integrate the published information on outcomes of maternal use of cannabis during pregnancy on the developing fetus and the “soft” neurological deficits and neuro-behavioral disturbances manifested by them from early childhood and evolving to peaks in adolescence. Taken together, these data serve to define what we call a heretofore unspecified “fetal cannabis spectrum disorder”."

The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionary conserved cell-signaling system that plays an important role in a variety of cell functions including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. In recent years its involvement in bone homeostasis has attracted a significant consideration. We hypothesized that Notch signaling pathway, which has a complex interplay with proinflammatory cytokines and bone resorption regulators, contributes to alveolar bone resorption via increased Notch receptors on immune cell surface and stimulates Notch receptor intracellular domain (NICD) translocation into the nucleus. The potential benefit of medications aimed to down-regulate these pathways in apical periodontitis treatment remains to be assessed."

Although increased peak systolic velocity at the site of the narrowing is a widely accepted method for assessing main renal artery stenosis, tardus parvus phenomenon detected on the downstream blood flow has been used as an alternative to direct insonation of the main artery. However, the uncertainty about the best Doppler parameter to be used for characterization of tardus parvus has yielded a variety of studies. Recently, the difference between the resistive index of the spleen and kidney (RISK) has been proposed as a potential marker of kidney damage and Doppler criterion for RAS in hypertensive patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). The hypothesis of this study was to speculate further and propose the RISK as valuable new Doppler diagnostic criteria for the tardus parvus in CKD too. Data from 183 control patients and 135 chronic kidney disease patients (CKD) were included in the study to test the feasibility of the method and plausibility of the hypothesis. Criteria inclusion was a color Doppler ultrasound measurement of the renal (RRI) and spleen resistive index (SRI). Serum creatinine (0.83 ± 0.20 vs 3.27 ± 1.74), RRI (0.60 ± 0.06 vs 0.69 ± 0.09), SRI (0.55 ± 0.06 vs 0.58 ± 0.09), RISK (0.06 ± 0.04 vs 0.11 ± 0.08), and spleen size (94.1 ± 13.2 vs 100.8 ± 16.5) were higher in CKD patients (p < 0.05). RRI correlated with SRI in both groups; however, the coefficient of determination was different (Z = 2.29, p = 0.022). In the CKD group, RISK correlated inversely with age (r = −0.276; p = 0.001) and positively with creatinine (r = 0.509; p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, creatinine remained an independent predictor of the high RISK (Wald = 13.07; p < 0.001; odds ratio = 1.87; 95% confidence interval 1.33–2.62). Since extraneous factors similarly influence RRI and SRI, the SRI can be considered the correction factor that can estimate the cardiovascular burden on the RRI. Consequently, according to the suggested hypothesis, RISK helps to distinguish the tardus parvus related to RAS from tardus parvus related to systemic influences on Doppler morphology. The identification of the underlying mechanisms of tardus parvus, would help a more accurate characterization of the phenomenon and improve screening and diagnostic test for RAS in CKD patients."

We propose that the valence of the outcome of these mechanisms may be determined by the cognitive activity of the patient before or during tDCS treatment. This hypothesis implies that proper cognition activity may work in cooperation with tDCS to achieve the maximum treatment effect. Negative cognition may decrease or even reverse the positive effect of tDCS. According to this hypothesis, the performance of explicit tasks or instructions before, during, or after tDCS is important. Harm caused by misuse of home-made tDCS equipment is also addressed in this hypothesis."

The global prevalence of the disease is on the rise, and it affects 35–40% of the population above 80 years. The pathological hallmarks of the disease include extra-neuronal deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) as plaques and intra-neuronal hyperphosphorylated tau protein as neurofibrillary tangles, which cause neurodegeneration and cerebral atrophy. Aβ deposition is catalyzed by β-secretase and γ-secretase, while tau hyperphosphorylation is catalyzed by glycogen synthase kinase – 3β (GSK-3β). With neurodegeneration, the level of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), as well as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), decreases in the synaptic cleft, called cholinergic deficiency. This leads to the cardinal behavioural abnormalities of AD, which is referred to as cholinergic hypothesis of AD. The other enzyme which degrades ACh is the butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Thus, current treatment options of AD include symptomatic treatment to elevate the levels of ACh by inhibiting AChE. However, the currently used drugs cause several side effects, and the quest for novel drugs remains an interesting and essential venture. Since the disease has multiple pathophysiologies, there is an unrelenting need to develop novel drugs and lead molecules capable of inhibiting multiple pathways. The present study hypothesizes use of tea polyphenols against the key drug targets of AD, viz. β–Secretase, γ-Secretase, GSK-3β, AChE and BuChE. The hypothesis has been validated using molecular docking tools. The result indicates that the polyphenols may potentially inhibit these enzymes, similar to their known inhibitors. Thus, the findings are of immense significance in the therapeutic interventions of AD, using tea polyphenols as exciting multi-target drugs."

High rates of intra- and interobserver variability and a corresponding low level of reproducibility are, unfortunately, issues that have to be taken into consideration in many medical fields. We hypothesise that the level of observer variability can be predicted in specific situations during the on-going assessment/diagnostic process and that the application of a communication concept based on Fusion Diagnoses might lead to improved patient treatment. A Fusion Diagnosis consists of the diagnosis itself combined with the estimated Level of Observer Variability (LOV) of the diagnostic process which is evaluated by the individual decision-maker during the on-going assessment process stated in parenthesis. Currently, the “Perceived Difficulty” of the investigator in a three-tiered grading system might be the most promising approach for the operationalisation of the LOV in the diagnostic process (D1 = easy to assess, D2 = average, D3 = difficult to assess). An example of a diagnosis according to this concept could be: Dysplastic Nevus (D3). Based on this concept, standardized clinical decision pathways could be investigated and developed. Studies would have to provide data about rational decisions in relation to the estimated LOV. For example, data might reveal that “ST-elevation myocardial infarction (D3)” as well as “no ECG abnormalities (D3)” are necessary indications for an immediate consultation of a colleague in the setting of suspected myocardial ischaemia. The concept is hypothetical and critical aspects, like over- and underestimation and the calibration of the physician, are likely limiting the benefit. Nevertheless, we assume that the suggested pragmatic concept might lead to superior patient treatment in specific fields."

Alcohol-stimulated oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation, with modulation of involved signaling pathway in neuroprotection, was reported previously. Neuroprotective strategy for management of alcohol induced neurodegeneration through a new generation neuroprotective agent and based on modulation of some neuroprotective signaling pathway such as CREB/BDNF and Akt/GSK has always been superior to any other therapeutic interventions. Therefore, the introduction and development of potential new neuroprotective properties and clarification of their effects on major cell signaling such as CREB/BDNF and Akt/GSK is necessitated. During recent years, using new neuroprotective compounds with therapeutic probability for treatment of alcohol induced neuro-biochemical and neuro-behavioral malicious effects have been amazingly increased. Many previous studies have reported the neuroprotective roles of crocin (major active component of saffron) in multiple neurodegenerative events and diseases in animal model. But the role of crocin neuroprotective effects against alcohol induced neurodegeneration and neurobehavioral sequels and also role of CREB/BDNF and Akt/GSK in this manner remain unclear. Hence we hypothesized that by using crocin in alcohol dependent subject it would provide neuroprotection against alcohol induced neurodegeneration and neurobehavioral and probably can manage sequels of alcohol abuses. Also we hypothesized that crocin, via intonation of CREB/BDNF and Akt/GSK signaling pathway, can inhibit alcohol induced neurodegeneration. In this article, we tried to discuss our hypothesis regarding the possible role of crocin, as a potent neuroprotective agent, and also role of Akt/GSK and CREB/BDNF signaling pathway in treatment of alcohol induced neurodegeneration and neurobehavioral through its anti-inflammatory,anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative stress and cognitive enhancer."

abstract = "Modern diets have become increasingly rich in fructose, for example through the addition of high-fructose corn syrup to many foods and drinks. It has been suggested that this might lead to hepatotoxicity, including the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. After entering hepatocytes via insulin-independent glucose transporter 2 transmembrane carrier proteins, fructose is phosphorylated to fructose-1-phosphate in a reaction catalysed by fructokinase (ketohexokinase). In turn, fructose-1-phosphate is hydrolysed by aldolase B to glyceraldehydes. Glyceraldehydes may enter gluconeogenesis via fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and fructose-6-phosphate; glyceraldehydes may also enter glycogenolysis via pyruvate. The last pathway involves conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Alternatively, pyruvate may be converted, via the action of the hepatic lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme LDH-5, into lactate. In liver damage, the LDH-5 isoenzyme becomes elevated, predominantly in serum/plasma. We therefore hypothesised that if dietary fructose is associated with hepatotoxicity, there should be a positive correlation between erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate and plasma LDH-5. This hypothesis was tested by assaying venous blood samples taken from 39 patients at rest, three hours after eating. Quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectrometry following gel electrophoresis was used to assay erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate levels. Similarly, plasma LDH-5 concentrations were spectrophotometrically analysed, using the pyruvate-lactate reaction, following electrophoretic separation of the LDH isoenzymes. A significant positive correlation was found between the two variables (r = 0.44, p = 0.0047). This result, which supports our hypothesis, is evidence in favour of the possibility that dietary fructose is associated with hepatotoxicity. In addition to being a marker of hepatic damage, LDH-5 may play a more direct epigenetic role in causing liver damage; acute hepatic injury is associated with nuclear translocation of LDH, causing the production of lactate from pyruvate in the nucleus; in turn, the lactate inhibits histone deacetylase and is associated with upregulation of genes associated with the damage response, leading to cell death."

Therapeutic approaches to PCOS require confirmatory diagnostics such as measurement of hormones and ultrasound scan of the ovary, which are in part, invasive. Conversely, the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are present in body fluids (urine, feces, saliva, etc.) and exhaled breath are reported to be endogenously altered in diseased state, which may be indicative of diseases including cancer. We hypothesize that the hindered metabolic state in PCOS condition would conditionally alter the VOCs that eventually are excreted in urine, which may offer a template to develop a viable and non-invasive diagnostic tool."

Laparoscopic promontofixation is the gold standard to treat apical defects but the dissection of the anterior compartment is variable since based on surgical judgment only. We therefore evaluate the placement of the anterior mesh using an ultrasonographic measurement after promontofixation.
Design
A prospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-1) was conducted between January 2015 and September 2015. 63 women that underwent a promontofixation for prolapse were included. Pelvic floor descent was evaluated with POP-Q. The distance between the bladder neck, and the anterior mesh was measured by ultrasound at the end of surgery. The placement of the mesh was subsequently correlated to the anatomical repair 1 month after surgery, and the occurrence of de novo symptoms as stress urinary incontinence.
Results
Ultrasound permitted to measure the distance between bladder neck and Mesh (BMD = Bladder neck-Mesh Distance) in all patients with variation between repeated measurements ranging for 0.6 to 1.2 mm. The BMD was highly variable from 0 to 13 mm (mean ± SD; 5.3 ± 3.1 mm). The BMD inversely correlated with the difference between C (P = 0.01) and Bp (P = 0.04) after and before surgery respectively, with the complication rate (P = 0.01) but not with the difference of Ba. A BMD of more than 6 mm predicted the absence of postoperative de novo symptoms. De novo“ stress urinary incontinence occurred in 23.8%.
Conclusion
BMD can be accurately measured by ultrasound. BMD predicts the apical repair but not the anterior repair. A short BMD predicted postoperative de novo stress urinary incontinence."

Previous models have suggested that the condition is mainly a degenerative tendinopathy, associated with changes in pain pathways and the motor system. The hypothesis of this work is that LE is the clinical manifestation of a primary nervous system disorder, characterized by an abnormal increase in neuronal activity and a subsequent loss of homeostasis, which secondarily affects the musculoskeletal tissues of the elbow-forearm-hand complex. A new model for LE is presented, supported by an in-deep analysis of basic sciences, epidemiological and clinical studies."

Current evidence suggests that the syndrome results from a genetic predisposition interacting with developmental events during fetal or perinatal life that together increase susceptibility in some individuals. This implies that environmental factors influence the initiation of PCOS in the fetus or infant, either directly or via the mother. PCOS is often considered to be an ancient disorder but there is no direct proof of this in the medical or historic record. One of the cardinal features, polycystic ovaries, was first described only in the early 1900s, despite reports of many thousands of autopsies recorded earlier. This conundrum could be explained by postulating that polycystic ovaries were rare before the 1900s and have become more common over the last 100 years. The hypothesis that PCOS is a syndrome of the 20th Century would eliminate the need to explain the paradox of why there exists a genetic predisposition to subfertility syndrome."

Protection against dental caries can be achieved experimentally by eliciting salivary IgA targeting surficial antigens of S. mutans, however, no such a vaccine has been launched for human use yet. Live vectored vaccines hold the greatest feasibility to induce potent and long-lasting immunity in the host. The FDA approved intranasal cold-adapted influenza vaccine has been used in clinical settings for many years. The vaccine can not only induce broad adaptive immune responses especially mucosal immunity, but the member strains can also circumvent existing immunity, presenting promising candidates for live vectored anti-caries vaccine. Moreover, the genetic techniques for modification of cold-adapted influenza viruses are well developed and widely applicable. Thus, we hypothesize that effective anti-caries vaccine can be developed with the backbone of cold-adapted influenza viruses by inserting specific antigenic identifier sequences of S. mutans into the viral genome, which is anticipated to protect against dental caries in humans with easy inoculation. The immune efficacies of recombinant cold-adapted influenza viruses expressing exogenous antigens have been verified by in vivo experiments for multiple infectious diseases, giving us great confidence to validate the safety properties and protection effect with this chimeric vaccine in animals or even humans. Existing data suggests that the live anti-caries vaccine may help improve public oral health by controlling the caries disease itself."

Our research confirmed that Pitchfork over-expression induced lateral cleft palate and primary cilia disassembly during palate development. We also demonstrated that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Patched1 (Ptc1) expression levels were altering in the over-expressed Pitchfork group during palate development. Then we observed by consulting a vast amount of literature that specific knockout of the Kif3a also induced lateral cleft palate and expended the expression domains of Shh and Gli1 during palate development. Furthermore, loss of the Kif3a results in disassembly of the primary cilia and eventually leads to abnormal palatal development. Finally, we found that both Pitchfork and Kif3a are accumulating at the basal body and ciliary necklace during the early phase of cilia assembly and disassembly and both of them are involved in ciliary transport. Based on the above evidence, we hypotheses that there may be a potential correlation between Pitchfork and Kif3a, that could regulate primary cilia disassembly during palate development."

Proof of this hypothesis is that in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, where there is physical connection between the atria and ventricles (bundle of Kent), there is electrical AV continuity, no PR segment is detected, and catheter ablation of the abnormal bundle restores AV discontinuity. Spontaneous initiation of the heart at the level of the sinus node, the pacemaker of the heart, could also be explained via field dynamics.

The degree and pattern of generated heat in cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissues plays an important role on the outcome of the treatment. it is mainly affected by diffusion and distribution pattern of magnetic nanoparticles within the cancerous and non-cancerous tissues. Study the diffusion and distribution patterns of magnetic nanoparticle in vivo is difficult and costly in many cases and in some cases evaluating the amount of generated heat at cancer site is almost impossible. In vitro models for cancer tissues are alternatives for in vivo models. However, usual in vitro models could not resembling all the characteristics of a cancer tumor. In this hypothesis we propose that using 3D printers can provide a platform to fabricate a personalized in vitro cancer model which could simulate the most important features of the cancerous tissues (including shape and vascular network) and can be used to study magnetic hyperthermia in a simulated media of compatible to in vivo conditions."

The normal wound healing process is slow and takes weeks to months, depending on the type of wound. In last two decades, electrotherapy called low-intensity currents (LIC) for the treatment became popular for faster wound healing, as well as in management of nonresponding and ulcerative wounds. It was reported that LIC mimics 'the current of injury' which is generated by body on wounding and helps in faster wound healing. Researchers have also studied the migration of localized cell and other bio-molecules under the influence of LIC helping the wound to heal faster. Literature review has also suggested that, electrical stimulation of isolated adipose tissue derived stem cells (ADSCs) releases growth factors and differentiates in to specialized cells like fibroblasts and keratinocytes in laboratory conditions. These research areas are well explored and emerged as independent state-of-the-arts therapies and technologies. Considering the fact, that adipose tissue (along with ADSCs) is present subcutaneously, a new hypothesis is proposed which states that 'low intensity current (LIC) stimulation of wound stimulates subcutaneous adipose tissue containing ADSCs which releases different growth factors and also differentiates into certain cells like fibroblasts, neurons and keratinocytes. These cells easily migrate to wound site due to lipolysis and loosening of fat tissue, resulting in faster wound healing'. Thus this hypothesis provides a missing link between two state of the art technologies; first one is 'LIC based electrotherapy' and second one is 'in-vitro LIC stimulation of ADCSs' where role and significance of in-situ ADCSs were never studied."

Fulminant MH (f-MH) is the most dangerous form of MH, which presents a hypermetabolic cascade state, including very high temperature and carbon dioxide production, increased heart rate and oxygen consumption, mixed acidosis, rigid muscles, and rhabdomyolysis. Dantrolene is the only specific drug therapy for MH on the market. Without dantrolene, the reported mortality of f-MH is as high as 42.3%. Based on the participation of catecholamine in the hyperhaemodynamic response of f-MH and the demonstrated effective control of catecholamine release of magnesium sulfate, combined with the fact that magnesium and calcium have opposite effects on muscle contraction, I hypothesized that magnesium sulfate could be a choice for delaying the progression of f-MH while waiting for dantrolene treatment."

In this paper, we propose that psychiatric disorders can be arranged in a three-dimensional classification system according to the degree of dysfunctions on three specific axes in a way that is similar to the arrangement of chemical elements according to their atomic weights in Mendeleyev’s periodic table. For the three axes, we chose externalization, drive, and attention to represent the three-dimensional descriptions of mental health, namely, well-being in social, motivational, and cognitive areas, respectively. Throughout the paper, we explain our reasons for choosing these three axes and compare our hypothesis with categorical diagnostic systems as well as Cloninger’s dimensional diagnostic system using personality disorders, affective disorders, and schizophrenia as the specific diagnostic samples."

An example interaction is described which involves Chlamydia species, Human papillomavirus (HPV), microbiota, and yeast, where yeast is a pathogen of low virulence which crosses the blood-brain barrier. The cooperative pathogenesis begins at the mucosal epithelium. Infection by Chlamydia, HPV, or dysbiosis of commensal bacteria disrupts the integrity of the mucosal epithelium, thereby allowing colonizing yeast to penetrate the epithelial barrier and enter into the bloodstream. Chlamydia and enabling commensals promote insulin resistance, which provides yeast with glucose and also sets the stage for accumulation of amyloid beta protein (ABP). Meanwhile, HPV-induced and hyperglycemia-induced immunological changes enable the spread of newly invasive yeast to the brain, where the release of inflammatory cytokines in response to yeast promotes production of ABP. Chlamydia also cross reacts with Candida species, which may stimulate further brain inflammation in response to Candida and may augment production of ABP thereby The yeast’s less virulent origins, coupled with immune modulation by enablers, might explain why AD as a model of infectious encephalitis is always slow and insidious rather than occasionally febrile, accompanied by seizures, or marked by signs of meningeal inflammation."

CDAD can complicate chronic renal failure. Kidney tissue culture cytotoxicity has long been known. Kidney function alterations among animal models or diseased humans are relatively uncommon in mild to moderate enteritis. Rare findings of toxinemia are reported. Some have proposed that renal dysfunction arises more from pre-renal compromises. Direct toxin studies on whole kidney are sparse. The role of direct toxin-associated renal disease is worthy of further investigation given the current impetus towards the development of protective and therapeutic passive and active immunity.

It is unknown whether the reported exercise intolerance associated with type 2 diabetes is a direct result of the hyperglycemia, the impact of a relatively sedentary lifestyle, or increased adiposity. We hypothesize that obesity and inactivity, not hyperglycemia, cause exercise intolerance in individuals with type 2 diabetes. An analysis of the literature and results from the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat model of type 2 diabetes strongly support this hypothesis. GK rats were not sedentary or obese when compared with Wistar control rats and did not have exercise intolerance. Specifically, despite being hyperglycemic, GK rats demonstrated a longer treadmill run time to exhaustion (150.6 ± 9.0 vs. 77.2 ± 12.9 min), further distance run (1506 ± 90 vs. 772 ± 129 m), more work performed per gram muscle (44.0 ± 2.8 vs. 21.9 ± 3.8 kg*m/g) and a small increase in total vertical work performed when accounting for body mass (116.8 ± 6.3 versus 98.9 ± 15.2 kg*m). These results document preserved exercise tolerance in the non-obese, non-sedentary GK rat supporting the hypothesis that the reported exercise intolerance in models of type 2 diabetes is dependent on obesity and inactivity. Solving the obesity and inactivity versus hyperglycemia causality dilemma is important in understanding the development of type 2 diabetes and implications for future pharmacological and life style interventions."

In women with good ovarian reserve, late follicular P elevation is believed to be the result of the controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) itself, multiple follicular development and excessive ovarian steroidogenic activity. These mechanisms do not seem to be plausible in women with low ovarian reserve. In these women, excessive COS achieve a small number of pre-ovulatory follicles, which is not coupled to considerable ovarian steroidogenic activity. Therefore, other mechanisms should be pursued and explored. Delicate paracrine and autocrine mechanisms within the oocyte-cumulus complex were suggested to preserve the integrity of the pre-ovulatory follicle, including inhibition of P increase and follicular luteinization. However, clinical studies to demonstrate the disruption of these mechanisms in cases with low ovarian reserve and ageing oocytes are still lacking. Late follicular progesterone/estradiol (P/E2) ratio was introduced into clinical practice as a more appropriate way to analyze P rise in women undergoing COS to control for the E2 increase. The current hypothesis claims that in a follicular environment were the mechanism that prevent premature luteinization is disrupted, independent to LH surge; P rise at the late follicular phase may relatively bypass normal E2 production, at the pre-ovulatory stage of steroidogenesis, causing a rise in the P/E2 ratio. Therefore, in women with low ovarian reserve and few pre-ovulatory follicles, undergoing conventional COS, a negative (reverse) correlation between number of maturing follicles and P/E2 ratio may support the existence of such a mechanism as its disruption, while a no or a positive correlation may disapprove it."

Migraine is a highly prevalent, disabling, and costly disorder worldwide. From a long time ago, headaches have been known to be associated with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Headaches originating from gastric complaints were appreciated by Persian Medicine (PM) scholars. Today, functional GI disorders are shown to have high comorbidity with migraines; however, a causal relationship is not accepted today and pathophysiological explanations for this comorbidity are scarce. Therefore, based on the PM philosophy and the existing evidence, we aimed to propose an explanation for the co-morbidity of migraine and GI disorders.
Summary
Noxious stimuli from the GI tract are relayed to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the brain stem, which is located close to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). TNC has shown projections to (NTS) through which frequent GI stimuli may antidromically reach the TNC and finally result in neurogenic inflammation. In addition, immune products, particularly histamine, are released in the submucosa of the GI tract and absorbed into the systemic circulation, which renders migraineurs more prone to attacks."

In Bypass surgery excess length of the graft is cut to straighten it between the arterial anastomoses to avoid any excess length, in order to make sure that there will be no curves, but in endovascular approach this option is not available. In endovascular procedures, there are factors affecting negatively the long-term results. These factors contribute to excess length of the arterial wall, which is exaggerated after balloon dilatation. With deployment of stent, the stent straightens the arterial segment, so any extra length shifts proximal and distal to this segment leading to exaggeration of curves in arterial wall which affect hemodynamics of blood flow leading to neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis even at the edges of stent. This explains neointimmal hyperplasia and restenosis at the edges of stent graft although its edges are landing on a normal artery. New solution for this durability problem of endovascular procedures is to avoid excess length. It can be achieved through a kind of stent that abolishes curves from the arterial tree."

Methods
Thirty-two rats were grouped as control (Group I, n = 8), SHAM (Group II, n = 7) and OBL (Group III, n = 17) respectively; and followed eight weeks and animals were decapitated. The olfactory bulbs and intestines were extracted. Specimens stained with hematoxylin/eosin and GFAP methods and analyzed Stereologically to evaluate volume loss of olfactory bulbs and Peyer’s patches volumes (PV) of intestines per cubic millimeter and compared with each other’s statistically.
Results
The mean olfactory bulbs volumes were estimated as 3.65 ± 0.32/mm3 in group I, 3.12 ± 0.20/mm3 in group II and 2.21 ± 0.15/mm3 in group III (p < 0.0005 Group III vs. I and II).

Mal de Debarquement Syndrome (MdDS) is a condition characterized by a sensation of motion in the absence of a stimulus, which presents with two subtypes depending on the onset: Motion-Triggered, and Spontaneous or Non-Motion Triggered. MdDS predominantly affects women around 40–50 years of age and a high number of patients report associated disorders, such as migraine and depression. The pathophysiology of MdDS is unclear, as is whether there are predisposing factors that make individuals more vulnerable to developing the condition. Hormonal changes in women similarly to what observed in migraineous patients, as well as depression disorder, have been examined as potential key factors for developing MdDS. Studies on migraine and depression have revealed correlations with hormonal fluctuations in females as well as aberrant levels of some key neurotransmitters such as Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) and inflammatory neuropeptides like Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP). Consequently, this manuscript aims to propose a new hypothesis on the predisposing factors for MdDS and a new concept that could contribute to the understanding of its pathophysiology.
New hypothesis
Recent findings have demonstrated a role for hormonal influences in MdDS patients, similar to previous observations in patients with depression and migraine. We hypothesize the involvement of gonadal hormones and aberrant neurotransmitter levels, including the GABAergic and serotonergic systems, in MdDS pathophysiology. Our theory is that certain individuals are more vulnerable to develop MdDS during specific gonadal hormonal phases. Furthermore, we hypothesize that it may be possible to identify these individuals by measurement of an existing imbalance of these neurotransmitters or inflammatory neuropeptides like CGRP.
Further evaluation of the hypothesis
According to one theory, MdDS is considered as a maladaptation of the Vestibular Ocular Reflex (VOR) and velocity storage. When considering this theory, it is essential to highlight that the brainstem nuclei involved in the VOR and the velocity storage include GABAb sensitive neurons, which appear to produce inhibitory control of velocity storage. Responses of these GABAb sensitive neurons are also modulated by CGRP. Thus an alteration of the GABAergic network by imbalances of inhibitory neurotransmitters or CGRP could influence signal integration in the velocity storage system and therefore be directly involved in MdDS pathophysiology.
Consequence of the hypothesis and future studies
A hormonal and neurotransmitter imbalance may act to predispose individuals in developing MdDS. Future studies should focus on the hormonal influences on neurotransmitters (e.g. GABA) and on the trial of CGRP antagonist drugs for the treatment of MdDS patients."

Currently available anti-fibrotic agents exhibit undesirous cytotoxic effects and thus prove ineffective to treat post-surgical fibrosis. Accordingly, there is a need to develop efficient and novel anti-fibrotic agents. Adiponectin (APN), an adipokine from adipocytes is increased in the aqueous and vitreous humor of the patients with micro-angiopathy and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, it is reported to be elevated in the subretinal fluid, vitreous and epiretinal membrane of patients with AMD, proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) respectively. Since APN has anti-angiogenic activity and reduces VEGF levels, we hypothesize that APN might regulate the angio-fibrotic switch and drive the formation of fibrovascular membrane at advanced stages of AMD, PVR and PDR. Intriguingly, APN is shown to inhibit liver, cardiac and pulmonary fibrosis, yet it accelerates renal fibrosis. Therefore, the factors such as tissue and cell type, disease specific pathological milieu and the choice of APN receptor interaction could determine the pro- or anti-fibrotic nature of APN. We speculate that APN could play a profibrotic role in the posterior segment of the eye."

The British scientist Leslie Orgel stated that evolution is cleverer than we are. This assumption seems correct considering that some species are naturally able to resist the age-related diseases that remain unsolved by our modern medicine. Indeed, bowhead whales can live for more than two hundred years and are suspected to possess efficient antitumor mechanisms. Naked mole-rats are exceptionally long-lived compared to similar-sized mammals and are protected from senescence and age-related diseases. Consequently, the characterization of protective molecular mechanisms in long-lived species (i.e. bowhead whale, naked mole-rat, microbat) could be of great interest for therapeutic applications in human. Cellular stress response is considered to be an anti-aging process dedicated to the prevention of damage accumulation and the maintenance of homeostasis. Interestingly, cellular stress response in plants and animals involves the production of health-promoting metabolites such as resveratrol, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and spermidine. Do anti-aging metabolites formed during stress exposure differ between human and extreme longevity species in terms of their nature, their quantity or their production? These questions remain unsolved and deserve to be considered. Indeed, the mimicking of anti-aging strategies selected throughout evolution in long-lived species could be of high therapeutic value for humans. This paper suggests that metabolomic studies on extreme longevity species cells exposed to mild stressors may lead to the characterization of health-promoting metabolites. If confirmed, this would provide new avenues of research for the development of innovative anti-aging strategies for humans."

Previous studies have found CD44 variants could significantly improve tumor resistance, therefore, we hypothesized the CD44v16, a CD44 variant found in our lab, might confer drug resistance in K562 cell. Through lentiviral expression system, the CD44v16 gene was introduced into the sensitive K562 cell, and the result indicated it could remarkably improve the drug resistance index. Real-time PCR and western blot experiments showed the expressions of protein p65, Bcl-2, Snail, and IKKβ in CD44v16-positive cell group were higher than the CD44v16-negative group.

In the liver, fructose is metabolised to fructose-1-phosphate and thence to glyceraldehydes, which in turn can either enter glycogenolysis via pyruvate or gluconeogenesis via fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. High levels of fructose-1-phosphate inhibit both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. We hypothesised that, if systemically absorbed short-chain fatty acids constitute a major metabolic fate of unabsorbed dietary fructose, then levels of erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate would be inversely correlated with plasma levels of short-chain fatty acids. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis in respect of the three main short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate. Venous blood samples from 39 patients (16 male, 23 female, mean (standard error) age 42.4 (3.3) years) were analysed. Erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate was measured using quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectrometry following gel electrophoresis, while plasma acetate, propionate and butyrate levels were measured using gas-liquid chromatography. The erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate level was inversely correlated with the plasma acetate (r = −0.30, p = 0.06), propionate (r = −0.31, p = 0.05) and butyrate (r = −0.40, p = 0.01).

In contrast, health associated effects at lower flux densities, which can be found in the human environment, are controversial, and no accepted interaction mechanism has been presented. Here we present a hypothesis regarding the biological aspect of interaction between LF MF and cells. We suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein STIM1, which functions as a sensor for several cellular conditions (low Ca2+ levels, temperature increase, increased levels of oxygen radicals, hypoxia), is a candidate LF MF sensor. Such a sensor function can be either direct (via local temperature increase caused by intracellularly induced electric fields), or indirect due to responses to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Activated STIM1 leads to downstream effects by activation of signal transduction processes and changes in gene expression leading to secondary events. The nature of these changes would be dependent on both cell type and the particular physiological state the cell displays at the time of STIM1 activation. Results from testing of this hypothesis, as suggested in this paper, would greatly assist in understanding of the possible health-related effects of low-level LF MF. This would benefit both safety assessments regarding MF exposure as well as possible use of MF in medicine. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms underpinning MF exposure effects of living matter allows the targeted use of the fields in medical applications. There are several examples already in use based on empiric and not on mechanistic knowledge. Knowledge generated from our hypothesis testing makes it possible for MF based medical applications to be optimized."

A low-fat plant-based diet was designed for reversing coronary artery disease and it is effective in reversing the disease. It has not been tested, however, as far as we know, whether diets with customary levels of fat can also reverse coronary artery disease. Nevertheless, evidence is accumulating to show that atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease are reversed with diets containing customary levels of fat. It has been known that fats of plant origin decrease the risk factors of cardiovascular disease. It is also known that vegans who consume diets with customary levels of fat have the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease. But recent and more specific data show that atherosclerosis was decreased when nuts that are rich in fat were added to a Mediterranean diet while atherosclerosis was increased in the controls. Also, two clinical cases show that coronary artery disease was reversed by low-fat plant-based diets that were supplemented with fat-rich foods of plant origin. These data, then, provide evidence that coronary artery disease may be reversed with a diet containing customary levels of fat from plant sources. We hypothesize that coronary artery disease may be reversed by diets with customary levels of fat of plant origin that are low in saturated fat content. This hypothesis needs to be tested by comparing a traditional low-fat plant-based diet with a plant-based diet containing customary levels of fat of plant origin in their effectiveness to reverse coronary artery disease."

The dual attention stimuli/alternating bilateral stimulation (DAS/ABS) element of EMDR therapy has no proposed mechanism of action agreed upon, which explains the rapid shifts in cognitions and dysfunctional traumatic memory networks that are central to its observable efficacy. This paper discusses an innate, biological mechanism found in biological systems, including the human nervous system that may explain the efficacy of DAS/ABS. This mechanism is stochastic resonance (SR). SR is observed to make unintelligible, subthreshold signals intelligible and facilitates signal transmission. It provides a potential mechanism for discrimination and the selective focusing of attention, which are important factors in effective psychotherapy for the psychologically traumatised individual. The body/mind complex aims to achieve the functional encoding of memories in the neocortex and a key structural crossroads in this process is the thalamus. Activity in the thalamus is decreased in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) compared to non-PTSD patients and a form of ‘gating’ is known to occur at the thalamic level. This ‘gating’ is adaptive and it is postulated to protect the higher neocortical systems in times of trauma. Although the model is initially somewhat counterintuitive, Stochastic Resonance; a form of random ‘noise’, can be considered ‘helpful randomness’ and when present in the thalamus SR can help filter and control sensitivity to incoming signals; helping to discriminate what is communicated. Naturally occurring SR is normally present as a result of descending cortico-thalamic activity, but appears attenuated as a result of exposure to trauma. The view of ‘noise’ in the current era of cell phones and High Definition is generally negative with science going to significant lengths to clean up signals: i.e. removing noise from them. We do not want white noise in our music or during our cell phone calls. However, some researchers invite us to consider that not all noise is bad and the downward cortico-thalamic ‘noise’ is an example of this category of ‘helpful noise’. This paper will discuss the potential role of SR, as the mechanism by which DAS/ABS generates a random (stochastic) signal, facilitating a return to functional memory processing, where there is a lack of naturally occurring noise from the descending cortico-thalamic connections because of exposure to trauma. Modelling the mechanism as SR will facilitate further study into EMDR therapy and this will hopefully encourage perspicacity, where there has previously been derision."

In patients with open growth plate, epiphyseal distraction is used to separate the uninvolved epiphysis from adjacent tumor. This helps preserve the growth potential and restore joint and limb function to a great extent. Interestingly, epiphyseal distraction also appears to inhibit the proliferation of osteosarcoma tumor cells and to increase sensitivity to chemotherapy. Tumor interstitial pressure (TIP) is often elevated in the microenvironment of most solid tumors, including osteosarcoma. Elevated TIP can promote the proliferation, invasion, and migration ability of osteosarcoma cells and also decrease the uptake and distribution of chemotherapeutic agents. Studies have confirmed that the sustained volumetric strain produced in distracted tissue decreases TIP; it stretches extracellular matrix, decreases interstitial density, and increases vessel diameter. We hypothesize that lowering of TIP during the period of epiphyseal distraction inhibits the proliferation and invasion of osteosarcoma cell and, at the same time, increases blood perfusion in the tumor and thus enhances uptake and distribution of chemotherapy agents. If the hypothesis is proved to be true, distraction of tumor segment could be a novel supplementary treatment for osteosarcoma by manipulation of TIP."

Here, we propose that the progressive uncoupling of two endosymbiotic subsystems (information and energy) inside the cell, as a consequence of long-term injuries, gives rise to alterations (i) in tissue interactions and (ii) in cell organization. In the first case, we argue that the impairment of both the coherent state and the synergy between intercellular communications underpins the onset of tissue dysplasia, that usually evolves towards cancer development. In the second case, we suggest that the rupture of endosymbiosis drives a sort of cell regression towards a protist-like entity represented by the concept of “de-emergence” postulated in our systemic evolutionary approach to carcinogenesis. This conceptual association of the cancer cell with a protist-like organism could support the development of novel cancer therapeutic approaches. To this end, we propose a paradigm shift in cancer pharmacology since: i) our knowledge of cancer pathophysiology as a complex system is insufficient, despite a vast knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying cancer; ii) current cancer pharmacology deals only with microvariables (e.g. gene or protein targets), which do not account for the integrated pathophysiology of cancer, rather than with macrovariables (e.g. pH, membrane potential, electromagnetic fields, cell communications and so on) and mesovariables (between micro and macro), such as the interaction between various cellular components including cellular organelles. This paradigm shift should allow cancer pharmacology to move forward from molecular treatments (focusing on single targets) to modular treatments that consider cancer-related processes (i.e. inflammation, coagulation, etc.) or even to a sort of ecosystemic treatment addressing the whole functioning of the “cancer ecosystem”. Examples of ecosystems treatment may be natural plant derivatives that act synergistically or pulsed electromagnetic fields which can act on particular biological processes in cancer cells. In addition, we need different working theoretical models on which to base new anticancer pharmacological approaches. Finally, we examine what value our systemic evolutionary approach could add to cancer treatments, in particular in liver cancer as a paradigm for developing potential applications."

The thickening of calcified cartilage, the thinning of superficial hyaline cartilage and the remodeling of subchondral bone indicated that the cartilage degradation could be a procedure of enchondral ossification similar to the growth plate, of driven by a host of cytokines within the affected joint. Articular cartilage loses stable state from normal resting to a high turnover in the stimulation of abnormal mechanical stresses and cytokines would subsequently contributed to slowly sustained remodeling and calcification, which might be the key features of the initiation and development of OA. In this article, the development and structural comparison of articular cartilage and growth plate as well as the major pathologic features of OA will be discussed to explain that cartilage degeneration in OA might be a process of enchondral ossification similar to growth plate. This would provide a new perspective for understanding OA’s pathogenesis and the treatment in the future."

During the anteroposterior compressive forces along the globe, the corneal deformation beyond certain limits leads to the development of sudden displacement forces within the anterior chamber. Aqueous within it which is incontinuous circulation with a posterior narrow pupillary aperture as its entrance, find the path of least resistance that is along the pupillary orifices leading to anexpulsive drive to displace the fluid through this small aperture.

The damaged muscular tissues are replaced by scar tissues and burdens the healthy muscles resulting in further attenuated functioning of heart. Since, human heart muscles cannot regenerate naturally or it has been thought so, pharmacological procedures such as using a heart assist device are followed to restore the lost function of heart. Stem cell engineering and cardiac patches offers promising prospects with their cutting edge research reports. Cardiac patches offers a viable solution as they can also function as an implant to assist in offering the mechanical support the damaged muscles were capable of. Designing cardiac patches to suit multiple functions is not only challenging but also perilous due to the target organ with which it will be interfaced. Sensor based, electrically active, miniaturized circuitry etc., poses a huge threat to the individual in whom the device/patch is implanted. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis on choosing β-PVDF based nanocomposites as the inimitable material for designing implantable cardiac patches. β-PVDF based nanocomposite materials is expected to exhibit piezoelectric effect and contribute to the adherence, proliferation and maturation of stem cells. Physico-chemical characterizations followed by in vitro cell line studies were performed in ought to confirm the same. The results revealed that the β-PVDF based nanocomposite material was mechanically stable and supportive in cardiomyocyte adherence and differentiation when compared to standard non piezoelectric scaffolds (control). Hence, an implantable β-PVDF based novel electrospun nanocomposite scaffold is hypothesized to be the hour of need in conjugation with stem cell engineering for repairing damaged heart muscles."

As a facultative intracellular pathogen, B. pseudomallei produces virulence factors to evade innate host response and survive within host cells. Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that play critical roles in host defense against pathogens by their ability to detect and eliminate microbes. Host defense processes against B. pseudomallei including phagocytosis, oxidative burst, autophagy, apoptosis, and proinflammatory cytokine release are all initiated by these two phagocytes in the fight against this bacterium. In vitro studies with mouse macrophage cell lines revealed multiple evasion strategies used by B. pseudomallei to counteract these innate processes. B. pseudomallei invades and replicates in neutrophils but little is known regarding its evasion mechanisms. The bidirectional interaction of neutrophils and macrophages in controlling B. pseudomallei infection has also been overlooked. Here the hypothesis that B. pseudomallei hijacks neutrophils and uses them to transport and infect new phagocytes is proposed as an evasion strategy to survive and persist in host phagocytes. This two-pronged approach by B. pseudomallei to replicate in two different types of phagocytes and to modulate their cell death modes is effective in promoting persistence and survival of the bacterium."

The former two are among genetically defined disorders that seem to provide survival advantages to heterozygote individuals, while severe health problems happen in homozygote mutation carriers. Although palmar fibromatosis has no defined mutations, its prevalence has been linked to the prevalence of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup I that expanded after the Last Ice Age, thus making th distribution of all three “Celtic” diseases dependent on the global climate from 40 to 8 Kya. During the Last Ice Age, the global climate was dry and dark due to dust-laden atmosphere (20–25 times more than today). It has been postulated that skin pigmentation was related to insolation, UV protection and skin synthesis of vitamin D, so when our ancestors moved to Eurasia, individuals with pale skin became advantageous. Deficiency of vitamin D has several health consequences and some of them have been proposed by other authors as important for the spreading of cystic fibrosis mutations: rickets/osteomalacia; susceptibility to diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis and salt induced arterial hypertension. The here proposed link is between vitamin D deficiency and the anaemia of chronic disease that might have facilitated spreading of the hemochromatosis mutation. It seems plausible that the risk of health problems in the offspring of close relatives might have resulted in social taboos of consanguinity in Eurasian protosocieties. Ancient steam bath rituals seem linked to lower incidences of cystic fibrosis in several European populations, thus suggesting health protection in an arid, dusty climate of the last glaciation, that made CFTR mutations in heterozygote carriers less advantageous."

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) mechanisms of death remains obscured. SIDS' Triple Risk Model assumed coexistence of individual subtle vulnerability, critical developmental period and stressors. Prone sleeping is a major risk factor but provide no clues regarding the mechanism of death. The leading assumed mechanisms of death are either an acute respiratory crisis or arrhythmias but neither one is supported with evidence, hence both are eventually speculations. Postmortem findings do exist but are inconclusive to identify the mechanism of death.
What does the proposed hypothesis based on?
1. The stressors (suggested by the triple risk model) share a unified compensatory physiological response of decrease in systemic vascular resistant (SVR) to facilitate a compensatory increase in cardiac output (CO). 2. The cardiovascular/cardiorespiratory control of the vulnerable infant during a critical developmental period may be impaired. 3. A severe decrease in SVR is associated with hyper-dynamic state, high output failure and distributive shock.
The hypothesis
Infant who is exposed to one or more stressors responds normally by decrease in SVR which increases CO. In normal circumstances once the needs are met both SVR and CO are stabilized on a new steady state. The incompetent cardiovascular control of the vulnerable infant fails to stabilize SVR which decreases in an uncontrolled manner. Accordingly CO increases above the needs to hyper-dynamic state, high output heart failure and hyper-dynamic shock.
Conclusions
The proposed hypothesis provides an appropriate alternative to either respiratory crises or arrhythmia though both speculations cannot be entirely excluded."

abstract = "Methotrexate (MTX), an antifolate, is the anchor drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is inexpensive, effective, and generally safe. When clinical response is inadequate, biological therapies are commonly used in combination with MTX. However, biological agents have safety concerns (i.e. infections, malignancy) and the addition of a biologic agent is expensive, making strategies to improve MTX efficacy important. Inhibition of pathways of folate metabolism involving purine metabolism by MTX, have been traditionally emphasized as important in MTX efficacy. However, inhibition MTX catabolism may also be important. MTX is irreversibly hydroxylated to form 7-hydroxy methotrexate (7-OH-MTX) by aldehyde oxidase (EC 1.2.3.1) (AOX). Catabolism of MTX to 7-OH-MTX is the first metabolic process imposed on an oral dose of MTX and will alter subsequent interactions of MTX with other enzymes. 7-OH-MTX is less potent than MTX in the treatment of rat adjuvant arthritis. RA patients with a low capacity to catabolize MTX to 7-OH-MTX do better clinically than individuals who are rapid formers of 7-OH-MTX. Therefore, altering the catabolism of MTX may be an innovative way to improve MTX efficacy. Raloxifene is a FDA-approved therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis and for the reduction of invasive breast cancers but has no known activity in RA. Raloxifene is a potent inhibitor of human liver AOX. Postmenopausal women with RA frequently have low bone mineral density and would be candidates for raloxifene and MTX combination therapy. The effect of raloxifene on MTX metabolism has never been studied. Our hypothesis is that in postmenopausal women with RA and osteoporosis treated with MTX and raloxifene, the inhibition of AOX with resultant decreased formation of 7-OH MTX; will increase MTX levels and improve MTX efficacy. This hypothesis could be studied in an open-label, proof of concept clinical study in individuals before and after the addition of raloxifene. Red blood cell MTX and 7-OH-MTX levels and RA disease activity (DAS28) would be measured. In possible future studies, there are dietary substances, as supplements, (e.g. epigallocatechin gallate in green tea and resveratrol) which inhibit human liver AOX which could be evaluated."

Evidence of neurotoxic impact from low dose systemic exposure to fluoride prompted an investigation by a branch of the governmental agency that has promoted fluoridation policy since its 1940′s inception. This review identifies ten significant flaws in the design of an animal experiment conducted by the U.S. National Toxicology Program as part of that investigation into the neurotoxic impact of systemic prenatal and postnatal fluoride exposure.

Intestinal type gastric cancer often is accompanied by gastric mucosal atrophy, intestinal metaplasia. The clinical manifestation involves hypergastrinemia, low stomach acid, PG I/II progressive decreasing, anemia, and protein energy malnutrition. The neck cells of gastric glands act as tissue stem cells to regenerate the gastric glands. In addition to secreting gastric acid and intrinsic factor, the parietal cells also have the function of inducing differentiation of themselves and gastric epithelial cells. When the function of parietal cells is normal, the neck cells differentiate into mature cells, and the glands regenerate intact. When the function of parietal cells is defective, the neck cells maybe differentiate into mature intestinal cells, and the gastric glands will regenerate in form of the intestinal metaplasia. When the function of parietal cells is lost, the neck cells can not differentiate into mature cells successfully, and the accumulation of immature cells in gastric mucosal tissue forms atypical hyperplasia of different degrees and cancers of various differentiation grades. Any factors that can reduce the function of parietal cell could result in intestinal type gastric carcinogenesis. Adrenal cortical hypofunction can make the parietal cell hypofunction, hypohematopoiesis, protein synthesis rates reducing and protein degradation rates increasing. The patients develop gastric cancer, and come with lack of gastric acid and intrinsic factor, anemia, protein energy malnutrition. Autoimmune gastritis can produce parietal cell antibodies to damage parietal cells. Patients with autoimmune gastritis gastric exhibit hypergastrinemia, lack of gastric acid and internal factor, higher incidence of gastric cancer.

Persistent racial disparities in prevalence rates have been reported, with the highest values observed in Subsaharan Africa and South Asia. In United States, non-Hispanic Black women are more likely to have a premature or low-birth-weight baby. Beyond the speculative debate on factors explaining such racial disparity, the key-question remains about the path from race to birth outcomes. Several hypotheses emerged from the published literature to explain the racial difference in likelihood for PB and LBW. However, the ‘Hispanic paradox’ remains unexplained. We relied here on published data to hypothesize that the racial disparity in PB/LBW is a consequence to the joint influence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and fat mass. Beyond its role as a source of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the 25-hydroxyvitamin D is directly implicated in the fetal growth and the normal completion of pregnancy. Because of its lipophilic property, a large part of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is swiftly trapped into fat mass and the circulating fraction impact the body development during fetal period. We postulate that the positive effect of vitamin D to prevent PB/LBW is less beneficial for women with high fat mass, independent of race. The core problem may be related to bioavailable 25-hydroxyvitamin D, not directly to race."

One popular theory is that with age and the cell division times increasing, DNA damage will inevitably accumulate, leading to dysfunction and failure of various tissues and organs, which will eventually lead to aging. Thus, repairing damaged DNA is a key strategy to extend lifespan. Excision repair cross-complementary gene 1 (ERCC1) is a DNA repair enzyme that recognizes, excises and repairs damaged DNA. Defects or reduced activity of the enzyme can lead to DNA damage accumulation. This study provides that aerobic exercise can significantly extend rats’ lifespan and increase the expression of ERCC1 in heart, brain, liver and kidney. Therefore, based on our experiments, we propose the following scientific hypothesis: aerobic exercise can up-regulate the expression of ERCC1 and then may reduce DNA damage accumulation to maintain genomic integrity and stability, thereby delaying aging and prolonging lifespan in humans."

abstract = "Goal-directed movements of a limb are optimized by sensorimotor integration, a process that merges both sensory and motor representations. In a previous study, we revealed that abnormal sensory representation can impair reach-to-grasp movements in patients with spinothalamocortical pathway lesions. This abnormal motor control was significantly recovered when referencing correct somatosensory information with the intact hand. Furthermore, motor control of the intact hand was impaired when referencing abnormal somatosensory information with the affected hand. Such bilateral limb interference suggests that there is only one common integrated sensory representation and only one common motor representation for both hands. The single sensory representation would be integrated from the somatosensory information received from both hands. Subsequently, the integrated motor representation would be derived from the integrated sensory representation, and would then be split and sent out via motor commands to both hands. Considering that bimanual coordinated movements are reportedly smoother than unimanual movements, information transfer between the integrated sensory and the integrated motor representation would be suitable for such efficient bimanual movements. Therefore, we propose a novel hypothetical model to better explain the observation of bilateral limb interference. The proposed model might contribute to the development of novel sensory and motor rehabilitation strategies by promoting the use of the unaffected hand."

This case series presents 10 cases of patients presenting with chronic pelvic pain following a cesarean section which were found upon surgical exploration to have developed adhesions between the abdominal wall and the uterus. When they first consulted, patients were evaluated clinically with a questionnaire and physical exam, and with ultrasonography to evaluate pelvic anatomy when necessary. The evaluation was completed with diagnostic laparoscopy which revealed atypical post-cesarean adhesions which were treated by adhesion lysis or hysterectomy. Surgical protocols of the cesarean sections were retrieved and analysed for potential adhesion risk factors. Patients presented with chronic pelvic pain that appeared in the early post-operative period. Physical exam revealed a subinvoluted uterus with a high fixed cervix. Ultrasound examination revealed clues of adhesions manifested by points of traction and an irregular uterine border. No other diagnosis such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian or bowel anomalies were identified during surgery. After laparoscopic adhesion lysis or hysterectomy, all patients who were treated noted a complete resolution of the pain that lasted during a follow-up of at least 5 years. These findings suggest that adhesions that create traction and fix the uterus to the abdominal wall following caesarian section can be the cause of severe chronic pelvic pain. In the presence of such pain, clinicians should suspect the presence of adhesions and investigate and treat patients accordingly."

abstract = "Nodular rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have raised rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti–citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) levels, and are more likely to smoke than RA patients without nodules. Subcutaneous and pulmonary rheumatoid nodules (granulomas) frequently co–exist. Pulmonary rheumatoid nodules develop prior to RA development and have the immunological machinery to generate RF and ACPAs. Pulmonary granulomas have been observed in animal models exposed to cadmium (Cd) inhalation. Cigarette smoke increases pulmonary Cd exposure. It has been suggested that dust and cigarette smoke co–exposure increases localised pulmonary Cd adsorption. We hypothesise that subcutaneous nodular RA represents a distinct disease subtype induced by pulmonary rheumatoid nodule formation and the generation of high levels of RA associated autoantibodies initiated by Cd inhalation via cigarette smoke. Cohorts of RA patients attending rheumatology clinics in Cornwall, UK (total n = 504) were studied to determine the prevalence of nodular RA, with matched analysis (age, gender and social class) to compare urinary Cd, RF and ACPA levels stratifying for nodular disease and smoking. In cohort 1 45/303 (14.9%) of the RA patients under regular follow up had nodular disease. Of the RA smokers, 30/155 (19%) were nodular and of the RA non–smokers 15/148 (10%) were nodular. Smoking was significantly associated with nodular RA, odds ratio (OR) = 2.48 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26–4.88, p = 0.008. Raised urinary Cd levels were significantly associated with nodular RA in non–dust exposed individuals, OR 2.26 (95% CI 1.08–4.73), p = 0.03 compared to dust exposed individuals, OR 0.78 (95% CI 0.35–1.76), p = 0.557, despite fewer pack years (py) at diagnosis (16 vs 20 py). Nodular RA smokers had significantly raised RF levels compared to RA smokers without nodular disease (median RF 171.5 (interquartile range (IQR) 48–394) vs median RF 31.7 (IQR 10.3–170.3), p < 0.00001). RF positivity was significantly more prevalent in nodular RA smokers compared to RA smokers without nodular disease (84/89 (94%) vs. 141/199 (71%), OR = 6.9 (95% CI 2.66–17.91), p < 0.00001).

Current obstetric guidelines recommend that the administration of low-dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia be initiated after 12 weeks' gestation. This starting time was chosen to minimize possible risks of maternal bleeding and fetal anomalies. However, evidence from reproductive medicine, where low-dose aspirin is commonly recommended to use before and in early pregnancy, as well as existing literature, does not support these concerns. On the other hand, defective placentation resulting in a subsequent ischemic placenta is considered as the starting point of preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin initiated in early pregnancy can balance the levels of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin and maintain adequate uteroplacental blood flow and, therefore, improve placentation. Thus, an initiation of low-dose aspirin earlier than 12 weeks can be considered. Meanwhile, evidence shows that low-dose aspirin can improve maternal vascular endothelial function without increasing the risks of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Therefore, it appears safe to use low-dose aspirin as a prophylactic until delivery."

Furthermore, since the level of PL and FFA in FF partially depends on their levels in serum, as a collaterally of our hypothesis is that the existing level of PL and FFA in serum correlates with the levels of PL and FFA in FF, and that the dose of applied gonadotropins during COS will correlate with the levels of PL and FFA in serum and FF. In addition, we assume that the level of PL and FFA in serum and in FF after COS will correlate with the retrieved number of GQ oocytes, one of the most important outcomes of COS. ."

It is widely accepted that mitochondrial apoptosis is an important link in myocardial infarction induced by I/R damage. Studies suggested that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway plays an important role in the development and function of the cardiovascular system and regulating the mitochondrial homeostasis. AhR played a critical role in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis in response to TCDD-induced stress through translocation of AhR from the cytoplasm into the cell nucleus. And a portion of AhR was found in the mitochondrial inter membrane space. Moreover, there were abundant AhR expression in myocardial cells induced by I/R, and ischaemic post-conditioning reversed apoptotic reperfusion injury involving the AhR signaling pathway. Additionally, AhR is involved in the mechanism of cardiac toxicity of many chemotherapeutic agents. Given the discovery mentioned above, we hypothesize that AhR pathway participates in myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury by regulating mitochondrial apoptosis. Meanwhile, how the AhR pathway is involved in I/R damage and regulating mitochondrial apoptosis is needed to further verified. To evaluate our hypothesis, we will measure the expression of AhR in mitochondria and cytoplasm after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion in vitro and in vivo. And then study the AhR pathway in regulating mitochondrial apoptosis to participate in myocardial I/R injury using mitochondrial protein mass spectrometry analysis and RNA interference technique. If our hypothesis is correct, AhR will be a key target in myocardial I/R injury and myocardial infarction, which could provide important agents."

On histopathological examination, SCAD is featured by prominent eosinophilic infiltration of the adventitia or periadventitial layer of coronary artery. It has been estimated that approximately 15–30% of SCAD patients experience recurrent episodes of dissection despite medical therapy. Preliminary evidence suggests that injury to the vascular endothelium and myocytes in the arterial wall may be explained by cytotoxic products released from eosinophils in response to inflammatory mediators. In addition, neovascularization of vasa vasorum and dilatation of intimal capillaries may be stimulated by localized eosinophils. Newly formed fragile vasa vasorum may disrupt due to high intraluminal pressure from the interconnected capillary network, leading to the expansion of intramural hemorrhage. It is hypothesized that anti-inflammatory therapy targeting eosinophilic coronary periarteritis would be effective in preventing the recurrence of SCAD by promoting the healing of dissection. The article delineates the biological plausibility, empirical data, and future perspective regarding eosinophilic inflammation as a potential therapeutic target for SCAD."

Moreover, H2 can regulate the intracellular signal as a signal modulator. However, it is still unclear in cell signaling involved in testosterone hormone production. Male fertility depends on the intra-testicular testosterone concentration, which is produced by the Leydig cell in the seminiferous tubules in testes. Although moderate amounts of ROS are needed for normal sperm function, the higher amounts might decrease testosterone production. High ROS decreases testosterone hormone production by dysregulation of hormonal signal from the hypothalamus to the Leydig cell as a result of redox imbalance. Lower level of testosterone fails to support the Leydig cell for the progression of spermatogenesis. Superoxide anion (O2−), hydroxyl radical (OH) and peroxynitrite (ONOO−) could also attack the DNA, lipid and protein, disrupting sperm structure and function and aggravating the milieu of male fertility and spermatogenesis. H2 regulates intracellular MAPK downstream cAMP signal and Ca2+ signal as a signal modulator to antagonize ROS signaling. Thus H2 can play a role in modulating signals involved in testosterone hormone production to improve male fertility caused by redox imbalance. We therefore hypothesize that molecular hydrogen may enhance testosterone production via cellular redox balance. By this hypothesis, we anticipate that molecular hydrogen may be an effective remedy in male infertility."

It is not clear whether such dysbiosis is a cause or a consequence of a disease state. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a healthy donor to a patient or diseased animal is a valuable tool for targeted modification of microbiome leading to therapeutic response. Positive effect has been shown in therapy of a number of gastrointestinal as well as non-gastrointestinal diseases. In addition, FMT has been successfully used to transfer the diseased phenotype form a donor with the disease to a healthy recipient. However, targeted modification of the microbiome before the onset of colitis has not been shown previously. Based on our preliminary results, we propose the hypothesis of so called reverse phenotype transfer in IBD. This term describes the phenomenon, in which the transplantation of gut microbiota from a donor more sensitive to IBD to a healthy recipient leads to resistance of the recipient to IBD and vice versa. Mice that received FMT from donors with severe colitis have shown improved colitis score compared with mice that received FMT from donors more resistant to development of colitis. Such reverse phenotype transfer has broad implications, especially in terms of preventive medicine. However, detailed mechanisms need to be elucidated to conclude the validity of the phenomenon."

Over expression of autotaxin which occurs in atopic dermatitis has been shown to be involved in itching pathology. Importantly, gene amplification of autotaxin also occurs in cholestasis. Melatonin has pleiotropic properties such as suppressive effects on serum level of autotaxin which relieves itching of atopic dermatitis.

abstract = "High low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is routinely described as the main cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). However, numerous observations are in conflict with Bradford Hill’s criteria for causality: a) degree of atherosclerosis is not associated with LDL-C; b) on average the life span of people with FH is about the same as for other people; c) LDL-C of people with FH without CVD is almost as high as in FH patients of the same age with CVD; and d) questionable benefit or none at all have been achieved in the controlled, randomized cholesterol-lowering trials that have included FH individuals only. Obviously, those individuals with FH who suffer from CVD may have inherited other and more important risk factors of CVD than high LDL-C. In accordance, several studies of FH individuals have shown that various coagulation factors may cause CVD. Equally, some non-FH members of an FH kindred with early CVD, have been found to suffer from early CVD as well. Cholesterol-lowering has only been successful in an animal experiment by using probucol, which has anticoagulant effects as well. We conclude that systematic studies of all kinds of risk factors among FH individuals are urgently required, because today millions of people with FH are treated with statins, the benefit of which in FH is unproven, and which have many serious side effects. We predict that treatment of FH individuals with elevated coagulation factors with anticoagulative drugs is more effective than statin treatment alone."

There is an existence of different treatment modalities for the management of vitiligo. But irrespective of treatment methods, the main drawback in the management of vitiligo is the occurrence of side effects during the implication of treatment. Among the treatment modalities, photochemotherapy seems to be the better choice of treatment for vitiligo. Photochemotherapy involves the usage of UV rays for photoactivation of the drug to cause photosensitization of skin which in turn leads to repigmentation. The main aim of the study is to develop novel combination strategy of lipid based nanoemulsion gel for the treatment of leucoderma using trimethylpsoralen and flavonoid. We assume that if this hypothesis of combination therapy proves successful it can be used as an additional novel treatment strategy in the management of vitiligo."

Similar in molecular structure to oxalate, wines or ethanol of all kinds and acetic acid extend lifespan, despite that ethanol is moderately carcinogenic. Cancer cells are likely to overproduce organic acids such as oxalate to counteract strong acids, and the insoluble calcium oxalate is stressful to cells. It is postulated that ethanol inhibits the generation of oxalate, and thus reduces cancer mortality. To confirm this hypothesis, an extensive epidemiological studies can be performed on cancer patients to show that heavy wine drinkers have lower mortality rates than control groups without the use of alcohol-abuse drugs. This experiment will illuminate the positive and negative sides of ethanol intake, and pave the way for establishing better strategies to treat cancer."

Such cancer cells could very well originate from chromosome missegregation which is a disturbingly common phenomenon, happening in 0.01 to 4 percent of cell divisions. Missegregated cells are aneuploid, typically lacking a chromosome or having one in surplus. Missegregated cells have mutation in the gene dose of the perhaps a thousand genes on a chromosome in one step. After missegregation cell division cannot be done right, as at least one daughter cell has a faulty chromosome number. At division in cells with surplus chromosomes the number will tend to increase due to mismatch in the division machinery. The organism has a number of repair mechanisms in place to prevent potential damage of accumulating aneuploidy. The first is the roll-back of the cell division itself, leading to tetraploidy or sometimes two nuclei in one cell; another is the prevention of further divisions. A very important one is induction of apoptosis, the cellular suicide. A special case is the elimination of the nucleus itself in the formation of red blood cells. Many aneuploid cells are probably eliminated by the immune system. A hypothetical mechanism would be the prevention of metastasis. Missegregation increases with age when the chromosomes lose their protective telomere ends at the Hayflick limit after about 50 divisions, and the unraveled chromosomes fuse and break. For cancer to develop all of these repair mechanisms must fail. The hypothesis offers a straightforward rationale for the multiple hit hypothesis of cancer development."

abstract = "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a spectrum of disease ranging from steatosis to steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis, but the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain largely unknown. As there is currently no approved pharmacological therapy and the prevalence of NAFLD keeps increasing, understanding of its pathophysiology is crucial. We hypothesise that vascular alterations in early NAFLD play a role in the progression of the disease by inducing an increased intrahepatic vascular resistance and consequently relative hypoxia in the liver. Evidence of the detrimental effects of hypoxia in NAFLD has already been observed in liver surgery, where the outcomes of steatotic livers after ischaemia-reperfusion are worse than in healthy livers, and in obstructive sleep apnoea, which is an independent risk factor of NAFLD. Moreover, early histological damage in NAFLD is situated in the pericentral zone, which is also the first zone to be affected by a decreased oxygen tension because of the unique hepatic vacsular anatomy that causes the pericentral oxygen tension to be the lowest. Angiogenesis is also a characteristic of NAFLD, driven by hypoxia-induced mechanisms, as demonstrated in both animal models and in humans with NAFLD. Relative hypoxia is most probably induced by impaired blood flow to the liver, caused by increased intrahepatic vascular resistance. An increased intrahepatic vascular resistance early in the development of disease has been convincingly demonstrated in several animal models of NAFLD, whereas an increased portal pressure, a consequence of increased intrahepatic vascular resistance, has been proven in patients with NAFLD. Animal studies demonstrated a decreased intrahepatic effect of vasodilators and an increased reactivity to vasoconstrictors that results in an increased intrahepatic vascular resistance, thus the presence of a functional component. Pharmacological products that target vasoregulation can hence improve the intrahepatic vascular resistance and this might prevent or reverse progression of NAFLD, representing an important therapeutic option to study. Some of the drugs currently under evaluation in clinical trials for NASH have interesting properties related to the hepatic vasculature. Some other interesting drugs have been tested in animal models but further study in patients with NAFLD is warranted. In summary, in this paper we summarise the evidence that leads to the hypothesis that an increased intrahepatic vascular resistance and subsequent parenchymal hypoxia in early NAFLD is an important pathophysiological driving mechanism for the progression of the disease."

Steroid combination with other immunosupressants is used in refractory cases. Steroids refractoriness has been observed in chronic cases. Some cases of RF represent a manifestation of the IgG4 related disease (IgG4-RD) that is associated to a dramatic response to steroid therapy. It is uncertain if RF́s treatment response differs according to its association with IgG4-RD. We hypothesize that RF́s treatment response to steroids depends on the association with IgG4-RD, thus, we collected and compared clinical data from 10 RF cases; 6 male, mean age 50.6 (±16.15 SD) years. Mean FU was 28 (±25.7 SD) months. According to IgG4 levels, patients were categorized as idiopathic RF (IRF n = 5) or RF-IgG4-RD (n = 5). Therapy response was categorized as complete, partial, stable disease, recurrence or non-response. Nine cases received initial therapy with prednisone; complete response was achieved in 4 RF-IgG4 RD. The remaining 5 cases (1 RF-IgG4RD and 4 IRF) underwent a 2nd line therapy; 4 prednisone + tamoxifen and 1 prednisone + azathioprine. Prednisone + tamoxifen combination achieved complete response in 1 case (RF-IgG4RD), partial response in 1 IRF; in 1 IRF case, disease remained stable and 1 did not respond. The prednisone + azathioprine treatment achieved complete response. At follow-up all patients remained stable and no recurrence was registered. These observations suggest and support the hypothesis that response to steroid monotherapy depends on the association of RF with IgG4, suggesting that IRF cases might benefit from initial combination therapies instead of steroid monotherapy."

In particular, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF) has become the center of concern in many laboratories. A deficiency in this growth factor, leading to insufficient neuron myelination and defective synapse function, appears to result in brain dysconnectivity during the first year of postpartum life, and cause social malfunction in childhood years and beyond. At least three approaches have been reported by which this deficiency can be corrected in neonates before irreversible damage has been caused. The overall purpose of this report is to bring together related observations and to evolve a coherent, plausible explanation of the cause and prevention of autism."

Animal studies provide strong evidence that the CNS directly regulates bone remodeling through the actions of the hypothalamus via two distinct pathways, the neural (mediated by leptin) arm and neurohumoral (mediated by neurohormones and growth factors) arm. The impact of AD on central regulatory mechanisms of bone mass is not known.
Objectives
To test a model that assesses the relationship between hypothalamic atrophy and bone loss in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and potential mediation through neural (leptin) and neurohumoral (insulin-like growth factor –1, IGF-1) mechanisms.
Hypotheses
AD-related hypothalamic structural change alters neural and neurohumoral regulatory systems of bone remodeling and contributes to bone loss in early AD.
Design
A secondary data analysis of data obtained in a two-year longitudinal study with path analysis and longitudinal mediation modeling.
Participants
The data were collected as a part of the University of Kansas Brain Aging Project, a two-year observational study of 71 older adults with early stage AD and 69 non-demented controls.
Measurements
Demographic characteristics and measures of bone density, body composition, and hypothalamic volume, serum levels of leptin, growth hormone, and IGF-1 were collected.
Results
Hypothalamic atrophy and bone loss were observed in AD group and were associated. Data modeling suggests that bone loss may precede measurable changes in the brain. Leptin increased over two years in AD and the increase in leptin was associated with hypothalamic atrophy. However, changes in leptin or IGF-1 levels did not mediate the relationship between hypothalamic atrophy and bone loss.
Conclusions
This study extends previous findings by suggesting that bone loss in AD may be related to neurodegenerative changes (atrophy) in the hypothalamus. Further studies are needed to explore the role of brain atrophy and mediating mechanisms in bone loss. Further exploring temporal relationship between bone loss and AD may have an important diagnostic value."

The antagonistic effect of two sets of muscles, one innervated by the trigeminal nerve, the other by the vagal nerve and cervical plexus, enables the body to modulate transmission of sound via this passageway and hence modulate the awareness of body sounds. Impairment of this system can be due to local factors, such as adhesions over the pharyngeal recess or inflammation inside the pharyngeal recess and/or Eustachian tube; or to tensions of the muscles involved, related to other causes. Dysfunction of the system can lead to symptoms related to increased or decreased awareness of body sounds, such as autophony, hearing of pulsating sounds and clicks in the ear; sensory symptoms related to increased activation of the nerves such as fullness feeling in the ear, facial pain, burning mouth syndrome, globus pharyngeus, pharyngeal pain; and symptoms related to inappropriate muscular contraction such as masticatory and cervical muscle tensions, bruxism, and tension type headache. The functioning of this acoustic passageway is related to the concept of the Trigeminocervical complex. The concept of Vagocervical complex is proposed."

In lupus nephritis, extracellular DNA accumulation from necrosis cells and activated cells is perceived as initial step of inflammation. The up-regulated type I IFN is one pivotal cytokine causing downstream inflammation enlargement. Currently, intracellular DNA sensor cGAS signaling has been found to be related to lupus nephritis and the aberrant up-regulation of type I IFN. However, how extracellular accumulated DNA activates intracellular cGAS is still unknown. It was reported that nuclear protein HMGB1 takes part in multiple autoimmune diseases and inflammation induction. When HMGB1 is secreted to extracellular environment under certain conditions, it combines with DNA and triggers IFN-I secretion. It has been reported that HMGB1 level in renal tissue and cGAS level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were both significantly up-regulated in SLE patients. Hence, we present a hypothesis that in lupus nephritis, the released HMGB1 helps extracellular accumulated DNA endocytosis and cGAS signaling pathway activation, followed by IFN-I secretion. We infer this is one pivotal pro-inflammation pathway in lupus nephritis progression."

Movement control was rated as at fault if they were unable to control specific trunk and pelvic movements during the tests. The Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) was used to assess symptoms. Following the intervention, observational rating during the SKB test improved from fault to no fault for anterior pelvic tilt, which decreased by 17° and 16° during right and left leg SKB tests respectively. The HAGOS symptoms subsection improved from 36% to 61%. Observational movement screening ratings were supported by 3-D motion analysis.

Of all of the methods used for the treatment of non-union, bone tissue bioengineering using scaffolds and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is the most widely studied and has emerged as a promising approach to address these challenges. However, there are several critical limitations, such as the low survival rate of MSCs under an inflammatory, ischemic environment. Accumulating studies have demonstrated that preosteoclasts not only play a role in the remodeling of the callus, but also participate in the entire process of fracture repair. The close crosstalk between preosteoclasts and MSCs stimulates the recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation of osteoblasts and improves the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. With no in vivo study reported thus far, we hypothesize that the administration of preosteoclasts together with MSCs at a certain ratio may effectively accelerate fracture healing and provide a new and promising therapeutic strategy for the clinical management of fracture non-union."

In the universe, which can be thought of as a closed system, heat transfer (dQ) is always positive and it leads to an increase in entropy (dS > 0). The positive dS leads to the generation of the irreversible arrow of time. Given that dS is constant, the time units have a similar direction and magnitude. In contrast to the universe, the brain is an open thermodynamic system which transfers heat to its surroundings. In this system, dQ and dS can become negative. This causes a reversible timing system and time units can be laid along different arrows and have different magnitudes. Theoretically, this mismatch can cause different timing in the brain and universe."

We propose that the experimental method is comparable to the conventional method in locating the sacral hiatus, which is crucial for a successful caudal block procedure. Anthropometric measurements and virtual comparative test between two methods were done on the 3D pelvis CT. In men, the distance from the CNP to the IP was 0.8 ± 0.5 cm in the conventional method group, while the distance from the ENP to the IP was 0.5 ± 0.4 cm in the experimental method group (p < 0.05). In women, the same distances were 1.5 ± 0.8 cm and 0.7 ± 0.3 cm, respectively (p < 0.05). In conclusion, finding a point of 6.5 cm from the coccyx tip in men and 6.0 cm in women could be an alternative way to find the sacral hiatus for blind caudal block."

This paper puts forward the hypothesis that the sequence of preferences for the three primary colours Red, Yellow and Blue could provide cues to the personality of an individual. The sequence of preferences will harbour hidden patterns or algorithms that are linked to personality traits. The fluctuations or volatility observed in these preferences carefully recorded over a large number of observations will throw up interesting patterns that can be linked to personality traits. The data from a number of subjects will be used to identify similarities in colour preference patterns that match with personality types that have been determined using standardised tools for identifying personality types. The protocols to be followed for testing the hypothesis have been detailed. Statistical analyses of the data sets are suggested. The subjects that will be studied will hopefully be a source of data that will lead to unveiling the complexities of various personality types and personality traits.

abstract = "All malignancies contain tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that facilitate cancer growth by secreting chemicals to elicit angiogenesis and shield the cancer from the immune system. The abundance of TAMs is a reflection of invasiveness and metastatic potential. TAMs will actively ingest ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles following intravenous administration and will store them as large lysosomal aggregates which can be imaged with MRI and ultrasound and visualized or quantitated in tissue biopsies. Since the USPIO also enhances regional lymph nodes, it is possible to include this information for more accurate cancer staging. The USPIO aggregates surprisingly also serve as heat sinks and can enhance hyperthermic regimens with focal laser, focused microwaves, or high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). The hyperthermic intervention can be chosen based upon accessibility for the selected energy source. By sustaining an intratumoral elevation of temperature for an effective period of time, ablation of a small or large fraction of the TAMs and cancer cells can be achieved. Thus, for aggressive cancer, USPIO is a theragnostic agent. Following USPIO-enhanced hyperthermia, the resulting debris will slowly reach the regional lymphatics and immune recognition may result. An effective vaccine or adjuvant could be injected peritumorally to improve immunorecognition of that patient’s cancer. The field of immunotherapy is being intensely explored at present. Using the theragnostic properties of USPIOs that are accumulated in the TAMs may prove useful in further attempts to make immunotherapy successful. This intervention could be utilized at any stage of cancer therapy. Should immunological recognition occur, an abscopal response may be achieved for that patient and for his/her cancer. This would truly be personalized cancer therapy."

Brain injury in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is common but under recognized and affects up to 54% of patients with this complication. It’s manifestations include cerebral oedema (CE) and cerebral infarction (CI). The etiology of CE in DKA has up to the present time been uncertain. Practical management had been guided by the assumption that rapid osmotic shifts due to rapid correction of hypovolemia and reduction of plasma glucose could cause a shift of water into the cells. The osmotic effect of glucose can cause inflammation by activation of inflammasomes. Recently it has been recognized that the body is in a pro-inflammatory state during DKA involving interleukin-1 production by inflammasomes. Interleukin-1 has been involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral oedema and CI.
Hypothesis
In diabetic ketoacidosis brain injury including cerebral oedema and infarction is caused by interleukin-1.
Confirmation of hypothesis and implications
Inflammasome activity could be quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in patients with and without clinical and/or subclinical CE and/or stroke or features of cerebral ischemia on MRI. Surrogates of brain injury in peripheral blood like neuron specific enolase could be measured and correlated with inflammasome activity. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonists and inflammasome inhibitors including telmisartan could be assessed in their effect on MRI changes consistent with CE or CI in patients with DKA in randomised placebo-controlled trials."

Fuzzy intelligent systems developed during 2007–2018 have been studied to explore various techniques applied for disease prediction. In the traditional approach, a physician is required to diagnose disease based on historical and clinical data but the intelligent system will help physicians as well as individuals to detect disease at any location of the world. The studies of various fuzzy logic systems and classified fuzzy logic applications in the field of diabetes, iris, heart, breast cancer, dental, cholera, brain tumor, liver, asthma, viral, parkinson, lung, kidney, huntington and chest diseases have been included in the review. This study indicates all the benefits of the fuzzy logic to the society and direction to tackle the diseases that still need software for their accurate detection.

We have shown the cultivation of social networks buffers against increases in diurnal cortisol common in old age. Cortisol is crucial for the response to stress and the process of ageing, and a recent study has demonstrated that a lower cortisol level is associated with longevity. We link the findings of social network cultivation and cortisol profile to the processes of biological ageing through DNA telomere length. Telomeres are repeated DNA sequences that cap and protect the ends of chromosomes, and telomere length is considered a potential biomarker for biological age because it is closely related to the cellular process of ageing and chronic stress and is inversely related to chronological age. Studies examining biological ageing have shown an association between an altered cortisol profile and telomere length dynamics. Together, these findings on social networks, cortisol profiles and telomere length suggest that seniors who are motivated to maintain social ties are biologically younger. We therefore propose the ‘rejuvenation hypothesis’, which posits that seniors with a stronger motivation for social network cultivation are biologically younger, as measured by cortisol levels and telomere length, than their peers who are less motivated to pursue social relationships. This idea suggests a new perspective and potentially fruitful direction for geriatric research. The focus on social network cultivation adds an important psychosocial dimension to rejuvenation therapies that so far have been dominated by biomedical approaches. The rejuvenation hypothesis also has important implications for social policy by supporting the viability of promoting network cultivation among the elderly to facilitate healthy ageing."

abstract = "Intracellular ferritin is known to store iron, an essential element in an array of physiological processes. But what purpose does serum ferritin serve, what controls ultra-high hyperferritinaemia (ferritin levels above 4000 ng/ml), and finally why is it raised in inflammatory diseases, the most impressive being haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis? This paper proposes a hypothesis and model to explain the above questions. Serum ferritin has some unfamiliar physiological properties. It dampens severe inflammation by inhibiting lymphocyte activity, hinders bacterial growth by acting as an iron chelator and slows malignant growth by having an antiangiogenic effect. Therefore, serum ferritin is effective at modulating many conditions and could be a desired physiological process in malignancy or infection. The proposed theory is that phagocytic cells fuse with pathological native cells in much the same way as macrophages do when forming multinucleated giant cells. The pathological cells can be “infected” by intracellular pathogens or the malignant phenotype. These fusion cells result in a massive upregulation of exclusive features of macrophage activity such as phagocytosis, iron metabolism and ferritin release. Dysfunctional mitochondria are critical to this process, Pathological cells that contain dysfunctional mitochondria “infect” phagocytic mitochondrial following cellular fusion, resulting in ferritin release. The key evidence suporting this idea: macrophages are the source of ferritin secretion; they have intimate contact with known triggers of HLH, allowing for fusion hybrids, and they commonly fuse with cells. It is also argued that exclusively intracellular pathologies trigger HLH, which is a requirement for this model. HLH has features of a mitochondriopathy and finally it is debated that all the defective genes known to trigger familial-HLH can increase the likelihood of macrophage fusion. If this hypothesis is correct, the implications might discover novel diagnostic tools to detect HLH and point to avenues of targeted therapy. This is a bold theory with interesting perspectives on cell biology and clinical medicine. The paper discusses the evidence and challenges of this proposed mechanism in describing hyperferritinaemia and its relation to HLH."

Intra-muscular injections of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) have become popular for the treatment of spastic muscle contractures but unfortunately its use has not resulted in long-term functional benefits and, paradoxically, has been associated with a persistent loss of contractile material. Recent biomechanical work has shown that the stiffness of the CP muscle increases in proportion to total collagen content within the perimysial extra-cellular matrix. Thus, rather than the use of tone-reducing agents, we hypothesize that the focal use of a selective collagenase, injected into spastic muscle at an appropriate dilution and concentration, may serve to reduce the extent of muscle contracture, improving clinical range of motion and perhaps sarcomere length."

We report the result of a retrospective study identifying seventeen subjects from Thomas Jefferson University (1999–2014) with biopsy-proven nodular glomerulosclerosis but no pre-existing history of DM. The main indications for percutaneous kidney biopsy (PKB) were either reduced renal function or the presence of proteinuria.

Further, it is known that there is a high frequency of co-occurrence of DTC and breast cancer. Although the underlying mechanisms that contribute to these phenomena are not entirely clear, 2 hypotheses are proposed here. First, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) produced by the placenta may be involved, since hCG has a similar function to stimulate the thyroid as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), the latter of which is known to play a role in causing DTC and may promote breast cancer through the secretion of thyroid hormones (THs). Second, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is stimulated by suckling in the puerperal period, induces the secretion of not only TSH and thus indirectly THs, but also prolactin (PRL), which can accelerate the development of breast cancer. These hypotheses also explain the pregnancy-associated transient increase in breast cancer risk, while inhibition of estrogen by PRL may have a long-term preventive effect on breast cancer. Pregnancy-associated hyperthyroidism may also account for female preponderance of thyroid disease in general as well as tumors in organs that the thyroid hormone targets such as cardiac myxoma and diffuse-type gastric carcinoma."

The age of the donor of a blood transfusion could affect recovery following a major traumatic insult and help avoid postinjury immune paralysis and its associated complications. The frequent transfusion of blood components to the severely injured trauma patient provides an opportunity for the recipient to benefit from the potentially favourable effect of blood originating from young donors. Different types of evidence support the presented hypothesis including work on soluble circulating factors, research on animal parabiontic models and epidemiological studies. Theories on the role of transfusion of cells, on bone marrow and on senolytics also represent grounds to elaborate pathways to test this hypothesis. The precise molecular mechanism underlying this hypothesis is uncertain. A beneficial effect on trauma patients following transfusion of blood could be due to a positive effect of blood donated from younger donors or instead to the lack of a negative effect possibly occurring when transfusing blood from older donors. Either way, identifying this mechanism would provide a powerful tool enhance long and short term recovery after trauma."

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are a population of adult stem cells with multipotential differentiation capability, low immunogenicity, and immunoregulatory effects. The unique immunoregulatory properties of BMSCs make them hold great promise in the treatment of chronic inflammation and immune disorders through a paracrine mechanism of anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects. The stem cell secretome is defined as the set of molecules secreted to the extracellular space. The secretome such as conditioned media (CM) obtained from BMSCs contains various bioactive molecules and vesicular elements, which may act as therapeutic mediators to support their immunoregulatory effects.

Intensive study on pathogenesis of colon cancer has been made to decipher the mechanisms underlying the development and progress of the disease so as to develop effective treatment. However, a complete therapeutic regimen is still not available for combating this deadly disease. Hurdles faced by chemotherapy include drug resistance due to P-glycoprotein transporters, untoward effects on normal cells, high cost, bio-burden of the therapy, and the most dreadful drawback is cancer relapse. The concept of cancer relapse is related to development of oxidative stress that causes cell apoptosis. If the level of oxidative stress is inadequate to cause apoptosis then it leads to cell dormancy which may revive post chemotherapy. This hypothesis aims to put forward a combinatorial approach that includes utilizing a cost effective, biocompatible and environmentally benign nanoparticulate carrier made up of lignin, loaded with anti-cancer agent and P-gp modulator, and functionalized with ligand for CD44 receptors that are over expressed on cancer cells. Antioxidant effect of lignin will overcome dormancy of cancer cells making it possible for cell cycle specific drugs to kill them and prevent relapse and active targeting will prevent untoward effects on normal cells. Thus a robust and wholesome formulation can be developed to combat colon cancer."

We demonstrate, in all six CCD cases, a significantly lower contribution of the intracellular compartment to the cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to supratentorial pathology (p < 0.01).

Our findings are consistent with a decreased intracellular fraction, presumably a surrogate for reduced cellular density in corticopontocerebellar degeneration, despite normal-appearing scans. Our approach allows detection of subthreshold structural changes and offers the additional advantage of applicability to most clinical cases, where only three DWI beta values are available."

We therefore follow a careful and well-structured decision making process. After referral of the patient with the request to amputate the affected limb, it is checked if the diagnosis CRPS-I is correct, duration of complaints is more than 1 year, all treatments described in the Dutch guidelines have been tried and if consequences of an amputation have been well considered by the patient. Thereafter the patient is assessed by a multidisciplinary team (psychologist, physical therapist, anesthesiologist-pain specialist, physiatrist and vascular surgeon). During a multidisciplinary meeting professionals summarize their assessment. Pros and cons of an amputation are discussed, taking into account level of amputation and expectations about post amputation functioning of patient and team. Based on assessments and discussion a consensus based decision is formulated and the patient is informed. If it is decided that an amputation is to be performed, the amputation will follow shortly. If it is decided not to amputate, the decision is extensively explained to the patient. Incidence of patients suffering from therapy resistant CRPS-I referred for amputation is low and because referred patients are strongly in favor of an amputation, a randomized controlled trial will be difficult to perform. Hence level of evidence in favor or against an amputation will remain low. We therefore report our decision making process to facilitate discussion about this difficult and delicate matter."

abstract = "Hypopituitarism diagnosed months or years following concussive injury can cause a variety of endocrine disturbances including insufficient secretion of human growth, luteinizing, follicle stimulating, thyroid stimulating, adrenocorticotrophic, and antidiuretic hormones. Recent evidence suggests that autoimmune reactions against pituitary and/or hypothalamic tissue constitute an etiologic factor for this hypopituitarism. One important trigger for autoimmunity is hypoxic stress. This trigger may be especially important in the post-concussive brain, which is particularly vulnerable to hypoxic stress. The vulnerable vasculature of the hypothalamic infundibulum can be a source of local exacerbation of any systemic hypoxia. Taking the above into account, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that hypoxic stress is a risk factor for post-concussive hypopituitarism. Following a discussion of literature relevant to this hypothesis, we suggest retrospective and prospective research methods for testing the hypothesis. Retrospective methods for hypothesis testing include comparing post-concussion victims with and without evidence of hypopituitarism in terms of their history of respiratory problems such as smoking, exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and opioid use or abuse. Significantly greater incidence of respiratory history among the hypopituitarism patients would support the hypothesis. Prospective methods include performing detailed respiratory history and examination immediately post-injury, then performing periodic endocrine panels to detect hypopituitarism during long-term follow up. The hypothesis will be supported if development of hypopituitarism among patients with positive respiratory history or examination findings post-injury is more frequent than hypopituitarism among concussion victims with negative respiratory history and exam findings. If the hypothesis is supported, effective prevention of post-concussive hypopituitarism should include efforts to support optimal respiratory function. Such efforts may be relevant to treatment as well. These efforts would include respiratory therapy, smoking cessation, treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, prudent stepping down of opioid use, incentive spirometry, aerobic exercise, and other conventional measures as indicated. Non-Western measures such as yoga should be considered as well. In addition, chiropractic care as an intervention that may ameliorate hypoxia at the systemic and local levels is discussed."

abstract = "Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a promising safe anticancer drug that cured a patient with chemoresistant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and treated lactic acidosis effectively. The well-known mechanism of DCA action is through stimulating Krebs cycle (stimulating pyruvate dehydrogenase via inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase). This prevents lactate formation (Warburg effect) depriving cancer cells of lactate-based benefits e.g. angiogenesis, chemoresistance and radioresistance. Here, we introduce novel evidence-based hypotheses to explain DCA-induced anticancer effects. On pharmacological and biochemical bases, we hypothesize that DCA is a structural antagonist of acetate competing with it for target enzymes and biological reactions. We hypothesize that DCA exerts its anticancer effects via depriving cancer of acetate benefits. We hypothesize also that acetate is an antidote of DCA capable of treating DCA toxicity. Many reports support our hypotheses. Acetate is vital for cancer cells (tumors depend on acetate) and DCA is structurally similar to acetate. DCA exerts opposite effects to acetate. Acetate caused a decrease in serum potassium, phosphorus and glucose, and an increase in serum lactate, citrate, free fatty acids and ketone bodies (serum acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels). Acetate decreased the proportion of active (dephosphorylated) pyruvate dehydrogenase in perfused rat heart. DCA produced quite opposite effects. Intravenous infusion of acetate produced metabolic alkalemia while DCA caused minimal effects on acid-base status. Acetate is important for cancer cells metabolism and survival as elevated acetate can drive resistance to targeted cancer treatments. Acetate is required for epidermal growth factor receptor vIII mutation in lethal brain tumors. Experimentally, DCA inhibited acetate oxidation in hearts of normal rats and reversed inhibitory effects of acetate on the oxidation of glucose. During presence of DCA with no glucose in heart perfusions with [1-14C]acetate, DCA decreased the specific radioactivity of acetyl CoA and its product citrate. This proves our hypotheses that DCA is an antimetabolite that antagonizes acetate for vital reactions in cancer cells. Acetate may be used as an antidote to combat DCA toxicity."

These compounds change the hormone homeostasis of the target organs regulated by those hormones, mostly by binding to their receptors and affecting their signaling pathways. Among the hormones altered by endocrine disruptors are sex hormones, thyroid hormones, and insulin. Studies have documented abnormalities in the reproductive and metabolic systems of various animal species exposed to endocrine disruptors. Endocrine disruptors can play a significant role in ocular diseases once hormone deficiency or excess are involved in the mechanism of that disease. Cataracts, dry eye disease and retinal diseases, such as macular hole and diabetic retinopathy, are some of the frequent problems where hormones have been implicated. We found that some compounds function as endocrine disruptors in the metabolism of body organs and systems. The increasing frequency of dry eye and other ocular diseases indicates the need to better investigate the potential relationships beyond the isolated associations mentioned by patients and documented as rare case reports. The evidence from case-control studies and experimental assays can provide the information necessary to confirm the endocrine effects of these chemicals in the pathophysiology of dry eye disease. We hypothesize that endocrine disruptors may contribute to the increase of ocular diseases, such as dry eye disease, in recent years."

abstract = "The prevalence of adult and childhood obesity are increasing. Most of the human newborn’s body fat accumulates in the last half of intrauterine life. Fat in the fetus was thought to be mostly synthesized from glucose, but now it is commonly accepted that the bulk of it is the product of placental transfer of maternal fatty acids. Transported fatty acids originate in maternal plasma “free” fatty acids, fatty acids hydrolyzed from maternal plasma triglycerides, and the poly-unsaturated fatty acid component of maternal phospholipids. Glucose remains an important precursor of alpha-glycerol phosphate, to which most transported fatty acids are eventually esterified. Maternal plasma lipids are elevated in late pregnancy and even more in obese and diabetic pregnant women. This accelerates the placental transport of fatty acids. The hypothesis presented in this paper rests on the observations that the exponential increase in fat tissue in the human embryo’s body occurs in time to parallel the increase of lipids in the mother’s blood and depends on the chemical affinity of the transcription factor PPAR gamma to fatty acids and on fatty acid stimulation of adipocyte generation from precursor cells. The hypothesis asserts that transported maternal fatty acids activate the transcription factors in the fetus and initiate conversion of the mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes. In obese and diabetic mothers, the higher plasma lipids facilitate increased placental fatty acid transfer. This will increase adipocyte generation and, through this, the prevalence of babies with increased fat cell size and number. Babies born with increased adipose tissue cellularity will have greater probability of growing up to become obese adolescents and adults. These newborns, whose obesity is hyperplastic as well as hypertrophic, as adults will have difficulty losing weight through diet and exercise or will regain the lost weight more quickly than others without these characteristics. Accordingly, increased placental fatty acid transfer and accelerated adipocyte generation may explain not only neonatal obesity, but some aspects of the adult obesity epidemic also. It is therefore recommended that prevention of fetal fat cell hyperplasia, by lowering maternal plasma lipids in mid and late pregnancy, should be attempted in pregnancies at risk for macrosomia."

Despite holding a wide range of ammunition in our arsenal to ameliorate such conditions, we are still facing with many stumbling blocks in the satisfactory pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular diseases among which the risk of hemorrhage and life threatening drug interactions can be highlighted. Our hypothesis focuses on mimicking the nature of platelet activation, to design a novel targeted delivery system based on the alterations of a physical parameter, the hemodynamic shear stress, to aim at the offending thrombi in an attempt to offer a noninvasive, rapid, and monitoring-free method that not only can prolong the circulation time of the cargo, but also deliver it locally and reduce both the undesirable adverse effects and drug interactions. Brij52 is our chosen candidate due to its unique non-spherical morphology after forming a niosomal vesicle. We surmised that thanks to its non-spherical shape, diverse shear rates may generate different shear stresses to its equators and axes which might result in the breakdown or at least distortion of niosomal structure under elevated shear stress. The vesicles have to be synthesized in the size of platelets or in the nano-sized scale. In order to prolong the time vesicles are circulating in the blood, PEGylation may help and to make such carriers highly selective to be only activated during pathophysiological clot formation, attachment of domain A1 von Willebrand factor can be of benefit to lead this proposed delivery system to the site of thrombus formation where shear rate exceeds those of 1000 s−1. There is now an emerging fast growing universal research on shear activated carriers, and the present theory is an endeavor to reach a successful treatment strategy to combat cardiovascular diseases based on the hypothesis that a non-spherical nano-carrier such as Brij 52 niosomal vesicle can be of paramount benefit to deliver current antithrombotic agents in a targeted and controlled manner in the presence of elevated shear stress of the obstructed blood vessels. With more radical advanced drug delivery systems being developed and new strategies being pursued, there will be more options in our arsenal to represent a promising avenue for achieving preventive, well-tolerated, and intelligent drug carriers to circumvent the drawbacks of antithrombotic pharmacotherapy."

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) represents the gold standard for preventing strokes of carotid origin. However, neuronal damage caused by ischemia and/or reperfusion may contribute to a poor clinical outcome after CEA. In response to shear stress caused by hypoxic-ischemic conditions in patients undergoing CEA, stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis leads to biological responses known as hypermetabolic stress, characterized by hemodynamic, metabolic, inflammatory and immunological changes. These changes maintain homeostasis and assist recovery, but an unregulated inflammatory response could lead to further tissue damage and death of neurons. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule involved in several physiological and pathological processes, including ABI. However, an excess of NO could have detrimental effects. We hypothesized that the hypoxic-ischemic state induced by carotid clamping leads to overexpression of inducible NO synthase and that uncontrolled production of NO could adversely affect outcome after CEA."

The medical literature from 1557 onwards, especially treatises on teratology, body asymmetry, and books of normal and pathologic anatomy, was searched for any mentioning of lateral body asymmetry, macroglossia and other possible visually detectable symptoms associated with the above-mentioned syndromes. The results indicate that lateral body asymmetry was not described before the first half of the 19th century, it was mentioned in the 1820s, and the first description of a true case was published in 1850. All first cases of hemihyperplasia were reported in continental Europe. Historical data suggest that the 11p15.5 chromosomal region became unstable in the first half of the 19th century. Our preliminary hypothesis is that de novo mutation occurred in continental Europe. Additional genetic research is needed to investigate the development of 11p15.5 instability during this period."

abstract = "The direct or indirect experience of crime can cause individuals to feel vengeful against the perpetrator(s). The prison system reflects this sentiment by creating austere environments that are dehumanizing, punitive, and hopeless. Prisons are, therefore, environments in which retribution and punishment take priority over rehabilitation. Frequently, prisoners are believed to be untreatable because of their antisocial orientation. However, several factors influence an antisocial orientation such as socioeconomic status, family of origin, and mental health. The ubiquitous nothing works misbelief has resulted in prisoner marginalization and increased recidivism because of insufficient treatment. In 2015, 10 million individuals were incarcerated worldwide with around 30 million circulating through prisons each year. The prison environment decreases prisoner life expectancy and overall health. Sadly, prisoner benefits from treatment post-incarceration dissipate after 3–6 months and many prisoners die by suicide or drug overdose. Prison overpopulation, as well as poor outcome post-incarceration, requires more effective treatment. We hypothesize that Prisoner Exposure to Nature (PEN) can transform prisons into environments that are conducive to maintaining and improving physical and mental health. In prior work we proposed the continuum Nature Exposure Sufficiency (NES) versus Nature Exposure Insufficiency (NEI). Prisons are impoverished environments that limit Nature Exposure (NE) which results in NEI. Individuals experience fluctuations in mental and physical health as a result of NEI. Numerous studies have shown that direct and indirect NE can improve mood, physical health, and facilitate connectivity with self and society. It is necessary to consider ways in which we can incorporate NE for prisoner wellbeing. Additionally, it is crucial that prison personnel and prisoners develop a therapeutic/helping relationship (i.e., alliance) that is facilitated by friendliness and warmth to foster social change and citizenship. Many prisoners experience isolation and disconnection with society upon reentry. Given that most prisoners are eventually released into the community, we are obligated not to make them worse. Hence, it is important that prisons create programs that develop citizenship to engender prisoner volition to become positive and active citizens. We focus on the prison and prisoners, however our work is relevant to all total institutions (e.g., mental hospitals, nursing homes, schools, etc.). The prison system favors punishment and mass incarceration over treatment and decarceration. The deleterious effects of incarceration are clear and it is time to implement treatments based on the principles of PEN to improve prisoner wellbeing and citizenship."

Pascal neglected social interactions; he was cold and aloof and had an obsessive revulsion to any expression of emotional attachment. As shown by his funerary mask and the autopsy report Pascal had craniosynostosis (primary nonsyndromic oxycephaly) with atrophy of the right half of the face. Congenital facial asymmetry due to craniosynostosis has a genetic basis. This suggests that Pascal’s facial deformity may betray his propensity to suffer from genetically determined diseases including ASD. Despite the intrinsic limitations of a diagnosis based only on biographical information, we surmise that Pascal had the three key symptoms (obsessive interests, difficulty in social relationship and problems in communicating) that characterize ASD individuals."

Data relevant to a prime disease entity within each of the two allegedly autoimmune disease, Crohn’s disease and Type 1 diabetes mellitus, refute the claim of autoimmunity.

This cancer cell life cycle has multiple similarities with the life cycle of lower eukaryotes (protists) substantiating the atavistic theory of cancer. The primitive cancer life cycle contains several cell types including primary cancer stem cells, somatic cells, as well as reproductive cells, that differentiate new atavistic cyst like structures (aCLSs, PGCCs). Accordingly, cancer stem cells are not transformed normal stem cells (hSCs). Similarities between CSCs and normal hSCs arise from the evolutionary common origin of primitive eukaryotes and more highly evolved eukaryotic cells (stemness evolution). The cell of origin of cancer, as postulated here is a deregulated human cell that has lost, not only relevant control mechanisms and mitotic capacity, but also its normal human p53 network becoming useless for the atavistic life cycle. We believe that this protoprecursor of cancer reactivates an ancient primitive TP53 network originating from the common eukaryotic ancestor. This atavistic p53 helpes to repair genotoxic DNA damages of reproductive cancer cells including CSCs but not DNA damages of somatic cancer cells exposed to genotoxic stress."

Very limited literature on instances of clinical lycanthropy or violent/manic/madness behaviour in association with the Moon may be due to very rare lycanthropic psychosis and not knowing which signal(s) could determine Moon-mood associations. Mechanistically, lunar effects related to bipolar disorder, mood changes, and psychosis could involve either, or a combination, of the following: (i) some as of yet non-measurable signal or undefined geoelectric/geomagnetic receptor or higher sensitivity in some humans, (ii) Moonlight affecting sleep and/or circadian rhythm, (iii) perinatal imprinting of susceptibility, (iv) lunar-periodic growth, and subsequent consumption, of or exposure to psychotropic agents. Importantly, remarkable recent studies (2018) suggest that links between some Moon cycles and bipolar disorder are conceivable. Further observations suggest a role for periodic changes in lunar distances in combination with the Earth and Sun positions. Targeted research could use insight from astrophysicists. If causal links between Moon signals and mood were corroborated, sufferers may benefit from improved disease understanding. Herein, we systematically review the literature and synthesize the evidence for and against the hypothesis. The werewolf myth could become another instance of folklore popularizing biological variation worthy of investigation such as the book characters created by the psychiatrist Hoffmann in 1845 as a Christmas present for his son; namely, ‘Struwelpeter’ and ‘Zappel-Philipp’ (shock-headed Peter and fidgety-Philipp): Their conspicuous characteristics have since been linked to genetic uncombable hair syndrome and ADHD, respectively. Overall, rather than dismissing (seemingly) trivial and uncertain concepts as ‘just folklore’, scientists should grapple with the roots, causes, and significance of traditions and tales, including the werewolf legend."

abstract = "Over the last few decades there has been a significant worldwide increase in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the causes of which are unknown. The biggest environmental change over this decade has been the massive introduction of cellphones. Eye contact is fundamental for infants' development, and parent-infant eye contact is impaired when parents are pre occupied by cellphones. We speculate that children with a pre-existing vulnerability to autism may be adversely affected by this pattern of parental behavior. As a first step toward exploring our hypothesis, we wished to document the extent of cellular phone usage by parents during their child's diagnostic developmental assessment. We speculated that, if under these stressful circumstances of awaiting their child's crucial assessment the parent is not fully engaged with his/her child, then in real daily activities this phenomenon is likely much more pronounced. Of 111 developmental sessions, 73 parents (66%) engaged their phone during the assessment, between 1 and 20 times. Of 62 observations in the waiting room, 52 (83.9%) parents used their phone, 1–19 times. Nine parents (17.3%) used their phone for 10–50% of the time and 16 (30.8%) for more than 50% of the time in the waiting room. In our analysis, the rate of language/motor delays was twice more common among children of cell phone users than among non users (p = 0.04) as an initial support of our hypothesis. Parents' focus and full attention toward their cellphones can adversely affect the development of joint attention in infants and may contribute to the development of autistic features among a vulnerable subgroup of infants. While more research is needed to prove causation, it would be reasonable to advise parents to decrease to minimum the usage of cellphones when interacting with their young children."

There are multiple causes of urolithiasis, including urinary tract infection (UTI). Infection stones (mainly composed of struvite) are associated with renal infections by urease-producing bacteria. However, there is limited knowledge about the role of UTIs in the formation of stones that are apparently not related with infection. We hypothesize that UTIs promote the formation of certain urolithiasis that appear to be non-infection stones. Some recent studies have reported the presence of bacterial growth in cultures of stones removed by endourological procedures. These findings have led to the hypothesis that UTIs have a role in the formation of stones that are apparently non-infection stones. It is unknown whether these UTIs promoted stone formation, or if the stones became infected after formation. Several in vitro studies and ultrastructural microscopic analyses of urolithiasis are consistent with our hypothesis. If our hypothesis is correct, it could have a great impact on the treatment of urolithiasis. Especially, early identification and treatment of renal infections could help to prevent septic events, which are frequently life-threatening. It could also help to reduce the recurrence of urolithiasis, and thereby reduce health care costs. In conclusion, some evidence suggests that UTIs have a role in the formation of some apparently non-infection urolithiasis. If this is so, it could have a great impact on the treatment and prevention of this disease."

Darlington et al. have demonstrated a decrease in the ratio of plasma 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid to anthranilic acid ([3-HAA]/[AA]) in many inflammatory conditions and proposed that this decrease either reflects inflammatory disease or is an antiinflammatory response. I argue in favour of the latter possibility and provide evidence that KA is responsible for the decrease in this ratio by increasing AA formation from Kyn through activation of the kynureninase reaction. Immunosuppression has been attributed to some Kyn metabolites tested at concentrations far greater than could occur in microenvironments. So far, only QA has been shown using immunohistochemistry to reach immunosuppressive levels. Future immune studies of the KP should focus on QA as the potentially main microenvironmentally measurable immunosuppressant and should include KA as an antiinflammatory metabolite."

Two possible mechanisms through which chemotherapy induces CIA have been identified: systemic endothelial dysfunction, resulting in decreased blood flow to the ovaries, and increased oxidative stress within the ovaries, both of which are proposed to lead to apoptosis of follicles. Endothelial dysfunction in ovarian arteries in women undergoing or who have undergone chemotherapy treatment is characterized by prothrombotic changes and thickening of the vascular wall. These changes result in occlusion of the blood vessels. Oxidative stress is increased and antioxidants decreased in the ovaries secondary to chemotherapy drugs, specifically cyclophosphamide. It is hypothesized that low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise during chemotherapy may prevent these changes and lessen the risk for developing CIA in premenopausal women. Low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise has been shown to improve endothelial function and blood flow in patients with cardiovascular disease—a disease state characterized by endothelial dysfunction and for which patients who have undergone chemotherapy are at increased risk. In mice, moderate intensity aerobic exercise has been shown to decrease the amount of oxidative stress within the ovaries, and in humans, chronic aerobic exercise has been shown to increase antioxidant production systemically. This hypothesis should be tested in both a mouse model, using sedentary and exercising mice treated with chemotherapy drugs that commonly result in CIA, as well as a human model to determine the effects of low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise on ovarian function in premenopausal women undergoing chemotherapy."

Acute inflammation of the vasculature, genetic susceptibility and immunopathogenesis based on a transmittable and infectious origin, are the pathologic events involved in the early inflammatory etiology and progression of this disease. However, the exact causes of KD remain unknown. Current proposed recommendations include three therapy lines; firstly, an initial standard therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) followed by aspirin. Secondly, in cases of high risk of coronary lesions, the adjunctive therapy with corticosteroid is commonly considered. Thirdly, in KD patients refractory to the previous therapies, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) antagonists are being used to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines. In view of this status quo, our starting hypothesis is that the ubiquitous and non-toxic neurohormone melatonin could be of critical importance in developing novel adjuvant therapies against KD, as it occurs with a plethora of other diseases. Considering its pleiotropic properties, particularly its antiinflammatory and immunoregulatory capacities, melatonin should be of great therapeutic interest for helping to control the main pathologic features of KD patients. In addition, this multifunctional indole has a safe pharmacological profile, enhancing the therapeutic activity of several drugs and reducing their possible side effects. Consequently, melatonińs actions to manage KD need to be tested in further clinical studies."

abstract = "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is distinctive for its strikingly high correlation with the diet. Heme-iron from red and processed meat was found to strongly increase the risk of CRC, yet only 20% of the total dietary iron is heme-iron. However, the results are still inconclusive in terms of the total dietary iron and CRC risk. On the other hand, vitamin B12 has been proposed as cytoprotector, and iron and vitamin B12 share their dietary sources. Meat and animal-derived products are the only foods that naturally provide vitamin B12. While iron is abundant in a variety of foods, its bioavailability (i.e. utilization) is the highest from meat and animal foods. We hypothesize that specific combinations of foods of animal origin could alter the risk of CRC, and even modulate the progression of CRC, by simultaneously altering iron and vitamin B12. All cells are iron dependent but iron’s metabolism is one of the most complex, and tightly regulated. No nutrient has so many dietary factors that inhibit its bioavailability which results in almost 80% of all dietary iron ending in the feces, which is 10-fold higher than in most tissues. Luminal exposure to iron, which was found to affect crypt fission and increases the risk of CRC, is influenced by colonic transit time, the composition of feces, and the pH in the large bowel. Therefore, “inactivating” iron in the feces by specific dietary inhibitors disables adverse alterations during the luminal exposure. Only one inhibitor has the ability to bind both forms of iron, heme and non-heme to insoluble complexes, calcium. Milk and dairy as the best dietary sources of calcium contain vitamin B12 of the highest bioavailability. While calcium (both dietary and supplemental) has been studied separately on the risk of CRC, it has not been considered from the aspect of iron bioavailability or supplying vitamin B12. Preliminary, the hypothesis was tested on the diet quality assessment in adults from two Croatia’s regions with distinctive dietary characteristics and CRC risk. Diet in the first region is considered to increase the risk of CRC (e.g. high intake of red and processed meat), while a traditional Mediterranean pattern prevails in the second region. However, CRC incidence rate is higher in the second region. Comparison of the regions showed that in the first region adults have significantly higher intake of vitamin B12, and as expected, the highest contribution is from meat. Still, the contribution of milk and dairy is significantly higher in the first than in the second region. These results suggest that high intake of vitamin B12 could have a protective role on CRC, when dietary intake of meat is high. Therefore, by specifically designing a diet to combine dietary sources with high content of both iron and vitamin B12 could result with a cumulative effect: the cytoprotective effect of vitamin B12, and diminished negative effect of high iron content in the feces. Clarifying the relevance of various dietary sources of iron from the aspect of high vitamin B12 content might provide answers we are still missing in the CRC."

There is an emerging evidence base to suggest that all DUs in SSc could share an ischaemic component which is potentially responsive to vascular therapy. Our hypothesis is that is that DUs occurring at sites other than the fingertips, in particular, those overlying the extensor aspect of the hands, may also have a potentially reversible ischaemic component. We review the evidence under the headings: ‘microvascular imaging’, ‘structural microvascular’ and, ‘functional vascular disease’, ‘macrovascular involvement’ and ‘vascular associates’. Based upon the current evidence, we would encourage the expert SSc community to reconsider the rationale for including only fingertip DUs in future SSc clinical trials, and suggest an agenda for future research."

Milestone studies showed that ultrasound (US) was an effective primary screening test for breast cancer both in the western world and in China. US improves the sensitivity of screening in Chinese women who have denser breasts and develop breast cancer earlier than Caucasian counterparts, and is used as the primary imaging test in the hospital-based opportunistic screening among asymptomatic self-referred women. Our previous work showed that US result might further differentiate the MG-detected breast cancers into low risk (US+) and ultra-low risk (US−). Indeed, most of the MG+/US− breast cancers would be ultra-low risk cancers and almost always present as MG micro-calcifications. Furthermore, majority of the commonest MG+/US− abnormal finding of micro-calcification is usually benign. Biopsy of benign breast disease increases not only the risk of breast cancer, but the expenses of screening and healthcare. Our hypothesis proposes that mammography-positive ultrasound-negative (MG+/US−) asymptomatic micro-calcifications might not need immediate invasive procedures and be safe to observe until the micro-calcifications increase significantly or become US-positive. If this hypothesis is proved, US would serve as the primary imaging test for breast cancer screening in China, with MG as the selective screening test and diagnostic tool for surgical plan. Unnecessary biopsy or surgery might be avoided with screening expenses considerably decrease."

For many years vitamin D has been considered crucial in the treatment and prevention of the Global Burden of Disease and in a reduction in mortality among elder people. Many health care providers prescribe these supplements in the management of osteoporosis and metabolic bone diseases; specifically in the primary prevention of fractures. Recently medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) has been reported as severe late sequelae of antiresorptive therapies (i.e., bisphosphonates and some monoclonal antibodies). Although MRONJ-related pathophysiology is not fully understood, there are three fundamental theories to explain it: (1) the inhibition of osteoclasts, (2) the inhibition of angiogenesis and (3) the processes of inflammation-infection. Recent advances in Vitamin D research have shown that this secosteroid can play a potential pivotal role in many of the different etiological pathways of MRONJ. Furthermore, there are a large number of co-morbidities between the deficit of this vitamin and other MRONJ concomitant outcomes. Our hypothesis argues that the low-risk and low-cost vitamin D dietary supplementation may prove to be suitable for use as a practical MRONJ prevention strategy. The described framework gives more insight into the study of disease mechanisms, search of potential biomarkers, and therapeutic targets in MRONJ."

We note the possible vital roles of hyperthermia, stress and steroid hormones during estrus that could positively regulate the expression of HSPs.

By means of thermography, an image acquisition technique that allows the recording of the heat emitted by objects or bodies, news insight can be obtained insights about the evaluation and follow-up of this disease. Actually, musculoskeletal disorders are a major cause of counseling and access to rehabilitation services and are some of the most important problems that affect the quality of life of many people. There are urgent both clinical and research needs for the assessment and follow-up of patients with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and the thermography is a rapid, non-invasive, easy to use and objective technique that analyzes the temperature of the examined tissue.
Hypothesis
The main aim is to offer a new possible hypothesis of validating the thermography techniques that support the evaluation and clinical follow-up of the Emery-Dreifuss dystrophy. To carry out this work we rely on the evidence of the existing bibliography. To perform this work and to evaluate the current situation on this topic, a systematic review was carried and after the application of an automatic and manual filter, inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 0 articles was obtained. Unfortunately, there is a lack of articles that relate the use of thermography in the Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Due to the absence of information, we have expanded the search to articles concerning the use of thermography in relation to alterations of the musculoskeletal system compatible with those of Emery-Dreifuss, genetic diseases related to the X chromosome and more generally muscular atrophy. Based on other studies and results carried out in diseases that show signs and symptoms similar to Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy, we believe that a new line of translational research could be opened with novel findings and we think that thermography could be an optimal tool for the clinical monitoring of this pathology. We believe that it would be of a great importance to carry out an observational study, to lay the foundations for future works, that relate thermography to the Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophies."

However, various studies, ours included, show that the use of intermittent challenges with hormetic effects improve subjective and objective wellbeing of individuals with CNCD, while having favourable effects on immunological, metabolic and behavioural indices. Intermittent cold, heat, fasting and hypoxia, together with phytochemicals in multiple food products, have widespread influence on many pathways related with overall health. Until recently, most of the employed challenges with hormetic effects belonged to the usual transient live experiences of our ancestors. Our hypothesis; we conclude that, whereas the total inflammatory load of multi-metabolic and psychological risk factors causes low grade inflammation and aging, the use of intermittent challenges, united in a 7–10 days lasting hormetic intervention, might serve as a vaccine against the deleterious effects of chronic low grade inflammation and it’s metabolic and (premature) aging consequences."

Thus, exploring new non-pharmacological strategies, including the neuroprotective mechanisms of aerobic exercise, to enhance therapeutic treatment of AD are essential. Previous studies have shown that the beneficial efficiency of aerobic exercise in the prevention and treatment of AD is time-sensitive, but its mechanism is not clear. Recent studies revealed that the water channel protein aquaporin 4 (AQP4) mediates the glymphatic system to clear interstitial solutes, including β-amyloid, from the brain. More recently, voluntary exercise has been shown to promote glymphatic clearance function in mice. However, glymphatic function is reduced in the mid- or late-stage of AD due to the loss of the polarity distribution of AQP4. Based on this, we hypothesized that AQP4-mediated glymphatic system clearance function is a determining factor for time-sensitive treatment of aerobic exercise in patients with AD. While further studies are necessary, the potential results are important for elucidating the new pro-cognitive mechanism of aerobic exercise, but also help to establish a new strategy for treatment of AD via regulation of glymphatic clearance function by targeting AQP4."

abstract = "Death by Plasmodium falsiparum, the leading cause of malaria, is going to remain a major obstacle among the infectious diseases. Plasmepsin aspartic proteases are key proteins in the pathogenesis of plasmodium species which break down the hemoglobin and exploit it as a source of amino acids. These enzymes are one of the favorite targeting agents for medicinal chemists to design new drugs. Plasmepsin proteins show a “flap” region in their N-terminal domain, predisposing them to a good “filler” drug with an exceptional affinity to this enzyme. Plerixafor (Mozobil®, AMD3100), a CXCR4 antagonist with a bicyclam ring, historically discovered as an impurity in a mixture which had anti-HIV properties, is now a FDA approved drug for mobilizing haematopoietic stem cells in cancer patients. In this hypothesis, we focused on the similarity of the structure of plerixafor and its analogues with heme functional group of hemoglobin, the main substrate of plasmepsin, and also with some other recent azamacrocyclic compounds demonstrating antimalarial activity, to test whether these compounds are capable of exhibiting antimalarial activity by inhibiting plasmepsin or not. A preliminary in silico docking study was used to evaluate this hypothesis and docking results indicated that macrocyclic cyclams and cyclens can reliably act as potent lead drug or central pharmacophore in developing new plasmepsin inhibitors as compared with previously designed plasmepsin II inhibitors."

And this kind of caudal to rostral gradient is never seen in any other neurotransmitters. However, the cause of this phenomenon remains unknown. In the present report, I, thus, postulate the following theory. Glycine has dual roles as a neurotransmitter, one is the agonist for inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs), and the other is a co-agonist for excitatory NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Inhibitory GlyRs are concentrated in the lower brain and the affinity of glycine to GlyRs is low, leading to the high content of glycine in the lower brain. In contrast, in the upper brain, there are little glycinergic neurons and the affinity of glycine to NMDARs is very high, leading to the low content of glycine in the forebrain. These different roles of glycine as a neurotransmitter between in the upper brain and in the lower brain make this steep caudal-rostral gradient in glycine content."

On the basis of the hypothesis that cancer immunotherapy, in particular with immune checkpoint inhibitors, increases the incidence of allergic-like immediate ARs to ICM with respect to “standard” cancer chemotherapy/targeted therapy (CHT) we retrospectively evaluated the incidence of CECT-related immediate ARs in cancer patients undergoing cancer treatments. All patients who underwent at least one CECT scan after starting any cancer treatment between 2006 and 2014 were included in a mono-institutional radiological database. The staff of the Radiology Unit recorded any ARs that occurred within 30 min of the ICM injection and classified them as “allergic-like” or “physiologic” and graded as mild, moderate, or severe according to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Manual on Contrast Media, version 10.1. Fifty-nine of the 3,521 patients included in the database received ipilimumab (Ipi), 75 received cytokines (Cys), and the remaining 3,387 received non-immunologic agents (CHT). Overall, 71 (2%) patients suffered ICM-related ARs. The incidence of ICM-related ARs was higher in Ipi- and Cy-treated patients than in those who received CHT (12%, 5%, and 2%, respectively). Our data show that immunological cancer treatments, particularly Ipi, considerably increase the proportion of patients suffering CECT-related immediate ARs with respect to non-immunologic agents. Although these findings need to be validated in larger prospective studies, they serve as a “wake-up call” for radiologists to closely monitor patients who have previously received cancer immunotherapy with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 antibodies when using ICM in order to reduce the risk of potentially severe immediate ARs."

The dilemma compels us to doubt about the correctness of gene mutation theory and re-understand the nature of tumor. This study explores the nature of cancer by the method of theoretical analysis by the view of tissue regeneration, and draws a conclusion that the carcinogenesis is consequence of failure of tissue development. Tumors originate from tissue regeneration, tumor cells originate from normal tissue stem cells. The tumor cells are only normal immature cells. Tumor promoters stimulate stem cells to proliferate. Carcinogens obstruct the inducers from inducing tissue stem cells differentiation outside of cells. With tumor promoters and carcinogens, the tissue stem cells proliferate, but cannot differentiate into mature cells, and stop in different phases of differentiation forming atypical hyperplasia of different degrees and tumors of various differentiation grades in tissue. The tumor cells can differentiate into normal mature cells with suitable inducers. The normal stem cells will develop into tumor stem cells without suitable inducers. The ultimate solution of tumor is differentiation therapy. Stem cell transplantation should be cautious."

abstract = "A reliable noninvasive method for the estimation of pulmonary function in healthy and diseased subjects should be of great importance in the prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Here we propose such a method, which is based on the parameter identification of the five-element Windkessel model of pulmonary circulation. The method requires the following input variables: the heart rate, the stroke volume, the Doppler echocardiographic measurements of the tricuspid regurgitation and the pulmonary valve velocity profiles, and estimations of the right atrium and the pulmonary vein pressure. The stroke volume is calculated as a product of the left ventricle outflow tract area and the velocity-time integral measured at the same place. The model parameter identification procedure is based on minimization of the root mean square error between the pulmonary artery root pressure calculated from the aforementioned Doppler velocity profiles (from the Bernoulli equation applied during the ejection phase) and the pressure from the Windkessel model during the same period. The output from the model contains the calculated pulmonary artery input impedance (i.e. the model parameters: pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary artery proximal and distal compliances, inertance, and characteristic impedance) and the pulmonary artery pressure profile during the whole heart period. Our method is applied to a subject with pulmonary hypertension. The right heart Swan-Ganz catheterization has been performed in this subject. The results obtained by using this method show that the five-element Windkessel model reconstructs the main features of the pulmonary artery input impedance very well: its modulus shows the minimum where the phase angle changes its sign. The pulmonary vascular resistance, the systolic, diastolic and mean pulmonary artery pressures obtained from the method are in good agreement with the values obtained invasively from the catheterization. Sensitivity analysis shows that the mean pulmonary pressure is fairly insensitive to slight overestimation/ underestimation of all input parameters, except for the right atrium pressure. The absolute error in the mean pulmonary artery pressure is nearly the same as the error in the right atrium pressure. Since the proposed method offers a deeper insight into the pulmonary circulation than the catheterization itself because it provides the proximal and distal compliance, the inertance and the characteristic impedance, it seems that it can serve in clinical practice as a good substitute for catheterization."

Current epidemiological evidence supports that the prevalence of cellulite is significantly higher in industrialized societies indicating that environmental factors have crucial role in its pathogenesis and perpetuation. Endocrine disrupting chemicals, which exist ubiquitously in the environment, are able to alter hormonal and homeostatic systems. Several of them exert agonist effects by binding to estrogen receptors and mimicking the biological activity of estrogens. Since elevated estrogen concentration is prerequisite for cellulite, the present article suggests that endocrine disrupting chemicals may be key determinants in the initiation and deterioration of cellulite either by stimulating estrogen receptors or increasing their circulating levels due to interference with enzymes and binding proteins."

Theses elevated endogenous opioids bring complications like pruritus, cardiac and vascular abnormalities in patients with cholestasis. However, little is known about the mechanism of increased endogenous opioids synthesis in cholestatic liver diseases. Different from the tradition view that the liver is the source of endogenous opioids peptides, recent researches give clues that skin may be another important organ in which endogenous opioid peptides were synthesized during cholestasis. Skin cells like keratinocytes, fibroblasts, macrophages and other inflammation cells had been reported to produce endogenous opioid peptides under certain physical and pathological conditions. In the course of obstructive jaundice, all these cells had the potential to be activated by different molecular mechanisms. And some cells like keratinocyte and inflammation cells had been proved to correlate with elevated plasma levels of enkephalin and beta-endorphin in patients with obstructive jaundice. Hence, we hypothesize that skin may be the site in which abundant endogenous opioid peptides been produced during the course of obstructive jaundice. These skin-cell related mechanisms should be further studied to resolve the puzzle of elevated peripheral opiate tone during obstructive jaundice."

Smokers who switch to vaping report a decrease in respiratory infections. A previous case report of a non-smoker who started to vape and experienced a resolution of chronic tonsillitis proposed that this could be due to bactericidal effects of propylene glycol. Here were report a similar case where a resolution of chronic nasal infection was associated with using glycerol-based nicotine vaporiser.
Case presentation
A never-smoker adopted an e-cigarette that his wife was using and after a few weeks of vaping liquids containing vegetable glycerine with low levels of nicotine (3 mg/ml) experienced a complete resolution of chronic nasal Staphylococcus aureus infections.
Conclusions
The improvements cannot be attributed to smoking cessation or bactericidal effects of propylene glycol. The effect could be a coincidence, but it could also be related to bacteriostatic properties of glycerol, or to antimicrobial properties of nicotine and/or the zinc (II) complex of nicotine. Assessments of effects of e-cigarettes with different humectants and nicotine levels in patients with recurrent bacterial respiratory infections could clarify this issue and possibly generate new treatments."

However, increasing neuroimaging evidence indicates that functional and structural abnormalities exist in the brains of chronic fatigue syndrome patients, suggesting that the central nervous system is involved in this disorder and that at least some chronic fatigue syndrome patients may have an underlying neurological basis for their illness. In the present paper, we speculate that glymphatic dysfunction, causing toxic build up within the central nervous system, may be responsible for at least some cases of chronic fatigue syndrome. We further postulate that cerebrospinal fluid diversion such as lumboperitoneal shunting may be beneficial to this subgroup of patients by restoring glymphatic transport and waste removal from the brain. Although recent evidence indicates that at least some chronic fatigue syndrome patients may benefit from cerebrospinal fluid drainage, further studies are needed to confirm this finding and to determine whether this can be attributed to enhancement of glymphatic fluid flow and interstitial fluid clearance. If confirmed, this could offer promising avenues for the future treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. Clearly, given the relative invasive nature of cerebrospinal fluid diversion, such procedures should be reserved for chronic fatigue syndrome patients who are severely debilitated, or for those with severe headaches. Anyhow, it seems worthwhile to make every effort to identify new therapies for patients who suffer from this devastating disease, especially given that there are currently no effective treatments for this condition."

abstract = "Learning and memory are generally considered the behavioral correlates of long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity associated with a persistent and long-lasting increase in synaptic strength. Repetitive stimulation of excitatory synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region leads to release and binding of glutamate to the glutamate receptors AMPAR and NMDAR located on pyramidal neurons. Activation of AMPARs facilitates Na+ influx, postsynaptic depolarization, NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ influx, and activation of several intracellular mechanisms that characterize LTP, including increased AMPAR synthesis, ROS production, and ER Ca2+ release. BDNF-TrkB receptor signaling, which increases intracellular Ca2+ levels via PLCγ1-mediated ER Ca2+ release, also plays an important role in facilitating hippocampal CA1 LTP. Interestingly, the cellular mechanisms that characterize LTP are strikingly similar to signaling pathways that underlie reactivation of latent HIV-1 reservoirs. Known as the “shock and kill” approach, reactivation of latent HIV-1, particularly in CD4+ memory T cells, is currently being pursued to potentially eradicate HIV-1. Indeed, AMPARs, NMDARs, and TrkB receptors have been found on and promote T cell activation and BDNF has been shown to reactivate latent HIV-1 in human macrophages. Additionally, latent HIV-1 reactivation via T cell receptor activation (a positive control in HIV-1 latency studies) involves PLCγ1-mediated increases in intracellular Ca2+, an increase in ROS levels, and activation of kinases and transcription factors that are also critical for LTP. Furthermore, PMA, also used as a positive control along with ionomycin in HIV-1 latency studies, has been shown to enhance hippocampal CA1 LTP. AMPK, an evolutionarily conserved kinase activated by increases in intracellular Ca2+, ROS, and/or AMP/ATP ratio increases improves lifespan and healthspan in several model organisms and is essential for T cell activation. Knockdown of AMPK also significantly inhibits HIV-1 replication. AMPK has been found localized in hippocampal CA1 dendrites and glutamate, NMDA, KCl, ionomycin, and BDNF have each been shown to induce AMPK activation in neurons. AMPK activation also increases synthesis and membrane insertion of AMPARs. Because both T cell activation and LTP are dependent on intracellular Ca2+ increases and because inhibition of ROS significantly inhibits hippocampal CA1 LTP and T cell activation, it is our hypothesis that AMPK links latent HIV-1 reactivation with hippocampal LTP, learning, and memory. We also propose that compounds that enhance or promote LTP and reactivate latent HIV-1 (e.g. PMA, ionomycin, resveratrol, metformin, etc.) either alone or in combination likely do so via AMPK activation."

Further, the load support of the wheel is limited to a point of the whole wheel in contact with the ground. Then, we humans may be using the legs as a part of spoke wheel and place our legs and feet on the ground alternatively to support the body weight while the gravitational torque makes the center of mass (COM) rotate around the hip joint when proper stiffness and balance is made. Through a pulley-like action involving the hamstrings and a lever-like action of back muscles via the psoas muscle, the energy expenditure for locomotion can be reduced to the energy for lifting the swing leg to maintain the proper position of the COM. Further, the stabilizing action of the psoas muscle to the spinal column can be achieved between the stance leg and the swing leg by the weight of the lifted swing leg during the forward movement. This lifting action during swing phase can assist an energy-efficient eccentric contraction of the stance leg. The passive tension generated by gravity (own weight and the carried load) can be the reason for the energy efficiency of both head-carrying and the Nepalese porter method. Using this passive gravitational force via actively synchronized neuromuscular action may be universal for animal locomotion."

abstract = "Breast cancer tumors have a tendency to metastasize to the bone. After development of a bone metastasis, the median survival time is 40 months. Currently, little is known about the modifiable risk factors for developing bone metastases in women diagnosed with breast cancer. One possible modifiable risk factor is increased bone resorption. Increased bone resorption is caused by an imbalance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts favoring osteoclast-driven bone resorption. Osteoclast activity results in the release of growth factors from the bony matrix that are requirement for successful breast cancer tumor cell proliferation within the bone. Mice studies have shown that mice that have been genetically engineered to have higher bone mineral density, and thus lower bone resorption, have a decreased incidence of bone metastases. Alternatively, mice genetically engineered to have lower bone mineral density or increased bone resorption have a higher incidence of bone metastases. In human studies, antiosteoporotic drugs have been shown to decrease osteoclast activity and prevent bone metastases. These studies suggest that increased osteoclast activity, which results in low bone mineral density, may be a modifiable risk factor for developing bone metastases in women with breast cancer. Women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer develop low bone mineral density in response to the direct effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on bone cells—including osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes—and through the decrease in circulating estrogen as a result of chemotherapy-induced ovarian dysfunction. Therefore, it is important for future studies to determine the risk of developing bone metastases associated with increasing bone resorption as measured by low or decreasing bone mineral density in women diagnosed with breast cancer, as well as to determine the best intervention(s) to promote a balance between osteoclasts and osteoblasts to favor osteoblast activity during chemotherapy treatment."

abstract = "Shoulder dystocia is a rare but severe obstetric complication associated with an increased risk of brachial plexus palsies, fractures of the clavicle and humerus, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and, rarely, neonatal death. Here we describe a fatal case of shoulder dystocia in a term newborn, although labor was uneventful, fetal heart rate tracing was normal until the delivery of the head and the head-to-body delivery interval (HBDI) occurred within 5 min. Full resuscitation was performed for 35 min without success. Hemoglobin concentration evaluated on the umbilical cord still attached to the placenta was within normal range, while neonatal venous hemoglobin concentration blood gases at 9 min of life showed severe metabolic acidosis and anemia. As previously described by others, our case supports the hypothesis of a hypovolemic shock as the cause of neonatal death, probably due to acute placental retention of fetal blood. The death of the newborn following shoulder dystocia is an event that still presents numerous gaps in knowledge. Further research should focus on:•Performing neonatal resuscitation with an intact umbilical cord.•Milking the umbilical cord before clamping.•Clamp the umbilical cord leaving a long portion attached to the newborn and squeeze its content simultaneously with the first resuscitation maneuvers.•Consider postdelivery volume replacement therapy sooner than expected from resuscitation algorithm."

One of the most significant factors in intraventricular hemorrhage development is fluctuations in the cerebral blood flow due to left-to-right shunting as a result of patent ductus arteriosus, and such cases most frequently develop intraventricular hemorrhage within the first 72 h. The frequency of intraventricular hemorrhage may be reduced through the prevention of fluctuations in the cerebral blood flow in this time frame. Based on our hypothesis, we recommend that extremely low birth weight infants should be delivered and monitored in hypobaric rooms for the first three days after birth, as this may reduce left-to-right shunting as a result of patent ductus arteriosus by preventing the rapid drops seen in pulmonary pressure after birth. A more stable hemodynamic status may be achieved by increasing the cerebral blood flow during an acute term in a hypobaric environment. Gradual transition to the normobaric status at the end of the third day may prevent the long-term negative effects of hypobaric conditions."

This dramatic reduction in numbers clearly highlights the obstacles that sperm must overcome in order to reach the destination for egg fertilizing. Phagocytosis of sperm by leukocytes are repeatedly observed and generally considered to be one of the most important barriers, but the mechanism of the phagocytosis of sperm remains unclear. L-selectin is constitutively expressed on leukocytes, which can influence the behaviors of leukocytes when bind to ligands. Sialic acids are found as the outer most monosaccharide, capping the majority of glycans at the sperm surface, can act as recognition molecule. Since the sialic acids are considered as ligands of L-selectin, we propose that leukocytes bind to the sperm through the L-selectin on leukocytes and sialic acid on sperm surface during the sperm phagocytosis in female reproductive tract."

Many in-vivo and ex-vivo animal researches have demonstrated that RIPC decreases significantly the ischemia-reperfusion myocardial damage, by up to 58% in isolated rat heart. Cardiac artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is a clinical model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion and a clinical potential application to RIPC. However, although RIPC has shown successful results in experimental studies, clinical trials on CABG have failed to demonstrate a benefit of RIPC in humans. Strikingly, the main proposed factors associated with this translational failure also impair the balance of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which has shown to play a key role in RIPC cardioprotection in animal models. Comorbidities, chronic pharmacological treatment and anesthesic drugs - common conditions in CABG patients - cause an ANS imbalance through parasympathetic activity decrement. On the other hand, ANS and specially the parasympathetic branch are essentials to get cardioprotection by RIPC in animal models. Consequently, we propose that ANS imbalance in CABG patients would explain the failure of RIPC clinical trials. Whether our hypothesis is true, many patients could be benefited by RIPC: a cheap, simple and virtually broad-available cardioprotective maneuver. In this paper we discuss the evidence that support this hypothesis and its clinical implications."

Cancer cells are further less metabolically flexible than normal cells. They can therefore not survive metabolic stress as well as normal cells can. Metabolic deprivation thus provides a potential therapeutic window. Unfortunately, current glucose blockers have toxicity problems. An alternative way to reduce a cancer patient’s blood glucose (BG), for a short-term period to very low levels, without the concomitant toxicity, is hypothesized in this paper. In vitro tests have shown that short-term BG deprivation to 2 mmol/L for 180 min is an effective cancer treatment. This level of hypoglycaemia can be maintained in vivo with a combination of very low-dose insulin and the suppression of the glucose counter-regulation system. Such suppression can be safely achieved by the infusion of somatostatin and a combination of both α and β-blockers. The proposed short-term in vivo method, was shown to be non-toxic and safe for non-cancer patients. The next step is to test the effect of the proposed method on cancer patients. It is also suggested to incorporate well-known, long-term BG deprivation treatments to achieve maximum effect."

To resolve this dissonance, it was assumed that an analysis of knowledge about accident releases and health effects gathered from one of these accidents could lead to the identification of an unrecognized exposure that could be inferred to have caused a specific observed injury that required a dose of at least 0.5 Sieverts. Because there is considerably more useful knowledge of reactor releases of radionuclides and observed health effects related to the Three Mile Island accident, that knowledge is analyzed. A relationship is inferred to exist between exposure to particulates in plumes released from the station vent stack and severe prolonged immunosuppression, a known effect of an exposure that delivers a dose of at least 0.5 Sieverts. More than ninety percent of the particulates were comprised of Strontium 89 nuclides, essentially pure beta emitters. Because Strontium is a metal, the nuclides in the particulates were configured as stable crystals which, when coming to rest in body tissue, functioned as intense point sources of chronic beta irradiation. The inference led to the hypothesis “particulates comprised of Strontium 89 nuclides provided the exposure that caused the health effects that were observed following the Three Mile Island accident”. The hypothesis was tested for validity against two requirements; that only the humans beneath the plumes, who would have inhaled the particulates, expressed the abrupt and persistent rise in the health parameter Deaths from all Causes that would result from the severe prolonged immunosuppression that follows a 0.5 Sievert dose, and that they expressed the excess cancers that would be expected following organ doses of 0.5 or more Sieverts. These effects were found. The Hypothesis is therefore valid and leads to knowledge of the heretofore unknown mechanisms and effects of low LET beta irradiation by a particulate."

abstract = "During evolution, Muller’s ratchet permanently generates deleterious germline mutations that eventually must be defused by selection. It seems widely held that cancer and aging-related diseases (ARDs) cannot contribute to this germline gene selection because they tail reproduction and thus occur too late, at the end of the life cycle. Here we posit however that by lessening the offspring’s survival by proxy through diminishing parental care, they can still contribute to the selection. The hypothesis in detail: The widespread occurrence of aging in animals suggests that it is an adaptation. But to what benefit? Aging seems to have only drawbacks. In humans, ARDs cause today almost all mortality; they include heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, kidney disease and cancer. Compensation seems unthinkable. For cancer, the author proposed in a previous study a benefit to the species: purifying selection against deleterious germline genes that when expressed enhance intracellular energy dissipation. This multicausal energy dissipation, posited as the universal origin of cancer initiation, relates to cellular heat generation, disrupted metabolism, and inflammation. The organism reproduces during cancer’s dormancy, and when approaching its end of life, the onset of cancer is accelerated in proportion to the cancer-initiating signal. Through cancer, the organism, now a parent, implements the self-actuated programmed death of Skulachev’s phenoptosis. This “first death” enhances by proxy the offspring’s chance of “second death” (or “double death”) through diminished parental care. Repetition over generations realizes a purifying selection against genes causing energy dissipation. The removal of the deleterious germline gene mutations permanently generated by Muller’s ratchet gives a benefit. We generalize, motivated by the parallels between cancer and aging, the purifying selection posited for cancer to aging. An ARD would be initiated in the organ by multicausal disruption of homeostasis, and be followed by dormancy and senescence until its onset near the end of the life cycle. Just as for cancer, the ARD eventually enhances double death, and the realized permanent selection gives a benefit to the species through the selection against germ line genes that disrupt homeostasis. Given their similarities, cancer and aging are combined in the posited Unified Cancer-Aging Adaptation (UCAA) model, which may be confirmed by next-generation sequencing data. Also because of the emerging important role of cellular senescence, the hypothesis may guide the development of therapies against both cancer and aging."

The imbalance between the strength of immune response and pretreatment tumor burden (TB) could also cause immunotherapy to fail in cancer patients. For this reason, we hypothesized that the TMB-TB ratio could predict the clinical benefit of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy and that PFS or ORRs should be used more often in patients with high TMB-TB ratio than in individuals with low TMB-TB ratios."

Raised intraocular pressure is the most important modifiable risk factor and lowering it remains the mainstay therapeutic approach for slowing optic nerve damage and visual field progression in glaucoma patients. An intriguing finding of clinical retrospective and prospective studies is that intracranial pressure is lower in patients with glaucoma. Furthermore, in a recent study on monkeys subjected to an implantation of a lumboperitoneal cerebrospinal fluid shunt to lower intracranial pressure, chronic reduction in intracranial pressure was associated with the development of glaucoma-like pathology in half of the monkeys. In addition, a very recent study demonstrated that patients whose intracranial pressure has been lowered following ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, as treatment for normal pressure hydrocephalus, have a significantly increased risk of developing normal-tension glaucoma. These findings suggest that a reduced intracranial pressure may play an important role in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. This may be due to an abnormally high pressure difference across the lamina cribrosa resulting in biomechanical changes of the optic nerve head and/or to a deficient clearance of toxic substances, particularly in the subarachnoid space of the optic nerve and/or in the ‘ocular glymphatic system’. The search for drugs or medical devices useful to ameliorate glaucoma by lowering the trans-lamina cribrosa pressure difference and/or by facilitating cerebrospinal fluid circulation may therefore be an important area for future research. In this article, we propose that infusion of artificial cerebrospinal fluid through an implantable pump into the intrathecal space surrounding the spinal cord could be a new promising strategy for the treatment of glaucoma. Although the implantation of such a cerebrospinal fluid pump is a relatively invasive intervention, it seems worthwhile to make every effort to identify new therapies for patients who suffer from this devastating disease, especially given the significant number of patients for whom non-invasive treatment options are ineffective."

The challenge being that research programmes concerning the emergence of these systems are viewed as the same as those relating to the origin of cells. Cells are strikingly important biological entities, hard wired into the entire field of biology. The development of biological systems took place much earlier than the origin of cells and even before the existence of the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA); a period which could be construed as being preLUCA and which would have taken place during in a ribonucleoprotein world. This latter entity was named FUCA (First Universal Common Ancestor) and could be viewed as a “great-grandmother” to LUCA, from which the three domains of life, namely Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya (emerging as a chimera of the two) evolved. RNA-world theories are the focus of mainstream research programmes for the origin of life stricto sensu. In the RNA-world view, self-replication of nucleic acids is seen as one of the most relevant events in the pre-biotic world. Without denying the relevance of self-replication, we argue here that the most germane event which occurred in the pre-biotic world was the crosstalk between nucleic acids and peptides. When these two macromolecules started to interact, the singularity that aggregated the complexity required to produce life began to emerge. Thus, comprehension of the early origins of the translation machinery and the assembly of the genetic code is key. Therefore, the relevance of cell theory and self-replication should be re-evaluated as well as the concept of life itself."

To investigate whether percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is associated with increased risk of gastric cancer.
Methods
We conducted a nationwide population-based retrospective study in Taiwan. Inpatient data from 1997 to 2010 were collected from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients with age less than 20 years; those with histories of PEG before 2000; those with histories of cancers; and those diagnosed with gastric cancer before or within 6 months of the first PEG procedure were excluded. Finally, 3505 patients who underwent PEG were included (PEG cohort), along with 7010 randomly-selected individuals, matched by age, sex, and year of index date, as the control cohort.
Results
After adjusting for age, sex, peptic ulcer, gastritis, hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery disease, risk of gastric cancer was significantly higher in the PEG cohort (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.31; 95% confidence interval, 4.12–6.00; p = 0.011). Patients with 2 or more PEG procedures were significantly associated with increasingly developing gastric cancer risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.91–3.85; p < 0.001). The possible hypothesis may be due to chronic inflammation caused by chemical and physical conditions of the tube.
Conclusions
Patients with PEG might be associated with a greater risk of subsequent gastric cancer in Taiwan. Physicians should be aware of the link when assessing patients with PEG."

However, these benefits of anthocyanins are lost in rats whose gut microbiome has been eliminated with antibiotic treatment – pointing to bacterial metabolites of anthocyanins as the likely protective agents. A human pharmacokinetic assessment of orally administered cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, a prominent anthocyanin, has revealed that, whereas this compound is minimally absorbed, ferulic acid (FA) is one of its primary metabolites that appears in plasma. FA is a strong antioxidant and phase 2 inducer that has exerted marked anti-inflammatory effects in a number of rodent and cell culture studies; in particular, FA is highly protective in rodent models of diet-induced weight gain and metabolic syndrome. FA, a precursor for lignan synthesis, is widely distributed in plant-based whole foods, mostly in conjugated form; whole grains are a notable source. Coffee ingestion boosts plasma FA owing to gastrointestinal metabolism of chlorogenic acid. Hence, it is reasonable to suspect that FA mediates some of the broad health benefits that have been associated epidemiologically with frequent consumption of whole grains, anthocyanins, coffee, and unrefined plant-based foods. The molecular basis of the anti-inflammatory effects of FA may have been clarified by a recent study demonstrating that FA can target the adaptor protein MyD88; this plays an essential role in pro-inflammatory signaling by most toll-like receptors and interleukin-1β. If feasible oral intakes of FA can indeed down-regulate MyD88-dependent signaling, favorable effects of FA on neurodegeneration, hypothalamic inflammation, weight gain, adipocyte and beta cell function, adiponectin secretion, vascular health, and cartilage and bone integrity can be predicted. Since FA is well tolerated, safe, and natural, it may have great potential as a protective nutraceutical, and clinical trials evaluating its effects are needed."

abstract = "Earlier observers have speculated on the causal relationships between abnormal CSF circulation and a variety of neurological dysfunctions. Such speculations have been at least partially validated by recent evidence and inquiries contravening the traditional static viewpoint of CSF circulation. More contemporary inquiries establish a number of factors which influence both CSF production and absorption (sleep disturbance, neck position, cerebral metabolism, brain atrophy, medications, etc.). Thus, transient periods of abnormality are possibly mingled with periods of normality. Such episodic alterations suggest that the physiological arrangements which underpin CSF circulation may be in some ways likened to blood pressure alterations, in that long-standing CSF abnormalities may be both unappreciated and gradual, though virulent enough to cause substantial neurological injury. We suggest that cervical stenosis (blocking an important CSF decompressive pathway into the vertebral canal) is among the largely unappreciated causes of abnormal CSF circulation and may play a role in cephalad neuronal dysfunction. Such a blockage is correlated with age and easily assessed by cine MRI study. Indeed, episodic disturbances can diminish CSF cerebral flow circulation increasing deposition in cerebral parenchyma of contrary metabolic products (e.g. beta Amyloid), possibly having a causal influence on senile dementia. Additionally, cervical stenosis, by increasing posterior fossa cerebral pressure, could play a causal role in a number of afflictions, among them sleep apnea, concomitant respiratory and circulatory dysfunction, hypertension, chronic occipital headaches, tinnitus, etc. We further suggest that among those patients with substantial cervical stenosis (extensive enough to block CSF circulation in the cervical area as identified by cine MRI) appropriate comparative clinical studies could be undertaken to demarcate associations with presenile dementia, sleep disturbance and posterior fossa dysfunction. Additionally, we suggest that an intracranial monitoring implant be perfected to chronically monitor both intracranial pressure and CSF flow – a monitoring device comparable to the rather less invasive sphygmometric evaluation of blood pressure. If such speculations prove correct, different therapeutic regimens which might improve outcome could be imagined. Among them better sleep hygiene (to by position maximize CSF flow) and possibly more aggressive operative decompressive intervention to diminish cervical obstruction."

Mucus layer is the vital protector over the intestinal epithelia cells (IECs). Mucus layer with impaired function could not provide isolated protection for IECs and thus proteases and pathogens from the gut lumen attacked and damaged the epithelial layer. Clinical manifestation and histopathology suggest that IBD might be a self-digestive inflammatory disease caused by digestive enzymes. In this review, we specifically focus on the role of intestinal mucosal barriers and aim to summarize the relationship among mucus layer, self-digestion and inflammation in IBD. We also propose a “Two Hits” Self-Digestion theory to explain the role of self-digestion in IBD and assess the application of mucus protectors to treat IBD."

A hypothesis related to long-term changes in synaptic efficiency has strong experimental support, but does not seem to be able to explain all observations. It has recently been proposed that magnetite together with a prion-like protein could be involved in a tandem mechanism for storage of memory in neurons in which electric impulses are received and reshaped by the magnetite to a form which can be accepted by the protein. The magnetite crystals can be magnetized by an electrical impulse, but they cannot hold the magnetism, which drops to zero after each impulse. Therefore, magnetite cannot be the substance in which information is stored. In the present paper we explain how a tandem mechanism could function in a neuron in which magnetite is situated together with a prion-like protein close to the cell surface membrane of the axon. We assume in addition that the information is stored in special storage neurons. With this, we propose a new hypothesis for information storage in neurons which could operate in addition to synaptic plasticity, but perhaps in different neurons."

It emphasizes the role of hormonal disbalance, i.e. hyperleptinemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypercortisolemia, hypercatecholaminemia, hyperestrogenemia and hyperandrogenemia in MetS. It is presumed that these important components modify cellular microenvironment towards carcinogenesis. The interactions between neurotrophins, leptin, and mast cells and the alterations in the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal axis in MetS are discussed. It is assumed that they are the consequence of inflammatory distress followed by hormonal and immune disbalance at a central level as well as of enlarged adipose tissue and changed adipocyte microenvironment leading, finally, to carcinogenesis."

CA is not a disease by itself but a collection of symptoms due to the involvement of cerebellum or its pathways. Presently the treatment for balance problems for CA is not standardized. Interventions available to improve balance are not specific to symptoms presentation. Functionally the cerebellum is divided into the spinocerebellum, vestibulocerebellum and corticocerebellum. Each functional zone has a distinct role in maintaining balance. Therefore, the presentation of symptoms will vary according to the functional zone involved. Pre-screening clients with CA for identifying the part of cerebellum involved will facilitate clinicians to provide tailor-made interventions for targeting specific symptoms for better outcomes. Pre-screening clients with CA according to the part of cerebellum involved is not in practice and our study will introduce this concept. We hypothesize pre-screening participants with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) for the involvement vestibulocerebellum followed by prescribing vestibulocerebellum targeted exercises will have better outcomes when compared to conventional balance training. We plan to conduct two related studies. In study 1 we will screen participants with CA for the involvement of vestibulocerebellum. In study 2, the effects of vestibulocerebellum targeted balance exercises on balance will be studied. We will assess the Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV) deviation and postural sway pattern to screen participants into people with and without vestibulocerebellar involvement. SVV deviation will be estimated using a computerized Subjective Visual Vertical (cSVV) device and postural sway pattern will be assessed using the limits of stability program of the Bertec© Balance system. The obtained SVV deviation scores will be used to derive at cut-off scores to discriminate clients with and without vestibulocerebellar involvement. The second study will test the treatment effects of conventional exercises plus vestibulocerebellum targeted exercises to improve balance by correcting SVV deviation in SCA with vestibulocerebellar involvement.

The findings of this cutting-edge research are extremely important to the clinicians, researchers and clients with SCA."

We offer as premise that Americans on average consume suboptimal amounts of potassium and blood pressure-lowering phytochemicals, and physiologically excessive amounts of sodium, and that such dietary imprudence leads to essential hypertension through oxidative stress-induced vascular endothelial and smooth muscle dysfunction. Such dysfunctions restrict nitric oxide bioavailability, impairing endothelial cell-mediated relaxation of the underlying vascular smooth muscle, initiating and maintaining inappropriately increased peripheral and renal vascular resistance. The biochemical steps from oxidative stress to vascular endothelial dysfunction and its pernicious cardiovascular consequences are well established and generally accepted. The unique aspect of our hypothesis resides in the contention that Americans’ habitual consumption of foods resulting in suboptimal dietary intake of potassium and supraphysiological intake of sodium result in oxidative stress, the degree of which, we suggest, will correlate with the degree of deviation of potassium and sodium intake from optimal. Because suboptimal intakes of potassium reflect suboptimal intakes of fruits and vegetables, associated contributors to oxidative stress include suboptimal intakes of magnesium, nitrate, polyphenols, carotenoids, and other phytochemical antioxidants for which fruits and vegetables contain abundant amounts. Currently Americans consume potassium-to-sodium in molar ratios of less than or close to 1.0 and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends a molar ratio of 1.2. Ancestral diets to which we are physiologically adapted range from molar ratios of 5.0 to 10.0 or higher. Accordingly, we suggest that the average American is usually afflicted with oxidative stress-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction, and therefore the standards for normal blood pressure and pre-hypertension often reflect a degree of clinically significant hypertension. In this article, we provide support for those contentions, and indicate the findings that the hypothesis predicts."

Experimental studies show female patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) demonstrate higher levels of sensitivity to irritants and airway hyperresponsiveness than males. Bronchial asthma shows female predominance in post-puberty patients, and gender interaction with severe asthma endotypes. Fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, migraine and chronic cough, syndromes, which are commonly related to neurokinin substance P (SP) in the literature, also show strong female predominance. Studies have demonstrated that sex hormones, primarily oestrogens, affect mast cell activation. Mast cell proteases can amplify neurogenic inflammatory responses including the release of SP. Based on human epidemiological data and animal experimental data we hypothesized that female patients have different interaction between mast cell activation and neurogenic inflammation, i.e. substance P release, resulting in a different nasal symptom profile. To test the hypothesis we performed allergen and non-specific nasal challenges in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) out of season and looked for gender differences in subjective and objective responses. The interaction between subjective and objective reactivity was evaluated through the comparison of subjective symptom scores, concentrations of neurokinin substance P (SP) and cellular markers in nasal lavages after low doses of nasal allergen challenges. Female allergic subjects tended to have higher substance P (SP) concentrations both before and after non-specific challenges. The difference between post-allergen and post – hypertonic saline (HTS) challenge was highly significant in female patients (p = 0.001), while insignificant in male subjects (p = 0.14). Female patients had significantly stronger burning sensation after HTS challenge than male. These data indicate difference in the interaction between inflammatory cells and the neurogenic response, which is gender- related, and which may affect symptom profiles after challenges. Different regulation of neurogenic inflammation in females may have impact on symptoms and endotyping in respiratory disorders, not only in allergic rhinitis, but also asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis and irritant -induced cough."

This finding is important to recognize since it may provide further insights into the potential underlying causes of disease. There is no known proposed mechanism to explain this phenomenon. We hypothesize that relative bradycardia is the central mechanism reflecting and influenced potentially by the direct pathogenic effect on the sinoatrial node as well as cross-talk between the autonomic nervous system and immune system. Cardiac pacemaker cells may act as a target for inflammatory cytokines leading to alteration in heart rate dynamics or their responsiveness to neurotransmitters during systemic inflammation. These factors account for the important role of how the host response to infectious and non-infectious causes influences the appearance of relative bradycardia. We propose several methods that may be useful to confirm the proposed theoretical framework to further enhance our understanding of this paradoxical phenomenon. This includes measuring, during the episode of relative bradycardia, proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, monitoring heart rate variability (HRV), and assessing underlying comorbidities and outcomes in patients with the same disease."

abstract = "Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an accelerated aging phenotype that typically leads to death via stroke or myocardial infarction at approximately 14.6 years of age. Most cases of HGPS have been linked to the extensive use of a cryptic splice donor site located in the LMNA gene due to a de novo mutation, generating a truncated and toxic protein known as progerin. Progerin accumulation in the nuclear membrane and within the nucleus distorts the nuclear architecture and negatively effects nuclear processes including DNA replication and repair, leading to accelerated cellular aging and premature senescence. The serine-arginine rich splicing factor SRSF1 (also known as ASF/SF2) has recently been shown to modulate alternative splicing of the LMNA gene, with SRSF1 inhibition significantly reducing progerin at both the mRNA and protein levels. In 2014, we hypothesized for the first time that compounds including metformin that induce activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master metabolic regulator activated by cellular stress (e.g. increases in intracellular calcium, reactive oxygen species, and/or an AMP(ADP)/ATP ratio increase, etc.), will beneficially alter gene splicing in progeria cells by inhibiting SRSF1, thus lowering progerin levels and altering the LMNA pre-mRNA splicing ratio. Recent evidence has substantiated this hypothesis, with metformin significantly reducing the mRNA and protein levels of both SRSF1 and progerin, activating AMPK, and alleviating pathological defects in HGPS cells. Metformin has also recently been shown to beneficially alter gene splicing in normal humans. Interestingly, several chemically distinct compounds, including rapamycin, methylene blue, all-trans retinoic acid, MG132, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, sulforaphane, and oltipraz have each been shown to alleviate accelerated aging defects in patient-derived HGPS cells. Each of these compounds has also been independently shown to induce AMPK activation. Because these compounds improve accelerated aging defects in HGPS cells either by enhancing mitochondrial functionality, increasing Nrf2 activity, inducing autophagy, or by altering gene splicing and because AMPK activation beneficially modulates each of the aforementioned processes, it is our hypothesis that cellular stress-induced AMPK activation represents an indirect yet common mechanism of action linking such chemically diverse compounds with the beneficial effects of those compounds observed in HGPS cells. As normal humans also produce progerin at much lower levels through a similar mechanism, compounds that safely induce AMPK activation may have wide-ranging implications for both normal and pathological aging."

Prostate cancer screening has led to a significant proportion of men diagnosed with low-grade, low-stage prostate cancer who are now more likely to choose an active surveillance strategy rather than definitive treatments. Definitive treatment, such as surgery and radiation therapy, is useful for high-grade disease; however, because of the low long-term risk of progression of a low-grade disease and side effects of surgery and radiation, these treatments are less commonly used for low-grade disease. While five alpha reductase inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of cancer detection on subsequent biopsies for men on active surveillance, no medications have been proven to prevent progression to high-grade disease. mTOR pathways have long been known to influence prostate cancer and are targets in various prostate cancer patient populations. Low-dose mTOR inhibition with rapamycin has shown promise in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer and appear to affect cellular senescence and immunomodulation in the aging population.

This is illustrated by the coexistence of both entities in lungs of individuals with combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. Macroproteins elastin and collagen are major constituents of the pulmonary extracellular matrix. The prevailing paradigm states that emphysema is caused by an imbalance between destructive proteolytic and protective antiproteolytic enzymes leading to accelerated degradation of elastin fibers in the lungs. Rates of elastin breakdown, however, are equally enhanced in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and emphysema. Excessive accumulation of collagen is a hallmark of IPF. Surprisingly, collagen levels in the lung parenchyma of patients with emphysema are also higher than in controls. The concentration of elastin fibers is elevated in fibrotic lungs, despite accelerated elastinolysis, suggesting that elastin repair is also enhanced in IPF. Since elastin concentrations are reduced in emphysematous lungs, the factor of divergence between emphysema and fibrosis seems to be the degree of elastin repair. Multiple elastin repair steps can be deduced of which tropoelastin synthesis and crosslinking of tropoelastin polymers by the copper dependent enzyme lysyl oxidase seem to be the most important ones. We suspect that the distinction in the pathogeneses of lung fibrosis and emphysema depends on the local availability of copper to activate sufficient lysyl oxidase for elastin crosslinking, and suggest assessing the effects of inhalation therapy with copper plus heparin in emphysema and heparin monotherapy in IPF."

However, there have been many contradictory findings showing modulations of VOR, which have caused confusion as to VOR’s role and accuracy. Further, there seems to be an influence of VOR when the anatomical inner ear structures are congenitally absent. Many people report vertiginous symptoms when they are exposed to visually challenging situations. These people with visually induced vertigo are usually found to have only mildly abnormal labyrinthine findings. Accurate visual information via binocular vision in animals, including humans, is important for the survival. Understanding how visual information is used in balance can help us to apply a different approach to the mechanism of vertigo. This article will review how accurate binocular viewing is possible for precise images through a complex oculomotor system and the proprioceptive senses of the external ocular muscles (EOMs). The proprioceptive senses from EOMs appear to affect motor efferents of the body. Oculomotor activities during viewing are important not just for learning but also for executing whole body motor responses. An error in the oculomotor afferents will cause a reaction to the error signal. This can be troubling for proper balancing during movement. Especially, common oculomotor causes (including fatigue of EOMs which is common in today’s lifestyle) can contribute to many vertiginous conditions."

According to the definition of osteoporosis by World Health Organization (WHO), the present hypothesis proposes an additional fractal-dimension indicator less than 3 to measure the structural change of bones, and further to diagnose osteoporotic patients with complications, to which BMD is insensitive. Literature reports support that the fractal dimension is more sensitive than BMD in specific cases. The hypothesis shows a promise not only in improving the accuracy of screening osteoporotic patients as a complementary indicator to BMD, but also in evaluating mechanical properties of osteoporotic bone and bone-repair effect of bone tissue engineering."

Sixteen couples (42.1%) attained ongoing pregnancy. Using logistic regression analysis only the result of the Oxisperm® (P = 0.047) and the HaloSperm G2® for DNA fragmentation (P < 0.0001) were significantly associated with the occurrence of pregnancy, whereas neither the conventional semen characteristics, nor the outcome of multiple other tests were significantly related (P > 0.05). Based on the logistic regression analysis the following formula could be derived: Logit(p) = 6.15–0.407 × (% halotest), whereby (p) is the probability of pregnancy, and % halotest is the proportion of spermatozoa showing DNA fragmentation in the HaloSperm G2® test. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83. In 16 out of 38 couples the IVF outcome, either positive or negative, could unequivocally be predicted, while in the remaining cases the probability of pregnancy was significantly related to the result of the formula.

Unfortunately many of schizophrenic patients suffer from persistent positive or negative symptoms that cannot be fully treated with available medication. With exploration on the possible causes of the disease there is evidence on dopaminergic transmission defects, there is a need to find more holistic way in treating the disease and a diet regimen could be one of them. Ketogenic diet, which is a popular diet regimen that consists in low-carbohydrate (about 30–50 g/day), medium-protein (up to 1 g/kg daily) and high-fat intake (around 80% of daily calories) mainly known for its helpful role in weight-loss. The key mechanism is to generate ketosis. A state in which ketones bodies in the blood provides energy part of the body's energy comes from ketone bodies in the blood. Possible hypothesis can be that ketogenic diet changes the ratio of GABA:glutamate in favor of GABA, by suppressing the catabolism and increasing the synthesis of GABA as well as glutamate metabolism, which could help to compensate the disrupted GABA levels in schizophrenic brain, leading to possible better outcome of the disease regarding symptomatology and preventing the weight-gain regarding some medications used and the correlating diseases responsible for weight gain."

Neural tube defects (NTDs) affect >300,000 children annually worldwide. The incidence of NTDs in Northern India (7.7/1000), is tenfold higher than in the US (0.7/1000). Higher rates were previously reported in Northern China. The causes of these trends have not been elucidated. Arsenic is a teratogen shown in animals to induce NTDs. The main potential sources for environmental arsenic exposure, groundwater and rice as a staple food, are high in India and China.
Objectives
To discuss the possible association between high environmental arsenic exposure through drinking water and rice with the high NTDs rates in these regions.
Discussion
Arsenic contamination of groundwater is the main source of environmental arsenic exposure. The locations of toxic arsenic regions in China and India correspond in most cases to the northern regions where the NTDs rates were high. Rice, the staple food in India and China, can absorb up to 10 times more arsenic than other crops, such as wheat and might further increase arsenic exposure.
Conclusions
We hypothesize that this NTD-arsenic in drinking water and rice association may explain why these areas in the northern regions of both countries have the highest incidence of NTDs. If proven true, this has major public health implications."

Conventional therapies as well as some recent approaches for the treatment of burned patients are currently in use. Nutritional therapy is also suggested as a supplementary option in major burns. Within this context, hormones involved in the regulation of appetite will have a paramount importance. The aim is to evaluate the interactions among ghrelin, some inflammatory parameters and the burn injury. Asprosin is also involved into this discussion due to its ghrelin-like actions. Aside from the consideration of insulin as well as stress hormones (cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine), an orexigenic, anti-inflammatory hormone, ghrelin affecting both metabolic and inflammatory systems is also involved in the protocols designed for burn treatment. Ghrelin’s actions exerted by way of growth-hormone secretagogue receptor, neuropeptide Y, agouti-related protein, proopiomelanocortin and gamma amino butyric acid are being investigated. Asprosin, one of the remarkably few hormones identified as appetite stimulator, acts as another orexigenic hormone by using almost the same signalling pathways as those of ghrelin. Interleukin-6 should also be evaluated both as a reliable biomarker of inflammation and also with its inhibitory effects on TNF-α within the scope of burn injury. In conclusion, treatment protocols during burn injury may be designed to raise decreased concentrations of ghrelin and to repress increased levels of inflammatory agents such as TNF-α. IL-6 may be evaluated from an entirely different aspect. The potential therapeutic use of asprosin may be considered within an integrative approach with a focus on cachexia-anorexia developed in severe burn trauma."

When intracranial pressure rises, the drainage of excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the subarachnoid space of the cranial and spinal nerves increases. Higher CSF pressure irritates nerve fibers inside nerve root sheaths and may consequently cause radicular pain, as was reported in patients with IICH. Moreover, the cut-off of 20–25 cm H20 used to define IICH may be too high, as has been suggested in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. We hypothesize that the neurological symptoms of FM are caused by the dysregulation of cerebrospinal pressure (CSP) and that spinal fluid drainage can relieve this pain. Exploring the processes underlying increased CSP may provide an alternative explanation for the generation of unexplained widespread pain (WSP) and FM as opposed to central sensitization. Additionally, when performing a lumbar puncture for diagnostic reasons, it is useful to measure opening pressure in patients with chronic WSP."

In this report, the relationships between each of the major mental disorders and each neuropsychiatric component like personality, reward system, or reinforcement learning have been comprehensively reviewed to construct a new integrated structured model for assessing the overlapped mental conditions in primary care psychiatry. This new structured model contains the following three loops: “input-output-feedback loop” (external/environmental loop), “reward-learning loop” (learning loop), and “mood-reward sensitivity loop” (mood loop), which are connected by the functions of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. With this new concept, overlapped mental conditions in each psychiatric patient could be theoretically much simply and logically explained. In conclusion, with the proposed psychiatric structured model, we can simply explain and understand the overlapped mental disorders in each patient. Inventing and developing such basic psychiatric structured model would offer us new diagnostic and therapeutic tools to realize personalized medicine, especially in the field of primary care psychiatry."

Infections, poor nutritional status, chronic illness, fatigue, therapies or procedures performed during and after transport also negatively affect the immune system.

Most therapies and studies of trauma, brain trauma, stroke, immune suppression and their co-morbidities do not address nor discuss methods that promote immune system resuscitation or efficacy to support its role in post-trauma healing and rehabilitation. These omissions present an opportunity for using autologous stored naïve (unexposed to the current trauma and co-morbidities) white blood cell infusions (autologous white blood cell infusion) (AWBCI) to supplement treatment of most traumas, trauma-associated infections, other co-morbidities and immune suppression derived problems in order to improve the global standard of trauma care. We hypothesize to give the traumatized patients back their own immune system that has been ‘stored’ in some fashion, either cryogenically or just after or during the trauma event [surgery, etc for example]. We emphasize that other treatments should not be replaced – rather we suggest AWBCI as concurrent therapy. We present focused select animal and human studies as proofs of concept to arrive at and support our therapeutic suggestion and hypotheses, flowing historically from donor white blood cell therapy [DLI] to close cohort white blood cell therapy to autologous white blood cell infusion [AWBCI].

In reaction to the increasing availability of low quality data; we call for a rigorous debate into the validity of substituting big data for accurate data in health research. We evaluated the step counting accuracy of a smartphone app previously used by 717,527 people from 111 countries. Our new data (from 48 participants; aged 21–59 years; body mass index 17.7–33.5 kg/m2) revealed significant (15–66%) undercounting by Apple phones. In contrast to the generally positive performances of wearable devices for stereotypical treadmill like walking, we observed extraordinarily large (0–200% of steps taken) error ranges for both Android and Apple phones. Unconscious bias (developers’ perceptions of usual behaviour) may be embedded into many unvalidated smartphone apps. Consumer-grade wearable devices appear unsuitable to detect steps in people with slow, short or non-stereotypical gait patterns. Specifically, there is a risk of systematically undercounting the steps by obese people, females or people from different ethnic groups resulting in biases when reporting associations between physical inactivity and obesity. More research is required to develop smartphone apps suitable for all people of the heterogeneous global population."

It is hypothesized that the different types of bacteria will exhibit variations in their sensitivity to iron chelation based on differences in their iron metabolism. Bacteria with weaker iron access systems might have their growth reduced initially, but stronger species may also be suppressed. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are known to possess different iron acquisition systems, which may affect their response to iron chelation. Bacteria which can produce siderophores are at a particular advantage for iron acquisition. Novel iron chelators, which do not act as xenosiderophores, may be effective in depriving these bacteria of iron. This has implications for the treatment of polybacterial sepsis, which might be enhanced if the sensitivity to iron chelation of the primary causative agents is known."

There are unmet needs in ADT focus on non-monoaminergic agents. Accumulating evidence suggests that the N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) plays an important role in the neurobiology and treatment of major depressive disorder. The role of copper ions in pathogenesis and treatment of depression is not fully clarified, however interaction between copper and NMDAR is of prime importance. Release of copper ions inhibits NMDAR and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor function thus protects neurons from glutamatergic excitotoxity. Abnormalities in glutamatergic transmission are the key of glutamate hypothesis of depression. Some authors revealed that NMDARs are also regulated by cellular prion protein (PrPC) and indicated that interactions of copper, glycine and NMDARs subunits are vital for the regulation of the receptor. As NMDAR antagonist ketamine is known to produce rapid antidepressive effect, observation of copper serum levels in patients treated with ketamine may provide important information about connections between NMDAR antagonistic agents and trace elements antagonistic to that receptor. It is necessary to carry out further studies related to copper and ketamine in depression treatment."

abstract = "Transposable elements (TEs), also known as “jumping genes”, are DNA sequences first described by Nobel laureate Barbara McClintock that comprise nearly half of the human genome and are able to transpose or move from one genomic location to another. As McClintock also noted that a genome “shock” or stress may induce TE activation and transposition, accumulating evidence suggests that cellular stress (e.g. mediated by increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species [ROS] and calcium [Ca2+], etc.) induces TE mobilization in several model organisms and L1s (a member of the retrotransposon class of TEs) are active and capable of retrotransposition in human oocytes, human sperm, and in human neural progenitor cells. Cellular stress also plays a critical role in human placental development, with cytotrophoblast (CTB) differentiation leading to the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast (STB), a cellular layer that facilitates nutrient and gas exchange between the mother and the fetus. Syncytin-1, a protein that promotes fusion of CTB cells and is necessary for STB formation, and its receptor is found in human sperm and human oocytes, respectively, and increases in ROS and Ca2+ promote trophoblast differentiation and syncytin-1 expression. Cellular stress is also essential in promoting human oocyte maturation and activation which, similar to TE mobilization, can be induced by compounds that increase intracellular Ca2+ and ROS levels. AMPK is a master metabolic regulator activated by increases in ROS, Ca2+, and/or an AMP(ADP)/ATP ratio increase, etc. as well as compounds that induce L1 mobilization in human cells. AMPK knockdown inhibits trophoblast differentiation and AMPK-activating compounds that promote L1 mobility also enhance trophoblast differentiation. Cellular stressors that induce TE mobilization (e.g. heat shock) also promote oocyte maturation in an AMPK-dependent manner and the antibiotic ionomycin activates AMPK, promotes TE activation, and induces human oocyte activation, producing normal, healthy children. Metformin promotes AMPK-dependent telomerase activation (critical for telomere maintenance) and induces activation of the endonuclease RAG1 (promotes DNA cleavage and transposition) via AMPK. Both RAG1 and telomerase are derived from TEs. It is our hypothesis that cellular stress and AMPK links TE activation and transposition with placental development and oocyte activation, facilitating both human genome evolution and the creation of all human life. We also propose the novel observation that various cellular stress-inducing compounds (e.g. metformin, resveratrol, etc.) may facilitate beneficial TE activation and transposition and enhance fertilization and embryological development through a common mechanism of AMPK activation."

abstract = "Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a transcription factor expressed in all skin cells type. It responds to exogenous and endogenous chemicals by inducing/repressing the expression of several genes with toxic or protective effects in a wide range of species and tissues. In healthy skin, AhR signalling contributes to keratinocytes differentiation, skin barrier function, skin pigmentation, and mediates oxidative stress. In the last years, some studies have shown that AhR seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of some skin diseases, even if the currently available data are contradictory. Indeed, while the blocking the AhR signalling activity could prevent or treat skin cancer, the AhR activation seems to be advantageous for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. Therefore, for its multifaceted role in skin diseases, AhR seems to be an attractive therapeutic target. Indeed, recently some molecules have been identified for the prevention of skin cancer and the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases"

abstract = "Nasotracheal suctioning (NTS) is a procedure commonly performed by respiratory physiotherapists and nurses to remove excess respiratory secretions from the tracheobronchial tree in a self-ventilating, non-intubated and non-tracheotomized patient. NTS is an important treatment modality for patients with acute secretion retention who are at high risk of progressive respiratory deterioration and arrest. However, NTS is a blind invasive procedure with risk of serious adverse events, and the patient experience of NTS is often extremely negative. Capsaicin, a substance extracted from cayenne pepper, elicits reflex coughs when inhaled. It is hypothesized that capsaicin-induced reflex cough may offer an alternative treatment option to NTS. It is suggested that repeated reflex cough bouts, elicited through inhalation of nebulized capsaicin via a facemask, could achieve clearance of retained secretions from the tracheobronchial tree to the oropharynx, thereby avoiding the need for NTS. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary cough flow data from a stroke trial. Stroke patients underwent assessments of peak cough flow (PCF, a measure of cough effectiveness) of both maximal volitional cough and capsaicin-induced reflex cough. In a sub-group of 20 stroke patients with weak volitional cough (mean PCF 220 L/min, SD 80), PCF of capsaicin-induced reflex cough was on average 184 L/min (SD 130) higher than PCF of subjects’ maximal volitional cough effort. Cough flow traces indicate a pattern of cough augmentation during consecutive reflex cough bouts. It is suggested that the hypothesis may best be tested in a pragmatic applied clinical study, i.e. through the application of nebulized capsaicin in relevant clinical situations, as opposed to observational or experimental physiological studies."

Melanoma cells are known to be inherently resistant to the chemotherapy which results in poor outcomes and even failure of the therapy. For this reason, a better understanding of underlying mechanism of melanoma pathogenesis and resistance is required, so that more efficient and novel therapeutic strategies can be developed. Survivin is a protein which is overexpressed in melanoma cells and is known to impart resistance to them against apoptosis. Also, melanoma cells overexpress Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) angiogenic growth factors which lead to aggressive angiogenesis in melanoma cells thereby making the treatment more challenging. This hypothesis presents a combinatorial approach against melanoma where an anti-survivin agent and an anti-angiogenic agent are combined with a chemotherapeutic drug and loaded in surface functionalized liposomes in order to target specific mechanisms of melanoma, thus overcoming its resistance. Thus, the study aims to overcome the resistance of melanoma cells by developing a wise combination of drugs and achieve a higher response rate in resistant melanoma model, which is usually not achieved with the existing treatment modalities."

The use of salivary enzymes as biomarkers to detect the changes in oral tissue at the initial phase seems viable, because saliva is easy to obtain, it moisture oral mucosa and cells metabolic compounds can be found on it.

Among these effects are inflammatory process control, bone and muscle strength enhancement, protein expression regulation, and a decreased risk of developing some pathologies in which these processes are key, such as osteoporosis, dermatological inflammatory non-infectious maladies and diseases affecting the central nervous system. Experimental data have suggested that steroid hormone levels in plasma change after boric acid administration, but a clear mechanism behind these variations has not been established. We analyzed possibilities for these changes and hypothesized that boric acid disrupts the interactions between steroid hormones and several carriers in plasma. In particular, we proposed that there is an uncoupling of the interactions between sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and estrogens and testosterone and that there are alterations in the binding of hydrophobic ligands by other carrier proteins in plasma. Further experimental and computational studies are required to support the hypothesis that boric acid and probably other boron-containing compounds can displace steroid hormones from their plasma carriers. If such phenomena are confirmed, boron administration with a clear mechanism could be employed as a therapeutic agent in several diseases or physiological events that require modulation of steroid hormone levels in plasma."

abstract = "Delivery of large DNA constructs is necessary for combinatorial, anti-aging gene therapy. However, this is hindered by the lack of a non-inflammatory vector with sufficient packaging space and the ability to effectively spread through tissue. It is possible that a mitochondrion, altered to be able to secrete therapeutic proteins, could serve as an ideal gene delivery vector in this regard (for post-mitotic cells at least). Initial transfection of mitochondria with a therapeutic gene vector could be undertaken by MITO-Porter, i.e., a dual-layered fusogenic liposomal-based delivery system. Then, once a protein export pathway from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytoplasm is achieved via Sec translocon installation in the inner membrane (IM), three other components would be necessary for vector maintenance. First of all, fusion with other mitochondria must be prevented through mitofusin-cleaving protease expression on the outer membrane (OM). Second of all, mitophagy must be evaded via the expression of deubiquitylases (DUBs) on the OM. Third of all, free radical damage to the membrane over time could be prevented by shutting down electron transport chain (ETC) activity via destruction of the endogenous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inside the vector – and expression of an ATP import channel to harvest sufficient energy from the host cell. The most crucial part of this plan would be to achieve Sec translocon installation in the IM. The hypothesis of this article is that Sec translocon installation into the IM may be achieved using one of a few molecular methods described herein. It is possible that it could simply occur through gene expression from a mitochondrial matrix-localized gene construct and spontaneous (or Oxa1-assisted) insertion into the mitochondrial IM. Alternatively, it could be incorporated into the MITO-Porter IM prior to fusion with patient-derived mitochondria. Lastly, it may be sent to the mitochondrial IM via the TIM/TOM complex, although hydrophobic membrane proteins may fold prematurely in the cytoplasm before reaching the mitochondrial TIM/TOM complex. Regardless, SecYEG, when present in the IM to a small degree initially, should suffice to install more copies of itself from a mitochondrial matrix-localized gene vector. After proteins (with a C-terminal tag and autotransporter domain) have been sent to the intermembrane space from the matrix in unfolded form, the endogenous SAM complex would suffice to export them to the OM, where the relevant (passenger) domain may be cleaved off by an orthogonal protease and released into the cytoplasm."

abstract = "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occurs as a result of insufficient myocardial perfusion leading to cell necrosis. This is most commonly due to the obstruction of the coronary artery by ruptured atherosclerotic plaque and thrombosis. Damaged ischemic and necrotic myocardial cells release pro-inflammatory substances in tissue and plasma, leading to a systemic inflammatory response. Profound systemic inflammatory response during ischemia/reperfusion injury causes disruption of endothelial glycocalyx and detachment of endothelial cells that express von Willebrant factor (vWF). We hypothesize that circulating vWF+ endothelial cells could act as antigen presenting cells which interact with T and NK cells directly, by cell to cell contact and indirectly by cytokine and chemokine secretion, leading to the immune response towards inflammation. Analyzing the frequency, phenotype and pro-inflammatory substances produced in circulating vWF positive (+) cells in patients with AMI could be beneficial to determine the severity of the pro-inflammatory response, according to the level of endothelial dysfunction in the early period of AMI. To evaluate these hypotheses, we suggest to determine frequency, phenotype, and ability of cytokine/chemokine production in circulating vWF+ endothelial cells by simultaneous surface and intracellular cell staining, and flow cytometry analysis. Secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, pro-atherogenic substances and the components of glycocalyx might be measured in supernatants of magnetically separated or sorted vWF+ endothelial cells, as well as in the serum of a patient with acute AMI by enzyme linked–immunoassay tests. The interaction of increasing concentrations of isolated circulating vWF+ endothelial cells and cognate T and NK cells might be investigated by lymphocyte proliferation rate, cytotoxic mediators’ expression, and cytokine production. If our hypothesis is correct, characterization of circulating vWF+ endothelial cells could grant us greater insight into their role in pathophysiology of AMI and the degree of myocardial damage."

Whilst many observations have been made of physiological abnormalities, how these explain the condition and who does and doesn’t develop CRPS remains unclear. We propose a new overarching hypothesis to explain the condition that invokes four dynamically changing and interacting components of tissue trauma, pathological pain processing, autonomic dysfunction (both peripheral and central) and immune dysfunction, primarily involving excessive and pathological activation of dendritic cells following trauma or atrophy. We outline pathophysiological changes that may initiate a cascade of events involving dendritic cells and the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway resulting in the condition, and the changes that maintain the condition into its chronic phase. This hypothesis should provide fertile ground for further investigations and development of new treatments that holistically address the nature of the disorder along its developmental continuum."

In this review, published findings are presented that support the novel concept that withdrawal from benzodiazepine class drugs can trigger elevated and sustained levels of a potent oxidant called peroxynitrite via potentiation of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, and in the later stages of withdrawal, via excessive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity, as well. Potentiation of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and excessive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity both result in calcium influx into the cell that triggers nitric oxide synthesis. In pathophysiological conditions, such increased nitric oxide synthesis leads to peroxynitrite formation. The downstream effects of peroxynitrite formation that may occur during withdrawal ultimately lead to further peroxynitrite production in a system of overlapping vicious cycles collectively referred to as the NO/ONOO(−) cycle. Once triggered, the elements of the NO/ONOO(−) cycle perpetuate pathophysiology, perhaps including reduced GABAA receptor functioning, that may explain protracted withdrawal associated symptoms while the vicious cycle nature of the NO/ONOO(−) cycle may explain how withdrawal becomes a chronic state. Suboptimal levels of tetrahydrobiopterin may be one risk factor for the development of the protracted withdrawal syndrome as this will lead to partial nitric oxide uncoupling and resultant peroxynitrite formation. Nitric oxide uncoupling results in superoxide production as calcium-dependent nitric oxide synthases attempt to produce nitric oxide in response to L-type voltage-gated calcium channel-mediated calcium influx that is known to occur during withdrawal. The combination of nitric oxide and superoxide produced, as when partial uncoupling occurs, react together in a very rapid, diffusion limited reaction to form peroxynitrite and thereby trigger the NO/ONOO(−) cycle. The NO/ONOO(−) cycle may explain the nature of the protracted withdrawal syndrome and the related constellation of symptoms that are also common in other illnesses characterized as NO/ONOO(−) disorders such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia."

While the best way to rid society of drug addiction is to prevent it from occurring in the first place, this is highly unlikely in the near future given the many ways that individuals can be first exposed to some potentially addicting substance. When an addiction is established, the first treatment for it is detoxification, but the insidious nature of addiction is its propensity to relapse. Too often, detoxified addicts resume drug use despite knowing that they are exposing themselves to serious, sometimes fatal, consequences. In an attempt to ward off relapse following detoxification, drug treatment centers, clinics, rehabilitation facilities, half-way houses, etc., offer different types of programs to help addicts stay clean. Examples of such treatments are 12-step programs, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), faith-based programs, and so forth. In addition, narcotics like methadone and suboxone, are sometimes prescribed to control the cravings that drive relapse, but this approach simply substitutes one drug for another. We now hypothesize that the auditory system can be used as a sensory conduit to modify the hijacked brain reward system of recently-detoxified addicts. As a rationale for this hypothesis, we present evidence from basic science studies showing the effect of music (the sensory input) on the brain, and from clinical trials employing music in a variety of neurological conditions. We then summarize an IRB-approved randomized control trial we performed to determine if our sound intervention could reduce the probability of relapse in recently-detoxified subjects.

Eighteen healthy participants volunteered for the study (10 males and 8 females). Temperature (core and skin) were recorded pre- and post (immediately and every 5 min until 35 min post) exposure to a single bout of WBC (30 s at −60 °C, 150 s at −110 °C). From both core and skin temperatures a bio-heat transfer model was applied which led to the analytical formulation of the body thermal resistance. An unsteady behavior presenting a similar time-evolution trend in the body insulative response is shown for both females and males, possibly due to the vasodilatation process following an intense peripheral vasoconstriction during the extreme cold. Females present a 37% higher inner thermal resistance than males when reaching an asymptotical thermal state at rest due to a higher concentration of body fat percentage. Adiposity of tissues inherent in fat mass percentage appears to be a key parameter in the body thermal resistance to be taken into account in the definition of appropriate protocols for males and females. The conclusions of this preliminary study suggest that in order to achieve the same skin effects on temperature and consequently to cool efficiency tissues in the same way, the duration of cryotherapy protocols should be shorter when considering female compared to male."

Recently, research has focused on better understanding the factors that increase an individual’s risk of suffering a HSI, with both lower strength (particularly eccentric strength) and shorter hamstring muscle fascicles found to play a significant role. Such findings have led to an increased popularization of eccentric hamstring exercises, such as the Nordic Hamstring Exercise, the correct utilization of which has been shown to reduce HSI rates. However, despite the robust evidence of their efficacy, adherence to eccentric loading exercises is often poor, with concerns about soreness often cited. Here, we advance the hypothesis that the utilization of genetic information will, in the future, allow for the optimization of HSI prevention programmes, both in terms of training adaptations, and both muscle damage and soreness in the acute phase of post-training recovery. We also discuss whether this information could be utilised in sport in order to predict HSI injury. Such an hypothesis, if correct, could have important implications for the implementation of injury prevention programmes, particularly with regards to adherence, which evidence suggests is currently a major barrier to the utilization of eccentric hamstring exercises."

abstract = "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a highly prevalent medical condition and amajor cardiovascular risk factor. Obesity is present in ∼70% of patients with OSA, nevertheless, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation – the gold standard therapy for moderate and severe OSA – has no appreciable long-term beneficial effects on obesity, body composition, energy metabolism, physical activities or the incidence of major cardiovascular events. Therefore, effective weight loss strategies in conjunction with CPAP therapy in OSA are critically needed. Since lifestyle interventions may positively impact body weight, there is a strong rationale to testing the hypothesis that Erikson coaching intervention as a form of lifestyle intervention to obese patients with OSA may increase their adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviour and thus result in weight reduction, improved body composition (reduction in %body fat) and improvements in glucose and lipid metabolism. There are three lines of evidence to justify testing this hypothesis: First, health coaching significantly facilitates uptake of healthy behaviours across a broad variety of chronic conditions; second, several randomized clinical trials suggested positive impact of health coaching on weight management and on cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight/obese otherwise healthy persons; third, Erickson coaching approach empowers the three key elements of health coaching (patient-centeredness, patient-determined goals, use of a self-discovery process) further, namely by introducing two other specific core elements into the coaching process: a) solution-focus and outcome frame, b) orientation at the patient-formulated positive outcomes (i.e., positive values resulting from behavioural change). Importantly, results of our recent pilot observational cohort study suggested that Erickson coaching is a powerful tool to address behavioural modification in obesity. In conclusion, testing our hypothesis may have significant clinical implications: if clinical randomized trials indicate that Erickson health coaching is an efficient approach to behavioural change and weight management in OSA then combining Erickson coaching with CPAP therapy may result in reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these high-risk patients."

The purpose of our study was to investigate the molecular mechanism and possible role of miR-146a in human neuroblastoma. In this study, targeted genes were predicted by bioinformatic analysis and confirmed by dual-Luciferase reporter assay. The expression level of miR-146a in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line was detected by quantitative RT-PCR. We used flow cytometric analysis to determine apoptosis and necrosis of SK-N-SH cells after transfection with miR-146a inhibitor, miR-146a mimic, and negative controls. The expression level of target genes was detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting. We identified BCL11A as a target of miR-146a. Thus, miR-146a targets the 3′UTR of BCL11A and inhibits its mRNA and protein expression. Overexpression of miR-146a can inhibit the growth and promote the apoptosis of human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells through inhibiting the expression of BCL11A. Furthermore, we found that upregulation of BCL11A by miR-146a inhibitor can promote SK-N-SH cells growth and protect SK-N-SH cells against apoptosis. Our results showed that miR-146a is a potential tumor suppressor gene in human neuroblastoma via directly targeting BCL11A. These findings suggest that miR-146a might be a new candidate target for treatment of human neuroblastoma."

abstract = "The theory of breast cancer as a child deficiency disease is an inversion of the current paradigm, which considers full-term pregnancies to be a protective factor and uses nulliparous women as the reference group. Instead, the theory of breast cancer as a child deficiency disease says that women with the highest parity (about 20, which is the limit of human fertility) are those with the lowest risk and should be used as the reference group in risk estimations. This theory is explained biologically by converting parity from the simple value of number of children into an understanding of the long-lasting biological and immunological effects of pregnancy. These effects can be reflected, as measured by functional genomics, in gene expression of the immune cells in the blood. Each pregnancy represents a unique fetus or semi-allograft, which provokes the creation and deposit of memory cell clones in the mother. Gene expression levels have been found to change linearly with number of full-term pregnancies in healthy women, but not in breast cancer patients. High hormone levels are necessary for a successful pregnancy, as they modulate the immune response from adaptive to innate in order to protect the fetus (considered as a semi-allograft) from rejection. At the end of the pregnancy, hormone levels drop, and the immune system recognizes the semi-allograft, but not in time for rejection to occur before birth. High hormones levels are also classified as carcinogens illustrating that carcinogenesis in the breast could be viewed as a war or balance between later exposures to hormonal carcinogens and the protection of the immune system. We propose that breast tumors are pseudo semi-allografts made up of transformed breast tissue cells. Assuming that the sensitivity to the exposure to increased levels of endogenous or exogenous hormones in women with breast cancer mimic those that occur in pregnancy, these breast tumor cells are protected against the body’s immune reaction, just as the fetus is during pregnancy. However, with more pregnancies, the potential to eradicate the pseudo semi-allograft might increase due to enhanced immune surveillance. The theory of breast cancer as a child deficiency disease proposes that the protective effect of pregnancy on breast cancer incidence via the immune system is independent of other risk factors."

abstract = "Introduction
Lithium is a medication used to treat bipolar disorder and may also prevent cognitive decline and suicide. Lithium is also found naturally, in levels well below clinical doses, in drinking water worldwide, and levels have been inversely associated with rates of psychiatric disorders. Lead (Pb) is another element in the environment but is a toxin of public health concern. Negative effects of chronic lead exposure and possible benefits of environmental lithium exposure appear complementary.
Hypothesis
Exposure to environmental lithium has associated benefits, which may be due to the mitigation of lead toxicity by lithium.
Methods
A series of reviews tested each element of the hypothesis. A systematic review clarified the psychiatric and medical correlates of lithium in drinking water. Non-systematic reviews clarified the harms of environmental lead, summarized experimental studies of lithium used to prevent lead toxicity, and explored overlapping biological mechanisms in lithium and lead exposure.
Results
Higher levels of lithium in drinking water were associated with lower suicide rates in 13 of 15 identified studies. While fewer studies were available for other outcomes, lithium was associated with lower rates of homicide, crime, dementia, and mortality. Lead was reported to be ubiquitous in the environment, and chronic low-level exposure has been associated with adverse effects, including effects opposite to the outcomes associated with lithium. Animal studies demonstrated that lithium pre-treatment mitigates lead toxicity. Neurophysiological correlates of lead and lithium exposure overlap.
Conclusions
Microdose lithium is associated with better psychiatric and medical outcomes, which are complementary to harms of environmental lead exposure. Experimental animal evidence is supportive, and lead and lithium impact overlapping neurophysiologic pathways. Therefore, several lines of circumstantial evidence suggest that lithium protects against the neurotoxic effects of lead. Further studies are required to clarify the benefits and mechanisms of low-dose lithium. There are significant public health implications if this paper's hypothesis is true."

Its significance is relatively well-known today but it seems that all aspects of its activities are not fully understood. Persian medicine (PM) has special views on the function of spleen; many side effects were reported in PM due to spleen dysfunction. On the other hand nowadays splenectomy as a treatment strategy is recommended for some disorders and increasing risk of infections is considered as the most important long term side effect of that. In this study, we hypothesize that splenectomy may have more side effects than currently proven. According to PM, spleen is in close connection with liver, cardiovascular system, stomach, bone, brain and skin, and that is why any kind of spleen dysfunction leads to change in blood viscosity, appetite and bone strength, liver dysfunction, mood and skin disorders, cancer formation and fever. Considering this viewpoint it can be hypothesized such side effects may also occur after splenectomy. Proven complications of splenectomy include hypercoagulated state, cardiovascular events and infectious diseases but there is also some evidence about increased risk of cancer, skin disease like systemic lupus erythematosus, mood disorder such as depression, defective bone formation and impairment of immunity which can be considered as different levels of evidence to confirm the hypothesis. But for some others such as changes in appetite, there are no studies let alone convincing evidence. Future research about theses possible complications may lead to novel results."

The mechanism of damage is inflammation which can be chronic or acute. An optimal microbial flora includes a wide range of pathogenic bacteria in low dose. This allows specific immunity to be developed and maintained with minimal inflammatory damage. Human milk has evolved to deliver an optimal microbial flora to the infant. Cow’s milk has the potential, following appropriate fortification, to maintain an optimal human microbial flora throughout life. Yoghurt is a fermented milk product in which bacteria normally present in milk convert sugars to lactic acid. The acid suppresses the growth of pathogens in the oral cavity, oropharynx and oesophagus. Thus yoghurt can restore an optimal flora in these regions in the short term. Since bacteria are transported between epithelial surfaces, yoghurt will also optimise the flora elsewhere. The judicious use of milk and yogurt could prevent a high proportion of human disease."

Although thrombosis is a result of activated blood coagulation, no explanation is being offered for the persistent presence of fibrin deposits in the affected organs. A classic example is stroke, in which the thrombolytic therapy is effective only during the first 3–4 h after the onset of thrombosis. This phenomenon can now be explained in terms of the modification of fibrinogen structure induced by hydroxyl radicals generated during the period of ischemia caused, in turn, by the blocking of the blood flow within the obstructed vessels. Fibrinogen modification involves intra-to intermolecular disulfide rearrangement induced by the reductive power of hydroxyl radicals that result in the exposition of buried hydrophobic epitopes. Such epitopes react readily with each other forming linkages stronger than the peptide covalent bonds, thus rendering them resistant to the proteolytic degradation. Also, limited reduction of human serum albumin (HSA) generates hydrophobic polymers that form huge insoluble complexes with fibrinogen. Consequently, such insoluble copolymers can be deposited within the circulation of various organs leading to their dysfunction. In conclusion, the study of protein hydrophobic interactions induced by a variety of nutritional and/or environmental factors can provide a rational explanation for a number of pathologic conditions including cardiovascular, neurologic, and other degenerative diseases including cancer."

abstract = "Aerial perspective illusion is a feature of visual perception where landscapes appear relatively close in clear light and distant in dim light. We hypothesized that bright sunlight might cause drivers to perceive distant terrain as relatively close and misinterpret the approach speed of surrounding landscape as unduly slow. This hypothesis would mean, in turn, that drivers in bright sunlight may underestimate their progress on the road, compensate by traveling at a faster baseline speed, and ultimately increase the prevailing risk of a life-threatening traffic crash. We conducted three pilot studies to illustrate how the illusion might contribute to a life- threatening traffic crash. The first illustration used a questionnaire to demonstrate that most respondents were mistaken when judging the distance between simple balls in different positions. The second illustration involved an experimental manipulation to assess whether aerial perspective influenced judgments about the relative positions of vehicles in traffic. The third illustration analyzed a segment of high-volume fast-speed traffic and found an increased frequency of speeding under bright sunlight. Together with past work based on the visual arts, these examples illustrate how an aerial perspective illusion can affect distance perception, may appear in realistic traffic situations, and could potentially contribute to the risk of a life-threatening traffic crash. An awareness of this hypothesis might lead to applications on how optical illusions could extend to everyday traffic and might potentially inform safety warnings to prevent life- threatening crashes."

abstract = "This etiologic model proposes that Alzheimers Disease (AD) arises when an unusually rapid increase in ventricle volume triggers axon stretch that culminates in the physical separation of trans-synaptic proteins. As a result, these proteins, such as neurexin, neuroligin, N-Cadherin and Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), experience a change in the configuration of their cytoplasmic tail, so that instead of transmitting signals to create and maintain synaptic structure they activate enzymes, and generate molecules, that stimulate neurite growth; for example, the transformation of the N-Cadherin tail dissolves its complex with presenilin and β-catenin triggering activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and cytoskeletal disruption. This disruption leads to an increase in pro nerve growth factor (proNGF), a molecule that stimulates neurite growth via the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75). GSK3β contributes to this growth by increasing microtubule instability through the phosphorylation of tau. Separation of trans-synaptic APPs leads to their cis dimerization and this stimulates production of amyloid beta (Aβ), an autocrine growth factor that interacts with both the p75 and alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Cis dimerization of APPs may also allow the autophosphorylation of Y682 and T668 in the APP cytoplasmic tail, triggering activation of c-Jun N terminal kinase, Abelson kinase and cyclin dependent kinase 5, all of which play a role in neurite growth. ProNGF, Aβ and the kinase cascades work together to transform synapses into growth cones and stimulate sprouting of neuropil threads in an attempt to reconnect axons and dendrites. Neurofibrillary tangles, located in neural cell soma, consist of neurofilaments and microtubules needed to fuel this renewal of neurite growth. The model suggests that the best way to treat AD is to prevent synaptic separation by identifying individuals experiencing unusually high rates of ventricle growth and reducing this to more normal levels by shunting or some other technique."

The objective of the present study was to review the histopathology in the original articles by authors Kleinman and Marks that described the specificity of the classical metaphyseal lesion for child abuse and to determine if there were any oversights in the authors’ analysis.
Methods
We reviewed the histopathology of the original studies that equated the classical metaphyseal lesion with child abuse. We compared this with the histopathology of metaphyseal fractures caused by known accidental, severe trauma in children and reviewed the histopathology of artifacts that can sometimes be produced in bone histology preparations.
Results
Acute classical metaphyseal lesions showed no hemorrhage, and the chronic classical metaphyseal showed islands of cartilage proliferation at the metaphyses and growth plate, findings consistent with rickets and other metabolic bone disorders. Some of the acute metaphyseal lesions were consistent with artifacts.
Conclusion
We believe the original studies that equate the classical metaphyseal lesion with child abuse are flawed. The most compelling observation that challenges the histopathology of the classical metaphyseal lesion as being a fracture is the absence of hemorrhage in the acute classical metaphyseal lesion. We hypothesize that some of the classical metaphyseal lesions were artifacts or represent metabolic bone disorders that were not considered and that these two non-traumatic explanations may have been the basis of the abnormal bone findings."

One of the dose limiting factors of this therapy is radiation induced heart damage that results from mediastinal radiation. Recently statins, a medication typically used to lower cholesterol levels, have been suggested as a prophylactic treatment to potentially mitigate this process. Similarly, we hypothesized whether colchicine, an anti-inflammatory medication that is presently used in the treatment of gout and pericarditis, might be used to prevent coronary artery disease induced by radiation therapy. We hypothesize that colchicine may help prevent the deleterious effect on coronary arteries induced by radiation therapy by inhibiting inflammation and platelet aggregation. The pathophysiology of radiation induced coronary artery disease is similar to that of coronary artery disease in the general population. Inflammation, fibrosis and platelet aggregation play a key role in this process. After radiation therapy, inflammation occurs, recruiting leukocytes, particularly neutrophils and monocytes. Neutrophils are fibrotic mediators, and macrophages form foam cells in the intimal layer of the vessel wall, leading to the build-up of atherosclerotic plaques. Platelet aggregation, both initially and upon plaque rupture, is also a culprit in exacerbating radiation damage. Colchicine is known to inhibit microtubule polymerization and therefore inhibits mitosis, neutrophil motility and has been shown to decrease platelet aggregation. Its anti-inflammatory properties have been attributed to several different effects based on microtubule dysfunction. Colchicine has also been shown to affect the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, leukocytes, and to decrease activation of thrombin induced platelet aggregation. There is evidence to suggest that colchicine may be beneficial in the treatment of radiation induced coronary artery disease due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant properties. This idea would be beneficial for future studies."

Apolipoprotein E is a protein coded by APOE gene containing 4 exons, located on chromosome 19q13.2. It is among the key regulators of various crucial body functions such as lipid transport, apoptosis, vitamin k pathway, and cognition, hence, it is highly suspected to play a pivotal role in the nociception process. However, very few studies have tried and succeeded to find a direct involvement of APOE in pain processing. The current article attempts to throw light on some of the major clinical research findings which strengthen the hypothesis stating that apolipoprotein E has a concealed yet deeply embedded association with the pain regulating pathways, through several underlying physiological, biochemical and neurological processes, that in turn, decide the fate of pain sensation in a complex manner."

This hypothesis was tested by carrying out the first pilot study of its kind to determine whether the non-invasive technique of neuromuscular taping can reduce blood pressure in patients suffering from systemic arterial hypertension. Neuromuscular taping was symmetrically applied to the back, between C1 and T2, of seven hypertensive patients for 5–7 days. Cardiovascular autonomic parameters were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. Taping was associated with falls in mean arterial blood pressure (p = .001), mean systolic blood pressure (p < .01), mean diastolic pressure (p < .01) and cardiac vagal tone at rest (p = .063). The beneficial effects on blood pressure appeared to last for at least five days post-neuromuscular taping. There is an indication, given the reduction in cardiac vagal tone at rest, that the mechanism of action of this intervention involves modulation of the brainstem parasympathetic system during cardiovascular control. Further studies are indicated to replicate the present findings, further investigate the effects of taping on autonomic functioning, and establish the optimum time-period and taping positioning."

abstract = "Gene expression is crucial and tightly regulated to steer the development, differentiation, proliferation and even apoptosis of a cell. Each cell and tissue type shows a unique repertoire of transcription factors. Tissue micro-environmental regulation of epigenetic signature of a gene has been documented in many cases. Epigenetic factors play a significant role in the regulation of gene expression. KLF4 is a well-known transcription factor regulating the expression of several genes including hTERT. KLF4 functions both as a tumor suppressor and oncogene depending on cell type. hTERT, upregulated in the majority of cancers as against its undetectable expression in differentiated cells, is one of the target genes for KLF4. Here we hypothesize that KLF4 differentially regulates epigenetic modification of the promoter of hTERT and consequently its expression in different tissue microenvironments. The proposed hypothesis explains the dual role of KLF4 in two different tissue microenvironments with respect to the regulation of hTERT expression. Since both KLF4 and hTERT are key molecules to maintain the stemness and immortality of cancer cells, defining the crosstalk between these two molecules may open new avenues for cancer therapeutics. Also, exploring the proposed hypothesis may unravel the cause of ambiguous nature of KLF4 in carcinogenesis."

In this paper, we present the hypothesis that the vasculature's robustness against risk factor load will complement conventional risk factor models as a novel stratifier of risk. Figuratively speaking, mortality risk prediction without robustness scoring is akin to predicting the breaking risk of a lake's ice sheet considering load only while disregarding the sheet's bearing strength. Taking the cue from systems biology, which defines robustness as the ability to maintain function against internal and external challenges, we develop a robustness score from the physical parameters that comprehensively quantitate cardiovascular function. We derive the functional parameters using a recently introduced novel system, VascAssist 2 (iSYMED GmbH, Butzbach, Germany). VascAssist 2 (VA) applies the electronic-hydraulic analogy to a digital model of the arterial tree, replicating non-invasively acquired pule pressure waves by modulating the electronic equivalents of the physical parameters that describe in vivo arterial hemodynamics. As the latter is also subject to aging-associated degeneration which (a) progresses at inter-individually different rates, and which (b) affects the biomarker-mortality association, we express the robustness score as a correction factor to calendar age (CA), the dominant risk factor in all CVD risk factor models. We then propose a method for the validation of the score against known time-to-event data in reference populations. Our conceptualization of robustness implies that risk factor-challenged individuals with low robustness scores will face preferential elimination from the population resulting in a significant robustness-CA correlation in this strata absent in the unchallenged stratum. Hence, we also present an outline of a cross-sectional study design suitable to test this hypothesis. We finally discuss the objections that may validly be raised against our robustness hypothesis, and how available evidence encourages us to refute these objections."

The Alu element is the most abundant potential source of non-coding RNA in the human genome represented by over 1.1 million copies totaling ∼10% of the genome's mass. Accumulation of “Alu RNA” was observed in the brains of individuals with dementia and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease – a degenerative brain disorder. “Alu RNAs” activate inflammatory pathways and apoptosis in the non-neural cells. In particular, the “Alu RNA” cytotoxicity is suggested as a mechanism in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a compartment damaged in the process of age-related macular degeneration. In RPE cells, the deficiency of Dicer is reported to lead to an accumulation of P3Alu transcripts, subsequent activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, and the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome. In turn, these events result in RPE cell death by apoptosis. Importantly, RPE cells are of neuroectodermal origin, these cells display more similarity to neurons than to other epithelial cells. Thus, it is plausible that the mechanisms of “Alu RNA” cytotoxicity in brain neurons are similar to that in RPE. We hypothesize that accumulation of polymerase III-transcribed noncoding RNA of Alu (P3Alu) may contribute to both neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other degenerative brain disorders. This hypothesis points toward a novel molecular pathway not previously considered for the treatment of AD."

Application of machine learning algorithms to such data could find diagnostic utility as biomarkers both to define the presence of the disorder and to quantitate its severity and find myriad applications in a developmental pipeline towards therapeutics and cure. Recent epigenomic studies have uncovered a wealth of clinically important data relating to synapse-nucleus signalling, memory storage, lineage-fate determination and cellular control and are contributing greatly to our understanding of all SUD’s. Epigenetics interacts extensively with glycobiology. Glycans decorate DNA, RNA and many circulating critical proteins particularly immunoglobulins. Glycosylation is emerging as a major information-laden post-translational protein modification with documented application for biomarker development. The integration of these two emerging cutting-edge technologies provides a powerful and fertile algorithmic-bioinformatic space for the development both of SUD biomarkers and novel cutting edge therapeutics. Hypotheses: These lines of evidence provide fertile ground for hypotheses relating to both diagnosis and treatment. They suggest that biomarkers derived from epigenomics complemented by glycobiology may potentially provide a bedside diagnostic tool which could be developed into a clinically useful biomarker to gauge both the presence and the severity of SUD's. Moreover they suggest that modern information-based therapeutics acting on the epigenome, via RNA interference or by DNA antisense oligonucleotides may provide a novel 21st century therapeutic development pipeline towards the radical cure of addictive disorders. Such techniques could be focussed and potentiated by neurotrophic vectors or the application of interfering electric or magnetic fields deep in the medial temporal lobes of the brain."

Interestingly, few studies are designed to examine sports related benefits of resistance exercise while including a proper control group to account for adaptations to simply performing the sports related task. Much of our knowledge on resistance exercise for sport is based off cross-sectional work showing that stronger athletes tend to perform at the highest level, along with cross-sectional work demonstrating that higher levels of strength are associated with various performance related parameters. Although there is a large body of cross-sectional literature providing a rationale for resistance exercise for sport, its implementation is largely based on the following: 1) An increase in muscle size will produce an increase in strength and 2) a stronger muscle will increase sports performance. However, there is a lack of evidence to support these assumptions. The weight of evidence suggests that resistance exercise may indirectly impact sports performance through injury prevention, as opposed to directly improving sport related abilities."

A number of studies have shown that myofibroblasts are main target cells of 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibitory action. The myofibroblast in the palmar aponeurosis of patients in different stages of Dupuytren’s disease was found by electron microscopy to contain a large number of mitochondria. Mitochondria play a critical role in cell metabolism being the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells. TGF-β1 has been shown to increase mitochondrial ROS production in different cell types, which mediate fibrosis related gene expression and myofibroblast differentiation. TGF-β1 increases mitochondrial ROS production in patients with Dupuytren’s contracture potentially in consequence of Vitamin D deficiency, leading to myofibroblast differentiation. Thus, targeting this basic pathomechanism seems suitable to establish new treatment strategies."

The small vessel vasculitides granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis are associated with autoantibodies to neutrophil cytoplasm antigens (ANCA), principally proteinase-3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). There is an association between GPA and nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus. The recent finding that S. aureus produces proteins that bind tightly to and block the function of both PR3 and MPO suggests a mechanism for ANCA formation. The bacterial protein-autoantigen conjugate is recognised by B cells with ANCA specificity, internalised, and the bacterial protein processed and presented to T cells with specificity for bacterial peptides. The T cell can then provide help to the B cell, allowing class switching, affinity maturation and the production of pathogenic ANCA. This mechanism predicts that T cells with this specificity will be found in patients, and that the bacterial protein-autoantigen conjugate will be particularly efficient at eliciting ANCA production."

But despite its prevalence and extensive study, a coherent pathology model describing androgenic alopecia’s precursors, biological step-processes, and physiological responses does not yet exist. While consensus is that androgenic alopecia is genetic and androgen-mediated by dihydrotestosterone, questions remain regarding dihydrotestosterone’s exact role in androgenic alopecia onset. What causes dihydrotestosterone to increase in androgenic alopecia-prone tissues? By which mechanisms does dihydrotestosterone miniaturize androgenic alopecia-prone hair follicles? Why is dihydrotestosterone also associated with hair growth in secondary body and facial hair? Why does castration (which decreases androgen production by 95%) stop pattern hair loss, but not fully reverse it? Is there a relationship between dihydrotestosterone and tissue remodeling observed alongside androgenic alopecia onset? We review evidence supporting and challenging dihydrotestosterone’s causal relationship with androgenic alopecia, then propose an evidence-based pathogenesis model that attempts to answer the above questions, account for additionally-suspected androgenic alopecia mediators, identify rate-limiting recovery factors, and elucidate better treatment targets. The hypothesis argues that: (1) chronic scalp tension transmitted from the galea aponeurotica induces an inflammatory response in androgenic alopecia-prone tissues; (2) dihydrotestosterone increases in androgenic alopecia-prone tissues as part of this inflammatory response; and (3) dihydrotestosterone does not directly miniaturize hair follicles. Rather, dihydrotestosterone is a co-mediator of tissue dermal sheath thickening, perifollicular fibrosis, and calcification – three chronic, progressive conditions concomitant with androgenic alopecia progression. These conditions remodel androgenic alopecia-prone tissues – restricting follicle growth space, oxygen, and nutrient supply – leading to the slow, persistent hair follicle miniaturization characterized in androgenic alopecia. If true, this hypothetical model explains the mechanisms by which dihydrotestosterone miniaturizes androgenic alopecia-prone hair follicles, describes a rationale for androgenic alopecia progression and patterning, makes sense of dihydrotestosterone’s paradoxical role in hair loss and hair growth, and identifies targets to further improve androgenic alopecia recovery rates: fibrosis, calcification, and chronic scalp tension."

We have observed from published scientific literature that HSA has the potential to control cholesterol biosynthesis due to its pseudoesterase activity.

Incidentally, Tyr411 is a critical moiety for pseudoesterase activity of albumin. With this frame of reference in mind we hypothesize that pseudoesterase activity of HSA is an important determinant of lipid metabolism including cholesterol biosynthesis. Therefore, albumin has the potential to influence the atherosclerotic state important for pathogenesis of coronary artery diseases."

Methods
The data were acquired from EEGs being recorded under resting conditions. Target variables are not the usually employed absolute values of the spectral parameters but rather their change being calculated from successive recordings with a single subjects design.
Rationale
Since the resting-EEG does not provide specific information, we had to decide what else might be addressed by that method.
Conclusions
Our hypothesis according to which the SR-EEG indicates Selye’s behaviorally non-specific General Adaptation Syndrome is based on good evidence.
Main findings
Dynamic pattern comparison between subsequent EEGs on the single case level is a hitherto neglected method, which may be utilize, for instance, with regard to objective therapeutic outcome assessment.
Significance
In order to substantiate the clinical meaningfulness of our new approach we report two case vignettes of psychiatric impairments. Apart from that, our procedure should provide the desperately needed objective assessment of the therapeutic effect with any disease displaying a certain proportion of unspecific symptoms."

No single theory can fully explain the four cardinal features of MPS; taut bands, local tenderness, local twitching and the characteristic pattern of referred pain. Bridging the gap between basic and clinical knowledge mandates coupling the local trigger point changes with the clinically seen distant somatically innervated referred pain. The main question addressed by the present theory is why do trigger points behave differently in comparison to the surrounding muscle tissue and are trigger points the primary problem or secondary to a primary pathology. We propose that trigger points have an extra-innervation system that connect them with other spinal structures such as the facet, the annulus and other trigger points with a role for the subcutaneous fascia as part of trigger points pathogenesis or passage for the extra-innervation. The extra-innervation system is Subcutaneous accessory pain system (SAPS). The novel SAPS system connecting trigger points to the spinal segments via dorsal rami is presented. Individuals with this accessory pathway are prone to myofascial pain, trigger point activation and segmental referred somatic pain similar to other axial spinal structures. Despite the high prevalence of myofascial pain, the mechanism is not universally agreed upon. Why do the trigger points act differently from surrounding muscle tissue and are almost constant in location in different individuals is controversial. Why does myofascial pain and its two components, trigger points and referred pain, exist or are more prevalent in some individuals than in others is unexplained. The correlation between axial spinal structures pathology and the trigger points is not explored well. The existing theories about trigger point formation and referred pain is scientifically credible for each separate component and the SAPS novel system can provide the link between the two."

Indoor workers have higher incidence and mortality rates of CMM than outdoor workers; CMM occurs in body locations never exposed to sunlight; CMM incidence is increasing in spite of use of UV blocking agents and small changes in solar radiation. Installation of two new fluorescent lights in the milking parlor holding area of a Minnesota dairy farm in 2015 caused an immediate drop in milk production. This lead to measurement of body amperage in humans exposed to modern non-incandescent lighting. People exposed to old and new fluorescent lights, light emitting diodes (LED) and compact fluorescent lights (CFL) had body amperage levels above those considered carcinogenic. We hypothesize that modern electric lighting is a significant health hazard, a carcinogen, and is causing increasing CMM incidence in indoor office workers and tanning bed users. These lights generate dirty electricity (high frequency voltage transients), radio frequency (RF) radiation, and increase body amperage, all of which have been shown to be carcinogenic. This could explain the failure of ultraviolet blockers to stem the malignant melanoma pandemic. Tanning beds and non-incandescent lighting could be made safe by incorporating a grounded Faraday cage which allows passage of ultraviolet and visible light frequencies and blocks other frequencies. Modern electric lighting should be fabricated to be electrically clean."

abstract = "Introduction
Dry eye disease is a multifactorial disease which affects the ocular surface system, and determines ocular discomfort symptoms and visual disturbance. Various types of ocular surgery, including strabismus one, represents a recognized cause for iatrogenic dry eye. However, it is not uncommon that strabismus patients, even not undergone to surgery, report symptoms of ocular discomfort and dryness. Hypothesis We hypothesize that two possible mechanisms may determine dry eye in strabismus patients by setting up a specific vicious circle: firstly, the increased exposure of the area of the bulbar conjunctiva located on the opposite side compared to the deviation may cause the thinning of the tear film lipid layer, with increased tear film instability; secondly, the dysfunctional lubricity secondary to the altered relationship between the eyelids and the deviated globe may cause blinking-related microtrauma, and thus inflammation and tear hyperosmolarity. These two entry points into the vicious circle of dry eye may determine a cascade of detrimental mechanisms, leading to further damage of the tear film, thus closing the disease circle.
Discussion
Strabismus patients may be affected by signs and symptoms of dry eye syndrome. The increased exposure of the bulbar conjunctival area along with the dysfunctional lubricity between the eyelids and the deviated eye could be the main underlying pathophysiological mechanisms acting as entry points into the vicious circle of dry eye disease. If our hypothesis was to be confirmed, ocular surface parameters should be routinely investigated in strabismus patients, whilethe use of tear substitutes with the aim of moistening and nourishing the ocular surface could help in reducing dry eye signs and symptoms."

Amongst them, the one which is gaining importance in the recent past is the metabolism of stem cells, especially One carbon metabolism. Being associated directly or indirectly, with DNA and Histone methylation, One carbon metabolism has an important role to play as far as epigenetic regulation of stemness is concerned. Folic acid being a methyl donor, forms an important component of One Carbon metabolism, and thus its availability has a significant effect on the methylation reactions. The present hypothesis says, using embryonic stem cells grown in vitro as a model system, one can study how deficiency of Folate during pre implantation embryonic development influence the self renewal as well as pluripotency of stem cells, from the perspective of One carbon metabolism and epigenetic mechanisms. Findings from such a study can possibly provide an explanation for the observed intra uterine growth retardation seen under maternal micronutrient deficiency."

At present, the pathological mechanism of MS is unknown and we do not have any theories or mathematical models to explain its disseminated patterns in time and space. In this paper, we present a new theoretical model from a viewpoint of complex system with chaos model to reproduce and explain the non-linear clinical and pathological manifestations in MS. First, we adopted a discrete logistic equation with non-linear dynamics to prepare a scalar quantity for the strength of pathogenic factor at a specific location of the central nervous system at a specific time to reflect the negative feedback in immunity. Then, we set distinct minimum thresholds in the above-mentioned scalar quantity for demyelination possibly causing clinical relapses and for cerebral atrophy. With this simple model, we could theoretically reproduce all the subtypes of relapsing-remitting MS, primary progressive MS, and secondary progressive MS. With the sensitivity to initial conditions and sensitivity to minute change in parameters of the chaos theory, we could also reproduce the spatial dissemination. Such chaotic behavior could be reproduced with other similar upward-convex functions with appropriate set of initial conditions and parameters. In conclusion, by applying chaos theory to the three-dimensional scalar field of the central nervous system, we can reproduce the non-linear outcome of the clinical course and explain the unsolved disseminations in time and space of the MS patients."

abstract = "Changes in fetal movement are associated with increased risk of stillbirth after 28 weeks of pregnancy. The majority of studies have focussed on maternal perception of reduced fetal movements, which is associated with stillbirth via placental dysfunction. Recent studies have also described an association between a single episode of excessive fetal movements and late stillbirth. We present a hypothesis that a sudden episode of excessive fetal activity indicates fetal compromise relating to underlying disturbance of the in utero environment, which if it persists can lead to fetal death. The origin of the excessive fetal movements is unknown; they may represent fetal seizures induced by asphyxia or infection, an attempt to release cord entanglement or a change in fetal behaviour (inducing signs of distress) in response to a noxious stimulus. It is also possible that an increase in maternal anxiety may lead to increased perception of fetal activity. Current evidence regarding excessive fetal movements is sparse; there is no clinical guidance regarding how reporting of this symptom might relate to a fetus at risk and which management might reduce the risk of subsequent stillbirth. This could be addressed by prospective observational studies of mothers presenting with excessive fetal movements which could both explore the underlying pathophysiology and determine which investigations could identify fetal compromise in this population. The presence of fetal seizures or umbilical cord entanglement could be evaluated at the time of presentation by cardiotocography and ultrasonography of the fetus and cord. Exposure to infection or noxious stimuli could be evaluated by maternal history and measurement of maternal blood for inflammatory markers or toxins. Maternal anxiety could be assessed by validated anxiety scores. Fetal outcome following excessive fetal movements can be recorded after birth. In addition, the presence of perinatal asphyxia can be assessed using Apgar scores, assessment of fetal acidaemia or measurement of stress-related factors in umbilical cord blood. The placenta and cord can be systematically examined for signs of hypoxia, infection or umbilical cord compression. Such studies would provide evidence regarding the underlying cause of excessive fetal movement and how this symptom might relate to in utero compromise and stillbirth. Ultimately, this approach will determine whether excessive fetal movements can be used alongside reduced fetal movements as a tool to reduce the perinatal mortality rate."

Patients with neck pain, seek treatment from different health professionals such as general practitioners, physiotherapists, chiropractors and alternative medicine practitioners. The interventions for neck pain are typically provided in a primary care or specialised healthcare setting depending on the general practitioners’ referral patterns. Clinicians are interested to know the various prognostic factors that can explain the recovery from neck pain. In order to know this, studies have explored and reported on a range of prognostic factors that contribute to the outcomes in patients with neck pain. This information is currently available only for neck pain following whiplash injury that has a traumatic origin. There is limited information on the role of prognostic factors specifically for non-specific neck pain without a traumatic episode. Moreover, there is a lack of data on whether there are interactions (moderation effects) between the prognostic factors. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis to elucidate whether the same set of prognostic factors found in neck pain associated with whiplash injuries are also identified in patients with neck pain without trauma. Additionally, we hypothesize that the association between a prognostic factor and the outcome variable (s) would be dependent on the third variable, thereby confirming the moderation effects. Clinicians could make informed decisions in the clinical management of neck pain with the knowledge of prognostic factors that explain the outcomes. It could also be used for the development of new interventions or for modifying the existing ones."

Inos has been licensed for several antiviral diseases; however, its efficacy against Mtb has not been tested yet. Since Mtb subverts the host immune system to survive within the host. Therefore, we hypothesized that the immune-stimulatory properties of Inos can be explored as an adjunct therapy for the management of tuberculosis. We have also outlined a systematic direction of study to evaluate if Inos could be repurposed for tuberculosis. The in vivo studies for therapeutic evaluation of Inos alone or in combination with the first line anti-TB drugs in a suitable TB disease model would provide a clearer picture of its utility as a host-directed anti-TB drug and may endow us with a new application of an existing drug to combat tuberculosis."

By contrast, in ulcerative colitis, the detrimental effect of intestinal dysbiosis could occur at any time of life, due to instant environment. This hypothesis could explain why the incidence of Crohn’s disease raises many years later than that of ulcerative colitis in developing countries that adopt the Western lifestyle. This would also explain why many early-life events, such as caesarean section, increased hygiene and repeated antibiotic exposure, are risk factors for subsequent development of Crohn’s disease, but not ulcerative colitis."

abstract = "In addition to classical metastatic pathways, recently gastric cancer was described having an alternative route called “endoluminal exfoliation”. Provisional analyses demonstrated, in fact, this kind of shedding is associated with several clinico-pathological features indicative of aggressive behavior and resulted to be an independent prognostic factor entailing poor prognosis. Compared with non-sowing counterparts, in fact, patients affected with exfoliating early and advanced gastric carcinomas met with shorter overall survival, disease free survival, progression free survival and time to tumor progression. In spite of these interesting results, however, the clinico-pathological and oncological significance of this unconventional metastatic route is still to be clarified. Such an investigation is further urged by the increasing widespread employment of minimally invasive treatments for gastric cancer which include a wide spectrum of intragastric interventions and maneuvers. Indeed, endoscopic mucosal resection, endoscopic submucosal dissection, endoscopic full-thickness resection, intragastric laparoscopic surgery and hybrid procedures all take place inside of the stomach. However, iatrogenic perforations can occur during execution of these treatments leading to spillage of malignant cells from gastric to the peritoneal cavity or trocar insertion sites. Furthermore, many other gastric conditions and interventions can collide with endogastric presence of floating cancer cells: spontaneous ulceration or perforation, laparotomy surgery, gastrointestinal occlusion, diverticula. Viability, migration and intraluminal transportability of the intragastric floating cancer cells represents another original and intriguing topic. All these considerations led us to entertain the hypothesis that removing the exfoliated cancer cells from the gastric lumen could save patients from the dreaded potential risk of spillage. Performing gastric lavage before starting any kind of tumor intervention could be the most appropriate procedure to adopt with prophylactic intent. Should our speculation prove to be clinically significant, preoperative gastric lavage should be pointed out as a simple but cogent method useful for preventing oncological mishaps such as spillage of gastric cancer cells and development of related recurrences or metastases."

There are few FDA-approved treatments for fatigue and great disagreement on how to measure fatigue, with over 250 instruments used in research. Many instruments define fatigue as “a lack of energy”, thus viewing energy and fatigue states as opposites on a single bipolar continuum. In this paper, we hypothesize that energy and fatigue are distinct perceptual states, should be measured using separate unipolar scales, have different mechanisms, and deficits should be treated using tailored therapies. Energy and fatigue independence has been found in both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis studies. Experiments in various fields, including behavioral pharmacology and exercise science, often find changes in energy and not fatigue, or vice versa. If the hypothesis that energy and fatigue are independent is correct, there are likely different mechanisms that drive energy and fatigue changes. Energy could be increased by elevated dopamine and norepinephrine transmission and binding. Fatigue could be increased by elevated brain serotonin and inflammatory cytokines and reduced histamine binding. The hypothesis could be tested by an experiment that attempts to produce simultaneously high ratings of energy and fatigue (such as with two drugs using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design), which would offer strong evidence against the common viewpoint of a bipolar continuum. If the hypothesis is correct, prior literature using bipolar instruments will be limited, and research on the prevalence, mechanisms, and treatment of low energy and elevated fatigue as separate conditions will be needed. In the immediate future, measuring both energy and fatigue using unipolar measurement tools may improve our understanding of these states and improve therapeutic outcomes."

Interestingly, HIV-1 Vpr, as well as some cationic proteins encoded by different viruses, share similar physical properties with the unique anti-microbial human cathelicidin LL37 peptide. Consistent with these observations, the Viral Quinta Columna Hypothesis predicts that virally-encoded cationic peptides encoded by multiple viruses may at the same time i) behave as new cathelicidin-like viral positive effectors of innate immunity, mainly through electrostatic interactions with microbial walls, and also display specific toxic cellular effects through interactions with specific intracellular targets such as PP2A proteins. In this context, virally-encoded cationic peptides, potentially detectable in biological fluids, may define a new paradigm for a viral control of homeostasis. Finally, we can also predict that characterization of virally encoded sequences with anti-infective effects may serve as template for the design of new efficient therapeutics polypeptides."

Glucose transporters (GLUTs) located in the brain are involved in direct glucose uptake by neurons. Instead of being insulin-sensitive, these transporters are regulated by glucose levels in the extracellular fluid, increasing their expression while glucose levels fall, to absorb more glucose.

abstract = "The prognosis of endodontically treated teeth has traditionally been associated with the presence of the so-called ferrule effect that is generally related with the presence of a minimum of 1–2 mm of sound tooth structure at the cervical area of parallel axial walls that totally encircle the tooth. Even though all of these factors are well desired, one should question if their absence should condemn a tooth and compel extraction as the only logical treatment plan option. For this reason an hypothesis is being formed that associates the aforementioned factors not with the presence of the so-called ferrule effect, but rather with the resistance form of the preparation that is being provided by the sound tooth structure at the cervical area of the tooth. When the desired resistance form is provided by sound tooth structure of endodontically treated teeth, then less lateral forces are being transferred to the post & core and subsequently to the root of the teeth, thus minimizing the chances of decementation of the post & core or worst fracture of the root. Even more important, if this hypothesis may be further entertained, then even when the so-called ferrule effect is not present, the teeth may not be extracted, but alternative strategies for post & core restorations may be investigated, such a more flexible carbon- or glass-fiber posts & core build ups made from flowable resin composite that may accommodate for the increased lateral forced exerted to the post & core complex during function."

In young women recurrent cystitis associated with sexual intercourse is quite common; however not all sexually active women will suffer a post-coital UTI episode. A variety of possible predisposing factors has been described, including behavioral risk patterns, genetic factors and increased virulence of certain subtypes of uropathogens. It has long been regarded that anatomical anomalies are rare in this setting of rUTIs. The shorter distance of the urethra to the anus has been the only anatomical risk factor described that is marginally significant in predisposing women for rUTIs. We hereby present a hypothesis that focuses on the shorter distance of the urethral meatus to the vaginal opening as the mainstay of sexually-induced rUTIs. In this theory of “functional hypospadias”, the low misplacement of the urethral opening allows for easier advancement of pathogen-laden mucous by penile thrust and increased friction during intercourse. Our hypothesis suggests that a shorter distance of the urethral meatus to the vaginal opening (and not the anus itself) is an anatomical risk factor for recurrent post-coital cystitis. Verification of this hypothesis might lead to a more patient-oriented approach by alerting clinicians in looking for an aberrant meatus and save the patient from unnecessary imaging and endoscopic examinations often used in these cases. Moreover it may also aid the patient in understanding her anatomy and modify behavioral risk practices."

Lyme disease (or Lyme borreliosis) is an affection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, sensu lato. Lyme disease is also reported as a variety of misleading clinical symptomatologies. Infected patient’s blood serology is the most currently test used for its diagnosis. However, serology has a low sensitivity, which ranges from 34% to 70%. Thus, there are numerous subsequent false-negative diagnoses despite an active clinical infection profile. Therefore, alternative and more sensitive techniques are required to detect the antigens or nucleic acids of Borrelia. Actually, the most appropriate methodological approach seems to be the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, PCR will detect the only “visible” part available of the targeted DNA presence in the blood of the infected patients. Consequently PCR alone will not be conclusive enough to reach the final diagnosis. Considering the ability of Borrelia to invade host cells, we hypothesize that a selective lysis of all blood cells should improve the diagnostic sensitivity of the detection of Borrelia by PCR in whole blood, and subsequently reduce the false-negative diagnostic rate, thus improving the patient’s diagnosis and therapeutic management."

Since a few decade man has been able to reach space, escape from the earth attraction and spend days and nights in a weightless condition. Some major physiological changes have been observed during long stays and in particular the sleep duration in space is shorter than on ground. This paper reviews a novel hypothesis proposing that sleep is partly due to gravity. Gravity is a fundamental part of our environment, but is elusive and difficult to apprehend. At the same time, all creatures on Earth undergo cycles of activity and periods of rest (although not always sleep). Careful analysis of previous research on sleep, on Earth, in space and in water, shows that gravity differs in these three situations, and sleep also varies, at least in its duration. On Earth, Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is conditioned by gravity; in space, astronauts have a shorter sleep duration and this is even more striking when a test subject is immersed in water for a week. In conclusion, sleep is partly due to gravity, which acts on our body and brain during the wake period."

We speculate that mild LVH in absence of left ventricular (LV) chamber dilation, could play a protective role towards functional capacity, clinical outcome, cardiovascular and total morbi-mortality in conditions in which LV systolic function is generally reduced. Accordingly to many epidemiological observations, the availability of extra-quote of systolic function could lead to a significative improvement in the final outcome of some kinds of heart patients, as those undergoing bypass-grafting, where the stress for heart and cardiovascular system is always high. We suppose that the functional reserve available for patients with LVH could make the difference with respect to other patients undergoing myocardial revascularization. Similarly, the availability of a contractile reserve warranted by LVH could ensure a little gain in the outcome for patients after other major cardiovascular events (such as myocardial infarction or other heart surgery as surgical valve replacement). However, our hypothesis only involves mild LVH without LV chamber dilation, that is the initial stage of “non-dilated concentric” LVH and “non-dilated eccentric” LVH according to the new four-tiered classification of LVH based on relative wall thickness and LV dilation. Support for our hypothesis derives from the well-known protective role of systolic function that is a major factor in almost all cardiovascular diseases, where LV ejection fraction (LVEF) has shown to significantly improve quality of life, as well as morbidity and mortality. The knowledge that mild LVH in absence of LV chamber dilation is not as harmful in such conditions as believed at present could make avoidable some drugs prescription in some stages of the disease. Furthermore, it may allow a better evaluation of the risk profile of patients with LVH undergoing some cardiovascular major events like bypass grafting, myocardial infarction or surgical heart valve replacement."

abstract = "The non-invasive assessment of chronic tissue hypoxia is difficult. Pulse oximetry only allows the peripheral oxygen saturation to be measured, while the detection of hyperlactataemia needs to take into account the fact that the accumulation of lactic acid may result from several causes other than prolonged tissue hypoxia. Arterial blood oxygen measurement is invasive and often does not give a good indication of the level of tissue hypoxia. Other suggested methods include the use of positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance T2∗ relaxation time measurement, photoacoustics and high-frequency ultrasound. Tissue hypoxia leads to increased levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, which in turn upregulates VEGFA, leading to increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promote angiogenesis. Hypoxia lasting for more than a few hours is associated with increased synthesis in erythrocytes of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG), a powerful regulator of the allosteric properties of haemoglobin, via the Rapoport-Luebering phosphoglycerate cycle. We therefore hypothesised that plasma VEGF and erythrocyte BPG levels should be positively correlated. Venous blood samples from 34 patients (18 male, mean age (standard error) 43.4 (3.2) y) were analysed; plasma VEGF was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay while the erythrocyte BPG was assessed by quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectrometry following gel electrophoresis. The Pearson product-moment correlation between the two variables was 0.622 (p < 0.0001). Based on our findings, we suggest that it may be useful to measure both erythrocyte BPG and plasma VEGF, together, when assessing chronic hypoxia; elevated levels of both are likely to indicate hypoxia."

Technicians or doctors often need to try many times to determine the relatively satisfied lens customization parameters. This repeated try-on process not only increases discomfort of patients, but also will increase the risks of corneal epithelial shedding or corneal infection. In order to conduct RGP fitting in a faster and safer manner, a new method of simulating RGPCL fitting in 3D printing technology was assumed. The preliminary experimental results indicated that this method could effectively reduce the number of try-on and increase patient satisfaction, while decrease the risk of epithelial shedding or infection."

abstract = "The impact of unrhythmic circadian clock on obesity has started to be increasingly appreciated nowadays. Recently it was discovered that interaction between intestinal microbiota and unrhythmic circadian clock plays a key role in such a process. It involves relaying signals from microbiota through dendritic cells to group 3 innate lymphoid cells in the intestine and in the end impacting some of the key transcription factors of circadian clock. Breaking such a signal relay may prove to be an effective way reducing unrhythmic circadian clock-induced obesity. Here, we propose a hypothesis and design experiments to prove that suppressing one of the transcription factors, RUNX1, plays a key role in the homing of ILC3 cells to intestine. Such suppression is in response to a retinoic acid-RARα binding initiated pathway and results in the upregulation of gut-homing chemokine receptor CCR9 and downregulation of lymphoid tissue-homing receptor CCR7, which can then guide ILC3 cells to intestine. Therapies that can specifically sustain Runx1 expression in ILC3 cells may assist preventing the ever-escalating obesity problem in modern society."

abstract = "An emerging body of evidence is starting to suggest that the hypertrophy of skeletal muscle fibers might be load specific. In other words, it may be that resistance training with high loads (i.e., ≥60% of 1 repetition maximum [RM]) emphasizes a greater growth of type II muscle fibers, while resistance training with low loads (i.e., <60% of 1RM) might primarily augment hypertrophy of type I muscle fibers. Type I and type II muscle fibers possess certain distinct characteristics, with type II muscle fibers having faster calcium kinetics, faster shortening velocities, and ability to generate more power than type I muscle fibers. Alternatively, compared to type II fibers, type I muscle fibers have a higher oxidative capacity and a higher fatigue threshold. Due to the lower fatigability of type I muscle fibers, it may be hypothesized that a greater time under load is necessary to stimulate an accentuated growth of these fibers. An increase in time under load can be achieved when training with lower loads (e.g., 30% of 1RM) and to momentary muscular failure. The present paper discusses the hypothesis that a greater hypertrophy of type I muscle fibers may be induced with low load resistance training."

Vitamin D is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in the liver and to the active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) in the kidneys. To exert its effect 1,25(OH)2D has to bind to the nuclear vitamin D receptor VDR. Lack of vitamin D leads to rickets in children and to osteomalacia in adults. 25(OH)D is used as a marker of a subject’s vitamin D status. Low serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with a number of diseases, risk factors for disease and increased mortality. However, intervention studies with vitamin D have generally been disappointing. Many, if not most cells have the hydroxylases necessary for intra-cellular activation of vitamin D. It is likely that more vitamin D diffuses or are transported into the cells than 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D, and accordingly, most of the 1,25(OH)2D that bind to the VDR are derived from intra-cellular hydroxylation of vitamin D. Therefore, our hypothesis is that serum vitamin D is a better marker of a subject’s vitamin D status than 25(OH)D. Since the half-life in serum for vitamin D is approximately one day, giving vitamin D weekly or monthly will result in short-lived serum vitamin D peaks with periods of vitamin D deficiency in between. On the other hand, serum 25(OH)D, which has a half-life of weeks, will show high and stable serum levels throughout. Important vitamin D effects may have been missed in studies with intermittent dosing, and vitamin D in intervention trials should be given daily. Likewise, in epidemiological studies and clinical practice 25(OH)D has uniformly been used as marker. This may lead to gross misclassification of individuals that do not have a stable influx of vitamin D from sun-exposure or diet. In epidemiological studies serum vitamin D should be measured as well as 25(OH)D, and in clinical practice a 25(OH)D measurement should be interpreted in view of recent sun-exposure and diet history."

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is defined by recurrent episodes of significant reduction or absence of the oro-nasal airflow during sleep, in the presence of thorax and abdominal movements and snoring. The pathophysiological consequences of intermittent hypoxia determined by OSAS are represented by systemic inflammation, the release of free oxygen radicals and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Cardiac arrhythmias are a frequent comorbidity in patients with OSAS.
Hypothesis
We hypothesized that the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy has an effect on inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, and red cell distribution width) in patients with OSAS and cardiac arrhythmias.
Evaluation of the hypothesis
We tested this hypothesis on 52 patients diagnosed with OSAS and cardiac arrhythmias, divided into two groups: group A (patients who received CPAP therapy and pharmacological therapy) and group B (only pharmacological therapy). The patients were evaluated at enrollment (T0), at 3 and 6 months. We did not find a statistically significant difference of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and fibrinogen levels between the two groups. Regarding the red cell distribution width (RDW), the CPAP treatment seems to have improved the RDW values in patients who received this treatment. Also, in patients from group A, a significant decrease in the average heart rate was noticed after 3 months.
Consequences
Fibrinogen and ESR cannot be used for monitoring the CPAP therapy in patients with OSAS and arrhythmias. Instead, the beneficial effect of CPAP in patients with OSAS and cardiac arrhythmias can be monitored with the help of the RDW, which could also be used for evaluating the cardiovascular risk in patients with OSAS and arrhythmias."

The hypotheses in this paper have been deduced from the latest scientific research findings and clinical observations of patients with genetic disorders, behavioral phenotypes and other family members suffering mental disorders. The first hypothesis postulates that catatonia and the heterogeneity of catatonic signs and symptoms involve nucleolar dysfunction arising from abnormalities of the brain-specific, non-coding micro-RNA, SNORD115 genes (either duplications or deletions) which result in pathobiological dysfunction of various combinations in the downstream pathways (possibly along with other genes in these shared pathways). SNORD115 controls five genes CRHR1, PBRM1, TAF1, DPM2, and RALGPS1 as well as the alternative splicing of serotonin 2C receptor. SNORD115 abnormalities with varying downstream multigene involvement would account for catatonia across the life span within some subtypes of autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar and major depressive disorder, psychosis, genetic disorders, and in immune disorders such as anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibody encephalitis as well as the susceptibility to the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) if environmentally triggered. Furthermore, SNORD115 genes may underlie a genetic vulnerability when environmental triggers result in excess serotonin producing the serotonin syndrome, a condition similar to NMS in which catatonia may occur. Dysfunction of SNORD115-PBRM1 connecting with SMARCA2 as well as other proven schizophrenia-associated genes might explain why traditionally catatonia has been classified with schizophrenia. SNORD115-TAF1 and SNORD-DPM2 dysfunction introduce possible clues to the parkinsonism and increased creatinine phosphokinase in NMS, while abnormalities of SNORD115-RALGPS1 suggest links to both anti-NMDAR encephalitis and the proven predisposing catatonic SHANK3 gene. The second hypothesis postulates that periodic catatonia (PC) on 15q15 involves abnormalities of vacuolar protein sorting 39 (VPS39), a proven de novo schizophrenic gene in this chromosomal locus and part of the HOPS complex. These will impact the autophagic and endocytic pathways, thereby lowering lysosomal degradation. VPS39 mutations may be considered also to disrupt lysosome-mitochondria tethering and transport of lipids and calcium through membrane contact sites (MCSs). To account for the periodicity in PC it is speculated that the mammalian equivalent of the vacuole and mitochondria patch (vCLAMP) would be altered by VPS39 mutations and subsequently followed by the mammalian equivalent of endoplasmic reticulum mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) restoring mitochondrial homeostasis. Future precision psychiatry will require accurate pathophysiologically-defined psychiatric diagnoses to accelerate the discovery of specific molecular-targeted medications to improve therapeutic outcomes."

Although its etiology is still being debated, interestingly, we found that the trend associated with the 538G allele frequency of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter C11 (ABCC11) gene, the determinant of wet-type earwax, and ethnic groups was similar to that between the incidence of cholesteatoma and ethnic groups (countries). The incidences of cholesteatoma in Europe (Denmark, Finland, and Scotland) are higher than in East Asia (Japan), and the frequencies of the ABCC11 538G allele in African, American, and European (Finland and Scotland) populations are higher than those in East Asian populations (Japan). Additionally, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the ABCC11 gene (rs17822931, 538G > A; Gly180Arg) is closely related to earwax morphotypes. While earwax is often beneficial to ear health, it is sometimes harmful in cases where it causes hearing impairment. Based on independent findings of associations between ABCC11 and the physiological environment of the auditory canal, we hypothesize a possible link between ABCC11, earwax, and the incidence of cholesteatoma."

Uncertainty remains about its precise mechanistic basis, but the physiological derangement is acute and profound, yet reversible with cessation of the drug. It is reminiscent of other “non type 1” presentations with DKA such as ketosis prone diabetes, except that glucose levels are usually normal. Impaired beta cell glucose sensing that mimicked a state of hypoglycaemia could theoretically lead to abrupt and transient cessation of insulin secretion. GLUT2 mediates glucose sensing in beta cells. In other tissues such as enterocytes, GLUT2 mediated glucose transport is controlled by SGLT1. Although the affinity of SGLT1 for SGLT2 inhibitors is low, hypothetically a rare variant within the SGLT family with a hitherto unrecognised role in GLUT2 mediated glucose sensing might have an affinity for the SGLT2 inhibitor ligand and thus give rise to acute, severe but reversible euglycaemic DKA in susceptible patients."

The degree of complexity of a cancer system could be vast involving multiple endogenous and exogenous agents interacting with the over 10 trillion cells comprising the body. It is hypothesized that the practical management of this complexity may be a key to cancer prevention and possibly treatment. But the management and resolution of such an immensely complex system is difficult and may require a multidisciplinary approach including physics, biology, biochemistry and medical science. Research such as in systems biology involving large data sets may offer resolution in time, but the scale of the task is daunting. In evaluating the hypothesis, this paper proposes a method of resolution of the complex cancer system through a proxy in the form of the vital body system, energy balance, involved in several cancer processes. Although I suggest that the energy balance system is itself complex, it may permit access to factors that may be used in limiting cancer initiation. Meta-analysis related to factors of blood sugar, inflammation, stress and immune response reveal that they could be likely candidates for management. Analysis also reveals certain devices that may give practical effect to these management options. Due to the inherent complexity of a cancer system, multiple devices may need to be applied in a combination. The analysis suggests that the low-risk and low-cost devices metformin, vitamin D and vitamin C, may prove to be suitable for use as a practical cancer prevention strategy. If the presented hypothesis is correct, a practical method for prevention or management of cancer may be possible. A trial to test the hypothesis is proposed."

This left over oxygen is ‘stored’ on Hb in the venous compartment and can be calculated as the venous oxygen content. We hypothesize that the development of a venous oxygen content or saturation reference range in a group of well, uninjured very preterm newborns and subsequent application, in a randomised trial, with a structural, functional and molecular outcome will resolve the method for assessment of oxygen sufficiency in preterms by demonstrating both clinical safety and effectiveness. This method could be subsequently used for titration of supplemental oxygen."

The function defects in Treg cells have been involved in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. The detection of Treg cell suppressive function is important for early diagnosis and prediction of response to treatment for autoimmune diseases. The traditional detection of Treg cell suppressive function needs at least 20 mL peripheral blood sample of patients and the results would be got in sixth day, therefore, it could not be widely applied in clinical. However, to find fast and simple detection method is very important. CD147 is a transmembrane protein and its expression is related to Treg cell suppressive function. Recent research has shown that the Treg cells with high CD147 expression have stronger suppressive function than which with low CD147 expression. In this work, we detected the ratio of CD147high/CD147low in CD4+CD25+ T cells in patients with active AS using fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). The results show the ratio of CD147high/CD147low decreased obviously in patients with active AS compared with healthy controls, which reflects the suppressive function deficit of Treg cell. In the same time, the detection of the ratio of CD147high/CD147low needs only 150 μL peripheral blood sample and the result would be got in 4 h. We therefore hypothesize that the ratio of CD147high/CD147low is a good indicator for the Treg cell function, and it is especially suitable for early diagnosis and prediction of response to therapy targeted recovering Treg cell function in autoimmune diseases."

We propose that the presence, and maturation stage of decidual myeloid DCs be investigated using semi-quantitative immunohistological analyses and/or double-color immuno-fluorescent labeling of DC lineage and activation markers. The spatial arrangement of granulysin+ cells, NKp46+ NK cells, DCs, and trophoblasts might provide information about their mutual interactions in vivo. Multiple flow cytometry analyses of NK-receptors would provide insight into NK cell activation status. NK cell activation status could be also assessed by cytotoxicity assays against trophoblast cell lines, or isolated cognate extra-villous trophoblast cells. A correlation between decidual progesterone concentration or IL-15 expression, and the degree of DC maturation or the frequency of granulysin+ cells, might help to elucidate the mechanism of abortion retention in utero."

This paper hypothesizes that Lactobacillus spp. containing products are able to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections in females. Using the keywords [lactobacillus OR lactobacilli OR probiotic] and [urinary tract infection OR UTI OR cystitis], a preliminary search on the PubMed, Ovid, Google Scholar and ClinicalTrials.gov database yielded 1,647 papers published in English between 1-Jan-1960 and 1-May-2017. 9 clinical trials with a total of 726 patients were reviewed. Different lactobacilli strains (in either oral or suppository formulation) were utilized and they demonstrated varying efficacy in the prevention of recurrent UTIs. Using a random-effects model, pooled risk ratio of at least one recurrent UTI episode during the entire study duration was 0.684 (95% CI 0.438 to 0.929, p < 0.001), per-protocol analysis. However, key limitations include significant inter-study variability and the limited duration of follow-up of most studies. Our hypothesis on the chemoprophylactic effects of probiotics for UTIs is plausible and supported by current data. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC14 were the most commonly studied lactobacilli strains. Further and more robust randomized controlled trials with standardized lactobacilli strains and formulation are required for confirmation of effects."

According to the latest research, IR is present in 25–45% of the general population. Therefore, the mechanism of its development is in the center of scientific and professional interest. Established or acquired factors, or combinations thereof, which disturb any step of the physiological insulin action mechanism: its binding to the cellular receptor, through the complex cascade of intracellular signaling pathways might cause IR. Although the adiposity and its underlying risk factors are considered to be the primary cause of IR, it is present in a great porportion in lean individuals as well. There are insights of the possible role of psychological factors: exposure to stress and deprssion to IR development, although the mechanism of this relationship has not been comperhensively studied. Data driven from cell cultures and experimental animal models suggest that there is an elevated level of counter-regulatory insulin hormones: growth hormone, prolactin and cortisol due to acute stress exposure. However, the relationship between these psychological disorders with the hyperreactivity of the axis of the hypothalamic–pituitaryadrenal axis as the underlying mechanism in the patophysiology of IR in lean individuals has not been systematically investigated. Based on the aforementioned, we hypothesise that this mechanism would be responsible for the formation of IR, and consequently, T2DM in lean individuals. The possible effect of the amount of stress in conjunction with the serum concentration of growth hormone, cortisol, prolactin and dehydroepiandrostendone to the abnormal 5-h oral glucose tollerance test results could contribute to the primary prevention of diabetes and its complications."

In this speculative unifying model I set a new hypothesis for the etiology of the majority of chronic diseases. The main aim is to put order and observe our organism in a systemic way, connecting pathologies we now see as disconnected phenomena, with the conceptual frameworks of complex systems and network medicine. Chronic diseases could be caused by a first unsolved acute infection. In case the pathogen cannot be completely eliminated, it becomes a persistent infectious. After the acute episode, some mild symptoms will occur and probably disappear; the chronic disease will remain latent over time. It will manifest even after years or decades, in the presence of another acute infection, a particular stress, trauma, or another event. The presence of the persistent infectious elicits changes in the immune and systemic regulation, and these processes degenerate over time. They will assume their rules and patterns, being independent from the initial stimulus. The key to understand the dynamics and individuality of chronic diseases is the immune system and its networks. The immune mechanisms that can lead to the persistent response are mainly the switch from the Th1 to the Th2 immunity and the molecular mimicry. The first persistent infectious will also modify the susceptibility to other pathogens, facilitating new infections and new consequent persistent infectious. From the immune point of view, our organism is divided into three compartments: the outer one, which comprehend all the surfaces in contact with the environment, the intermediate one, which comprehend the internal organs and tissues, and the innermost one, comprehending the Central Nervous System and the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous tubule. The immune key-role is played respectively by the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, the endothelium, the blood–brain barrier and blood-testis barrier. The chronic diseases follow a progressive scheme, involving the three compartments from the outer to the innermost one. The primer microorganism at the origin of the majority of diseases could be streptococcus, or staphylococcus. Both cause acute in children, with a great variability of responses and symptoms, and both cause molecular mimicry. This model can be tested and proved in more ways, I propose here some of them. It could pave the way to a radical change in our comprehension and therapeutic approaches to chronic diseases."

We postulate that certain hematoma qualities are triggers that influence cell biological behaviours and that the release of certain growth factors determines what pattern of remodelling will prevail: intramembranous or endochondral ossification. A detailed characterization of the structural parameters of hematomas will allow researchers to create a microenvironment that aids the migration of mesenchymal stromal cells into the hematoma where, once established, they accelerate the bone healing process.

The current standard of care (which involves coaptation of the two ends via epineurial sutures) is largely unchanged from its first description over 400 years ago, and unfortunately leads to a recovery that is at best slow (taking months or years) and partial. Encouragingly, two new conceptual approaches are being developed that separately have been shown to improve outcomes. The first approach involves optimization of the mechanical aspects of nerve coaptation (with an emphasis on exceedingly “clean cuts” of the axon ends and moving any suture material far away from the coaptation site). The second approach involves manipulation of the chemical composition of the local environment at the cut ends of the nerve in order to promote re-establishment of membranous continuity. Though neither approach currently leads to results that reach those of uninjured controls, there is reason to believe that these two approaches can be used concurrently. Thus, we hypothesize that immediate and complete restoration of peripheral nerve function after injury is attainable by a combination of surgical and chemical interventions. The combination could be tested in rodents and non-human primates by assessing histology, electrical activity, intracellular diffusion, and functional status and could likely rapidly move to a clinical trial in humans. If the hypothesis is proven to be true, its impact would be profound, as it would positively affect not only recovery after traumatic nerve injury, but also functional status after allotransplantation, as well as introduce the prospects of advanced interfaces between human nerves and computer circuits."

γH2AX assay has been used for DNA damage assessment at higher doses of radiation exposure. Its expression has not been studied in cases with diagnostic low dose radiation exposure. Concerns have been raised about the after-effects of radiation in diagnostic procedures like Computed Tomography (CT) scan, Angiography etc especially when such scans are repeated within short span of time. The purpose of the present study was to assess immediate DNA damage after exposure to low level of ionizing radiation by the flow cytometric method of gamma-H2AX.
Material and methods
Study sample includes total 60, cases and controls with two groups Group I-Normal controls (n = 15); Group II-Low dose, further divided in three groups: Group IIA-single CT scan (n = 15); Group IIB-Multiple CT scans (n = 15); and Group IIC-angiography single exposure (n = 15). For Low dose group blood was collected within 1 h after exposure in EDTA vaccutainers and immediately kept on ice. Lymphocytes were isolated and were fixed in 80% chilled ethanol and stored at −20 °C till further analysis. The H2AX assay was done and 10,000 cells were analysed for gamma H2AX positivity in flowcytometer.
Results
Significant gamma-H2AX positivity was found in cases versus control, the most significant DNA damage amongst cases was observed in cases with multiple CT scans.
Conclusion
The exposure to multiple CT scans causes more double strand breaks as compared to single scan. DNA damage can be studied by flow cytometric analysis of gamma-H2AX in human peripheral lymphocytes."

However, it is still unknown that the reason why CD25 positive AML patients have a dismal clinical outcome. CD25 positive AML cells are generally unresponsive to IL-2, but strongly respond to IL-3. The levels of IL-3Rα on these AML cells are very high and directly proportional to the CD25 levels. T-lymphocytes produce IL-3 in response to stimuli including IL-2-mediated activation. Thus, CD25 on AML cells may capture environmental IL-2 and deliver it to the surrounding T-lymphocytes expressing IL-2Rβ/γc, leading to the production of IL-3 as a growth stimulus to CD25 positive AML cells. We hypothesize that IL-2/IL-3 interplay via CD25 is responsible for the growth property of CD25 positive AML, which may affect clinical behavior of those patients."

Although research has provided insight into microcirculatory blood flow, our knowledge remains limited. In this article, we propose a new role of microcirculation in physiological and shock states. In healthy individuals, microcirculation maintains cellular homeostasis via preconditioning. When blood volume decreases, the ensuing microcirculatory changes result in heterogeneity of perfusion and tissue oxygenation. Initially, this is partly compensated by the preserved autoregulation and the increase in the metabolism rate of cells, but at later stages, the loss of autoregulation activates the cascade of intracellular hypothermia."

The reason for its existence remains unexplained. Given that MPHL is progressive and has its earliest manifestations in young adults it may be a barometer of age. Here we suggest that MPHL may have atavistically allowed women in our species and ancestor species to select younger (but not necessarily the youngest) adult mates. Evidence suggests that conceptions by younger fathers are more likely to lead to live births and less likely to result in miscarriage. Further children fathered by younger men may have improved health and be less likely to suffer from a number of co-morbidities. This is collectively known as the “paternal age affect”. Hence the selection of younger males mediated by the MPHL may improve the fitness of the population and of the species at the expense of the individual. Indeed MPHL may have been an evolutionary “nudge” directing women to favour younger partners. It is conceivable that for a species whose success is predicated upon co-operation, collaboration and altruism the gene cannot be exclusively selfish and must have a selfless allele."

C-reactive protein, a marker of intimal thickening of the myeloid-related protein 8/14 heterodimer, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, interleukin-15, the cytotoxic mediator, granulysin, and the matrix metalloproteinase 9 could be valuable, single, fast, and non-invasive laboratory tools for ED deterioration degree assessment. We propose to investigate the impact of pro-inflammatory biomarkers on ED, measured by previously established clinical methods in patients with yet undiagnosed CAD and at medium risk for an acute coronary event. It could be useful to measure and correlate the concentration of particular inflammatory markers in peripheral blood samples and the results of the Framingham and SCORE charts, multi-slice computed tomography coronary angiography, echocardiography, brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, ankle-brachial index, carotid wall thickening, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, and particularly, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

However, almost all drugs with central nervous system-mediated weight loss properties studied thus far in randomized, placebo-controlled trials in persons with BED or BN have been efficacious for reducing binge eating behavior. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, marketed for type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management, produce weight loss in a dose dependent manner and have favorable psychiatric adverse event profiles. We hypothesize that GLP-1 receptor agonists will safely reduce binge eating behavior in individuals with BED or BN, including those with co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and propose that randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists be conducted in persons with BED and those with BN. To support this hypothesis, we review studies of GLP-1 and GLP-1 receptor agonists in preclinical models of binge eating, studies of GLP-1 levels in individuals with BED or BN, and preliminary data of GLP-1 receptor agonists in humans with abnormal eating behavior."

In a recent study, it has been demonstrated that purine nucleotides and uric acid alter the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Thus, we hypothesize that adenine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, 2,8-dihydroxyadenine and uric acid may potentially interfere with the activity of AChE. The hypothesis has been tested using computational tools. Uric acid has been found to be the most potent inhibitor of AChE, with a binding affinity higher than the known inhibitors of the enzyme. Further, since depleted AChE activity is associated with dementia and cognitive impairment, the present study suggest that disturbed purine nucleotide metabolism in CKD is a risk factor for cognitive impairment."

This hypothesis proposes that injuries to vasomotor nerves cause the arteriolar injury in the kidney in hypertension, (as well as that in the uterus in preeclampsia). Different patterns of perivascular hyalinisation in different viscera are clues to the varying causes and consequences of arteriolar injury. In the uterus there is a symmetrical, perivascular “halo of hyalinisation” that marks the lines of extension of regenerating, injured nerves to the placental bed, whereas in the kidney there is a disordered and asymmetrical “halo of hyalinisation” where persistent, and recurrent, increases in intravascular pressures interrupt development of regenerating nerves. Consequences of injuries to vasomotor nerves include releasing a “soup” of cytokines that cause regeneration of “new” nerves expressing primitive, pain and stretch receptors including TRPV-1 and P2X3 purinergic “stretch” receptors that may be significant in the afferent mechanism in preeclampsia. There is also concurrent, “background” hyperplasia of denervated tunica media and intima leading to narrowing of the arterioles and a further drive to hypertension through renal ischaemia (Goldblatt, 1942). These observations require support from animal studies and other investigations to establish causation. This hypothesis may provide a number of potential mechanisms that reinforce, or accelerate, the physiological processes that contribute to hypertension."

Several interventions are used to treat this disorder. Among them, vitamin B6 is widely used to treat the symptoms observed in autism. Vitamin B6 is beneficial for about half of autistic individuals in decreasing behavioral problems. However, until now, it remains unknown why vitamin B6 is effective for this disease. Although the exact pathogenesis is not defined, it is evident that certain neurotransmitter systems are impaired in the brains of autistic patients, causing the symptoms observed in the disease. In fact, impairment of many neurotransmitter systems has been reported, including GABA, serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenalin. Furthermore, vitamin B6 is important for the synthesis of many neurotransmitters, including GABA, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenalin, histamine, glycine, and d-serine, indicating that vitamin B6 supplementation may enhance many neurotransmitter systems. Thus, vitamin B6 supplementation can treat the impaired neurotransmitter systems in a given patient, even if the actual impaired neurotransmitter systems are not defined in that patient."

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are responsible for extracellular matrix deposition in conditions of frank hepatocellular injury and are key cells involved in the development of fibrosis. In experimental models and patients with NASH, urea cycle enzyme gene and protein expression is reduced resulting in functional reduction in the in vivo capacity for ureagenesis and subsequent hyperammonemia at a pre-cirrhotic stage. Ammonia has been shown to activate HSCs in vivo and in vitro. Hyperammonemia in the context of NASH may therefore favour the progression of fibrosis and the disease. We therefore hypothesise that ammonia is a potential target for prevention of fibrosis progression of patients with NASH."

The main drivers that could have contributed to the upsurge in scrub typhus cases in past two decades are changes in land use land cover (LULC) and urbanisation which are; as a result of the population explosion, causing a strain on sanitation and also increased diversion of forest land for agricultural use. In addition, the availability of better tests, changes in antimicrobial use, climate change also could have impacted the epidemiology, which is showing an upward trend as is evidenced by increasing reports and concomitant publications from India on scrub typhus. Scrub typhus cases are supposed to increase in the coming years as factors like global warming, urbanisation, changes in LULC and rise in AMR (anti-microbial resistance) will be difficult or impossible to control. Therefore, increasing awareness of public and health care professionals regarding scrub typhus coupled with availability of rapid diagnostic assays and implementation of appropriate treatment protocols for control of AFI (acute febrile illness) especially at the community level will help mitigate the scenario in the long run."

Growing data, generated in separated lines of research, suggest that different processes underlying impulsivity are associated to relapse in alcohol drinking. Considering the evidence, relapse can be understood as an impulsive choice or as an impulsive action. In the first case, the return to drinking behavior is a consequence of insensitive to delayed consequence, that is, to the discounting of delayed rewards. In the second case, relapse is a consequence of failures to inhibit prepotent responses. Nevertheless, conditions that control the action of each mechanism or their interaction to influence relapse still unknown. We hypothesize that both mechanisms interact to produce relapse depending on framing effects, the moments of a drinking episode or context. The implication of the hypothesis is that relapse prevention strategies need to reduce discounting rate, but also to increase behavioral inhibition in the presence of cues related to alcohol."

New mother have been encouraged to exclusively breastfeed by health care professionals and consumer-advocacy forums for years, citing “breast milk is the perfect food”. The benefits are numerous and include psychological, convenience, economical, ecological and nutritionally superior. Human milk is a composite of nutritional choices of the mother, commencing in the pre-conceptual era. Events influencing the eventual nutritional profile of breast milk for the neonate start with pre-conceptual dietary habits through pregnancy and finally to postpartum. Food choices do affect the nutritional profile of human breast milk. It is not known who coined the phrase “breast milk is the perfect food” but it is widely prevalent in the literature. While breast milk is highly nutritive, containing important immunological and growth factors, scientific investigation reveals a few short-falls. Overall, human breast milk has been found to be low in certain nutrients in developed countries: vitamin D, iodine, iron, and vitamin K. Additional nutrient deficiencies have been documented in resource-poor countries: vitamin A, vitamin B 12, zinc, and vitamin B 1/thiamin. Given these findings, isn’t it more accurate to describe breast milk as “conditionally perfect”? Correcting the impression that breast milk is an inherently, automatically comprehensive enriched product would encourage women who plan to breastfeed an opportunity to concentrate on dietary improvement to optimizes nutrient benefits ultimately to the neonate. The more immediate result would improve pre-conceptual nutritional status. Here, we explore the nutritional status of groups of young women; some of whom will become pregnant and eventually produce breast milk. We will review the available literature profiling vitamin, mineral, protein and caloric content of breast milk. We highlight pre-existing situations needing correction to optimize conception and fetal development. While alternative forms of infant nutrition carry standard product labels of nutrient adequacy, this information does not apply universally to all breast milk. Infant formulas are fortified with various amounts of vitamins, minerals, supplemental protein concentrates, nucleic factors, omega 3 fatty acids and any important new nutritional finding. Infant formulas are manufactured to be consistent in composition and are monitored closely for quality. Not true for human breast milk. Any nutrient deficiency existing in pregnancy will ultimately be carried forward via lactation. It is a biological impossibility for a lactating woman to transfer nutrients via breast milk she does not have!"

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a bleeding disorder whose estimated incidence is 4.2/100.000 person/years in the pediatric age group. We observed three cases with ITP in our cohort of 315 pediatric SSPE cases, an incidence higher than coincidentally expected in the general population. We hypothesize an association between SSPE and ITP. Our three cases had measles 1–2 years before the onset of ITP and 8–10 years before first symptoms of SSPE. A common immunogenetic background creating susceptibility to infection and autoimmunity might play a role. Alternatively, chronic antigenic stimulation by the MV leading to synthesis of cross-reacting antibodies against platelets, or treatment of ITP with immunoglobulins or steroids might affect or alter the development and manifestation of SSPE. The co-occurrence of these two disorders of viral and immune pathogenesis may draw attention to similar observations and provide clues for their mechanisms."

abstract = "The cause and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases remain unsolved puzzles. These diseases are correlated with presence of beta sheet-rich amyloid assemblies. Here, I derive and assemble puzzle pieces to obtain a loose end-tying hypothesis for cause with direct implications for therapy. I use the following extrapolations to find connectable puzzle pieces: (a) the traditional extrapolation that amyloid/amyloid precursors cause disease, (b) a recent extrapolation that amyloid-forming proteins, some of which are virus protein homologs, are components of an empirically obscure innate immune system that counters insults, including those by both viruses and bacteria, (c) a new extrapolation that various insults produce assemblies with structural features in common and that amyloid-forming, innate immune system proteins recognize these features and, then, counter insults by co-assembly, (d, 1) a second new extrapolation that beta sheet is a common structural feature and is extended during insult-neutralizing co-assembly and (d, 2) an appendix, derived from studies of phages T3 and T4, that most insult-produced assemblies are obscure to current biochemical analysis. The hypothesis is the following. One function of amyloid-forming proteins is non-classical innate immunity to biological insults. This immunity works via beta sheet-extending co-assembly of amyloid-forming proteins with beta sheet-containing insult products. For example, co-assembly with beta sheet-containing viral assembly intermediates inhibits virus production. Amyloid-forming proteins cause neurodegenerative disease when errant, typically overproduced. Other innate immunity systems sometimes exacerbate symptoms. This hypothesis suggests the following therapy, based on manipulating Nature’s chemistry. First, conduct directed evolution to obtain low-pathogenicity, chronic symptom-producing viruses with assembly intermediates that co-assemble with and destabilize both amyloid and amyloid sub-assemblies. Then, infect patients with these viruses."

abstract = "Tissue related ankle hyper-resistance has been reported to contribute to equinus gait in children with spastic cerebral palsy. Hence, ankle plantarflexor stretching programs have been developed in order to restore passive ankle dorsiflexion. Despite high quality evidence on the limited effects of stretching on passive joint mobility, further muscle-tendon adaptations have been reported which may impact gait performance. As such, children with spastic cerebral palsy subject to long-term manual static stretching achieved dorsiflexion gains through the reduction of muscle and fascicle strain whilst preserving tendon strain, and prolonged use of ankle-foot orthoses achieved similar dorsiflexion gains through increased tendon strain whilst preserving muscle and fascicle strain. The latter concurred with normalization of early stance plantarflexor moment yet reductions in push-off plantarflexor moment given the increase in tendon compliance. Therefore, similar limited gains in passive ankle joint mobility in response to stretching may be achieved either by preserving/restoring optimal muscle-tendon function, or at the expense of muscle-tendon function and thus contributing gait impairments. The largest increase in ankle passive joint mobility in children with SCP has been obtained through prolonged plantarflexor stretching through ankle casting combined with botulinum neurotoxin type A. However, to our knowledge, there are no published studies on muscle-tendinous adaptations to ankle casting combined with botulinum toxin type A and its effect on ankle joint gait kinetics. Therefore, we hypothesized that ankle casting elicits muscle-tendon adaptations which concur with altered ankle joint kinetics during the stance phase of gait in children with SCP. More information is needed about the relationships between muscle structure and function, and the effect of specific interventions designed to alter muscle properties and associated functional outcomes in children with spastic cerebral palsy."

The rate of elastin breakdown is a predictor of mortality in patients with COPD. Decelerating elastinolysis might be an attractive therapeutic target in this debilitating condition. Vascular calcification starts in the elastin network of the arterial wall and is enhanced in patients with COPD. Elastin calcification is accompanied by an upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase gene expression and consequently a shift in the elastase/anti-elastase balance towards degradation. Magnesium can be regarded as a natural calcium antagonist and has the proven ability to ameliorate vascular calcification. Furthermore, an animal study has suggested that magnesium deficiency promotes elastin degradation. I hypothesize that inhibiting elastin calcification by means of magnesium supplementation might counteract both vascular calcification and elastin degradation in COPD. This could potentially have a favorable impact on cardiovascular and respiratory related morbidity/mortality in patients with COPD."

Furthermore, the excitability of the Vc with the stimulation of the peripheral nociceptive fibers innervating the intracranial vessels or dura matter is regarded as a main cellular substrate for migraine. Here, a revised hypothesis is introduced, reinforcing the previous hypothesis and complementing it. This hypothesis suggests that, besides the Vc, much broader areas of the trigeminal sensory nuclei (Vsn), i.e., the principal sensory nucleus (Vp), the oralis nucleus (Vo), and the interpolaris nucleus (Vi), contribute to process and integrate pain signals generated in the head. In addition, the plasticity of synaptic transmission between nuclei or subnuclei in the Vsn, in particular, the Vsp, can be a cellular model for migraine, in the same way as the hippocampal synaptic plasticity is a model for learning and memory. This hypothesis will contribute to the discovery of new therapeutic tools for patients with migraine."

In addition to biomechanical alterations associated with the pathomechanisms underlying PFP, the investigation of neurophysiological alterations has provided novel information in the understanding of the pathophysiology of PFP. For instance, women with PFP present lower amplitude of the vastus medialis (VM) H-reflexes compared to pain-free controls, which suggests that the excitability of spinal reflexes might be a promising tool for discriminating woman with PFP in clinical practice. However, the cross-sectional design of the current research does not inform whether the reduced excitability predisposes to or is the consequence of PFP. Therefore, two hypotheses can be raised: (1) the reduction in excitability of the α-motoneurons is a risk factor for PFP; Or, (2) the reduction in H-reflex excitability is a consequence of PFP due to pain. If the former hypothesis is proven correct, it may help in the early identification of individuals with PFP. If the latter, it may help understand the reduced excitability as a consequence of the long-term pain, which may be interfering in the recovery of individuals with PFP in a long-term basis. In addition, exploring such hypotheses may have direct rehabilitative and prevention implications for PFP and its putative progression to knee osteoarthritis."

Monitoring of PASNS during hospitalization will provide a metric which could be of immense value in unraveling of the pathophysiology and aiding in the management of the patients with TTS by predicting in-hospital complications, long-term outcome, and its recurrence. Recent work with noninvasive monitoring of skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA), via conventional electrodes used for the recording of the electrocardiogram have shown that the filtered signals >500 Hz originate in the cervical and stellate ganglia, which also innervate the heart, and thus they provide an estimate of stellate ganglion nerve activity.

Human ATR is homologous to bacterial ATR and B cells produce anti-ATR antibodies as an autoimmune response thereby reducing the concentration of ATR and thus limiting production of AdoCbl, one of the two bioactive forms of vitamin B12. The next step in MS pathogenesis is a period of subclinical AdoCbl deficiency over a period of many years resulting in production of odd-carbon-number fatty acids that are incorporated into myelin rendering it antigenic. The next step in MS pathogenesis is breach of the blood brain barrier thereby introducing leukocytes into the brain’s blood supply resulting in T cell attack of antigenic myelin. All epidemiological clusters are regions wherein the major agricultural products are legumes that produce a high percentage of odd-carbon-number fatty acids and contain symbiotic rhizobia type bacteria in root nodules and in the soil. This novel etiological hypothesis is called “multiple sclerosis due to adenosylcobalamin deficiency” (MS-AdoCbl). Creation of realistic animal models based on the MS-AdoCbl hypothesis is presented. Methods for testing predictions made by the MS-AdoCbl hypothesis are described."

abstract = "Women are at greater risk of developing osteoporosis (OP). However, in the past few years it has become more widely recognized that OP is a significant problem also in men although OP is frequently under-diagnosed and, consequently, under treated in men. Most guidelines, screening and fracture risk evaluation methods as well as pharmacologic agents have been developed for women and then adapted to men. Bone Mineral Density (BMD) measurement by Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) is reported as T score and the capability of DEXA to diagnose OP and predict fracture risk is still debated. In addition, the use of female T score references for the diagnosis of OP in men is incorrect for the following reasons: 1) DXA definition was developed just for Caucasian women, 2) men and women display structural differences in terms of bone growth, catabolism and size; 3) aging men have more periosteal apposition, less cortical porosity and endocortical resorption than aging women; and 4) T scores results, both in man and in women, can be affected by the presence of co-morbidities and it is known that in men OP is often secondary. From a biological point of view, OP is mainly due to increased osteoclastic activity leading to an imbalance in bone remodeling that favors resorption. However, some evidence suggests a more complex identity for osteoclasts (OCs) over and above their simple role of ‘bone eaters’. In our laboratory, we observed spontaneous OCs formation in vitro in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from OP patients (n.12 female patients and n.6 male patients; DXA T score-2.5 or less). Some researchers demonstrated OCs gender differences in bone resorption activity of female-derived versus male-derived OCs. Indeed, further data from our laboratory also showed gender differences in number of spontaneously differentiated OCs and differentiation time. Therefore, we hypothesized that it would be possible to perform OP screening and diagnosis observing and measuring PBMCs different ability to differentiate spontaneously into OCs in male and female patients. If this hypothesis will be confirmed, it will result in an effective and efficient strategy for OP screening, diagnosis, monitoring and fracture prevention, targeting health service resources on selected patients. However, our hypothesis must be tested in a properly designed clinical trial and several key issues still need to be addressed."

We present our hypothesis of using all possible information with a new concept of protective nerve stimulation together with first data supporting our theory. In protective nerve stimulation during ultrasound guided nerve blocks a fixed current of 1.0mA (0.1ms) is used without any change during block performance. The aim is no muscular twitches before and during injection.

AMD is anticipated to affect 196 million people worldwide, by 2020. However, the etiology of this disease remains unknown. Aging, genetic, and environmental influences have generally been implicated as major etiologic factors. We sought to examine the hypothesis that consumption of the ‘displacing foods of modern commerce,’ which equate to processed, nutrient-deficient and potentially toxic foods, may be the primary and proximate cause of AMD. To evaluate this hypothesis, we ran correlative AMD prevalence data against well-known proxy markers of processed food consumption, namely, sugar and vegetable oils, in 25 nations. In twenty-one nations, published studies provided AMD prevalence data and in four Pacific Island nations, practicing ophthalmologists in the regions completed retrospective chart analyses to estimate AMD prevalence in their respective regions. To estimate AMD prevalence historically, an extensive review of published papers and ophthalmic literature was completed. This review indicates that, between the years 1851 and 1930, AMD was a medical rarity worldwide, which then rose modestly in prevalence in the 1930s in the U.S. and U.K, finally elevating to epidemic proportions by 1975 in the U.S. Numerous developed nations have followed suit in recent decades. Simultaneously, between approximately 1880 and 2009, processed, nutrient-deficient foods gradually supplanted and displaced whole, unprocessed, nutrient-dense foods in developed nations, such that by 2009, 63 percent of the American diet was made up of nutrient-deficient foods in the form of refined white flour, added sugars, vegetable oils, and artificially created trans fats. The correlative data in 25 nations shows that increasing sugar and polyunsaturated vegetable oil consumption is invariably associated with new onset or rising prevalence of AMD, generally within about 30–40years of the beginning of increasing consumption of these proxy marker processed food components. The correlative data also demonstrates that, when consumption of sugar is moderate, but “harmful vegetable oil” consumption remains extremely low or absent, the prevalence of AMD remains rare. This study supports the hypothesis that the ‘displacing foods of modern commerce,’ which equate to processed, nutrient-deficient, and potentially toxic foods, are the primary and proximate cause of AMD. This study also supports the conclusion that macular degeneration is entirely preventable, through ancestral dietary strategy and avoidance of processed foods. Finally, this research has implications for patients with existing early and intermediate stages of AMD."

We present the case of a patient with evidence of exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi sl and a long history of debilitating fatigue, cognitive abnormalities and autonomic nervous system issues. The patient had a positive Western blot for anti-basal ganglia antibodies, and the autoantigen has been identified as γ enolase, the neuron-specific isoenzyme of the glycolytic enzyme enolase. Assuming Borrelia own surface exposed enolase as the source of this autoantibody, through a mechanism of molecular mimicry, and given the absence of sera reactivity to α enolase, a bioinformatical analysis was carried out to identify a possible cross-reactive conformational B cell epitope, shared by Borrelia enolase and γ enolase, but not by α enolase. Taken that evidence, we hypothesize that this autoantibody interferes with glycolysis in neuronal cells, as the physiological basis for chronic symptoms in at least some cases of PTLDS. Studies investigating on the anti-γ enolase and anti-Borrelia enolase antibodies in PTLDS are needed to confirm our hypotheses."

Unlike diabetes type 1, diabetes type 2 is more common in adults who simultaneously suffer from other comorbid conditions making them susceptible to repetitive fall incidents and sustaining head trauma. The resulting brain insult exacerbates current psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, which, in turn, increases the risk of sustaining further brain traumas. The relationship between diabetes, traumatic brain injury and psychiatric health constitutes a triad forming a non-reversible vicious cycle. At the proteomic and psychiatric levels, cellular, molecular and behavioral alterations have been reported with the induction of non-traumatic brain injury in diabetic models such as stroke. However, research into traumatic brain injury has not been systematically investigated. Thus, in cases of diabetic neuropathy complicated with traumatic brain injury, utilizing fine structural and analytical techniques allows the identification of key biological markers that can then be used as innovative diagnostics as well as novel therapeutic targets in an attempt to treat diabetes and its sequelae especially those arising from repetitive mild brain trauma."

Lisophosphatidic acid, which has been reported to be increased in patients with cholestasis and pruritus, has been described to cause scratching behavior that is prevented by an opiate antagonist in laboratory animals, suggesting an opioid-receptor mediated mechanism of scratching.

abstract = "Endometriosis is a risk factor for type I epithelial ovarian cancer but an issue to be clarified is the site of origin of endometriosis associated ovarian cancer. Here we proposed that the uterus may be the organ of origin of ovarian endometrioid cancer associated with endometriosis. Thus, the first neoplastic transformation would characterize the uterine cells migrating in the pelvis via retrograde menstruation and they would implant secondarily on the ovary. Supporting this hypothesis, an higher incidence of synchronous precancerous and cancerous endometrial pathology in patients affected by ovarian endometrioid cancer associated with endometriosis was showed. Moreover, uterine endometrial type I carcinoma resembles endometriosis associated endometrioid ovarian cancer in behavior and prognosis. This hypothesis is also supported by epidemiologic evidence showing a protective effect for tubal ligation and oral contraceptive use for endometriosis associated endometrioid ovarian cancer. Endometriosis and endometrioid ovarian carcinoma might represent two distinct biological entities characterized by the same organ of origin (the uterus), the same pathogenetic mechanism (transtubal reflux) and the same target organ (the ovary). By shifting the early events of ovarian carcinogenesis to the endometrium, prevention approaches as salpingectomy/tubal ligation and intervention at uterine corpus level may play an important role."

abstract = "The human brain loses its volume and its function during aging. The solid part of the brain within the intracranial space, the brain parenchyma, decreases in volume with age; while the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume increases. With progressive loss of brain parenchymal volume (BPV), CSF may shift from cerebral ventricles to the subdural space, forming subdural effusion (SDE), whose role in the brain aging process remains unclear. We hypothesize that damages associated with ventriculomegaly can be lessened after formation of SDE. As the BPV decreases, the enlarged ventricular surface area causes dysfunction of its lining ependymal cells, followed by damages to the periventricular tissue. The periventricular nerve fibers are stretched by the enlarged ventricles. We hypothesize that after the formation of SDE, ventriculomegaly can be stopped or even reversed. By allowing the atrophic brain to reside in a smaller fraction of the intracranial volume, damages associated with ventriculomegaly can be alleviated. If our hypothesis is correct, physicians should continue to maintain a conservative approach for uncomplicated SDE. For focal or global brain parenchymal loss caused by various pathologies, intracranial spacers can be employed to simulate the effect of SDE to protect the brain. For treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, aggressive ventricular size reduction should be pursued. Finally, the protective effects of SDE have its limits. Extremely enlarged subdural volume can cause acute or chronic subdural hematoma, further damaging the brain."

Signs and symptoms of ASD often appear in the first year of life while the disease strikes other infants who had previously been developing normally at around 2years of age. Ozonoff and her colleagues recently suggested that there are three different pathways or trajectories for the development of ASD in infants 6–24months of age. I hypothesize that pathway 1 is caused by in utero insult/injury, pathway 2 by obstetric complications at birth, and pathway 3 by environmental triggers of ASD affecting infants 0–3years of age. Faster progress can be made in elucidating the underlying causes of neonatal and regressive forms of ASD if the diseases are investigated separately, instead of being part of the same disorder."

abstract = "A fundamental function of the visual system is detecting motion, yet visual perception is poorly understood. Current research has determined that the retina and ganglion cells elicit responses for motion detection; however, the underlying mechanism for this is incompletely understood. Previously we proposed that retinogeniculo-cortical oscillations and photoreceptors work in parallel to process vision. Here we propose that motion could also be processed within the retina, and not in the brain as current theory suggests. In this paper, we discuss: 1) internal neural space formation; 2) primary, secondary, and tertiary roles of vision; 3) gamma as the secondary role; and 4) synchronization and coherence. Movement within the external field is instantly detected by primary processing within the space formed by the retina, providing a unified view of the world from an internal point of view. Our new theory begins to answer questions about: 1) perception of space, erect images, and motion, 2) purpose of lateral inhibition, 3) speed of visual perception, and 4) how peripheral color vision occurs without a large population of cones located peripherally in the retina. We explain that strong oscillatory activity influences on brain activity and is necessary for: 1) visual processing, and 2) formation of the internal visuospatial area necessary for visual consciousness, which could allow rods to receive precise visual and visuospatial information, while retinal waves could link the lateral geniculate body with the cortex to form a neural space formed by membrane potential-based oscillations and photoreceptors. We propose that vision is tripartite, with three components that allow a person to make sense of the world, terming them “primary, secondary, and tertiary roles” of vision. Finally, we propose that Gamma waves that are higher in strength and volume allow communication among the retina, thalamus, and various areas of the cortex, and synchronization brings cortical faculties to the retina, while the thalamus is the link that couples the retina to the rest of the brain through activity by gamma oscillations. This novel theory lays groundwork for further research by providing a theoretical understanding that expands upon the functions of the retina, photoreceptors, and retinal plexus to include parallel processing needed to form the internal visual space that we perceive as the external world."

Successful cognitive aging is intact cognition in the oldest-old; we define resistant successful cognitive aging as successful cognitive aging despite high risk. The protected survivor model posits that a minority of the general population has a protective factor that mitigates the negative effect of a risk factor on successful cognitive aging for the unprotected majority. As age increases, differential failure rates increase the proportion of survivors with protection. Among the unprotected, the proportion with low risk increases, but among those with protection, high risk and low risk do not differ. Due to differential mortality, half the survivors are eventually protected – a majority among those with high risk, and a minority among those with low risk. According to the protective survivor model, an example of Simpson’s paradox, the association of the risk factor with survival does not change within an individual, but the association in the surviving population changes as its age increases. We created quantitative illustrations of a simplified protected survivor model applied to successful cognitive aging to explain how the usual association of a risk factor with cognitive decline is reversed in the very old. In the illustrations, probability of subsequent survival was higher for survivors with high risk (mostly protected) than low risk (mostly not protected), an example of Simpson’s paradox. Resistance to disease despite the presence of risk factors is consistent with the presence of countervailing protection. Based on the protected survivor model, we hypothesize that studies seeking protective factors against cognitive decline will be more effective by limiting a successful cognitive aging sample to resistant successful cognitive aging – to contrast with a sample without successful cognitive aging."

We may wonder why the modality fail in some patients but perhaps the more proper question would be, why it works in so many? We know that the contribution of residual renal function (RRF), more so than in hemodialysis, is critically important to the well-being of many of the patients. Unique features of the modality include the relatively low volume of dialysate fluid needed to provide effective uremic control and the disproportionate tendency for both hypokalemia and hypoalbuminemia, when compared to hemodialysis. It is currently believed that most uremic toxins are generated on the interface of human and bacterial structures in the gastrointestinal tract, the intestinal biota. PD offers disproportionate removal of these toxins upon “first-pass”, i.e., via PD fluid exchanges before reaching the systemic circulation beyond the gastrointestinal compartment. Studies examining the net removal gradient of protein-bound uremic toxins during PD are scarce, whereas RRF receives considerably more attention without effective interventions being developed to preserve it. We propose an alternative view on PD, emphasizing the modality’s compartmental nature, both for its benefits and the limitations."

Testosterone or gonadotropins therapy are widely used to treat HH patients, however both have undesirable effects and GnRH treatment for HH patients is time and cost consuming. Direct delivery of therapeutics to the brain via the nasal route is located in the center of attention during the last decade and trial application of intranasal oxytocin as a method of enhancing social interactions are reported. It has been delineated that oxytocin stimulates GnRH release from the rat hypothalamic explants and intranasal applied oxytocin up-regulates GnRH expression in the male rat hypothalamus.

However, such mechanical effects play no role in the remarkable efficacy of gastric bypass. Instead, mounting evidence shows that altered neuroendocrine signaling is responsible for the weight reducing effects of RYGB. The exact mechanism of this surgical response is still a mystery. Here, we propose that RYGB leads to weight loss primarily by inducing a functional shift in the gut microbiome, manifested by a relative expansion of aerobic bacteria numbers in the colon. We point to compelling evidence that gastric bypass changes the function of the microbiome by disrupting intestinal gas homeostasis, causing excessive transit of swallowed air (oxygen) into the colon."

The aim in this paper is to build on this hypothesis and explore the relationship of solar irradiance of which UVB is a component, by latitude with the prevalence rates of ASD. Twenty-five reports published between 2011 and 2016 using comparable diagnostic criteria were reviewed. The results suggest a tendency for the prevalence rates of ASD to be lowest in countries near the equator and for this rate to increase as the latitude increases. These findings provide some support not just for the Vitamin D hypothesis, but also for a new proposition that along with UVB radiation, the entire solar radiation spectrum which reaches the earth, may play a role in ASD. While these results are both novel and encouraging in terms of the potential efficacy of exposure to natural sunlight, further research is warranted before results can be considered definitive, and before the implications of the findings can be implemented clinically."

On the contrary, there is some evidence that tight glycemic control in acute brain injury is associated with poor outcome. Current consensus derived guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommend an upper limit of blood glucose of 140–180mg/dl, as there is no evidence to support strict control. The lack of improved outcomes with normoglycemia in this population dictates reconsideration of assumptions regarding the underlying pathophysiology of hyperglycemia. Review of the current data suggests there are two distinct pathophysiologic entities of hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke patients: diabetic and non-diabetic.

Whereas the surgical approach is able to diminish the perceived knee pain of concerned patients’, the postoperative recovery is often accompanied by persistent skeletal muscle dysfunctions and atrophy, which is responsible for functional deficits for up to several years. Recent findings indicate that surgery induced adverse effects on skeletal muscles are largely associated with the use of pneumatic tourniquets, wherefore several studies try to reduce tourniquet use in orthopedic surgery. However, due to comparable incidence of muscle impairment and increased surgical challenge, the most frequently applied surgical technique in TKA is still associated with the use of tourniquets. When attenuating TKA induced adverse effects, the preoperative preparation of patients by specific exercises (called prehabilitation) was able to enhance preoperative overall fitness through associated accelerated recovery. Based on patients’ limited functional activity, prehabilitation techniques have to be particularly designed to allow regular adherence. The present paper is based on a narrative review of current literature, and provides a novel hypothesis by which blood flow restriction exercises (BFR) are able to improve patients’ compliance to prehabilitation. BFR training is characterized by the application of low-resistance exercise with similar intensities as daily living tasks in association with a suppression of venous blood flow in an extremity, achieving significant morphological and neuromuscular adaptations in skeletal muscles. In addition, preoperative enhancements in muscle health with corresponding benefits in overall fitness, BFR induced molecular alterations could also be able to interfere with TKA induced pathological signaling. Therefore, based on the known major impact of BFR on skeletal muscle physiology, the present paper aims to illustrate the potential beneficial impact of BFR training as a prehabilitation concept to promote patients regular adherence to preoperative exercises and thus achieve an accelerated recovery and increases in patients’ satisfaction."

As this is a never-smoker, the improvements cannot be attributed to smoking cessation. One possible explanation is that the improvement was due to antimicrobial properties of propylene glycol. The hypothesis could be tested by a trial of zero-nicotine e-cigarettes in patients with recurrent bacterial throat infection."

Hair follicles on frontal region are more vulnerable to DHT. With development of minimal invasive hair transplantation surgery, hair follicles transplantation could be performed from frontal or occipital region to frontal region. However, limited hair follicles remained a problem. With development of technology of vitrification, we suggested extracting hair follicles from frontal region without affecting the appearance and preserving them with vitrification when the patient was young. When alopecia progressively developed, these extracted hair follicles would increase the donor number of hair follicles used for transplantation, which could extend longer dense hair appearance."

Previous studies indicated that tumor exosomes derived from lung cancer cells contained abundant sortilin. Sortilin is a member of the vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein (VPS10P) family of receptors that act as co-receptors for p75NTR and play an independent role in cell death induced by proNGF. Recently, a study showed that proNGF could mediate the death of natural killer (NK) cells through binding to the p75NTR–sortilin complex. However, it has not been reported, to our knowledge, that lung cancer cells induce NK cell apoptosis through a p75NTR–proNGF–sortilin mechanism. As a secreted protein, lung cancer cells may release some proNGF into the tumor microenvironment. We therefore hypothesized that lung cancer cells may promote the apoptosis of NK cells through releasing exosomal sortilin and proNGF. To test this hypothesis, experiments involving the production of exosomal sortilin and proNGF in lung cancer cells and the expression of p75NTR in NK cells are required based upon previously established experiments using fluorescent components. Such experiments may provide insight into the potential mechanism by which lung cancer cells promote apoptosis of NK cells through a p75NTR–proNGF–sortilin pathway."

Geographic markers such as latitude/sunshine and more recently lactase population distributions are found to be correlated with IBD. As a result of clinical and pathogenic similarities between the 2 conditions, some authorities questioned whether a connection exists between them. We compare IBS directly with IBD, and indirectly with geographic markers associated with IBD, in order to evaluate possible evolutionary links between IBS and IBD. Similar correlations may link IBS as a precursor to IBD and possibly other conditions which are geographically connected with IBD. Data from four systematic reviews on IBD incidence and prevalence, IBS prevalence, and lactase distributions were included. Pearson’s correlations were used for comparisons, with IBD values log-transformed because of skewed distribution. The articles provided 18–28 complete set of national data. Direct comparison between IBS and IBD showed no significant correlations (r = −0.14, r = −0.06 for CD and UC prevalence, r = −0.10 for CD incidence). Indirect comparisons also failed to show correlations of IBS with lactase distributions (r = −0.17), sunshine (r = −0.2) or latitude (r = 0.097); however, there was significant correlation between lactase distributions and CD incidence (r = −0.84), prevalence (r = −0.55) and UC prevalence (r = −0.59). Both sunshine (r= −0.53) and latitude (r = 0.58) are also significantly related to CD incidence. It is concluded that IBS and IBD do not follow similar global geographic patterns. This suggests a lack of an evolutionary genetic background coincident with emergence of lactase persistence. As well, vitamin D has no obvious impact on development of IBS. Similarities with IBD may result from sub groups (not yet identified) within the current Rome criteria of IBS. Alternatively limited intestinal gut–brain responses to host microbial interactions may result in similar overlap features in both."

abstract = "Schizophrenia poses an evolutionary paradox, being genetically mediated yet associated with reduced fecundity. Numerous hypotheses have attempted to address this, but few describe how the schizophrenic phenotype itself might constitute an evolutionary adaptation. This paper draws on René Girard’s theory on human origins, which claims that humans evolved a tendency to mimic both the desires and the behaviours of each other (mimetic theory). This would have promoted social cohesion and co-operation, but at the cost of intra-group rivalry and conflict. The mimetic dynamic would have escalated such conflicts into reciprocal internecine violence, threatening the survival of the entire group. Girard theorised that the “scapegoat mechanism” emerged, by which means such violence was curtailed by the unanimity of “all against one”, thus allowing the mimetic impulse to safely evolve further, making language and complex social behaviours possible. Whereas scapegoating may have emerged in the entire population, and any member of a community could be scapegoated if necessary, this paper proposes that the scapegoat mechanism would have worked better in groups containing members who exhibited traits, recognised by all others, which singled them out as victims. Schizophrenia may be a functional adaptation, similar in evolutionary terms to altruism, in that it may have increased inclusive fitness, by providing scapegoat victims, the choice of whom was likely to be agreed upon unanimously, even during internecine conflict, thus restoring order and protecting the group from self-destruction. This evolutionary hypothesis, uses Girardian anthropology to combine the concept of the schizophrenic as religious shaman with that of the schizophrenic as scapegoat. It may help to reconcile divergent philosophical concepts of mental illness, and also help us to better understand, and thus counter, social exclusion and stigmatisation."

Building on current theoretical models, this paper proposes that microglial dysfunction could perpetuate functional changes within acute motor FND, thus providing a pathophysiological mechanism underlying the chronic stage of the motor FND phenotypes seen clinically. Core to our argument is microglia’s dual role in modulating neuroimmunity and their control of synaptic plasticity, which places them at a pathophysiological nexus wherein coincident physical trauma and psychological stress could cause long-term change in neuronal networks without producing macroscopic structural abnormality. This model proposes a range of hypotheses that are testable with current technologies."

abstract = "Elbow pain syndromes are common upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders, and they are usually associated with repetitive occupational exposure. Ligaments are often one of the sources of musculoskeletal disorders because of their mechanical and neurological properties. The wrist ligaments are some of the ligaments most vulnerable to occupational exposure. Since most occupational tasks require wrist extension for handling tools and loading, the scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) bears greater strain during loading, which results in creep deformation and hysteresis. Ligamentous creep may result in diminished ability to detect signal changes during joint movements, which impairs neuromuscular control established by ligamentomuscular reflex arcs elicited from mechanoreceptors in the ligaments. Changes in muscle activation patterns of forearm muscles due to diminished ligamentomuscular reflexes may initiate a positive feedback loop, leading to musculoskeletal pain syndromes. The relationship between elbow pain syndromes and SLIL injury will be presented through two hypotheses and relevant pain mechanisms: 1. Repetitive tasks may cause creep deformation of the SLIL, which then impairs ligamentomuscular reflexes, leading to elbow pain disorders. 2. Lateral epicondylalgia may increase the risk of SLIL injury through the compensation of the lower extensor carpi radialis muscle activity by higher extensor carpi ulnaris muscle activity, which may alter carpal kinematics, leading to SLIL degeneration over time. The differential diagnosis is usually complicated in musculoskeletal pain disorders. The failure of treatment methods is one of the issues of concern for many researchers. A key element in developing treatment strategies is to understand the source of the disorder and the nature of the injury. We proposed that the differential diagnosis include SLIL injuries when describing elbow pain syndromes, particularly, lateral epicondylalgia."

Using graph theory, previously well-known network measures of integration between brain regions have been constructed under the key assumption that information flows strictly along the shortest paths possible between two nodes. However, it is now apparent that information does flow through non-shortest paths in many real-world networks such as cellular networks, social networks, and the internet. In the current hypothesis, we present a novel framework using the maximum flow to quantify information flow along all possible paths within the brain, so as to implement an analogy to network traffic. We hypothesize that the connection strengths of brain networks represent a limit on the amount of information that can flow through the connections per unit of time. This allows us to compute the maximum amount of information flow between two brain regions along all possible paths. Using this novel framework of maximum flow, previous network topological measures are expanded to account for information flow through non-shortest paths. The most important advantage of the current approach using maximum flow is that it can integrate the weighted connectivity data in a way that better reflects the real information flow of the brain network. The current framework and its concept regarding maximum flow provides insight on how network structure shapes information flow in contrast to graph theory, and suggests future applications such as investigating structural and functional connectomes at a neuronal level."

abstract = "Aging is a progressive internal physiological deterioration of the organism, leading to the occurrence of age-related lethal diseases. It has become a major societal challenge to understand the processes that drive aging and to develop rational pharmacological agents and dietary approaches to fight against age-related deterioration and diseases. Interestingly, several lines of evidence highlight an influence of the developmental period on the risk of age-related diseases later in life. This field is known as the developmental origins of health and disease. Following this logic, studying the modification of maternal diet during early life may provide innovative new anti-aging approaches. Nutritional and psychological stresses during gestation are associated with poorer offspring health conditions in late life, and must be avoided during pregnancy. Besides these recommendations, very little has been published about the possible use of maternal diet to program offspring for healthy aging and an extended lifespan. Such health benefits may be provided by different foreign molecules, and particularly the phytochemicals produced by stressed plants, or xenohormetins. The xenohormesis hypothesis proposes that xenohormetins are signals of environmental change and trigger a beneficial adaptive response in individuals who consume them. No studies to date have investigated whether the consumption of stressed plants during pregnancy and lactation could provide chemical cues that impact early life programming and thus influence the future health and lifespan of offspring. Investigating the effect of xenohormesis in early life will involve adding edible plants exposed to different stressors (i.e. UV light, heat, ozone, etc.) to maternal diet and the exposure of offspring to this xenohormetin-enriched maternal diet at different periods of their prenatal life. The hypothesis proposed in this article is a potential tool to decipher the possible impact of xenohormesis during early life, and paving the way toward an innovative maternal diet that ensures the healthy aging of the progeny."

This transdiagnostic approach has recently been adopted into the study of anorexia nervosa (AN), an illness that can be considered compulsive in nature. This has led to the development of an account of AN that identifies key roles for the heightened reinforcement of starvation, leading to its excessive repetition, and goal-directed system dysfunction. Considering models of illness in other compulsive disorders, we extend the existing account to explain the emergence of reinforcement and goal-directed system abnormalities in AN, proposing that anxiety is central to both processes. As such we emphasise the particular importance of the anxiolytic effects of starvation, over other reinforcing outcomes, in encouraging the continuation of starvation within a model that proposes a number of mechanisms by which anxiety operates in the development and maintenance of AN. We suggest the psychopathology of AN mediates the relationship between the anxiolytic effects of starvation and excessive repetition of starvation, and that compulsive starvation has reciprocal effects on its determinants. We thus account for the emergence of symptoms of AN other than compulsive starvation, and for the relationship between different features of the disorder. By extending and adapting an existing explanation of AN, we provide a richer aetiological model that invites new research questions and could inform novel approaches to prevention and treatment."

However, a careful examination of the literature reveals a growing body of cross-sectional studies finding stronger associations between strength independent of physical activity on these various outcomes and biomarkers (i.e., C – reactive protein, homocysteine, total cholesterol) of health. Considering that engagement in resistance type exercise is associated with an increase in strength, such cross-sectional data is often used to promote engagement in resistance training. When one examines the cross-sectional studies together with the experimental work, however, this relationship becomes less clear. For example, being in a higher tertile or quartile for grip strength may be associated with more favorable biomarkers or health outcomes, yet, experimental work shows that grip strength does not change with traditional resistance exercise. This seems to suggest that our interpretation and application of this literature may be incorrect. It is our opinion that much of the cross-sectional work may more accurately illustrate inherent differences between individuals who are “weak” and individuals who are “strong”. In addition, there is conflicting experimental evidence and a lack of longitudinal support that resistance exercise may have a meaningful effect on long-term health outcomes. Using this evidence, we present our “human baseline hypothesis”, which proposes that the baseline value of strength that a person possesses prior to training may be a more appropriate indicator regarding long-term health outcomes than the act of training itself."

However, the mechanisms by which OSA causes cardiometabolic dysfunction are not fully elucidated. OSA increases plasma free fatty acids (FFA) during sleep, reflecting excessive adipose tissue lipolysis. In animal studies, intermittent hypoxia simulating OSA also increases FFA, and the increase is attenuated by beta-adrenergic blockade. In other contexts, excessive plasma FFA can lead to ectopic fat accumulation, insulin resistance, vascular dysfunction, and dyslipidemia. Herein, we propose that OSA is a cause of excessive adipose tissue lipolysis contributing towards systemic “lipotoxicity”. Since visceral and upper-body obesity contributes to OSA pathogenesis, OSA-induced lipolysis may further aggravate the consequences of this metabolically harmful state. If this hypothesis is correct, then OSA may represent a reversible risk factor for cardio-metabolic dysfunction, and this risk might be mitigated by preventing OSA-induced lipolysis during sleep."

Economic competitiveness and corporate profitability often pre-empt environmental concerns. The calving of an iceberg in Antarctica and the hurricane activity in the Caribbean during 2017 are unfortunate illustrations of the continuing escalation of environmental issues. We provide historical and current evidence for the importance of Nature Exposure (NE) and introduce the continuum Nature Exposure Sufficiency (NES) and Insufficiency (NEI). Insufficiency includes impoverished environments (e.g., slums and prisons) where nature exposure is very limited. Nature Exposure Sufficiency (NES) is an optimal amount of exposure to nature where many benefits such as reinvigoration can be obtained by everyone. NES also has several benefits for individuals with various health conditions such as arthritis, dementia, or depression. The benefits of NE are not just derivable from parks, forests, and other natural settings. Interiors of buildings and homes can be enhanced with plants and even pictures or objects from nature. Additionally, there is abundant evidence indicating that virtual and artificial environments depicting nature can provide substantial NE and therefore contribute to general wellbeing. Besides the difficulty in achieving cooperation amongst nations, corporations, and other collectives in developing and implementing long range plans to deal with climate change, there is also sometimes an aversion at the individual level whereby people are unwilling to experience nature due to insects and other discomforts. Such individuals are often averse to supplanting the comforts of home, even temporarily, with inadequate facilities that are seemingly less pleasant than their typical dwellings. We propose using the term Nature Exposure Aversion (NEA) to describe such behavior and propose that the aversion is largely due to conditioning. Such behavior may be addressed through desensitization in virtual environments which in turn may contribute to an endorsement of the view that climate change is occurring and must be dealt with. The issues of Nature Exposure Sufficiency and Insufficiency are intertwined with the sustainability of the planet and future planning and efforts to deal with the environment. If the outcome is unfavorable, the descent of civilization will be more rapid than the ascent."

abstract = "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a debilitating, widespread pain disorder that is assumed to originate from inappropriate pain processing in the central nervous system. Psychological and behavioral factors are both believed to underlie the pathogenesis and complicate the treatment. This hypothesis, however, has not yet been sufficiently supported by scientific evidence and accumulating evidence supports a peripheral neurological origin of the symptoms. We postulate that FM and several unexplained widespread pain syndromes are caused by chronic postural idiopathic cerebrospinal hypertension. Thus, the symptoms originate from the filling of nerve root sleeves under high pressure with subsequent polyradiculopathy from the compression of the nerve root fibers (axons) inside the sleeves. Associated symptoms, such as bladder and bowel dysfunction, result from compression of the sacral nerve root fibers, and facial pain and paresthesia result from compression of the cranial nerve root fibers. Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension, Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus and the clinical entity of symptomatic Tarlov cysts share similar central and peripheral neurological symptoms and are likely other manifestations of the same condition. The hypothesis presented in this article links the characteristics of fibromyalgia and unexplained widespread pain to cerebrospinal pressure dysregulation with support from scientific evidence and provides a conclusive explanation for the multitude of symptoms associated with fibromyalgia."

abstract = "Human movement is a complex orchestration of events involving many different body systems. Understanding how these systems interact during musculoskeletal movements can directly inform a variety of research fields including: injury etiology, injury prevention and therapeutic exercise prescription. Traditionally scientists have examined human movement through a reductionist lens whereby movements are broken down and observed in isolation. The process of reductionism fails to capture the interconnected complexities and the dynamic interactions found within complex systems such as human movement. An emerging idea is that human movement may be better understood using a holistic philosophy. In this regard, the properties of a given system cannot be determined or explained by its components alone, rather, it is the complexity of the system as a whole, that determines how the individual component parts behave. This paper hypothesizes that human movement can be better understood through holism; and provides available observational evidence in musculoskeletal science, which help to frame human movement as a globally interconnected complex system. Central to this, is biotensegrity, a concept where the bones of the skeletal system are postulated to be held together by the resting muscle tone of numerous viscoelastic muscular chains in a tension dependent manner. The design of a biotensegrity system suggests that when human movement occurs, the entire musculoskeletal system constantly adjusts during this movement causing global patterns to occur. This idea further supported by recent anatomical evidence suggesting that the muscles of the human body can no longer by viewed as independent anatomical structures that simply connect one bone to another bone. Rather, the body consists of numerous muscles connected in series, and end to end, which span the entire musculoskeletal system, creating long polyarticular viscoelastic myofascial muscle chains. Although theoretical, the concept of the human body being connected by these muscular chains, within a biotensegrity design, could be a potential underpinning theory for analyzing human movement in a more holistic manner. Indeed, preliminary research has now used the concept of myofascial pathways to enhance musculoskeletal examination, and provides a vivid example of how range of motion at a peripheral joint, is dependent upon the positioning of the entire body, offering supportive evidence that the body’s kinetic chain is globally interconnected. Theoretical models that introduce a complex systems approach should be welcomed by the movement science field in an attempt to help explain clinical questions that have been resistant to a linear model."

abstract = "The important role of microfilaria (worms) in human and animal disease remains an area of key disagreement between the naturopathic and allopathic physicians. While microfilaria infections are rampart in undeveloped countries, they rarely rise to identification as a cause of disease in Western countries. New research studies in the diagnosis and treatment of SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) and (IBD) Inflammatory Bowel Diseases of ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s Disease and microcytic colitis may make both sides equally correct. A study of rifaximin failures in SIBO positive individuals finds biomarkers of decreased Free Androgen Index (FAI), high incidence of autoimmune disease and elevated Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG). The author hypothesizes that the underlying pathophysiology is increased exposure to Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) which hormonally act as xeno-estrogens. These xeno-estrogens increase the host production of SHBG, reduce pituitary stimulation of androgen product and result in a shift to estrogen dominance. Estrogen dominance is associated with autoimmune diseases and catabolic states. Treatment with a mixture of anabolic steroids that raises the FAI and lowers SHBG results in dramatic improvement in the signs and symptoms and recovery of the vast percentage of severe SIBO sufferers the author has treated. Similar results have been seen in severe pre-surgical cases of IBD whom fail all pharmaceutical interventions. Based on the recent recognition of the biological importance of Wolbachia in the occurrence of major diseases in the underdeveloped countries such as onchocerciasis, and the sexual nature of Wolbachia’s role in helminths reproduction, the author hypothesizes that the EDCs are shifting the host’s hormonal milieu in a more estrogenic direction and increasing reproduction of helminths changing the gastrointestinal microbiota. Present allopathic treatment of onchocerciasis utilizes albendazole and avermectin as therapy against the microfilaria larvae and doxycycline as bactericidal for Wolbachia. The allopathic treatments are unacceptable for pregnancy and children. Both naturopathic and allopathic treatments share a common focus on the suppression of the underlying bacterium Wolbachia infestation. The author hypothesizes that treatment of these two very different gastrointestinal diseases involves first establishing a normal, anabolic hormonal milieu and concurrently controlling an underlying yet unrecognized microfilaria overgrowth through naturopathic and allopathic treatments prescribed to the host. A case report of one such critically ill individual is noted. A thorough case controlled observation of symptoms matched with biological culture colony count and concentration of microfilaria in disease before and after the aforementioned anabolic treatment may answer the hypothesis."

Large size of the training dataset is critical to increase the diagnostic accuracy. The performance of the trained machine could be tested by new images before clinical use.

Nanomedicine provides improved therapeutics. In the current paper we present preliminary data regarding the potential use of Ruxolitinib-conjugated gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in dermatological conditions, as GNPs have been proven to have a reduced absorption rate into the systemic blood flow for cutaneous administration. Internalization of the newly formed bioconjugate was assessed by electron microscopy and the functional effects of the drug were investigated by cell counting, flow cytometry and western blotting. Our data show that gold nanoparticles conjugated with Ruxolitinib inhibit the proliferation of fibroblasts by inhibiting JAK2 protein. Ruxolitinib carried by gold nanoparticles alters the proliferation of human fibroblasts, which is of great clinical importance as it can be readily administered on the skin with minimal risk of systemic side effects."

Leiomyomas (uterine fibroids) are benign tumors, which pose a huge threat concerning various health problems in women affected by this condition. The exact cause of leiomyomas development is, however, still largely unknown. Therefore, in an attempt to clarify their etiology, we performed an immunohistochemical characterization of telocytes in leiomyomas as well as in normal myometrium. Tissue samples of intramural leiomyomas from 26 women (age 46.26 ± 11.07) were immunohistochemically stained for the expression of c-kit (CD117) antigen, one of the markers of telocytes. C-kit (CD117) antigen is useful for a routine immunohistochemical identification of uterine telocytes in histological sections of myometrium. In normal, healthy myometrium the c-kit positive telocytes occupy approximately 2.2% of the area of a tissue slide, contrasting with no detectable c-kit positive cells within leiomyomas. As telocytes are thought to be key players in the regulation of tissue homoeostasis, our data suggest that uterine telocyte loss may have important implications in the pathogenesis of leiomyomas. In addition, we supposed to summarize three hypotheses on the association of the cells telocytes loss within the myometrium and formation of leiomyomas. These hypotheses include the loss of telocytes’ functions as “sex hormone sensors” and regulators of smooth muscle cells cycle; the role of telocytes as progenitor cells for the development of leiomyomas; and the hypothesis of decreased angiogenesis after telocytes’ loss with subsequent hypoxia (as a key factor for leiomyomas development)."

The aim of this study was to examine the ultrastructural changes in the myocardium of human with end-stage heart failure. Left ventricular myocardial tissue samples from 7 patients with end-stage heart failure were examined with transmission and scanning electron microscopy. All heart failure patients were of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III–IV. The data indicated normal three-dimensional arrangement of cardiac muscle cells in failing myocardium. The various organelles in cardiomyocytes including the nucleus, mitochondria, myofibrils, T-tubules and intercalated discs did not exhibit any remarkable morphological changes. We did observe the appearance of small membrane bound vesicles which appear to be associated with the intercalated discs. The nearly normal ultrastructure and arrangement of cardiomyocytes was remarkable in contrast to the dramatic clinical status of these patients in heart failure. These observations support the hypothesis, that there are no dramatic changes in the ultrastructure or three-dimensional architecture of cardiomyocytes in end-stage failing human myocardium."

However, iron has also been shown to be an essential nutrient for rapidly proliferating tissues and cells. In this respect, anemia of inflammation, characterized by limited duodenal iron uptake and sequestration of iron into the reticuloendothelial system, might be regarded as a potentially effective defense strategy of the human body against tumor growth. We therefore hypothesize that iron therapy, by supporting colorectal tumor growth and increasing the metastatic potential, may worsen tumor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. This hypothesis is particularly supported for colorectal cancer by laboratory, epidemiological and animal studies, demonstrating the role of iron in all aspects of tumor development growth. Compared to non-malignant colon cells, tumor cells differ in the levels and activity of many iron import and export proteins, resulting in an increase in intracellular iron level and enhanced proliferation. In addition, it is demonstrated that iron is able to amplify Wnt signaling in tumors with Apc mutation, a critical mutation in the development of colorectal cancer. If our hypothesis is to be confirmed, current practice of iron administration, as treatment for anemia and as replacement of blood transfusions, can be hazardous and should be completely reconsidered."

This elevation makes advanced glycation a significant association with the disease. Early detection of vaginal wall glycation could therefore be relevant in the prevention and management of pelvic organ prolapse. A vaginal wall biopsy to detect this would be ideal, but is invasive. Therefore the use of a more accessible organ to access, such as skin, would be beneficial. Our previous independent study suggests that conditions such as pregnancy, can induce a change in the vaginal tissues’ glycation content. The aim of this study was to assess whether the skin glycation undergoes similar changes as observed in vaginal tissue glycation in the same subjects in order to prove the hypothesis that skin advanced glycation content can predict vaginal tissue glycation. A rat model was used. The vaginal tissues from non-pregnant and E15-E18 pregnant rats and skin tissues from the same rats were taken for the measurement of advanced glycation content. The glycation marker, pentosidine, was quantified by a high performance liquid chromatography. Our results demonstrated that glycation content in vaginal wall tissues from pregnant rats was lower than the tissues from non-pregnant ones, and a strong positive association between skin and vaginal wall pentosidine level was observed. We conclude that skin pentosidine is reflective of vaginal wall pentosidine. Skin glycation may therefore be a potential tool in the prediction and management of pelvic organ prolapse."

The resulting sample could then be treated to further augment cell concentration and injected, under fluoroscopic control, into the non-union site through a percutaneous approach."

Leprosy has a broad range of clinical manifestations that range from mild (tuberculoid leprosy) to severe (lepromatous leprosy) forms, and are highly dependent on the host’s immune response. Among the immune response elements involved in the pathogenesis of leprosy are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), vitamin D receptor (VDR), natural killer cells (NK), and T cells. These innate and adaptive immune response elements may be related to the Notch signaling pathway, which is involved in immune cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation. We hypothesize that failure in Notch signaling in leprosy patients may be associated to: 1) compromising NK cell maturation, lysing of infected cells, and CD4+ Th1 differentiation. 2) VDR alterations and TLR polymorphisms may affect expression of Notch Delta-like ligands (DLL) in antigen presenting cells (APCs). 3) altered DLL expression by APCs could compromise CD4+ T cell differentiation towards the Th1 and Th17 effector phenotypes; and finally 4) expression of Notch Jagged ligands would induce CD4+ T cell differentiation towards Th2 effector phenotype and alternative activation of macrophages. Altogether, these signaling failures could favor proliferation of M. leprae in the host. Therefore, evidence of the proposed immunologic failures in leprosy patients would be essential for the better understanding of immunopathogenesis of this disease, and would ultimately enable detection of susceptible individuals, providing a valuable tool for prevention of this debilitating disease."

Therefore, understanding early stress as a first wave of stress in life is necessary in order to explore a possible second wave hit model. From this perspective, we believe that breast cancer can be understood as a second wave of stress during development and that, in addition to the first wave, can cause important impacts on the response to cancer treatment, such as increased chances of disease progression and distinct behavioral responses. In this article we propose a second wave hit hypothesis applied to breast cancer and its implications on the immune, endocrine and cognitive systems, through mechanisms that involve the HPA axis and subsequent activations of stress responses."

abstract = "At present there is no therapy for Alzheimer’s Disease which completely stops the progressive dementia effecting late onset Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients. It is felt that the main reason for this failure is that AD appears to be a disease caused by four major pathological processes. To date, efforts to develop treatments have addressed only one or another of these four etiologies. However, even a partially effective therapy against one cause allows the others, untreated, to continue their inexorable destruction of the neurons of the brain. It is suggested that a therapy is required which inhibits all four causes of the disease. Just such a therapy is proposed here with four specific drugs and a vitomer together in a combination treatment. The four major pathologic processes causing AD are: I. vascular hypoperfusion of the brain with associated mitochondrial dysfunction. II. destructive protein occlusions. III. uncontrolled oxidate stress and IV: pro-inflammatory immune processes secondary to microglial and astrocytic dysfunction in the brain. A detailed literature search has provided four drugs and a B6 vitomer which together provide an ideal combination to treat the four etiologies of AD. All four drugs are used clinically for various indications and would be used “off label” in combination to treat AD. The drugs have been used in preliminary studies to treat dementia with favorable indications in all of them inhibiting dementia with only modest side effects. In in vitro studies all five of the combination have been shown effective in inhibiting one or more of the four disease etiologies and together they are effective against all four. The four drugs are Trental, Nicergoline, Nilotinib, and Methylene blue. The vitamer is B6 pyridoxamine. The cumulative benefits of this combination should provide an effective treatment to completely stop the progressive dementia of AD, measured in 12–18months. The use of an endpoint of complete cessation of progressive dementia rather than the standard of a statistical determination of the slowing of progressive dementia allows the study to be conducted with a cohort of only 15 patients (no statistics and no placebo patients) as every AD patient would otherwise show progressive dementia without the effective treatment."

Recent research has shown that traumatic events may affect not only the victims’ lives, but also that of their progeny. It is generally accepted that this transmission of trauma occurs through parental behavior; however as has been recently discovered, the effects of trauma may also be inherited due to induced alterations in gene expression. These changes, so called epigenetic modifications, illuminate the interaction between genes and the environment. In contrast to mutations, epigenetic alterations do not change the DNA code, but rather modify the DNA structure, thus being capable of regulating gene expression and in turn making it possible for an individual to genetically respond to environmental changes. There are four possible epigenetic mechanisms: paramutation, DNA methylation, posttranslational modification of histones, and non-coding RNA. All of these mechanisms can be found both in somatic cells and in germ cells, leading to the putative transmission of alterations upon fertilization. To date, little is known regarding the epigenetic inheritance of trauma in humans. In this review, we elucidate the hypothesis that males may transmit biological correlates of traumatization through the germline to their offspring. This model of epigenetic inheritance has been supported by some evidence from animal studies. Overall, by considering findings on the epigenetic inheritance of traumatizing events in other mammals as well as findings on epigenetic transmission of acquired traits in humans, it should be possible through future research to confirm the transmission of traumatic effects in humans. By doing so, new possibilities of trauma treatment through modulation of epigenetic pathways might arise."

NK cell counts and function are elevated following acute exercise, and the generally accepted mechanism of increased recruitment suggests that binding of epinephrine releases NK cells from endothelial tissue via decreases in adhesion molecules following. I propose that blood flow-induced shear stress may also play a role in NK cell recruitment from the endothelium. Additionally, shear stress may play a role in improving NK cell function by decreasing oxidative stress. The relationship between shear stress and NK cell count and function can be tested by utilizing exercise and local heating with cuff inflation. If shear stress does play an important role, NK cell count and function will be improved in the non-cuffed exercise group, but not the cuffed limb. This paper will explore the mechanisms potentially explaining exercise-induced improvements in NK cell count and function, and propose a model for investigating these mechanisms. This mechanistic insight could aid in providing a novel, safe, relatively inexpensive, and non-invasive target for immunotherapy in cancer patients."

abstract = "Meningitis is an infectious disease commonly arising from a bacterial etiology. The rapid progression of morbidity and mortality due to bacterial meningitis requires critical and imminent time-dependent clinical intervention. Although it is unambiguously clear that bacteria must infiltrate the cerebrospinal fluid, the sequence of events in the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis has not been fully elucidated. Most reviews of the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis do not specify the anatomical location of bacteria following BBB traversal. We propose an additional hypothesis focusing on the Virchow-Robin space (VRS). The VRS consists of a small, but identifiable perivascular space formed by a sheath of cells derived from the pia mater. The VRS has been described as an immunological space and possibly having a role in several neuropathological diseases. Solute exchange between cerebrospinal fluid and extracellular fluid occurs at the VRS, with subsequent drainage into the subarachnoid space. Because the VRS is continuous with the subpial space, a more direct route to the meninges is facilitated. The involvement of the VRS may have profound implications on the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies: (1) nasopharyngeal colonization; (2) penetration into the blood stream after crossing the mucosal and epithelial membranes; (3) proliferation in the bloodstream; (4) extravasations through the endothelium of the post-capillary venules to the perivascular VRS; (5) migration from VRS to subpial space; (6) traversal through pia mater, entering the CSF in the subarachnoid space; (7) invasion of the meninges. The implication of the VRS in the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis would be twofold. First, the VRS could provide an additional route of entry of bacteria into the brain. Second, the VRS could provide an area for bacterial proliferation, and thereby serve as a bacterial reservoir in relatively close proximity to the meninges. The clinical consequences of this hypothesis are: 1) clinical interpretation of laboratory findings, and 2) effective antibiotic delivery into the VRS. If the role of the VRS is established as part of bacterial meningitis pathogenesis, antibiotic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the VRS need to be determined. This may result in developing novel antibiotic delivery and clinical strategies to improve morbidity and mortality."

abstract = "Both, hamstring and ACL injuries are among the most typical injuries, particularly in change of direction and high speed running sports. They're also difficult to treat. Therefore, in the past few years, sports medicine practitioners and exercise scientists have mainly been focusing on the development and implementation of preventive programs in order to reduce the number of lower limb injuries, mainly by improving knee alignment. A number of studies have been able to prove the success of these training interventions, which are mainly addressing sensorimotor abilities and plyometric activities. The number of non-contact hamstring injuries has nevertheless been on the rise, particularly in sports like soccer and football. Therefore, the purpose of the following article is to introduce the hypothesis that the above-mentioned training interventions have a massive influence on the activation patterns on the targeted muscle group, and on the M. biceps femoris in particular. Muscle function and the resulting internal load are directly related to muscle architecture at the insertion. Training induced adaptations in hamstring activation patterns can thus lead to an increased injury susceptibility. In this case, a simulation model that directly relates to an acute deceleration maneuver provides valuable insights into the function of the biceps femoris muscle, especially when the rate of activity and the muscle geometry at the insertion area are taken into consideration. We conclude that there needs to be a greater individualization of prevention programs, especially in regards to anatomical requirements, in order to further reduce injury rates in elite sports. Moreover, it would also seem reasonable to apply a similar approach to aspects of chronic pain such as chronic non-specific low back pain."

“Bolus death” or “Café Coronary syndrome” refers to death due to asphyxia caused by an occlusion of the upper airways due to food. In this kind of asphyxia, the food bolus obstructs the larynx or the bronchial branches. This kind of event often affects subjects with acute intoxication due to alcohol or drugs, or with edentulism and with neurological or psychiatric diseases.
Case report
An elderly woman, suffering from schizophrenia, was found dead in her house due to food bolus asphyxia. The post-mortem toxicological analysis on the deceased’s biological fluids revealed the presence of tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics and neuroleptics. Study of the oral cavity showed the presence of partial edentulism and periodontal disease.
Hypothesis
We hypothesize that this kind of asphyxia in adults can be prevented. We believe that there are two major preventable factors: edentulism and salivation disorders in elderly and neuropsychiatric patients. The primary prevention of these pathologies would deal with the basic physician, similarly to other screenings already effectively in place.
Conclusions
It is possible to prevent fatal asphyxia in subjects who suffer from this kind of diseases through appropriate screening. This prevention strategy would greatly reduce the amount of choking deaths in adults."

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) or biventricular pacing (BIVP) has become a common procedure for the treatment of ventricular dyssynchrony in patients with heart failure, particularly in those with bundle branch block patterns (QRS durations >150ms) on the electrocardiogram (ECG). However, a large group of non-responders are made up of patients with dyssynchrony and QRS duration below 130ms. Recent studies have introduced permanent His bundle pacing as another method for achieving normalization of the QRS duration even in a majority of patients with right or left bundle branch block pattern on the ECG.
Hypotheses
We hypothesize 1. Biventricular pacing, (BIVP) performed as the standard procedure for CRT is inherently abnormal, spatially, at the right and left ventricular apex, and temporally, in regard to the timing of normal activation of the interventricular conduction system. Corollary 1. Permanent, selective, His bundle pacing (PHBP) is the most physiological form of ventricular pacing which replicates the normal activation of the interventricular conduction system. Corollary 2. An appropriately powered, prospective, crossover trial comparing PHBP with BIVP will show that the former is associated with the same benefits in patients with heart failure and QRS durations >130ms and would improve, rather than worsen, outcomes in heart failure patients with QRS duration <130ms. We present experimental and clinical evidence in support of these hypotheses."

We conducted a kinematic analysis of grasping movements with a pediatric patient suffering from CRPS in an upper limb to investigate how pain-related fear affects motor control. Using a three-dimensional measurement system, we recorded the patient’s movement while grasping three vertical bars of different diameters (thin, middle, thick) with the affected and intact hands. We analyzed the maximum grasp distance between the thumb and the index finger (MGD), the peak velocity of the grasp movement (PV), and the time required for the finger opening phase (TOP) and closing phase (TCP). Consequently, the MGD and PV of grasp movements in the affected hand were significantly smaller than those of the intact hand when grasping the middle and thick bars. This might reflect pain-related fear against visual information of the target size which evokes sensation of difficulty in opening fingers widely to grasp the middle and thick bars. Although MGD and PV increased with target size, the TOP was longer in the affected hand when grasping the thick bar. These findings indicate that pain-related fear impairs motor commands that are sent to the musculoskeletal system, subsequently disrupting executed movements and their sensory feedback. Using kinematic analysis, we objectively demonstrated that pain-related fear affects the process of sending motor commands towards the musculoskeletal system in the CRPS-affected hand, providing a possible explanatory model of pathological pain."

However, despite improved survival rates since the introduction of staged surgical reconstruction, treatment options for HLHS remain palliative rather than curative. A major limiting factor in the development of definitive curative therapy for HLHS is an incomplete understanding of its pathogenesis. Currently, the aetiology HLHS is best conceptualised by the ‘flow theory’ of cardiogenesis, which states that normal cardiac development is reliant on the interrelationship of normal flow patterns of blood through the developing heart, and appropriate growth of the cardiac valves and myocardium. Thus, congenital cardiac malformations, such as HLHS, are thought to arise when these two processes are incorrectly coupled in utero. The rationale for the hypothesis proposed herein rests upon the flow theory of cardiogenesis. Morphological studies of HLHS indicate that, although underdeveloped, all left-sided cardiac structures are present and anatomically correct. Further, of the various structural abnormalities that can occur within the spectrum of HLHS, the presence of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) is rare. The rarity of a VSD within the morphological spectrum of HLHS suggests the syndrome may not develop in the presence of a functionally significant VSD. Presumably, the presence of a functional VSD establishes a communication between the two ventricles during cardiac development, and preserves the normal pressure-flow-dependent growth of the left ventricular (LV) myocardium, despite inflow/outflow valve defects. It is proposed that surgical creation of a VSD in utero will ‘rescue’ the LV of hearts with left-sided valvular deformities that render them susceptible to the development of HLHS later in gestation. In evaluating this hypothesis, potential techniques for surgical creation of a VSD in utero are offered. These techniques are based on already established catheter-based in utero interventions, and conventional postnatal percutaneous procedures for VSD creation. Further discussion is also offered on techniques to avoid, and manage, potential complications (i.e. conduction system damage) of the proposed technique(s). Finally, if VSD creation in utero is indeed practically feasible, and successfully establishes the hypothesised hemodynamic and myocardial growth normalisation within the abnormally developing LV, the clinical implications are profound. This procedure may hold a potential cure for almost every sub-type of HLHS."

As such, attention bias modification (ABM) was conceived as a treatment option where anxiety is alleviated through a computerized cognitive training regimen that reduces an individual’s attentional bias to threat. Although ABM appears to be a promising treatment option for anxiety, the mechanism of action by which the treatment is effective is unknown. We hypothesize that effective ABM treatment is associated with neuroplasticity-related structural changes in an extended amygdala – prefrontal cortex network that can be detected with standard T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Literature regarding [1] effects of brain damage on attention bias, [2] functional neuroimaging of attention bias, [3] structural neuroimaging of attention bias, and [4] functional neuroimaging of ABM training all support the role of this network as the underlying mechanism of attention bias behavior and neuroplasticity-related changes in attentional bias. Additionally, we provide proof of principle pilot data that ABM training reduces MRI measures of gray matter volume in the basal forebrain/extended amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex. Greater reduction in gray matter volume corresponds to greater reduction in attentional bias. In addition, level of pre-training bias appears to be a strong indicator of treatment outcome. In short, we provide converging evidence for the hypothesis that the mechanism underlying effective ABM training is reduced gray matter volume in an extended amygdala network. MRI-based measures of neuroplasticity in this network could be an important target outcome for the treatment of anxiety with ABM."

It is known that women with PCOS are more likely to suffer from psychological problems, especially anxiety and depression, than other women. However, little is known of how much of this is due to testosterone, and if so, what the mechanism(s) might be. This study explores the hypothesis that testosterone impacts women with PCOS both directly and indirectly, via testosterone currently in the bloodstream and through prenatal exposure. It is hypothesised that direct effects occur when testosterone acts directly upon receptors; indirect effects occur where the impact of testosterone is mediated via another variable; activational effects are ephemeral and are caused by testosterone in the bloodstream; organizational effects occur prenatally and cause permanent changes. Four pathways are hypothesised in this paper: 1/ a direct and activational pathway which improves mental rotation ability; 2/ an indirect and activational pathway, whereby distress is caused when the physiological symptoms of testosterone are experienced as embarrassing or otherwise disturbing; 3/ an indirect and organizational effect on mood, where elevated prenatal testosterone predisposes women with PCOS to low blood sugar levels and thus low mood; 4/ and finally, it is suggested that the pathway from biology to psychology can be travelled in reverse, with a direct activational effect of relaxation training on the reduction of adrenal androgens. Testing these hypotheses has important implications for our understanding of PCOS, and our ability to treat this condition more effectively."

abstract = "In recent years, studies have suggested a novel pathway for cell survival, which faces scientific skepticism and interest in its concept of cell ‘resurrection’ – that is, the anastasis of cells at late-stage apoptosis. While biomarkers have been discovered, many of these are related to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response – acting also to promote cell survival in the presence of perturbation. The promises of anastasis, if accepted, will greatly impact translational medicine especially in the treatment of cancer, since apoptosis is generally irreversible in the late stages, and chemotherapy is performed to maximize tumor death and minimize off-target effects. As with all new concepts, there is a need to demarcate anastasis from a well-studied survival mechanism – the ER stress response – if the concept is to progress any further. In this article, it is proposed that anastasis and the ER stress response are one and the same mechanism, demarcated only by the presence of persistent stress. Further, anastasis solves the paradox of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cancer by providing rationale in C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)-induced tumor survival, such that CHOP-mediated apoptosis initiates genetic alterations in favor of its survival. After which, the cell regenerates through an enhanced ER stress response. Hence, anastatic cell recovery is the ER stress response post-apoptosis."

Since respiration entails intake of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide from tissues as waste product, the notion of administering carbon dioxide in respiratory failure appears counter-intuitive. However, carbon dioxide stimulates the chemosensitive area of the medulla, known as the central respiratory chemoreceptor, which activates the respiratory groups of neurones in the brainstem and stimulates inspiration thereby initiating oxygen intake during normal breathing. This vital initiation of normal breathing is via a reduction in the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid and the medullary interstitial fluid. We hypothesise that in cases of type I respiratory failure in which the PaCO2 is low, administration of carbon dioxide by inhalation would stimulate the respiratory groups of brainstem neurones and facilitate breathing, which would be of therapeutic value. Preliminary clinical evidence in favour of this hypothesis is presented and we recommend that a formal randomised study be carried out."

A writer and a revolutionary, he embraced the ideals of the French Revolution and took part in the stormy political discussions, which the fall of the Republic of Venice had provoked. Despite his poor health, Foscolo lived an adventurous life serving as a volunteer in the Guardia Nazionale and in the Napoleonic army. Following Napoleon’s fall (1814), he went into voluntary exile in early 1815. He reached London in Sept. 1816 and lived in poverty at Turnham Green (Chiswick) until his premature death. Foscolo’s medical history has been poorly investigated and the cause of his death remains unclear. In an attempt to shed light on his clinical history, we analyzed his Correspondence (Epistolario), a series of more than 3000 letters written between 1794 and 1827. From the age of 26 (1808), Foscolo had frequent episodes of cough and dyspnea that progressively worsened. Four acute respiratory exacerbations occurred in 1812. Between September 1812 and April 1813, he had breathlessness as that of asthma. Frail and ailing, he developed a chronic liver disease in 1826. In August 1827, weakness, dyspepsia and drowsiness further increased and dropsy became manifest. He went into coma on September 7, 1827 and died aged 49 three days later. Based on a brief history of urethritis and urinary obstructions (1811–1812), previous scholars have suggested that Foscolo had urethral stenosis that caused a chronic bladder outlet obstruction and led to consequent renal failure. This hypothesis, however, does not mention the respiratory symptomatology present since 1804, which is a pivotal feature of Foscolo’s illness. We surmise that Foscolo suffered from alpha-1 anti trypsin (AAT) deficiency, a rare genetic disease, which caused his premature death and support our interpretation with documental evidence."

Mycoplasma infections cause diseases in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, urethritis in men resulting in painful dysuria, urgency and urethral discharge. Cough, fever, headache, urethritis may persist for several weeks and convalescence is slow. The symptoms of these diseases are aggravated by the detection of mycoplasma infections, that takes either a long time, besides being expensive or is specific and restricted to only a limited number of contaminant strains. Mycoplasmas are hard to detect visually but could be seen and followed by time-lapse microscopy. Our hypothesis is that one can detect mycoplasma infection irrespective of its origin and type of mycoplasma. Main lines of supporting evidence are provided by the time-lapse microscopy showing dynamic morphological alterations caused by mycoplasmas before changes in human cell cultures become visible. Morphometric measurements of mycoplasma infections revealed four subphases: i) detachment of infected cells, ii) aggregation, iii) biofilm formation and iv) shrinkage of infected cells. The applicability of time-lapse microscopy for the detection of mycoplasma infection was validated by a mycoplasma test Kit. Most important implications related to morphometric parameters include the observation of mycoplasma infected cultures for an extended period of time instead of applying static snap-shot microscopy. A reliable method is offered to estimate the time of mycoplasma exposure that elapsed during the cell growth. This microphotometric approach served a more economical detection of mycoplasma contamination at its early stage of cell growth and spread, irrespective of the origin of contaminated serum, without defining the type of mycoplasma."

The best regimen for treating Plasmodium falciparum induced malaria is based on artemisinin and its derivatives which were prescribed as artemisinin combination therapy (ACT). These are highly effective drugs resulting in rapid clearance of parasites even in severe P. falciparum induced malaria patients. However, from the past few years parasites resistant to ACT’s have begun to emerge in various parts of the world such as Cambodia and Greater Mekong Subregion. Currently, the ACT’s resistance is comparatively low with clinical presentation of hindered artemisinin clearance and a small reduction in artemisinin sensitivity in cultured isolates. In order to counteract this, we hypothesize artesunate and quercetin/luteolin loaded self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) which could provide an alternate drug combination to ACT induced P. falciparum resistance to treat malaria. The proposed formulation design can significantly help in reduction of dose and dosing frequency, which ultimately enhance patient compliance with decreased drug toxicity. We presume that if this hypothesis proves correct, it may become an additional novel tool and one of the plausible therapeutic options in treating malaria."

Although this effect has been attributed to an optimization of biotin’s essential cofactor role in the brain, a case can be made that direct stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by pharmacological concentrations of biotin plays a key role in this regard. The utility of high-dose biotin in MS might reflect an anti-inflammatory effect of cGMP on the cerebral microvasculature, as well on oligodendrocyte differentiation and on Schwann cell production of neurotrophic factors thought to have potential for managing MS. But biotin’s ability to boost cGMP synthesis in the brain may have broader neuroprotective potential. In many types of neurons and neural cells, cGMP exerts neurotrophic-mimetic effects – entailing activation of the PI3K-Akt and Ras-ERK pathways – that promote neuron survival and plasticity. Hippocampal long term potentiation requires nitric oxide synthesis, which in turn promotes an activating phosphorylation of CREB via a pathway involving cGMP and protein kinase G (PKG). In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyloid beta suppresses this mechanism by inhibiting sGC activity; agents which exert a countervailing effect by boosting cGMP levels tend to restore effective long-term potentiation in rodent models of AD. Moreover, NO/cGMP suppresses amyloid beta production within the brain by inhibiting expression of amyloid precursor protein and BACE1. In conjunction with cGMP’s ability to oppose neuron apoptosis, these effects suggest that high-dose biotin might have potential for the prevention and management of AD. cGMP also promotes neurogenesis, and may lessen stroke risk by impeding atherogenesis and hypertrophic remodeling in the cerebral vasculature. The neuroprotective potential of high-dose biotin likely could be boosted by concurrent administration of brain-permeable phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors."

Previous studies have detected herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA inside patient’s aqueous humor. However, no further explanation for HSV-related etiology of ICE syndrome was established. Besides, construction of animal models using HSV all failed, leaving behind a blank space about how HSV infection finally led to ICE syndrome. By summarizing findings from previous studies, we came up with a hypothesis about etiology of ICE syndrome: HSV infection initiated ICE syndrome by integration of viral genetic material into human genome. Infection of HSV changed activity and morphology of endothelial cells, making them regain the ability of mitosis. Proof of such hypothesis will provide a theoretical foundation for construction of animal models and effective intervention of the disease."

Approximately 90% of survivors will have moderate to severe neurological injury ranging from moderate cognitive impairment to brain death. Currently, few early prognostic indicators are considered reliable enough to support patients’ families and clinicians’ in their decisions regarding medical futility. Blood biomarkers of neurological injury after OHCA may be of prognostic value in these cases. When most bodily tissues are oxygen-deprived, cellular metabolism switches from aerobic to anaerobic respiration. Neurons are a notable exception, however, being dependent solely upon aerobic respiration. Thus, after several minutes without circulating oxygen, neurons sustain irreversible damage, and certain measurable biomarkers are released into the circulation. Prior studies have demonstrated value in blood biomarkers in prediction of survival and neurologic impairment after OHCA. We hypothesize that understanding peptide biomarker kinetics in the early return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) period, especially in the setting of refractory cardiac arrest, may assist clinicians in determining prognosis earlier in acute resuscitation. Specifically, during and after immediate resuscitation and return of ROSC, clinicians and families face a series of important questions regarding patient prognosis, futility of care and allocation of scarce resources such as the early initiation of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). The ability to provide early prognostic information in this setting is highly valuable. Currently available, as well as potential biomarkers that could be good candidates in prognostication of neurological outcomes after OHCA or in the setting of refractory cardiac arrest will be reviewed and discussed."

With respect to female contraceptive methods, many have been developed, marketed, and are widely available. In contrast, male contraception has been limited to condoms, which pose logistical challenges, and vasectomy, which is largely irreversible. The use of sound to achieve effective and safe male contraception is a promising but unproven hypothesis. Based on the existing and incomplete totality of evidence, we hypothesize that the combination of sound with a modified ultrasonic technique in a single system will provide a practical delivery method that merges all of the appropriate and prescribed frequencies to have spermicidal qualities that may result in effective and safe male contraception. It is also plausible that any experimental male contraceptive method that heats the testicles where they can no longer produce sperm offers the possibility of a favourable benefit to risk ratio. The single system combining sound with a modified ultrasonic technique includes an acoustically suitable pad to assure proper transmission and delivery without concern for injury from the ultrasound frequencies, an amplification and regulation module, a frequency source generator, the complementary heat created along with external and targeted directionality, and various transport methods, such as wired, wireless, or remote. This methodology also offers the ability to move quickly to prototype, achieve multiple patent crossovers, secure and employ commercially available technologies, and provide the opportunity for rapid regulatory approval worldwide. These concepts have been explored in basic research in many animal species as well as humans. To achieve an adequate totality of evidence, the test of this hypothesis requires further basic research in humans to clarify the relevant mechanisms, clinical and observational epidemiologic studies to further explore the hypothesis, and large-scale randomized trials to detect the most plausible magnitude of benefits of this promising but unproven technology. It is plausible that this technology will represent a major breakthrough to combat world population growth.

abstract = "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by the loss of insulin secreting cells due to a directed autoimmune process, which is linked to oxidative stress and inflammation. Exercise training is known to induce several benefits by reducing inflammation and improving antioxidant defenses. In this context, exercise training may be considered as an efficient and relatively inexpensive non-pharmacological tool for diabetes treatment, added to the usual insulin administration. Unfortunately, most people with T1DM do not reach the recommended levels of physical activity due to concerns with hypoglycemic episodes. Recent data have demonstrated that exercise sessions composed by strength exercises or high-intensity interval exercise reduce the risk of hypoglycemia during and after the physical effort, when compared with continuous aerobic exercise in insulin-dependent patients. However, no studies have tested the chronic effects of this combination of protocols on health-related markers yet. Herein, we suggest a combination of hypertrophic strength exercises (3 sets at 8-RM) with a high-intensity interval protocol (10×60-s bouts at ∼90% HRmax interspersed with 60s recovery) in the same exercise session, three times per week, for T1DM patients free of micro and macrovascular complications. Our hypothesis is that this training protocol may minimize the exercise-associated rapid drop of glucose levels in T1DM, due to glucoregulatory hormones and transient reduction of insulin-mediated glucose uptake. This training is also likely to cover long-term glycaemic, bioenergetic, neuromuscular and cardiorespiratory adaptations, implicating in improved health and decreased risk of micro and macro complications."

The example of pre-eclampsia and normal pregnancy were studied to see if the hypoxia-induced disorders can be dragged towards adaptation. Here, we analyse the genetic variants that are known to be associated with adaptation to high altitude hypoxia. Our results demonstrated that the genetic variants of EPAS1, ADAM9, and EGLN1 increased approximately three-fold in the cases of preeclampsia compared to normal pregnancy. This may suggest the ability of the hypoxic cells of preeclampsia to respond to the high selective pressure of hypoxia with a higher degree of genetic variability, which can lead to adaptation. Signs of “acclimatisation” were seen both in cases and controls but with higher frequencies in controls. This can be a new approach that follows patients’ genetic selection and susceptibility of individuals for adaptability, which could be enhanced by drug development."

The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) modulates waking and REM sleep, and is part of the reticular activating system (RAS). The properties of PPN cells are unique in that all PPN neurons fire maximally at gamma band frequency regardless of electrophysiological or transmitter type, thus proposed as one origin of “bottom-up” gamma. This property is based on the presence of intrinsic membrane oscillations subserved by high threshold, voltage-dependent calcium channels. Moreover, some PPN cells are electrically coupled. Assuming that the population of PPN neurons has the capacity to fire at ∼40Hz coherently, then the population as a whole can be expected to generate a stable gamma band signal. But what if not all the neurons are firing at the peaks of the oscillations? That means that some cells may fire only at the peaks of every second oscillation. Therefore, the population as a whole can be expected to be firing at a net ∼20Hz. If some cells are firing at the peaks of every fourth oscillation, then the PPN as a whole would be firing at ∼10Hz. Firing at rates below 10Hz would imply that the system is seldom firing at the peaks of any oscillation, basically asleep, in slow wave sleep, thus the activation of the RAS is insufficient to promote waking. This hypothesis carries certain implications, one of which is that we awaken in stages as more and more cells are recruited to fire at the peaks of more and more oscillations. For this system, it would imply that, as we awaken, we step from ∼10Hz to ∼20Hz to ∼30Hz to ∼40Hz, that is, in stages and presumably at different levels of awareness. A similar process can be expected to take place as we fall asleep. Awakening can then be considered to be stepwise, not linear. That is, the implication is that the process of waking is a stepwise event, not a gradual increase, suggesting that the brain can spend time at each of these different stages of arousal."

It is hypothesized here that, depending on the parameters, one of the means by which long-term electromagnetic field exposure has the potential to eventually lead to immunosuppression is via downstream inhibition of the enzyme calcineurin — a protein phosphatase, which activates the T-cells of the immune system and can be blocked by pharmaceutical agents. Calcineurin is the target of a class of pharmaceuticals called calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, pimecrolimus and tacrolimus). When organ transplant recipients take such pharmaceuticals to prevent or suppress organ transplant rejection, one of the major side effects is immunosuppression leading to increased risk of opportunistic infection: e.g., fungal, viral (Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus), atypical bacterial (Nocardia, Listeria, mycobacterial, mycoplasma), and parasitic (e.g., toxoplasmosis) infections. Frequent anecdotal reports, as well as a number of scientific studies, have shown that electromagnetic field exposures may indeed produce the same effect: a weakened immune system leading to an increase in the same or similar opportunistic infections: i.e., fungal, viral, atypical bacterial, and parasitic infections. Furthermore, numerous research studies have shown that man-made electromagnetic fields have the potential to open voltage-gated calcium channels, which can in turn produce a pathological increase of intracellular calcium, leading downstream to the pathological production of a series of reactive oxygen species. Finally, there are a number of research studies demonstrating the inhibition of calcineurin by a pathological production of reactive oxygen species. Hence, it is hypothesized here that exposures to electromagnetic fields have the potential to inhibit immune system response by means of an eventual pathological increase in the influx of calcium into the cytoplasm of the cell, which induces a pathological production of reactive oxygen species, which in turn can have an inhibitory effect on calcineurin. Calcineurin inhibition leads to immunosuppression, which in turn leads to a weakened immune system and an increase in opportunistic infection."

New maternal impulses are at odds with their original ambitions and for many mothers stress and frustration will be the result as they have to combine child care with workweeks of 60–80h to reach or remain at the top. Pregnancy hormones modify the female’s brain as has been demonstrated already for decades in animals. This brain plasticity due to adult neurogenesis in the so called maternal circuitry of the limbic system is long-lasting and perhaps lifelong. In humans hormonal and neuro-imaging studies show ample evidence for fundamental and long lasting pregnancy induced brain changes, not only in the limbic system, but also in the cortical networks like theory of mind and mirror neuron system. Recent research shows pronounced and long lasting brain changes in several of these areas. It can be concluded that there exists a maternal brain that drives mother’s behaviour and priorities. Research in men shows that the more fathers are involved in raising their children, the more caring behaviour they develop. Structural anatomical changes are found in neural regions involved in parental motivation. These studies show that brain plasticity in fathers is experience dependent. In Nordic countries, a policy of paid paternal leave followed by a flexible shared parental leave, stimulates fatherly behaviour. This might reduce men’s eagerness for top careers, thus creating better opportunities for women. Demolition of women’s glass ceiling starts with the father."

abstract = "The cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) increases with age, up until the midpoint of life in males and females. However, LDL-C can decrease with age in older men and women. Intriguingly, a recent systematic review also revealed an inverse association between LDL-C levels and cardiovascular mortality in older people; low levels of LDL-C were associated with reduced risk of mortality. Such findings are puzzling and require a biological explanation. In this paper a hypothesis is proposed to explain these observations. We hypothesize that the free radical theory of ageing (FRTA) together with disrupted cholesterol homeostasis can account for these observations. Based on this hypothesis, dysregulated hepatic cholesterol homeostasis in older people is characterised by two distinct metabolic states. The first state accounts for an older person who has elevated plasma LDL-C. This state is underpinned by the FRTA which suggests there is a decrease in cellular antioxidant capacity with age. This deficiency enables hepatic reactive oxidative species (ROS) to induce the total activation of HMG-CoA reductase, the key rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. An increase in cholesterol synthesis elicits a corresponding rise in LDL-C, due to the downregulation of LDL receptor synthesis, and increased production of very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C). In the second state of dysregulation, ROS also trigger the total activation of HMG-CoA reductase. However, due to an age associated decrease in the activity of cholesterol-esterifying enzyme, acyl CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase, there is restricted conversion of excess free cholesterol (FC) to cholesterol esters. Consequently, the secretion of VLDL-C drops, and there is a corresponding decrease in LDL-C. As intracellular levels of FC accumulate, this state progresses to a pathophysiological condition akin to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It is our conjecture this deleterious state has the potential to account for the inverse association between LDL-C level and CVD risk observed in older people."

With the development of the total mesorectal and complete mesocolic excision (TME/CME), the local relapse rate of colorectal cancer has significantly decreased. People attributed it to the improvement of lymphadenectomy, but lymphatic metastasis is difficult to explain the local relapse in N0 patients. Previously, we have proven the existence of “Metastasis V” in mesogastrium and mesocolorectum, and supposed that it is one of the major risk factors in local recurrence. Therefore, we think complete mesentery excision can effectively reduce “Metastasis V”, prevent cancer leak and improve patients’ outcome. Due to the different length and complexity of mesentery, the difficulty of mesentery excision varies. Meanwhile, there is an obvious distinction of local relapse rate in different alimentary tract, even in different segment of a same organ. Thus we assume that the length and complexity of mesentery may be a risk factor of the locoregional recurrence of the carcinoma in gut."

However, there is evidence that tumor-specific cathepsins (lysosomal proteases) circulate systemically long before a cancer is clinically apparent. As such, we hypothesize that cathepsins, by virtue of their proteolytic activity, impart molecular changes in tissues remote from the primary tumor. These subtle molecular changes, which are specific for various tumors, can be readily detected by FDA of hair, nails and skin. We call for more research in the utility of FDA and tumor specific cathepsins for the early and non-invasive diagnosis of various malignancies."

Despite these complexities, apoptosis of the structures within the inner ear, is a theme common to many forms of acquired hearing loss. Apoptosis is a calcium-dependent process, and within the inner ear, L- and T-type calcium channels are believed to contribute to calcium availability during this process. There are few studies limited to animal models evaluating the role of calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) as otoprotective agents in the setting of acquired hearing loss. Here, I hypothesize that CCBs will provide utility as a therapy against acquired forms of sensorineural hearing loss by preventing calcium influx that occurs during inner ear cellular apoptosis."

Many studies exist that have analyzed the composition of the bacterial community in the different regions of the GIT of humans and model animals. Microbial imbalance leads to several systemic disorders, including cardiovascular and renal disease. The imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their elimination by antioxidants leads to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress plays an important role in a variety of physiological processes, as well as disease. The continuous formation of ROS in the GIT is the result of the interaction between intestinal mucosa, symbiotic bacteria and dietary factors. It has also been proven that ROS play a role in the pathogenesis of several GI disorders, including IBD. We hypothesized that the levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) would be the highest in the ileum, caecum or colon, where the microbiota mostly consist of butyrate producing bacteria, Bacterioides, Clostridium, Ruminococcus or Bifidobacterium, which derive energy through carbohydrate fermentation. We also assumed that advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) mostly act in the segments, where bacteria reside and which are responsible for the amino acid fermentation, such as caecum or colon. Lipid hydroxyperoxides are generated during digestion in the stomach, which contains absorbed oxygen and has a low pH. According to this we hypothesized that the highest concentration of thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) could be in the stomach, which, however, has not been confirmed. Because Lactobacilli are able to produce catalase, an endogenous antioxidant, and are abundant in the small intestine, we hypothesized that antioxidant capacity (measured by ferric reducing ability) would be the highest here. The highest levels of AGEs were found in the caecum. The highest level of TBARS was found in the jejunum of the rats. The assessment of our hypothesis also revealed high levels of AOPP in the caecum. It has been shown that AOPP contributes to the progression of IBD. The ferric reducing ability of tissue was the lowest in the colon of the experimental animals, which is in accordance with previous studies that show that rat colon has a lower total antioxidant capacity than the small bowel. In summary, we offer some insight into the differences between the oxidative status along the GIT of rats and some advice concerning supportive antioxidant therapy of gastrointestinal diseases."

Elastin is a unique protein providing deformability and resilience to dynamic tissues, such as arteries and lungs. It is an absolute basic requirement for circulation and respiration. Elastin can be degraded by elastases and has a high calcium affinity. Elastin calcification and elastin degradation are two pathological processes that impair elastin’s functioning. Furthermore, elastin degradation can be associated to elastin calcification. Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) is probably the most potent natural inhibitor of elastin calcification and requires vitamin K for its activation. Measuring circulating levels of inactive MGP (dp-ucMGP) is a frequently used method to assess vitamin K status. Dp-ucMGP reflects the burden of vitamin K-dependent proteins that have not been activated by vitamin K and could therefore best be regarded as a biomarker of a vitamin K deficit. Dp-ucMGP levels decrease after vitamin K supplementation. Since the amino acids desmosine and isodesmosine (DES) are unique to crosslinked elastin fibers, systemic elastin degradation can be assessed with the plasma DES assay. Recently, we discovered a strong correlation between plasma dp-ucMGP and plasma DES levels in both patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and controls. The ‘Vitamin K deficit and elastolysis theory’ posits that elastin degradation causes a rise in the vitamin K deficit and implies that vitamin K supplementation could be preventing elastin degradation. If this hypothesis holds true and is universally found in every state and condition, it will have an unprecedented impact on the management of every single pulmonary disease characterized by accelerated elastin degradation, such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, bronchiectasis, COPD and cystic fibrosis. Theoretically, a plasma dp-ucMGP concentration of zero would be associated with a near-complete standstill of elastin degradation and disease progression in patients with any of these debilitating conditions."

Patients undergoing bariatric surgery achieve a significant decrease in their excess weight and a multitude of sequela associated with obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is an intestinal peptide that has been implicated as one of the weight loss-independent mechanisms in how bariatric surgery affects type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 improves insulin secretion, inhibits apoptosis and induce pancreatic islet neogenesis, promotes satiety, and can regulate heart rate and blood pressure. Moreover, numerous studies have demonstrated potential neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects of GLP-1. Increased GLP-1 activity has been shown to increase cortical activity, promote neuronal growth, and inhibit neuronal degeneration. Specifically, in experimental studies on Alzheimer’s disease, GLP-1 decreases amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles. Furthermore, recent studies have also suggested that GLP-1 based therapies, new class of antidiabetic drugs, have favorable effects on neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. We present a hypothesis that bariatric surgery can help delay or even prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s disease in long-term by increasing the levels of GLP-1. This hypothesis has a potential for many studies from basic science projects to large population studies to fully understand the neurological and cognitive consequences of bariatric surgery and associated rise in GLP-1."

MicroRNAs (miR) have been reported to be involved in the process of cardiac remodeling, a recent study shows that miR-93 is elevated in the blood of CAD patients. Similar to human CAD, we found miR-93 is elevated both in ventricle tissue and blood in mice MI model, and miR-93 is secreted from cardiomyocytes cultured under hypoxia. Interestingly, miR-93 inhibits apoptosis and protects cardiomyocytes from ischemia/reperfusion injury. In other type of ischemic disease like stoke and peripheral arterial disease, miR-93 shows long term protective effects via enhancing angiogenesis, inducing macrophage M2 polarization and antioxidant effects. These effects are favorable for ventricle remodeling inhibition after MI. In a pilot experiment, we indicated that miR-93 knockdown deteriorate cardiac remodeling in 30days after MI in mice models. Therefore, we hypothesize that miR-93 upregulation and secretion from cardiomyocytes after MI is adaptive, which could inhibit cardiac remodeling and heart failure."

Even though brain edema occurs in the whole brain, the authors assume that the characteristically focal appearance of demyelinated lesions, for instance of multiple sclerosis plaques, are attributable to anatomical and structural characteristics of the brain. In an experimental section, a balloon inserted into the brain and other organs removed during autopsies produces an increased tissue pressure. This model shows tissue pressure in the vicinity of the balloon up to 80mmHg. The height of the produced pressure varies in different organs and special regions of the brain. The verified pressures in the pons cerebri show that stretched myelinated fiber bundles in outer regions can induce strong pressures in enclosed edematous tissue, as seen in central pontine myelinolysis. The presented experimental results support the hypothesis that demyelinated lesions, as seen in multiple sclerosis, may be caused by increased tissue pressure, or respectively, brain edema."

Theta and lower theta waves of the EEG have essential role in proper functioning of the memory performance. Both endotracheal intubation and atropine administration in CPR process can abolish these waves. We hypothesize that CI in CPR survivors can be caused by disturbance in aforementioned waves due to endotracheal intubation and atropine administration."

They ushered in the age of targeted chemotherapy in 1910 with the discovery of the anti-syphilitic organic arsenic agent, arsphenamine or Salvarsan (also known as 606). It was the clinical compound of choice for treating syphilis until penicillin and other antibiotics were introduced clinically in the 1940s. Yet now, more than 100years after its discovery, the precise biochemical mechanism by which this compound eliminates the syphilis spirochete in vivo from humans and animals remains unknown. Other organic arsenic compounds such as melarsoprol and roxarson have been used to treat parasitic infections. More recently, arsenic trioxide has been shown effective in producing remissions and possibly cures in a high percentage of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, the exact biochemical mechanism by which this clinical result is manifested remains to be determined. The purpose of this publication is to propose a possible mechanism, by which these apparently diverse arsenic compounds function to produce their clinical results and to suggest their potential for the treatment of infections caused by resistant organisms."

Complex multicellular organisms harbor the necessary properties to produce bacteria (water, nitrogen and oxygen). C.

The latter property coupled with overgrowth and immune compromising factors such as HIV/AIDS, cancer treatments, organ transplantation, diabetes, corticosteroid use, dentures, and broad-spectrum antibiotic use have modified the fungus from a normal component of the microflora to a foe of an oral cavity and resulting in reduced sensitivity towards commonly utilised antifungal agents. Hence, the need for alternative therapy to curb this plight is of importance. Making use of biomolecules produced by Streptococcus mutans, application of lactoferrin which is a nonspecific host defense factor found in saliva with metal chelating and broader antimicrobial properties, use of probiotics which have the capacity to boost the host immunity through eliciting Immunoglobulin A synthesis, and perturbing the pathogen’s environment via competition of space and food, and application of photodynamic therapy can help to manage the burden of oral candidiasis."

Evidence is growing that at least for cam impingement, and perhaps less so for pincer impingement, there is a relation to the development of osteoarthritis. It has been demonstrated that surgery for impingement can improve function and decrease pain. Intuitively, it would then make sense that surgical intervention would prevent further degeneration. However, available literature to date cannot assure that it does. Therefore, the impingement itself seems not a sufficient cause to consistently cause osteoarthritis. For many years we have observed a phenomenon whereby the femoral head ‘migrates’ anteriorly and superiorly in the acetabulum in patients with cam impingement. The same, but less constant, can be observed in pincer impingement, where the head may migrate posteriorly and medially. Migration of the femoral head is known in the literature and seen as caused by, or as part of, osteoarthritis of the hip. We suggest that the migration is caused by the impingement, and that the femoral head wanders into the impingement-related area with cartilage damage. In cam impingement this may be anterolateral, in pincer impingement posteromedial. The effect must be a huge increase in compression forces, especially in cam impingement. The migration may even lead to, or be a sign of, micro-instability of the femoral head in the acetabulum, which may produce an increase in shear forces. We therefore hypothesise that impingement may lead to osteoarthritis by means of migration and the possible existence of micro-instability of the femoral head. Detecting and quantifying these phenomena seem of uttermost importance and may add a new dimension to conservative hip surgery."

We herein present the hypothesis that a causal link between small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and functional dyspepsia might exist. Development of functional dyspepsia symptoms may derive from abnormal fermentation of carbohydrates due to increased proliferation of coliform bacteria, resulting in luminal distension, increased intestinal permeability and immune response perpetuation in predisposed hosts, secondary to an episode of infectious gastroenteritis. Moreover, the treatment of functional dyspepsia remains challenging and we explore the feasibility of innovative therapeutic modalities based on our hypothesis."

abstract = "Chronic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI) is a form of central neuropathic pain that is debilitating and often refractory to current pharmacological treatments. Neurostimulation pain therapies, such as epidural spinal cord stimulation, have only moderate success in reducing SCI pain. The pathogenesis of SCI pain may involve a state of central neuronal hyperexcitability, especially in the spinal cord dorsal horn, that develops after injury. We hypothesize that the neuronal structures near the spinal cord injury site may be an important pain generator, and intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) may normalize dorsal horn neuronal hyperexcitability and hence alleviate SCI pain. Specifically, ISMS may induce frequency-dependent conduction block on axons of afferent sensory neurons, in the spinothalamic tract and Lissauer’s tract. ISMS may also facilitate primary afferent depolarization that elicits presynaptic inhibition of incoming afferent inputs. Together, these actions will reduce abnormal afferent inputs and ascending pain signals before they can reach the brain. Furthermore, ISMS may directly induce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in dorsal horn neurons, and trigger the release of endogenous inhibitory neurotransmitters, opioids and serotonin to inhibit postsynaptic neurons and restore the compromised segmental pain inhibition after SCI. Finally, ISMS may alter the frequency and pattern of discharge such that the rostrally conducted impulses no longer code pain or activate brain areas concerned with pain signaling. Based on recent progress in understanding spinal learning and plasticity, we also postulate that repetitive or long-term ISMS may help the dorsal horn “reset” neuronal excitability and regain normal pain processing for a prolonged period. By finely tuning the stimulation parameters (e.g., intensity, pulse width, frequency), position, and geometry of ISMS electrode, multiple spinal structures (e.g., dorsal horn, dorsal column, spinothalamic tract) may be modulated to induce synergistic pain inhibition. Our hypothesis can be readily tested in preclinical models of SCI pain by using a combination of in vivo electrophysiological (neuronal activity) and animal behavioral (pain response) approaches. Since ISMS electrodes stimulate the spinal structures directly, we expect that the effective stimulus intensity and energy consumption can be lower than that for epidural spinal cord stimulation. The proposed hypothesis may provide insights and rationales for developing a novel neurostimulation pain therapy by directly inhibiting the pain generators in the spinal cord, and ISMS may be an alternative strategy to treat SCI pain."

As cannabis legalization, use, and potency has increased worldwide over the past decade, so has the prevalence of CHS. These patients often require acute care and inpatient treatment for refractory emesis, electrolyte derangement, dehydration, acute renal failure, and injury to the upper gastrointestinal tract. Routinely-prescribed antiemetics are frequently associated with treatment failure in CHS, necessitating use of sedating agents such as benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. Hydrotherapy with hot water provides short-term symptomatic relief from acute episodes of CHS. The reasons for this may be from chronic and/or excessive cannabis use leading to abnormal stimulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in CHS patients. Overuse of cannabis may also lead to dysfunction of the endocannabinoid system, which is essential for allostasis of the autonomic nervous system after stress."

The majority of the cases is asymptomatic and up to 85% are due to single gland adenoma. Parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice after localization of the hyperactive gland. Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC) is the most common cancer of the thyroid and constitutes more than 70% of thyroid malignancies. PTC can present as a single nodule or can be Multifocal. The incidence is higher in women. Early treatment favors a good prognosis. PTC with PHPT has been reported in 2.3–4.3% of patients undergoing surgery for PHPT. The coexistence of parathyroid adenoma and incidental PTC is thought to be rare. The mechanisms underlying the relationship between PHPT and PTC have not been established. We suggest a possible hypothesis for the relationship based on shared embryological origin and genes, high parathyroid hormone (PTH), low 1,25 hydroxy vitamin D, hypercalcemia resulting in high levels of angiogenic growth factors. This promotes the formation of parathyroid adenomas and papillary thyroid carcinoma. Presence of these two diseases can complicate patient management due to untreated hypercalcemia, unrecognized thyroid cancer and need for second surgery if not screened for both diseases carefully."

While corticosteroid therapy is currently the recommended treatment for HSP, dapsone, an anti-leprosy agent, has also recently been suggested to have therapeutic efficacy due to its ability to suppress IL-8. Moreover, in addition to IL-8 suppression, dapsone has been reported to exert various anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the generation of toxic free radicals, myeloperoxidase mediated halogenation that converts H2O2 to HOCl, leukocyte chemotaxis, production of tumor necrosis factor, and other anti-inflammatory molecules.

Only well-informed consumers can shop effectively for food rich in dietary fibre and thereby derive the health benefits that fibre can offer.

However, this knowledge is not the only important determinant; food purchases are influenced by socioeconomic and demographic factors. Our hypothesis is that the level of knowledge about fibre and fibre consumption varies with age, gender, education level and urban or rural environment. It is our assumption that life styles, environmental conditions and education can affect the level of knowledge and perception about healthy eating habits. If this assumption is accurate, targeted education campaigns to educate and sensitise the population about fibre-rich foods and the health benefits of fibre is a priority. Public health programmes are urgently needed, particularly in rural areas, to sensitise the population to fulfill the recommended fibre intake, high-fibre food sources and the mechanisms by which fibre can help prevent disease."

The pathophysiologic background of the biochemical determinants of vascular volume in HF status, however, has not been known. I recently demonstrated that changes in vascular and red blood cell volumes are independently associated with the serum chloride concentration, but not the serum sodium concentration, during worsening HF and its recovery. Based on these observations and the established central role of chloride in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, I propose a unifying hypothesis of the “chloride theory” for HF pathophysiology, which states that changes in the serum chloride concentration are the primary determinant of changes in plasma volume and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system under worsening HF and therapeutic resolution of worsening HF."

It is the most common eye disease affecting millions of people aged 50years or older, and is slowly becoming a major health problem worldwide. The disease mainly affects macula lutea, an oval-shaped pigmented area surrounding fovea near the center of retina, a region responsible for visual acuity. It is fairly a complex disease as genetics of patients, environmental triggers as well as risk factors such as age, family history of CVDs, diabetes, gender, obesity, race, hyperopia, iris color, smoking, diabetes, exposure to sun light and pyroptosis have all been clubbed together as probable causes of macular degeneration. Among genes that are known to play a role include variant polymorphisms in the complement cascade components such as CFH, C2, C3, and CFB as potential genetic risk factors. So far, AMD disease hypothesized theories have not resulted into the anticipated impact towards the development of effective or preventive therapies in order to help alleviate patients’ suffering because, as of today, it is still unclear what actually initiates or leads to this dreaded eye condition. Based upon our extensive work on the metabolism of homocysteine (Hcy) in various disease conditions we, therefore, are proposing a novel hypothesis for AMD pathogenesis as we strongly believe that Hcy and events such as pyroptosis make a greater contribution to the overall etiology of AMD disease in a target population of susceptible hosts by inciting and accelerating the inherent inflammatory changes in the retina of these patients (Fig. 2). In this context, we further state that Hcy and pyroptosis should be considered as legitimate and valuable markers of retinal dysfunction as they not only aid and abet in the development but also in the progression of AMD in older people as discussed in this paper. This discussion should open up new avenues in tackling inflammatory and pyroptosis centered pathways that are up-regulated or solely promoted by Hcy interaction within the ocular compartment of AMD susceptible hosts."

Unremittent psychological stress causes dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamic–pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis, which collectively promotes inflammation, atherosclerosis, and subsequent CVD risk. Stress reduction techniques, such as mindfulness meditation, have been shown to improve some markers of HPA and SNS function at rest and in response to acute stressors, suggesting that such techniques, over time, may be cardioprotective. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that eight weeks of daily mindfulness meditation, compared to a non-mindful relaxation control, may provide a novel strategy to buffer stress responses in healthy and at-risk populations, thereby lowering the risk of chronic psychological stress and the associated CVD risk as measured by arterial stiffness. The current paper outlines methodological considerations for testing this hypothesis, including appropriate acute stressors, and measurement of SNS, HPA axis and cardiovascular function. If the hypothesis is correct, mindfulness meditation would complement healthy lifestyle techniques such as exercise and diet to prevent CVD risk."

It is classified into three categories, of which the idiopathic type accounts for the vast majority of cases. As indicated by the name, the etiology of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome remains unknown though it has been suggested that impaired T cell function is involved. Recently, evidence has mounted to suggest that dysfunction in regulatory T cells plays an important role in the development of allergic disease, a recognized comorbid condition for children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. It is known that regulatory T cells are mainly induced by short chain fatty acids produced by gut microbiota and that children with allergy are reported to have aberrant gut microbiota. On this basis, we hypothesize that an aberrant microbiota, i.e., dysbiosis in the gut resulting in defective induction of regulatory T cells, is also involved in the etiology of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children. Our hypothesis can be directly tested by metagenome analysis using bacterial DNA extracted from the feces of patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Indirect evidence could be obtained by epidemiological survey, such as a comparative study of the environmental factors influencing the initial colonization of gut microbiota between patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome and age-matched healthy children. Factors that may disrupt this colonization include a cesarean delivery, formula feeding, excessive use of antibiotics, or the introduction of inappropriate solid foods containing a high amount of saturated fat. Based on this hypothesis, we suggest it would be clinically worthwhile to study whether administration of probiotics composed of commensal bacteria known to efficiently induce regulatory T cells in vitro could control the exacerbation or relapse of INS."

abstract = "It has previously been demonstrated that emissions of the agricultural pollutant, nitrous oxide (N2O), may be a confounder to the relationship between herbicide use and psychiatric impairments, including ADHD. This report attempts to extend this hypothesis by testing whether annual use of anthropogenic nitrogen-based fertilizers in U.S. agriculture (thought to be the most reliable indicator of environmental N2O emissions) is associated with per capita ethanol consumption patterns, a behavior often comorbid with ADHD. State estimates of anthropogenic nitrogen fertilizers from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) were obtained for the years between 1987 and 2006. Our dependent variable was annual per capita ethanol consumption. Ethanol consumption was categorized as beer, wine, spirits, and all alcoholic beverages. Least squares dummy variable method using two-ways fixed effects was utilized. Among states above the 50th percentile in farm use of anthropogenic nitrogen for all years (i.e., agricultural states), a one log-unit increase in farm use of anthropogenic nitrogen fertilizers is associated with a 0.13 gallon increase in total per capita ethanol consumption (p<0.0125). No statistically significant association between farm use of anthropogenic nitrogen and per capita ethanol consumption was found in states below the 50th percentile in farm use of anthropogenic nitrogen. The new findings are in agreement with both behavioral human studies demonstrating a link between N2O preference and alcohol and drug use history as well as molecular studies elucidating shared mechanisms between trace N2O antinociception and alcohol-seeking related behaviors."

abstract = "This work makes proposals on the relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and hydrocephalus that changes over time with the evolution of the disease. This includes the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filling mechanism that leads to an increase in mode pressure if excess fluid volume exacerbates the obstructive process. Elevation in mode occurs because pressure in the central nervous system (CNS) represents a state of reduced flow, rather than an abnormality of volume. Diseases that cause elevated mode pressure by means of a primary edema can lead to hydrocephalus if there is sufficient time and obstruction to flow for the filling mechanism to act. Hydrocephalus is driven primarily by labile pressure due to restricted compliance, it can expand skeletal compartments and deplete parenchyma volume as it advances. This hypothesis applies existing principles of water balance. It is part of a series of works that propose a spectrum of hydrocephalic disorders including developmental forms such as achondroplasia with other conditions such as functional trapped fourth ventricle, arachnoid cyst, syringomyelia and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Links between the conditions can be made by understanding the continuously variable pressure profile local to the cavity that is subject to filling. Fluid lesions of the brain or spine that arise from developmental malformations of the skull have a physiological component. Changes form part of the mechanisms that may compensate the disease process."

abstract = "Preeclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy characterized by the development of vasospasm, hypertension and often associated with proteinuria after the 20th week of gestation. Because termination of pregnancy results in the most efficacious resolution of preeclampsia, it is a leading cause of premature delivery worldwide. In pregnancy, 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) have been shown to facilitate uterine blood flow during preeclampsia, in which the classic vasodilator agents such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin are reduced. EETs are converted to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) by the activity of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). We tested the hypothesis that sEH activity is increased in preeclampsia by measuring urinary 14,15-DHET in healthy and preeclamptic pregnant women. Urine samples were collected and incubated with or without β-glucuronidase to enable the measurement of both the glucuronidated and free forms of 14,15-DHET, which were quantified using a 14,15-DHET ELISA. Levels of total (free+glucuronidated) 14,15-DHET, which is a measurement of EET-dependent sEH activity, were higher in urine samples obtained from preeclamptic women compared to healthy pregnant women. Considering the fact that free+glucuronidated 14,15-DHET levels are increased in urine of preeclamptic women, we hypothesize that sEH expression or activity is augmented in these patients, reducing EET and increasing blood pressure. Moreover we suggest that novel anti-hypertensive agents that target sEH might be developed as therapeutics to control high blood pressure in women with preeclampsia."

Autonomic modulation and/or alterations in cardiac electrophysiology are commonly cited as potential mechanisms responsible for these effects. This article reviews existing evidence for each and explores a separate mechanism which has not received much attention but has scientific merit. Based on presented evidence, it is proposed that n-3 LCPUFAs affect HR and HRV directly by autonomic modulation and indirectly by altering circulating factors, both dependently and independently of the autonomic nervous system.

Misophonia is not listed in any of the contemporary psychiatric classification systems. Some investigators have argued that misophonia should be regarded as a new mental disorder, falling within the spectrum of obsessive-compulsive related disorders. Other researchers have disputed this claim. The purpose of this article is to critically examine the proposition that misophonia should be classified as a new mental disorder. The clinical and research literature on misophonia was examined and considered in the context of the broader literature on what constitutes a mental disorder. There have been growing concerns that diagnostic systems such as DSM-5 tend to over-pathologize ordinary quirks and eccentricities. Accordingly, solid evidence is required for proposing a new psychiatric disorder. The available evidence suggests that (a) misophonia meets many of the general criteria for a mental disorder and has some evidence of clinical utility as a diagnostic construct, but (b) the nature and boundaries of the syndrome are unclear; for example, in some cases misophonia might be simply one feature of a broader pattern of sensory intolerance, and (c) considerably more research is required, particularly work concerning diagnostic validity, before misophonia, defined as either as a disorder or as a key feature of some broader syndrome of sensory intolerance, should be considered as a diagnostic construct in the psychiatric nomenclature. A research roadmap is proposed for the systematic evaluation as to whether misophonia should be considered for future editions of DSM or ICD."

Non-adherence to pharmacologic treatments is associated with worsening conditions including hospitalization and death. This is a significant burden to healthcare systems on a global scale with non-adherence rates being as high (or higher) as 50% in the first treatment year. The most common causes for non-adherence are forgetfulness, busy lifestyle or complexity and changes in therapeutic schedules. In conditions like atrial fibrillation (AFib) this leads to a drastic increase in event rates, e.g. strokes. Patients diagnosed with AFib are strongly recommended to receive anticoagulant treatments for stroke prevention. Treatments with Vitamin K antagonists or novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) can dramatically lower the risk of ischemic strokes in the presence of AFib. Non-adherence can expose the patients to an increased stroke risk. This is especially true for NOACs, due to their short half-life. Patients have to take these medications once or twice daily for adequate stroke prevention, i.e., single non-use of the medication can already diminish or reset the anticoagulative effect. Adherence devices could help improve patient’s compliance by reminder or feedback function. They have shown to be successful in a number of clinical trails. Especially, newer devices that make use of digital technologies show promising results but are not used broadly in clinical practice. Here we provide evidence for our hypothesis that newly available adherence devices might increase adherence rates and thereby reduce the number of strokes in patients with AFib."

The dentate gyrus/CA3 region is increasingly implicated in hippocampal atrophy, its putative role in spatial pattern separation appears to be impaired in mental health disorders, and performance on a task indicative of pattern separation correlates with dentate gyrus/CA3 volume. Spatial pattern separation is thought to utilize the heightened neural plasticity of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus to distinguish highly similar aspects of scene so that these remain distinct in memory rather than lost. The level of such activity associates with BDNF secretion, which may affect neuroplasticity and therefore hippocampal volume. Distinguishing fine-grained aspects of surroundings was likely of great importance during hunting and gathering for survival in nature. However the need to make subtle environmental discriminations is much reduced in modern survival activity. Ancestrally, exploration and utilization of the spatial pattern separation process may have resulted in detection of potential food items, an activity that was likely followed by intensive effort-based reward (EBR) activity to obtain the food. EBR activity and restorative walking in nature demonstrate positive mental health benefits, while their lack indicates negative effects on mental health. Data support the hypothesis that spatial pattern separation activity and neural circuitry are separate from, and may precede, those of EBR as well as restorative walking in nature. Spatial pattern separation therefore represents an additional nature-related neural process whose modern decrease in use may negatively affect mental health. Interventions that increase spatial pattern separation experiences may enhance BDNF secretion, neuroplasticity, hippocampal volume and mental health."

abstract = "The definition of dystonia has been renewed repeatedly but always within the context of overactive muscle contractions. In dystonia the muscles unnecessary for a motion fail to be adequately suppressed because of the loss of central motor control, resulting in inappropriate movements or abnormal postures (“overflow phenomenon”). This represents, however, only one side of the disrupted motor control. Some patients complain of the inability to activate muscles necessary for the intended task despite the lack of motor paresis, as best exemplified by the apraxia of eyelid opening. The author has ever coined the term “negative dystonia” for this phenomenon, which occurs hypothetically as a result of failed central motor flow and is often co-existent with overflow. Negative dystonia has a fixed pattern and sensory trick may be effective to ameliorate the symptom just as in the case of conventional dystonia. Hence we can speculate that the overflow and flow failure are the two sides of the same coin, both being caused by the loss of motor control. The current hypothesis is that dystonia is a representation of the patterned motor malflow (malicious flow) due to the loss of motor control."

Bisphosphonates (BPs) are commonly used as therapy for OP as it influences hard and soft tissues calcium metabolism. Mucosal and dermal ulceration with exposure of underlying bone arises from incomplete epithelial recovery due to reduced desmosome formation deriving from lack of available calcium. Pathological situations such as bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw have been described. This hypothesis states other situations which demand intact functional desmosomes such as healing skin over chronic pressure points leading to pressure ulcers (as well-known as bedsores, pressure sores, pressure injuries, decubitus ulcers), and hemidesmosomes such as epithelial seals in contact with titanium surfaces will have a higher prevalence of breakdown among patients being treated with BPs. This may be proven through the diminished modulation of calcium ions due to BPs, and its effect on the formation of intercellular gap junctions."

Two common statin side effects are muscle pain, referred to as “statin-associated muscle symptoms”, and increased risk for new onset type-2-diabetes mellitus. Up to 25% of statin users report muscle symptoms resulting in many patients being switched to lower dose or lower potency statins, or refusing statins altogether. The most likely signaling mechanisms for statin-associated muscle symptoms overlaps with the proposed mechanism of statin-induced insulin resistance. Metformin has outstanding utility in reducing insulin resistance and preventing type-2-diabetes mellitus, but has not been studied for statin-associated muscle symptom rescue or prevention. The overlapping mechanisms of statin-associated muscle symptoms, statin-induced insulin resistance, and metformin intervention offers the potential to address two common and detrimental side effects of statins. As statins are the single best medication class for preventing cardiovascular events the potential for clinical benefit is large given metabolic syndrome’s growing prevalence in the United States. Herein we hypothesize that metformin will rescue and prevent patients from statin-associated muscle symptoms. This hypothesis can benefit two patient groups: 1) patients at risk for diabetes who are taking a statin and experiencing muscle symptoms; and 2) patients with diabetes taking metformin who are to be started on a statin. Method to test Group 1) Symptom Rescue: randomized control trial of metformin versus placebo in patients with prediabetes who are already taking a statin, and are experiencing mild-to-moderate muscle symptoms. Method to test Group 2) Symptom Prevention: meta-analysis, of statin randomized control trials, with patient level data, comparing patients taking metformin at baseline to patients not taking metformin when a statin is started. An efficient method to simulate both symptom rescue and symptom prevention is a skeletal muscle cell culture model of statin-associated muscle symptom markers. These experiments would identify if metformin reverses (rescues) or prevents markers of statin-associated muscle symptoms. As metformin is recommended by the American Diabetes Association for type-2-diabetes mellitus prevention, yet not frequently used, validating this hypothesis will lead towards research and practice change including: a) decreases in the frequency of statin-associated muscle symptoms; leading to subsequent increases in statin therapy compliance; b) increases in metformin use in prediabetes with subsequent decrease in the incidence of type-2-diabetes mellitus; and c) decreases in complications of both cardiovascular disease and diabetes due to improved statin compliance and type-2-diabetes mellitus prevention."

Despite advances in the understanding of its pathogenesis, especially regarding the participation of T-lymphocytes and the key role of TNF, the triggering factor of the disease at the molecular level remains unknown, as well as the function of other cell populations. By presenting antigens to T-lymphocytes, monocytes assume an important role in both innate and adaptive immune response. In the last two decades, by using flow cytometry with antibodies against CD14 (receptor for lipopolysaccharide) and CD16 (low affinity receptor for IgG), human blood monocytes were classified into three subpopulations: classical (CD14++CD16−), intermediate (CD14++CD16+), and non-classical (CD14+CD16++). Under normal conditions the population of classical monocytes corresponds to about 85%, while intermediate to 5.4%, and nonclassical to 9.2%. However, intermediate and nonclassical subsets are increased in various inflammatory situations, such as moderate to severe asthma, colorectal cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis. Despite psoriasis being considered a disease of inflammatory nature, scarce studies evaluating the frequency of subpopulations of monocytes in psoriatic patients are found on current medical literature, and they are restricted to peripheral blood analysis. This study aims to identify the frequency of monocyte subpopulations in blood levels as well as lesional skin of plaque psoriasis patients, and to evaluate their association to cytokines, and clinical disease severity."

In contrast, CR rates in patients over the age of 60 reaches only 40–60%. While achievement of a CR is an important stepping stone in the treatment of AML, the majority of these patients experience relapse and die of their disease without adequate consolidation chemotherapy. Blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) can improve outcome in a select patient with AML but unfortunately, it is not a valid treatment option for the majority of older patients. Thus, the development of novel chemotherapy regimens that capitalizes on AML biology to eliminate the malignant clone with little to no side effects on the normal haematopoiesis is paramount in the treatment of elderly patients. In the current paper, we propose to take advantage of the dysfunctional DNA repair mechanisms present in AML cells and induce synthetic lethality using a combination of PARP inhibitors with low dose anthracycline and DNMT inhibitors. Such a combination, while effectively eliminating leukaemia should be well tolerated and thus, suitable for the treatment of frail patients."

It is associated with a wide range of sleep disorders that are generally attributed to nasal congestion and presence of inflammatory mediators like cytokines and interleukins. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms behind these sleep disorders remain unclear. On the other hand, the trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR) has recently been linked to various sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea, sleep bruxism and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep apnea. TCR can be incited by stimulation of the trigeminal nerve or the area innervated by its branches including the nasal mucosa. Trigeminal nasal afferents can be activated on exposure to noxious stimuli (mechanical or chemical) like ammonia vapors, carbon-dioxide, nicotine, hypertonic saline, air-puffs and smoke. In rhinitis, there is associated neuronal hyper-responsiveness of sensory nasal afferents due to inflammation (which can be suppressed by steroids). This may further lead to increased occurrence of TCR in rhinitis. Moreover, there is involvement of autonomic nervous system both in rhinitis and TCR. In TCR, parasympathetic over activity and sympathetic inhibition leads to sudden onset bradycardia, hypotension, apnea and gastric motility. Also, the autonomic imbalance reportedly plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of rhinitis. Thus, considering these facts we hypothesize that the TCR could be the link between rhinitis and sleep disorders and we believe that further research in this direction may yield significant development in our understanding of sleep disorders in rhinitis."

Incompatible occlusion with the inherent tendency of maxillo-mandibular relation has a profound effect on either wearing of natural teeth or failures of restorations. With the aid of cephalometrics and analysis of occlusion it is now possible to reduce this fallacy and achieve a harmony by re-designing the occlusion. According to our treated worn dentition cases, the restoring treatment guided by the tendency of maxillo-mandibular relation showed very promising results."

In contrast, recent and rapidly accruing contemporary studies provide preliminary evidence that challenge the view that PFC associated impairments are completely ‘hidden’. Studies that examine the various functions of the PFC and differentiate these to provide preliminary evidence to indicate earlier EF development than that which develops upon reaching adolescence, are reviewed here, together with research that identifies early predictors of later EF impairments.

Although there seems to be an increasing tendency to use grafts in pelvic floor reconstructive procedures due to lower risks of erosion than synthetic meshes, there are inconclusive data to support the routine use of biological grafts in pelvic organ prolapse treatment. In light of these observations new strategies are needed for the treatment of prolapse. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is extremely rich in growth factors and cytokines, which regulate tissue reconstruction and has been previously used in orthopaedics and plastic surgery. To date, however, it has never been used in urogynaecology and there is no evidence to support or oppose its use in women who suffer from POP, due to uterine ligament defects. PRP is a relatively inexpensive biological material and easily produced directly from patients’ blood and is, thus, superior to synthetic materials in terms of potential adverse effects such as foreign body reaction. In the present article we summarize the existing evidence, which supports the conduct of animal experimental and clinical studies to elucidate the potential role of PRP in treating POP by restoring the anatomy and function of ligament support."

abstract = "The iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) include a variety of disturbances such as decreased fertility, increased perinatal and infant mortality, impaired physical and intellectual development, mental retardation, cretinism, hypothyroidism, and endemic goiter (EG). The occurrence of the latter is determined by interplay between genetic and environmental factors. The major environmental factor is iodine status that is required for normal thyroid hormone synthesis. However, other factors like intake of micronutrients and goiterogens also have a significant impact. Essential and toxic trace elements both play a significant role in thyroid physiology. We hypothesize that in terms of overexposure boron may serve as a potential goiterogen. In particular, it is proposed that boron overload may impair thyroid physiology ultimately leading to goiter formation. Certain studies provide evidential support of the hypothesis. In particular, it has been demonstrated that serum and urinary B levels are characterized by a negative association with thyroid hormone levels in exposed subjects. Single indications on the potential efficiency of B in hypothyroidism also exist. Moreover, the levels of B were found to be interrelated with thyroid volume in children environmentally exposed to boron. Experimental studies also demonstrated a significant impact of boron on thyroid structure and hormone levels. Finally, the high rate of B cumulation in thyroid may also indicate that thyroid is the target for B activity. Chemical properties of iodine and boron also provide a background for certain competition. However, it is questionable whether these interactions may occur in the biological systems. Further clinical and experimental studies are required to support the hypothesis of the involvement of boron overexposure in goiter formation. If such association will be confirmed and the potential mechanisms elucidated, it will help to regulate the incidence of hypothyroidism and goiter in endemic regions with high boron levels in soil and water."

This paradigm has been generalized by the neurotrophic theory emphasizing the role of hyponeurotrophinemia of key factor. Both type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome are characterized by insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell damage. Cyclic keeping the fast enhances plasma neurotrophin levels. Fasting induces prenatal-development gene expression in adult pancreas and promotes neurogenin (Ngn)-3 gene expression to generate insulin producing β-cells. Probably, the increased plasma and tissue levels of the nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor after fasting reprogramme Ngn-3 gene expression as this genotrophic action enhances Ngn-3 protein synthesis. This results in regeneration of damaged pancreatic β-cells and restores insulin secretion in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus."

abstract = "Short stem uncemented femoral implants were developed with the aim of preserving proximal bone stock for future revisions, improving biomechanical reconstruction, aiding insertion through smaller incisions and potentially decreasing or limiting the incidence of thigh pain. Despite all the advantages of short stem designs, it remains unclear whether they are able to limit post-surgical thigh pain. In patients with short stem hip arthroplasty and persistent thigh pain, it is of the utmost importance to understand the potential etiologies of this chronic pain for selecting the appropriate treatment strategy. Therefore, this manuscript explores the hypothetical etiologies of persistent thigh pain in short stem total hip arthroplasty, including both peripheral factors (structural or biomechanical causes) and central factors (involvement of the central nervous system). First, intrinsic causes (e.g. aseptic femoral loosening and prosthetic joint infection) and extrinsic sources (e.g. muscle pathology or spinal pathology) of persistent thigh pain related to hip arthroplasty are explained. In addition, other specific peripheral causes for thigh pain related to the short stem prosthetic reconstruction (e.g. stem malalignment and micro-motion) are unraveled. Second, the etiology of persistent thigh pain after short stem hip arthroplasty is interpreted in a broader concept than the biomechanical approach where peripheral structural injury is believed to be the sole driver of persistent thigh pain. Over the past decades evidence has emerged of the involvement of sensitization of central nervous system nociceptive pathways (i.e. central sensitization) in several chronic pain disorders. In this manuscript it is explained that there might be a relevant role for altered central nociceptive processing in patients with persistent pain after joint arthroplasty or revision surgery. Recognition of a potential role for centrally-mediated changes in pain processing in total hip replacement surgery has important implications for treatment. Comprehensive treatment addressing peripheral factors as well as neurophysiological changes occurring in the nervous system may help to improve outcomes in patients with short stem hip arthroplasty and chronic thigh pain. Working within a biopsychosocial approach in orthopaedic surgery, specifically in relation to total hip arthroplasty, could be very important and may lead to more satisfaction. Further research is warranted."

In the United States, the Collaborative Care Model (CCM) addresses the shortfall of psychiatrists by providing indirect consultation in primary care. A Cochrane meta-analysis affirms the efficacy this model for depression and anxiety. However, our experience with the CCM suggests that most patients referred for consultation have problems far more complex than simple depression and anxiety. Based on preliminary data, we offer five linked hypotheses: (1) in an efficient collaborative care process, the majority of mental illnesses can be handled by providers who are less expensive and more plentiful than psychiatrists. (2) A majority of the remaining cases will be bipolar disorder variations. Differentiating these from PTSD, the most common alternative or comorbid diagnosis, is challenging and often requires a psychiatrist’s input. (3) Psychiatric consultants can teach their primary care colleagues that bipolar diagnoses are estimations based on rigorously assessed probabilities, and that cases fall on a spectrum from unipolar to bipolar. (4) All providers must recognize that when bipolarity is missed, antidepressant prescription often follows. Antidepressants can induce bipolar mixed states, with extreme anxiety and potentially dangerous impulsivity and suicidality. (5) Psychiatrists can help develop clinical approaches in primary care that identify bipolarity and differentiate it from (or establish comorbidity with) PTSD; and psychiatrists can facilitate appropriate treatment, including bipolar-specific psychotherapies as well as use of mood stabilizers."

However, insulin has also been found to increase the growth of certain bacteria which form the non-butyrate producing part of the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome is recently in focus for its strong association with many chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Metformin, a widely popular anti-diabetic medication has been shown to prevent weight gain in many trials. There are many studies postulating the mechanisms of the anti-obesity effect of metformin including improvement in insulin sensitivity (and consequently a reduction in insulin levels). Recently, however, it is becoming evident that metformin’s action is likely to be primarily mediated by the gut. Further, metformin has also shown to affect the growth characteristics of certain bacteria which form the part of the human gut microbiome. With this frame of reference in mind, we hypothesize that metformin is likely to exert its anti-obesity effect by altering the composition of the gut microbiome. If proved, this has the potential to contribute to the management of obesity and pave the way for the development of novel anti-obesity drugs."

The hypothesis is that the inverse association found sometimes between fish intake and cognitive decline is partially due to exposure of the oral cavity to active peroxidases from HRR served in conjunction with fish. This hypothesis can be tested by specifically looking at whether HRR is consumed with fish and whether such HRR is prepared in a way that preserves activity of HRR peroxidases. It is possible that by putting active HRR peroxidases in their mouths, elderly people supplement their age-diminished salivary antioxidant capacity and break down additional hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the oral cavity before it can migrate into the brain, thus decreasing the incidence of brain cell death induction by chronically-elevated H2O2. Intentional exposure of the oral cavity to active HRR peroxidases could be a prophylactic for delaying dementia. Because vegetable peroxidases are inactivated by gastric juices, it will be difficult to obtain benefit from HRR peroxidases’ antioxidant effect via ingestion in encapsulated dietary supplements."

However, CABG surgery can lead to ischemia/reperfusion injury, which is characterized by a strong inflammatory response. Interleukin (IL)-18, is a strong inflammatory mediator, that is released from cardiomyocytes and can be found in the systemic circulation of patients during and immediately after CABG surgery. The existing damage of endothelial glycocalyx in patients with ischemic heart disease is further impaired concurrently during the surgery due to the anaesthesia-surgical technique used and intravascular fluid loading. This results in the increased incidence of adverse events, including myocardial infarction. IL-18 leads to the activation of lymphocyte cytotoxicity via cytotoxic mediators (Fas ligand, Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, perforin, and granulysin). We hypothesize that IL-18 is released locally in the heart and the systemic circulation in patients undergoing CABG surgery and may be correlated with the level of activity of circulating lymphocytes. In turn, this may lead to lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity directed toward damaged and activated endothelial cells. Shear stress glycocalyx, as well as damaged and activated endothelial cells then become the main the source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. These attract activated lymphocytes to adhere to the endothelium or enter the subintimal layer, increasing existing or initiating the formation of new plaques, which leads to the development of myocardial infarction during or shortly after surgery. To evaluate our hypothesis, we will measure the local concentration of IL-18 in the sinus coronarius and systemic circulation. These values will then be correlated with immunological and biochemical parameters, predominantly with the concentration of degradation products of glycocalyx and cytotoxic mediators in activated lymphocytes. If our hypothesis is correct, measuring the IL-18 concentration that is responsible for glycocalyx deterioration, may become a useful tool for predicting myocardial infarction occurrence in patients undergoing CABG surgery."

By conducting retrospective chart review, we found neurodegenerative diseases are more prevalent in elderly patients with chronic eczematous dermatitis. The mean time delay between the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and onset of skin lesions is 4.17years. In all 6 patients who received skin biopsy, eosinophils in the upper dermis or at the dermo-epidermal junction were obvious, which are remnant of the pathological finding of bullous pemphigoid. Together with the well-known association between bullous pemphigoid and neurodegenerative diseases, the results suggested that unlocalized eczematous dermatitis in the elderly may be an early manifestation of bullous pemphigoid. Inter-discipline communication among neurology, dermatology and geriatrics/gerontology is required to tailor specific managements for elderly patients with pruritus and neurodegenerative diseases."

The main idea is that there is a common pathway from wellbeing and health to chronic disease (“chronopathy”) and even to death, which comprises following steps: 1) unhealthy diet, sedentary life style and permanent exposition to xenobiotics and all kinds of noxious stimuli;→2) intestinal dysbiosis;→3) alteration of the intestinal mucus layer (especially that of the colon);→4) disruption of the endothelial tight junctions;→5) metabolic endotoxemia+bacterial translocation;→6) inflammation;→7) exacerbation of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and consequent maladaptation and malfunctioning of the colon;→8) epigenetic manifestations;→9) “chronopathy” and premature death. Therefore, in order to maintain a good health or to improve or even reverse chronic diseases in a person, the main outcome to look for is a homeostatic balance of the intestinal microbiota (eubiosis), most of which is located in the colon. Lynn Margulis was one of the main scientists to highlight the importance of the role played by bacteria not only in the origin of all biological species now present on earth, but also on their role in global homeostasis. Bacteria do not rely on other living beings for their existence, while the latter depend completely on the former. Humans are no exemption, and new evidence emerges each day about the pivotal role of intestinal microbiota in human health, disease and, in general, in its wellbeing. The following facts about intestinal microbiota are nowadays generally accepted: there are about 10 times more bacteria in the gut than human cells in every human being; the microbioma is about 100–150 times bigger that the human genome, and there is a clear link between intestinal microbiota and many of the most common chronic diseases, from obesity and diabetes to depression and Parkinson disease and different kinds of cancer. The main implication of this theory is that we should become a sort of microbiota farmers, that is, we ought to be more conscious of our intestinal microbiota, take care of it and monitor it permanently. Thus, as part of our good life habits (healthy eating, physical exercise), we should probably undergo periodic seasons of fasting and colon cleansing, as it was common in older times."

Tumor cell invasion and metastasis which closely related to the dynamic changes of the cytoskeleton is an important factor influencing the survival of patients. Therefore, inhibition of tumor cell invasion and metastasis is a key strategy for the treatment of cancer. MACF1 is a microtubule microfilament cross-linking factor that plays an important role in cell polarization, cell migration, and maintenance of tissue integrity. A lot of studies have shown that microRNAs play an important role in tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis. Therefore, we propose the following scientific assumptions: MACF1, an important molecule in adjusting the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells, regulates microfilaments, microtubules participating in cytoskeleton dynamics to promote malignant tumor cell migration and invasion; MicroRNA targeting MACF1 can decrease the expression of MACF1 and thus disrupt the dynamic balance of microtubule or microfilaments as an effective way to inhibit the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. So we can use it as a new target for clinical early diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumor invasion and metastasis."

This hypothesis involves microbes (archaea and bacteria) that exist in human body biofilms in syntrophic associations, where bacteria ferment nutrients to produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are used by methanogenic archaeons to produce methane. Overgrowth of archaea on human tissues (e.g., in association with intestines, teeth or lungs) results in excessive removal of SCFAs from the biofilms and this triggers bacteria in the free-living biofilm state to convert to the endoparasitic state and become intracellular in host cells where they incite inflammation and disease. The proposed model provides the mechanism to explain dysbiosis etiology of several human diseases, including gingivitis, leaky gut syndrome, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, among others."

In 1988, Brenner hypothesized that there was an inverse relationship between nephron number and hypertension. Over the course of one’s lifetime it is predicted that even healthy individuals will lose a significant percentage of nephrons as part of normal aging. Thus, a low nephron endowment at birth or in combination with age- or disease-related nephron loss could pre-dispose individuals to the development of hypertension. Currently, it is not clear what minimal number (ie, threshold) of nephrons is associated with susceptibility to glomeruli injury or hypertension, due in part to the lack of relevant animal models. The BPH2 mouse is a unique genetic model of hypertension that has a normotensive line (BPN3 mice) as well as a hypotensive line (BPL1 mice) derived from the original breeding of eight common inbred strains of mice. Thus, we hypothesize that the differences in blood pressure observed in BPH2, BPN3, and BPL1 mice will correlate inversely with nephron number as predicted by the Brenner hypothesis. If our hypothesis is true, then the BPH2 mouse model will provide a unique experimental model to study the impact of nephron endowment and nephron number on susceptibility to renal injury and hypertension."

In particular, accumulating evidence suggests that InsR and compensatory hyperinsulinemia play a pivotal pathogenic role in the hyperandrogenism of many PCOS phenotypes, which in turn have a clear detrimental effect on chronic anovulation. Different forms of fasting, such as intermittent fasting (IF, including alternate day fasting, or twice weekly fasting, for example) and periodic fasting (PF, lasting several days or longer every 2 or more weeks) are currently being tested in several in vitro and in vivo studies. Changes in the circulating levels of Insulin Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1), Insulin-like Growth Factor-Binding Protein 1 (IGFBP1), glucose and insulin are typical effects of fasting which may play a key role on aging and metabolic homeostasis. Considering the paramount importance of InsR and compensatory hyperinsulinemia, different fasting regimens can reduce IGF-1, IGFBP1, glucose and insulin levels and consequently have beneficial effects on ovarian function, androgen excess and infertility in PCOS women."

It is hypothesized that the neural networks built over time to encode the sexual fantasies that motivate serial killers to act should display a unique, detectable activation pattern. The pathological neural watermark hypothesis posits that such networks comprise activation of brain sites that reflect four cognitive components: autobiographical memory, sexual arousal, aggression, and control over aggression. The neural sites performing these cognitive functions have been successfully identified by previous research. The key findings are reviewed to hypothesise the typical pattern of activity that serial killers should display. Through the integration of biological findings into one framework, the neural approach proposed in this paper is in stark contrast with the many theories accounting for serial killers that offer non-medical taxonomies. The pathological neural watermark hypothesis offers a new framework to understand and detect deviant individuals. The technical and legal issues are briefly discussed."

However, there is still some debate as to whether the cancers originate from a secretory or ciliate cell lineage. One well established method for determining the origin of a cell line is to document the expression of genes and proteins that are cell type specific. Lineage or tissue specific patterns of gene expression are evidence of direct decent from a given cell type within a tissue. It has recently been established that the Tumor Protein TAp73 gene (TP73) is expressed in basal epithelial cells that develop into multiciliate cells. TP73 expression is therefore a marker for basal stem cells that are predestined to differentiate into cells with motile cilia and its expression is maintained in fully differentiated multiciliate cells. Interestingly TP73 expression has also been observed in a high percentage of epithelial ovarian cancers. With this in mind, it is hypothesized that a high percentage of epithelial ovarian cancers which express TP73 originate from a ciliate cell lineage."

Typically, platelet transfusion efficacy is demonstrated by the increase in platelet count after transfusion. However this approach is complicated by the fact that activated platelets tend to produce lower post-transfusion platelet counts, but may be more efficacious in a bleeding patient. Intraoral blood levels, measured by salivary transferrin, urine dipstick hemoglobin or another method, could be used as an in vivo assay to monitor a patient’s response to platelet transfusion and compare different types of platelet products."

Thus, the possible usefulness of HAM to restore joint functions in severely damaged TMJs could be hypothesized. Based on these premises, the clinical research question “Is human amniotic membrane positioning effective to reduce symptoms and restore jaw function in patients with severe inflammatory-degenerative disorders of the temporomandibular joint?” has been addressed by performing a systematic review of the literature. Out of potential 11988 and 8883 citations in the PubMed and Scopus databases, respectively, only five were of possible interest for inclusion in the review, but none of them addressed specifically the clinical research question. Thus, the hypothetical background for usefulness was discussed. The benefits of HAM positioning in TMJs with severe inflammatory-degenerative disorders could be related with its anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial and analgesic properties as well as its low immunogenicity. Studies in which HAM is positioned within the joint space of patients with severe TMJ degeneration, either as a disc-replacing film during major surgeries for discectomy and arthroplasty or as an injectable solution that can be needle-inserted after an arthrocentesis procedure, should be designed to test the hypothesis."

Updated research and the epidemiology of PD suggest that the disease might be induced by environmental factor(s), possibly with genetic susceptibility, and that α-synuclein probably should be regarded as part of the body’s own defense mechanism. To explain the dual-hit theory with stage 1 involvement of the olfactory structures and the ‘gut-brain’-axis, the environmental factor is probably airborne and quite ‘robust’ entering the body via the nose/mouth, then to be swallowed reaching the enteric nervous system with retained pathogenicity. Similar to the essence of smoking food, which is to eradicate microorganisms, a viable agent may be defused by tobacco smoke. Hence, the agent is likely to be a ‘living’ and not an inert agent. Furthermore, and accordant with the age-dependent incidence of LPD, this implies that a dormant viable agent have been escorted by α-synuclein via retrograde axonal transport from the nose and/or GI tract to hibernate in the associated cerebral nuclei. In the brain, PD spreads like a low-grade infection, and that patients develop symptoms in later life, indicate a relatively long incubation time. Importantly, Actinomyces species may form endospores, the hardiest known form of life on Earth. The authors hypothesize that certain spores may not be subject to degradation by macroautophagy, and that these spores become reactivated due to the age-dependent or genetic reduced macroautophagic function. Hence, the hibernating spore hypothesis explains both early-onset and late-onset PD. Evaluation of updated available information are all consistent with the hypothesis that PD may be induced by spores from fungi or Actinobacteria and thus supports Broxmeyer’s hypothesis put forward 15years ago."

These patients were provided with specified coloured glasses which were required to be used during day time. Results indicated that specified coloured glasses significantly improved attention performance. Furthermore electrophysiological parameters revealed a significant change in the late event related potential distribution pattern (latency, amplitudes). This reflects a synchronization of together firing wired neural assemblies responsible for visual processing, suggesting an accelerated neuromaturation process when using coloured glasses. Our results suggest that the visual event related potentials measures are sensitive to changes in clinical development of patients with deficits of visual processing wearing appropriate coloured glasses. It will be discussed whether such a device might be useful for a clinical improvement of distraction symptoms caused by visual processing deficits. A model is presented explaining these effects by inducing the respiratory chain of the mitochondria such increasing the low energy levels of ATP of our patients."

Graham has however argued that juvenile cancer, which precedes reproduction, could during evolution have implemented a “cancer selection” that resulted in novel traits that suppress this juvenile cancer; an example is protection against UV sunlight-induced cancer, required for the emergence of terrestrial animals from the sea. We modify the cancer selection mechanism to the posited “cancer adaptation” mechanism, in which juvenile mortality is enhanced through the diminished care received by juveniles from their (grand) parents when these suffer from cancer in old age. Moreover, it is posited that the cancer adaptation selects against germline “dissipative genes”, genes that result in enhanced free energy dissipation. Cancer’s progression is interpreted as a cascade at increasing scale of repeated amplification of energy dissipation, a cascade involving heat shock, the Warburg effect, the cytokine IL-6, tumours, and hypermetabolism. Disturbance of any physiological process must enhance energy dissipation if the animal remains functioning normally, what explains multicausality, why “everything gives you cancer”. The hypothesis thus comprises two newly invoked partial processes—diminished (grand) parental care and dissipation amplification—and results in a “selection against enhanced energy dissipation” which gives during evolution the benefit of energy conservation. Due to this benefit, cancer would essentially be an adaptation, and not a genetic disease, as assumed in the “somatic mutation theory”. Cancer by somatic mutations is only a side process. The cancer adaptation hypothesis is substantiated by (1) cancer’s extancy, (2) the failure of the somatic mutation theory, (3) cancer’s initiation by a high temperature, (4) the interpretation of cancer’s progression as a thermal process, and (5) the interpretation of tumours as organs that implement thermogenesis. The hypothesis could in principle be verified by monitoring in a population over several generations (1) the presence of dissipative genes, (2) the incidence of cancer, and (3) the beneficial effect of dissipative gene removal by cancer on starvation/famine survival."

In addition to taking part in many biological processes such as development, reproduction and repair, midkine (MK) also plays important roles in the pathogenesis of malignant diseases as well as in the regulation of MDR. Although, the mechanisms of action of P-gp and MK are different, overexpression of both proteins prevents the accumulation of many chemotherapeutics in tumor cells, leading to decreased therapeutic effects of anticancer drugs. Therefore, identification of the result of dual inhibition of P-gp and MK in overcoming chemoresistance may enhance the likelihood for a more efficient chemotherapy."

abstract = "Although promising treatments are currently in development to slow disease progression and increase patient survival, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States. Cancer treatment modalities commonly include chemoradiation and therapies that target components of aberrantly activated signaling pathways. However, treatment resistance is a common occurrence and recent evidence indicates that the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) may underlie the limited efficacy and inability of current treatments to effectuate a cure. CSCs, which are largely resistant to chemoradiation therapy, are a subpopulation of cancer cells that exhibit characteristics similar to embryonic stem cells (ESCs), including self-renewal, multi-lineage differentiation, and the ability to initiate tumorigenesis. Interestingly, intracellular mechanisms that sustain quiescence and promote self-renewal in adult stem cells (ASCs) and CSCs likely also function to maintain latency of HIV-1 in CD4+ memory T cells. Although antiretroviral therapy is highly effective in controlling HIV-1 replication, the persistence of latent but replication-competent proviruses necessitates the development of compounds that are capable of selectively reactivating the latent virus, a method known as the “shock and kill” approach. Homeostatic proliferation in central CD4+ memory T (TCM) cells, a memory T cell subset that exhibits limited self-renewal and differentiation and is a primary reservoir for latent HIV-1, has been shown to reinforce and stabilize the latent reservoir in the absence of T cell activation and differentiation. HIV-1 has also been found to establish durable and long-lasting latency in a recently discovered subset of CD4+ T cells known as T memory stem (TSCM) cells. TSCM cells, compared to TCM cells, exhibit stem cell properties that more closely match those of ESCs and ASCs, including self-renewal and differentiation into all memory T cell subsets. It is our hypothesis that activation of AMPK, a master regulator of cellular metabolism that plays a critical role in T cell activation and differentiation of ESCs and ASCs, will lead to both T cell activation-induced latent HIV-1 reactivation, facilitating virus destruction, as well as “activation”, differentiation, and/or apoptosis of CSCs, thus inhibiting tumorigenesis. We also propose the novel observation that compounds that have been shown to both facilitate latent HIV-1 reactivation and promote CSC differentiation/apoptosis (e.g. bryostatin-1, JQ1, metformin, butyrate, etc.) likely do so through a common mechanism of AMPK activation."

And I suggest that children with undetectable anti-HBs titers after recommended immunization schedule as well as the additional booster doses should be followed up over time because they may be at risk of developing a number of autoimmune disorders. In this light, the non-responsiveness to HBV vaccine might be a predictor of latent autoimmunity. For that reason, research studies are needed in order to verify the existence of potential IL-18 and IFN-γ gene polymorphisms to utilize as biomarkers of latent autoimmunity. As a final point, administration of neutralizing antibodies against IFN-γ and/or IL-18 might represent a future target for immune-modulatory therapeutic approach to halt or even reverse autoimmune phenomena."

Accumulated data support the involvement of cell-mediated immune dysfunction in the development of OLP. However, the connection between neuroendocrine system and oral immune response in OLP patients has never been clarified. Melatonin is considered as a major chronobiotic hormone produced mainly by the pineal gland. This gland is recognized as a regulator of circadian rhythm and a sensor in the immune response through the NF-kB transduction pathway. It was suggested that pineal-derived melatonin and extra-pineal melatonin synthesized at the site of inflamed lesion might play a role in inflammatory response. According to our immunohistochemical study, expression of melatonin could be detected in human oral mucosa. In addition, increased levels of melatonin were observed in inflamed oral mucosa of OLP patients. We hypothesize that chronic inflammation possibly induces the local biosynthesis of melatonin in inflamed oral mucosa. We also speculate that melatonin in oral mucosa may play a cytoprotective role through its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, melatonin may play an immunomodulatory role in relation to pathogenesis of OLP. Our hypothesis provides a new implication for upcoming research on the connection between circadian neuroendocrine network and immune response in oral mucosal compartments."

Presence of immune cell aggregates in solid tumors has been associated with clinical outcomes, but little is known about the immune microenvironment in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which has high morbidity and mortality. Based on our preliminary observation, we hypothesize that there is the presence of tumor-associated immune aggregates (TaIAs) during oral cancer development. Adapting to the dynamic change of the composition of cellular membership and co-evolving with the tumor at invasion fronts, these TaIAs, either pro-inflammatory or immune suppressive, are associated with clinical consequences. With the unique access to a set of prospectively collected, highly annotated OSCC surgical samples and the use of multi-color immunostaining of key immune cells, the confirmation of our hypothesis may shed light of the underlying biology related to OSCC and the knowledge learned can potentially be used to identify prognostic markers, response predictive markers for immunotherapies, as well as novel therapeutic targets."

It is considered that disease arises from the influence of environmental factors on genetically susceptible individuals. Recent researches, using magnetic resonance imaging, connected iron deposits in different brain regions with demyelinating process in multiple sclerosis patients. Although iron is an essential trace element important for many biological functions it could be harmful because iron excess can induce the production of reactive oxygen species, development of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation which leads to demyelination. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, the most common experimental animal model for multiple sclerosis, we recently found that chronic iron overload influences the clinical course of disease in Dark Agouti rats. In female rats iron overload accelerated the onset of disease, while in male rats it accelerated the progression of disease and increased mortality rate. We hypothesize that those differences arise on molecular level in different expression of stress response proteins hepcidin and metallothioneins in male and female iron overloaded rats. They are both upregulated by metal ions in both sexes. Hepcidin is additionally upregulated by estrogen in female rats and therefore causes higher degradation of iron exporter ferroportin and sequestration of iron in the cells, lowering the possibility for the development of oxidative stress. Antioxidative effect of metallothioneins could be increased in female rats because of their ability to reversibly exchange metal ions with the estrogen receptor. In case of iron excess metallothioneins release zinc, which is normally bound to them. Zinc binds to estrogen receptor and leaves metallothioneins binding domains free for iron, causing at least provisional cytoprotective effect. To test this hypothesis, we propose to determine and compare serum levels of hepcidin and estrogen using ELISA essay as well as expression and distribution of acute stress response proteins hepcidin and metallothioneins, iron and estrogen receptor in the brain and spinal cord tissue using immunohistochemistry in control and chronic iron overloaded male and female rats in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. It would be also possible to perform the same immunohistochemistry in the brain tissue of multiple sclerosis patients post mortem. The results of experiments could contribute to better understanding of cytoprotective mechanisms in chronic iron overload that could have possible therapeutic applications in iron disturbances. In order to elucidate whether common measure of systemic iron status, like ferritin, haemoglobin concentration and transferrin saturation levels, may be used to distinguish physiologic from potentially harmful iron levels in local disease, for example multiple sclerosis and Still’s disease, well-designed clinical trials would be of great interest."

The cardinal symptoms of each – fatigue and headache – are common in the other and their multiple other symptoms are frequently seen in both. The single discriminating factor is raised intracranial pressure, evidenced in IIH usually by the sign of papilloedema, regarded as responsible for the visual symptoms which can lead to blindness. Some patients with IIH, however, do not have papilloedema and these patients may be clinically indistinguishable from patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. Yet IIH is rare, IIH without papilloedema (IIHWOP) seems rarer still, while chronic fatigue syndrome is common. So are the clinical parallels spurious or is there a way to reconcile these conflicting observations? We suggest that it is a quirk of clinical measurement that has created this discrepancy. Specifically, that the criteria put in place to define IIH have led to a failure to appreciate the existence, clinical significance or numerical importance of patients with lower level disturbances of intracranial pressure. We argue that this has led to a grossly implausible distortion of the epidemiology of IIH such that the milder form of the illness (IIHWOP) is seen as less common than the more severe and that this would be resolved by recognising a connection with chronic fatigue syndrome. We hypothesise, therefore, that IIH, IIHWOP, lesser forms of IIH and an undetermined proportion of chronic fatigue cases are all manifestations of the same disorder of intracranial pressure across a spectrum of disease severity, in which this subset of chronic fatigue syndrome would represent the most common and least severe and IIH the least common and most extreme."

However, weight loss can reduce insulin resistance, which in turn helps to restore hormonal balance and ovulation resulting to improved fertility. Previously, we reported that alkaline reduced water (ARW) could significantly reduce obesity by alleviating adiposity, regulating the levels of adipokines/pro-inflammatory cytokines and by inducing cholesterol homeostasis. Herein, we hypothesize that ARW might ameliorate the pathophysiological (hormonal, metabolic, and immunological) imbalances incurred by PCOS, thereby improving the infertility of PCOS patients."

There are no differences in the prevalence of asymptomatic MD between males and females; however, symptomatic MD has a distinct male predominance with a male-to-female ratio ranging from 2:1 to 5:1 in children. Furthermore, if the ectopic tissue contains gastric mucosa, MD has a greater chance of becoming symptomatic. Studies have shown that acid secretion is more likely to occur in male infants compared to female infants. In adults, men are known to have a higher level of acid production compared to women. Peptic ulcers (PU) are more common in males due to high acid secretion, and gastric tissues are affected by gastrin secretion in both conditions. MD is typically accompanied by ectopic gastric tissue, and could therefore be affected by gastrin and acid secretion in a similar manner to PU. Some of the major complications of MD are diverticulitis, ulcers, and bleeding from adjacent ectopic gastric tissue, and such complications resemble PU. PU also have male to female ratios ranging from 2:1 to 5:1, which is again similar to MD. Since the secretion of both gastrin and acid decrease with age, symptomatic presentation of MD also declines with age. Therefore, we hypothesize that higher gastrin and acid levels in males affect the ectopic gastric mucosa and lead to an increase in MD symptoms, which result an increased incidence of MD in males."

Depending on whether diabetes is type-1 or type-2, it is characterized by deficiencies in insulin secretion, insulin receptor sensitivity, hexokinase activity, and glucose transport. Current drug treatments are able to lower circulating glucose but do not address the problem of glucose utilization in the intracellular milieu, the consequence of which is tissue damage. In the long-term, such changes can produce structural damage in many cortical and subcortical brain areas that are related to cognitive function. Many epidemiological reports consider anxiety and depression as clinical entities that accompany diabetes. However, anxiety and depression in diabetes appear to occur in parallel and do not follow a causal relationship. From a behavioral perspective, anxiety may be considered adaptive, whereas depression can be considered reactive in response to changes in lifestyle and ailments that are caused by the disease. Therefore, the main alteration in diabetes seems to be cognitive function. We hypothesized that in type-2 diabetes, hypoglycemic medications do not restore the function of glucose in the intracellular compartment, which may have deleterious effects on neural tissue with behavioral consequences. In such a case, it is important to develop pharmacological interventions that directly restore plasma insulin levels, insulin receptor function, and hexokinase activity, thereby avoiding damage to neural tissue that is associated with cognitive deficits in diabetic patients, particularly patients with type-2 diabetes. The better management of such alterations in diabetes should be directed toward improving glucose utilization by neural tissue."

abstract = "Delirium and dementia represent an emerging global crisis in healthcare. Attempts have been made to identify the pathognomonic feature that would make delirium stand out from dementia but unfortunately the global neural dysfunction of both disorders has made the establishment of a direct measurement difficult. Modern conceptualisations of delirium have been influenced by the assessment tools used to assess, detect, and analyse its complex and transient nature. Recent publication of the DSM-V criteria for delirium has marginally altered the previous DSM-IV criteria with a focus upon inattention with vague terms such as consciousness downplayed. Such an alteration has been found to be restrictive and thus impact upon delirium case identification. Although these findings are approximating the empirical state of delirium as measured by validated instruments, a more refined neuroscientifically informed phenomenological framework is required in order to enhance the theoretical understanding of delirium assessment and resolve these challenges. One such application is the predictive coding (PC) model, also known as the hierarchical Bayesian inference model, to interpreting delirium pathophysiology. Therefore, the aims of this paper are to 1) propose the hypothesis that delirium pathophysiology can be explained in terms of the PC model, 2) support this hypothesis by applying this model to current methods of assessing delirium phenomenology, particularly attention, and 3) outline a future programme of research to test many of the parameters of this application."

Here we discuss ASDs and cancer linkages across levels ranging from genes to pathways and systems, as well as from the vantage points of mechanism and of clinical and epidemiological studies. Review of existing findings yielded evidence that ASDs and cancer overlap extensively in signal transduction pathways that are involved in metabolic processes. We hypothesize that further studies focusing on illuminating the relationships between ASDs and cancer, specifically with regard to signaling pathways that regulate metabolic activities, could help shed new insight on these conditions and develop treatment strategies that, by targeting underlying mechanisms, may be more efficient and effective for both conditions."

abstract = "In this article is given the new insight about the affection of stress on the increase of level of low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the blood, which is connected with the disturbance of hydrodynamics in the bloodstream, the attention was paid to the cylindrical cholesterol plaque, and it's classification. The disturbance of hydrodynamics of blood under the stress leads to the formation of a cylindrical cholesterol plaque, which repeats the contour of the vessel, and leads to the ischemic disorders of the heart and brain. The cylindrical cholesterol plaque goes through several stages of development: friable, yielding, dense, old. In the case of destruction of friable, fresh cholesterol plaque, releases a big quantity of low-density lipoproteins. This leads to the pathological increase of level of LDL in the blood. In the case of long disturbance of hydrodynamics, occurs the formation of strong links between low-density lipoproteins. Yielding cholesterol plaque is formed. Further maturation of cylindrical cholesterol plaque, leads to it's densifying and damage. We may emphasize, that short periods of strong contraction and expansion of vessels lead to the increase of level of LDL in the blood. Self-dependent restoration of normal level of LDL in blood occurs in the case of restoration of pressure in the limits of numbers, which are specific for particular person, and which don't exceed the physiological standard. Among patients with long duration of stress, the duration of vasospasm increases. LDL, without having a possibility to crumble, begin to stick together and form the yielding cylindrical plaque. It is characterized by having of not so strong connection with the vascular wall, and maintains only at the expanse of iteration of the vascular wall, it has cylindrical shape, is elastic and yellow. The thickness and length of walls depends on the degree of cross-clamping during the time of formation of yielding cylindrical plaque. In the case of stopping of spasm, yielding cylindrical plaque can resolve slowly. Among hypotensive and individuals, which have normal pressure, the increase of level of LDL isn't noted. There aren't such investigations, where such link was noted. The increasing of level of LDL among these people (especially under the stress) can say about cases of short-term increase of pressure, which could be unnoticed. These patients require pressure monitoring and, accordingly, the adjustment of the state of stress and anger."

The default-mode network, salience network, frontoparietal control network and dorsal attention network are brain networks with integral roles in the maintenance and modulation of the aforementioned functions. Multiple lines of evidence point to their dysfunction in delirium. The convergence of neurotransmitter changes, neuroendocrine and inflammatory stressors on brain networks disrupts bottom-up and top-down attentional control. Neuroimaging and neuroanatomy correlates are potentially consistent with this hypothesis. Overall, this model appears to have significant utility in connecting the seemingly disparate precipitants of delirium while accounting for the clinical manifestations of the syndrome."

The results of this study showed that if melasma is due to oligomenorrhea, the use of systemic anti-estrogenic therapies can improve melasma by reducing of Melanogenesis due to decreasing α msh (alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone) in addition to oligomenorrhea improvement. However, because of the extreme attention to the advertising cosmetic creams, attention to systemic therapies has been faded.

The leading cause of CF mortality and morbidity is the progressive destruction of the lungs due to recurrent infections and chronic inflammation. CFTR defect also affects immune cells, including neutrophils, resulting in ineffective, severe and persistent inflammatory response. Since unopposed recruitment of neutrophils significantly contributes to lung tissue damage through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we hypothesize that the administration of iron chelators could serve as a novel treatment to attenuate chronic inflammation in CF lungs since iron is significantly involved in ROS production by neutrophils. Ideally, the iron chelator should sequester host iron effectively, prevent bacterial access to chelator-bound iron and penetrates lung tissues efficiently, e.g. by inhalational route of administration."

This article proposes that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the main factor contributing to improved cognition following exercise. Additionally, it argues that cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxidative stress explain the release of BDNF from cerebral endothelial cells. One way to test these hypotheses is to block endothelial function and measure the effect on BDNF levels and cognitive performance. The CBF and oxidative stress can also be examined in relationship to BDNF using a multiple linear regression. If these hypotheses are true, there would be a linear relationship between CBF+oxidative stress and BDNF levels as well as between BDNF levels and cognitive performance. The novelty of these hypotheses comes from the emphasis on the cerebral endothelium and the interplay between BDNF, CBF, and oxidative stress. If found to be valid, these hypotheses would draw attention to the cerebral endothelium and provide direction for future research regarding methods to optimize BDNF release and enhance cognition. Elucidating these mechanisms would provide direction for expediting recovery in clinical populations, such as stroke, and maintaining quality of life in the elderly."

abstract = "Among various infections, chronic osteomyelitis is one of the most challenging in terms of treatment. This infection is more common among patients with open fractures and those who have undergone elective orthopedic procedures. The treatment of osteomyelitis requires high antibiotic doses and an aggressive and multifaceted surgical approach. The use of parenteral antibiotics alone, without debridement, is not sufficiently effective, due to the formation of sequestra and the low vascularity of the affected area. The surgical options available for patients with chronic osteomyelitis include sequestrectomy, curettage, and intramedullary reaming, although these procedures usually result in bone defects that require further surgical intervention. Polymethyl methacrylate or calcium phosphate beads, impregnated with antibiotics, are commonly placed in such cases; however, this option has several disadvantages, including the need for future removal of cement, uncontrollable local release of antibiotics, and the need for broad-spectrum agents. The resulting bone defects also require additional treatments involving vascularized fibula grafting, intramedullary nails, use of techniques like Masquelet and Ilizarov, and even soft tissue transfers. All of these methods have certain limitations, such as the eventual requirement of more than one surgical event. Certain growth factors aid in the development and vascularization of new bone, such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1). We propose that nanoparticles of BMPs, IGL-1, and microorganism-specific antibiotics can be placed on the surface of intramedullary nails. These nanoparticles can be attached to various different polymeric materials such as poly(d,l-lactide), which is a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer, and can be positioned in several layers, to ensure controlled and systematic release. The placement of nanoparticles at the infection site alone will also ensure local delivery of the drugs only to the required areas. Moreover, these intramedullary nails will be useful for both infected non-unions and mal-unions. Over time, the nanoparticles will eradicate the infection and stimulate new healthy bone formation, whereas the intramedullary nail itself will provide constant stability and immobilization. This model provides new and revolutionary ideas for the development of individualized technologies in medicine."

The link between TNF-alpha blockers and IgAN may be hypothesized examining diseases which share pathologic features. In this respect, idiopathic IgAN and Henoch Schonlein Purpura have been the object of studies revealing a pathogenetic role of aberrant glycosylation of IgA1 molecules. The Authors suggest that anti-drug antibodies against glycan structures of TNF-alpha inhibitors may cross react against serum aberrant IgA1 leading to large antigen-antibody complexes. These large polymeric IgA complexes are then able to deposit in the mesangium and activate the complement cascade. Such hypothesis may be tested by measuring serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 of patients developing IgAN following introduction of TNF-alpha blockers.

However, a growing number of new approaches are being proposed that suggest the emergence of paradigm shifts in this area. In particular, quantum theories of mind, brain and consciousness seem to offer a profound change to the current approaches. Unfortunately these quantum paradigms harbor at least two serious problems. First, they are simply models, theories, and assumptions, with no convincing experiments supporting their claims. Second, they deviate from contemporary mainstream views of psychiatric illness and do so in revolutionary ways. We suggest a possible way to integrate experimental neuroscience with quantum models in order to address outstanding issues in psychopathology. A key role is played by the phenomenon called the “stream of consciousness”, which can be linked to the so-called “Gamma Synchrony” (GS), which is clearly demonstrated by EEG data. In our novel proposal, a unipolar depressed patient could be seen as a subject with an altered stream of consciousness. In particular, some clues suggest that depression is linked to an “increased power” stream of consciousness. It is additionally suggested that such an approach to depression might be extended to psychopathology in general with potential benefits to diagnostics and therapeutics in neuropsychiatry."

Conventional dosage forms, such as eye drops, have to surmount several elimination mechanisms and complex barriers to achieve therapeutic concentrations at the target site often resulting in low anterior segment bioavailability (ca. 2–5%) with generally none of the drug reaching posterior segment tissues. Thus, frequent intravitreal injections are currently required to treat retinal conditions which have been associated with poor patient compliance due to pain, risk of infection, hemorrhages, retinal detachment and high treatment related costs. To partially overcome these issues, ocular implants have been developed for some posterior segment indications; however, the majority require surgical implantation and removal at the end of the intended treatment period. The transparent nature of the cornea and lens render light-responsive systems an attractive strategy for the management of diseases affecting the back of the eye. Light-responsive in situ forming injectable implants (ISFIs) offer various benefits such as ease of application in a minimally invasive manner and more site specific control over drug release. Moreover, the biodegradable nature of such implants avoids the need for surgical removal after release of the payload. Incorporating drug-loaded polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) into these implants may reduce the high initial burst release from the polymeric matrix and further sustain drug release thus avoiding the need for frequent injections as well as minimizing associated side effects. However, light-responsive systems for ophthalmic application are still in their early stages of development with limited reports on their safety and effectiveness. We hypothesize that the innovative design and properties of NP-containing light-responsive ISFIs can serve as a platform for effective management of ocular diseases requiring long term treatment."

The indication of elective surgical repair is currently based on the maximum diameter and growth rate criteria which represent an oversimplification of the Law of Laplace stating that the stress exerted in a cylinder or sphere is proportional to its radius. These criteria fail to capture the complex pathophysiology of the aneurismal disease thus often leading to therapeutic inaccuracies (treating large AAAs with a very low actual rupture risk while observing smaller ones with a much greater risk). Aneurysmal disease is mainly a degenerative process leading to loss of structural integrity of the diseased aortic wall which cannot withhold the stresses due to systemic pressurization. Moreover aortic wall degeneration has been shown to be a localized phenomenon and rupture depends on the pointwise comparison of strength and stress rather than a global aortic wall weakening. Ex-vivo mechanical studies have related vessel wall hypoxia to loss of structural endurance and reduced wall strength. Therefore a module to capture in vivo variation of aortic wall blood supply and oxygenation would be of value for the evaluation of AAA rupture risk. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) imaging represents a novel technique which has been already used to estimate tissue vascularity in several clinical conditions but not aneurismal disease. We hypothesize that PCT could be used as an adjunct tool during AAA diagnostics in order to evaluate aortic wall oxygenation in vivo, therefore providing a possible means to identify weak spots making the lesion amenable to rupture."

Saliva proteins as possible biomarker for GVHD could facilitate the management and diagnosis accuracy. For support the proposed hypotheses, in this pilot study we collected whole saliva samples from patients with undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and from healthy subjects. Samples were collected prospectively between pre-transplant, thirty days, one hundred and, two hundred days after transplant. The proteomic profile was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and LCMS–ESI–IT-TOF mass spectrometry. The relevant personal data, past medical history were also recorded. The most relevant proteins found exclusively in GVHD patients were: CSF2RB, Protocadherin (Pcdh) Fat 2 precursor, protein capicua homolog isoform CIC-S, MUC16 and RGPD8_HUMAN RANBP2. This study aims to conduct an initial evaluation of the possible presence of such biomarkers in saliva from GVHD patients, and suggested a potential application of proteomics analysis as a alternative method to diagnose GVHD."

Interestingly even the fetus, in a sexually dimorphic manner, influences the pedantic growth and development of placenta. Although placenta is thought to act as a protective barrier against chemical exposures, certain endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that are circulating in mother’s blood tend to cross placenta. These EDCs have been reported to cause changes in expression levels of certain genes, immunogenic factors and non-coding RNAs such as micro RNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) leading to placental stress. We hypothesize that these changes in placenta occur in a sexually dimorphic manner as a result of interaction between EDC exposure and fetal sex. Therefore, we propose that the ability of placenta to respond and buffer EDC exposure depends on fetal sex and, hence the EDC associated disease susceptibility of one sex differs from the other."

Molecular science has associated the presence of specific molecules with its development, and moreover recent research suggests that deregulated angiogenesis is a crucial process in the development of cholesteatoma and its recurrence. Further, haematologists have linked von Willebrand factor and its defects (both quantitative and qualitative) to augmented angiogenesis through upregulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor and angiogenic cytokines. Thus, herewith we probed whether a relationship between von Willebrand disease and the etiopathogenesis of cholesteatoma, plays a potential role for anti-angiogenic molecules for the advent of cholesteatoma surgery adjuvant treatment."

We put forward a new hypothesis: tumors arise from the excessive repair of damaged stem cells. There are stem cells in all tissues and organs, and the stem cells have perfect damage repair mechanisms, including damage repair systems and repair-inhibiting systems. Tumors arise from the excessive repair of damaged stem cells, i.e., carcinogens induce stem cell damage, leading to overexpression of damage repair systems, and simultaneous inactivation of repair-inhibiting systems through genetic or non-genetic mechanisms, finally forming tumors. The outcome (forming clinically significant tumors or death) and development (tumor recurrence, metastasis or spontaneous healing) of the tumor cells depends on whether the injury and the excessive repair persists, whether immune surveillance function is normal and the tumor microenvironment is appropriate. This hypothesis not only addresses the issues of where tumor cells arise from, how tumors form and where they go, but also provides a reasonable explanation for many unresolved issues in tumor occurrence, development, metastasis or healing. In addition, this hypothesis could guide the early diagnosis, reasonable treatment and effective prevention of tumors."

However, recent data suggest that low immunogenicity of current BoNT-A preparations could allow more frequent injections. Our hypothesis is that a short time interval between injections may be safe and effective in reducing upper limb spasticity and related disability. IncobotulinumtoxinA was injected under ultrasound guidance in spastic muscles of 11 subjects, who were evaluated just before BoNT-A injection (T0), and 1month (T1), 2months (T2) and 4months (T3) after injecting. At T1, in the case of persistent disability related to spasticity interfering with normal activities, patients received an additional toxin dose. Seven subjects received the additional dose at T1 because of persistent disability; 4 of them had a decrease of disability 1month later (T2). Rethinking the injection scheme for BoNT-A treatment may have a major impact in the management of spasticity and related disability. Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm that injection schedules with short time intervals should no longer be discouraged in clinical practice."

abstract = "CTE has two prominent components: the pathophysiology that is detected in the brain postmortem and the symptomology that is present in the interval between retirement and end of life. CTE symptomology has been noted to include memory difficulties, aggression, depression, explosivity, and executive dysfunction at early stages progressing to problems with attention, mood swings, visuospatial difficulties, confusion, progressive dementia, and suicidality (e.g. McKee et al. (2012), Omalu et al. (2010a–c), McKee et al. (2009)). There are a number of assumptions embedded within the current CTE literature: The first is the assumption that CTE symptomology reported by athletes and their families is the product of the pathophysiology change detected post-mortem (e.g. McKee et al. (2009)). At present, there is little scientific evidence to suggest that all CTE symptomology is the product of CTE pathophysiology. It has been assumed that CTE pathophysiology causes CTE symptomology (Meehan et al. (2015), Iverson et al. (2016)) but this link has never been scientifically validated. The purpose of the present work is to provide a multi-factorial theoretical framework to account for the symptomology reported by some athletes who sustain neurotrauma during their careers that will lead to a more systematic approach to understanding post-career symptomology. There is significant overlap between the case reports of athletes with post-mortem diagnoses of CTE, and symptom profiles of those with a history of substance use, chronic pain, and athlete career transition stress. The athlete post-career adjustment (AP-CA) model is intended to explain some of the symptoms that athletes experience at the end of their careers or during retirement. The AP-CA model consists of four elements: neurotrauma, chronic pain, substance use, and career transition stress. Based on the existing literature, it is clear that any one of the four elements of the AP-CA model can account for a significant number of CTE symptoms. In addition, depression can be a chronic lifelong co-morbid condition that may be present prior to an athletic career, or may be developed secondary to any of the model elements as shown in Fig. 1. Notably, neurotrauma is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition, for the development of CTE symptomology."

But major challenges still remain in patients with osteoporosis involving compromised osseointegration, and the therapeutic methods is far from optimism. Gallium can directly inhibit bone osteolysis, prevent bone calcium release and augment bone mass, which makes Ga unique among the potential antiresorptive drugs. Silicon, as an indispensable modulator in bone formation, presents its bone anabolic effects, while reduces, at least doesn’t increase, bone resorption. We hypothesize that the combination of bone anabolic effects of Si and antiresorptive effects of Ga will result in synergistic effects on the improvement of osteointegration under osteoporotic condition. In our strategy, in order to maximize the efficacy while minimize the side effects of ions, a novel titania mesoporous layer fabricated by electrochemical anodization on the surface of titanium implant will be employed as a promising local drug delivery system. The synergistic effects of Ga and Si on improving osseointegration will be verified by animal experiments, and be furthered by clinical trials. Our hypothesis could help to create an option to improve success rate of dental implants in osteoporotic patients."

Similarly certain eye diseases have been associated with systemic diseases of the inflammatory pathway. We hypothesized that periodontal diseases are associated with eye diseases. Thus using literature data we find that several studies have reported that eye disorders are associated with the presence of periodontal diseases.

Serine/threonine-protein kinase, pknB (Rv0014c) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) was selected as the drug target since it involves in several vital functions of the Mtb. All of the 1554 drugs were subjected to molecular docking with pknB. Glide and AutoDock Vina were employed using rigid docking followed by induced fit docking protocol for prioritization of drugs. Out of 14 drugs prioritized, six are suggested as high-confident drugs towards repurposing for TB as they were consistently found within top 10 ranks of both methods, and strongly binding in the active site of the pknB. We also found atorvastatin as one of the high-confident drugs, which has already been demonstrated to be active against Mtb under in vitro conditions by other researchers. Therefore, we propose that the prioritized six high-confident drugs as potential candidates for repurposing for TB and suggest for further experimental studies.

The cause of this formation of ectopic lymphoid aggregates may be an acute infection, asymptomatic reactivations of a common neurotropic virus, exposure to a neurotoxin, or physical injury to peripheral nerves. In step 2, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected lymphocytes or monocytes bring EBV from the circulation to one or several of these lymphoid aggregates, whereupon cell-to-cell transmission of EBV and proliferation of latently EBV-infected lymphocytes lead to the presence of many EBV-infected cells in the lymphoid aggregates. The EBV-infected cells in the aggregates ignite an inflammation in the surrounding nervous tissue. This local inflammation elicits, in turn, a wave of glial cell activation that spreads from the EBV-infected area to parts of the nervous system that are not EBV-infected, disturbing the neuron-glial interaction in both the peripheral – and central nervous system. In step 3, immune cell exhaustion contributes to a consolidation of the pathological processes. There might be a cure: Infusions of autologous EBV-specific T-lymphocytes can perhaps remove the EBV-infected cells from the nervous system."

However, despite advanced knowledge about molecular mechanism responsible for the effects induced by LSD and other related substances acting at serotonergic 5-HT2a receptors, we still do not understand how these drugs trigger specific sensory experiences. LSD-induced experience is characterised by perception of movement in the environment and by presence of various bodily sensations such as floating in space, merging into surroundings and movement out of the physical body (the out-of-body experience). It means that a large part of the experience induced by the LSD can be simplified to the illusory movement that can be attributed to the self or to external objects. The phenomenology of the LSD-induced experience has been combined with the fact that serotonergic neurons provide all major parts of the brain with information about the level of tonic motor activity, occurrence of external stimuli and the execution of orienting responses. Therefore, it has been proposed that LSD-induced stimulation of 5-HT2a receptors disrupts the integration of the sensory stimuli with information about the movement of the body leading to perception of illusory movement."

Under stressful circumstances, the concentration of blood saturated fatty acids (SFAs) increases rapidly to provide enough ATP for individuals’ survival owing to stress hormones such as glucocorticoid, catecholamine and glucagon. It is reported that SFAs can trigger an inflammatory response through CD14-TLR4-MD2 complex. The role of TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathway has been confirmed in the pathogenesis of cancer pain and inflammatory pain. Furthermore, a newly clinical research uncovers that the children with recurrent abdominal pain, which is triggered by early psychosomatic stress, have higher levels of SFAs than healthy individuals. We therefore put forward the hypothesis that the elevated level of SFAs induced by stress hormones may be engaged in the presurgical anxiety-induced persistent postsurgical pain. If established, it’s of important clinical significance, which will make great contributions to the prevention and treatment of the presurgical anxiety-induced persistent postsurgical pain."

We are starting to appreciate that nutrition can influence composition of gut microbiota that can impact hosting organism’s physiology and can even result in development of pathological changes. Evidence is also emerging that acute as well as chronic stresses can profoundly influence the physiology of certain organs, especially heart and liver. Our preliminary data imply that changes in animal nutrition and stress levels initiated up to minutes before the cell isolation could alter the cell stress response of cultured primary hepatocytes after isolation, leading to differences in sensitivity of apoptosis triggering. Therefore, we propose the hypothesis that conditions of animal breeding, especially diet and stress levels, are reflected in the physiology of the isolated primary cells. Variations in animal breeding conditions may influence experimental results on isolated cells and their applicability for studying human disorders."

Heparin has been used to treat pregnant women who are predisposed to thrombosis, and it has also been used in some women with infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss without associated thrombotic events. Positive pregnancy outcomes after heparin treatment in these groups indicate that heparin may alter the uterine environment to make it more suitable for implantation and fetal growth. In this paper, we propose that in some cases, heparin may accomplish this by inhibiting HHV-6 transfer to the endometrium and/or by offsetting the virally-mediated effects of endothelial cell injury."

The immunological alterations of the peritoneal fluid explains the effects of disease, such as the inhibition of the physiological processes of cytolysis, but does not explain the cause. There is evidence to support the hypothesis that ectopic müllerian remnants of the endometrium, endocervix and endosalpinx are items from the genital ridge leaked during organogenesis. It is known that tissues derived from coelomatic epithelial and mesenchymal cells have the potential to metaplastically differentiate into epithelium and stroma. In addition, the phenotype of the ectopic endometrial cells is significantly different from those ectopic. There is scientific evidence that, during organogenesis, the genes of the Homeobox and Wingless family play a fundamental role in the differentiation of the ducts of Muller and development of the anatomical structure of the urogenital tract. We present here a hypothesis that deregulation of genes and the Wnt signaling pathway Wnt/β-catenin leads to aberrations and deregulation within the mesoderm, thus, may cause aberrant placement of stem cells. In addition, immune cells, adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase and pro-inflammatory cytokines activate/alter peritoneal microenvironment, creating the conditions for differentiation, adhesion, proliferation and survival of ectopic endometrial cells."

Several studies examining the effects of Metformin during pregnancy reported a lower pregnancy loss, reduced gestational diabetes and no increased risk for birth defects, however, several more recent studies also raised concerns about its safe use. The therapeutic effect of metformin stems from its ability to inhibit the action of the first complex of the electron transport resulting in reduced ATP production. At the initial stages of embryo development, the only source of ATP is the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Lowering ATP production at the critical stage of early embryo development may impair oocyte maturation and embryo development as well as reprogram the metabolic characteristics of the offspring."

Attention was initially focused on the adverse effects of moderate and severe anemia. Interestingly, some studies revealed that mild anemia was associated with optimal fetal development and was not affecting pregnancy outcome. The explanation for this phenomenon became a target for scientists. Hemodilution, physiologic anemia and relative decrease in hemoglobin concentration are the changes observed during pregnancy but they do not explain the reasons for the positive influence of mild anemia on a fetomaternal unit. It is hypothesized that hemodilution facilitates placental perfusion because blood viscosity is reduced. Subsequently, it may lead to a decline in hemoglobin concentration. Anemia from its definition implies decreased oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and can result in hypoxemia and even hypoxia, which is a common factor inducing new blood vessels formation. Therefore, we raised the hypothesis that the lowered hemoglobin concentration during pregnancy may upregulate vascular growth factor receptors expression such as VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (FLK-1/KDR). Consecutively, increased fetoplacental vasculogenesis and angiogenesis provide further expansion of vascular network development, better placental perfusion and hence neither fetus nor the mother are affected."

abstract = "Over the past decades, chemotherapy has significantly increased the overall prognosis and survival of several patients diagnosed with cancer. However, the usefulness of some chemotherapeutic agents has been hindered by a collateral dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. To date, although extensive efforts have been directed to the early detection of subclinical toxicity in patients treated with these drugs, it remains unclear which approach would be best in order to prevent chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity (CIC). For many years, conventional echocardiography has been among preferred noninvasive imaging modality to monitor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Unfortunately, a significant reduction in LVEF is not recognized early on after chemotherapy-induced myocardial damage. Moreover, delayed recognition has been associated with poor recovery potential and poor clinical outcome. Thus, there is a critical need to identify early, reliable parameters of subclinical injury. Myocardial deformation imaging, also known as strain imaging echocardiography (SIE), is becoming readily available for advanced routine echocardiography and has shown value in detecting subclinical ventricular dysfunction in several clinical scenarios. Abnormalities in systolic deformation parameters have been identified as early manifestation but left ventricular diastolic properties remain less well defined. We hypothesize that onset as well as progression of cardiotoxicity not only should disturb deformation curves of myocardial contraction, but also relaxation. Hence, SIE may detect subtle myocardial changes in diastole that could be of potential benefit in the early prediction of CIC. If this premise is proven correct, the use of a standardized advanced echocardiographic imaging protocol using both, systolic and diastolic strain imaging, will prove to be a powerful noninvasive tool as baseline and follow-up of these patients. Furthermore, it will foster the developing of more effective screening strategies in at risk cancer survivor populations, or identify the best time to start cardioprotective therapy to prevent CIC. Also, this experience might be extrapolated to other non-oncologic patient population in need of a surveillance tool to early recognize cardiac injury secondary to the use of cardiotoxic medications."

Tics are elicited by either environmental experiences or internal signals that instruct the basal ganglia to initiate automatic or procedural movements. In most vertebrates the basal ganglia encode instructions for habitually used sequences of motor movements that are essential to survival. Tic disorders may represent evolved phenotypes with a lower threshold for basal ganglia-directed actions. This may have produced a susceptibility to extraneous tics, but also produced fast-acting tactical solutions to immediate physical problems. During periods of nonstop movement, continual foraging, and sustained vigilance, it may have been advantageous to allow subcortical motor commands to intrude into ongoing motor activities. It is clear that the engrams for individual motor responses held in the basal ganglia are selected by converging cortical and subcortical inputs. This form of convergent action selection results in the selection of the most contextually reinforced actions. Today people with Tourette’s have tics that seem arbitrary and inappropriate; however, this may be due to the vast discrepancies in reinforcement between the ancestral environment and the modern one. In prehistoric environments, the motor behaviors of individuals with tic disorders may have been appropriate in environmental context, and had ecological relevance in survival and self-promotion."

However, the appearance of gene-directed prodrug therapy and recombinant DNA technology has invigorated the notice in range of applications employing bacteria and bacterial therapy and have been carried out. The most possible and promising upcoming strategies are bacteria mediated cancer treatment. Significant efficacy in pre-clinical studies have been demonstrated and some are presently under clinical investigation.

Estrogen and angiogenesis are significant factors in the etiology of melasma. A useful addition to the therapeutic armentarium for treating melasma would include a topical agent that could effect both of these causative factors. Specifically, a topical preparation consisting of an anti-estrogen and a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor would accomplish this goal. Suitable candidates that target estrogen receptors and vascular endothelial growth factor are currently used in medical oncology as systemic antineoplastic agents. The anti-estrogen could be either a selective estrogen receptor modulator (such as tamoxifen or raloxifene) or an aromatase inhibitor (such as anastrozole or letrozole or exemestane).

abstract = "Recent research on re-circulation of interstitial fluid from the brain parenchyma to the periphery and its inferred importance in immune surveillance dysregulation are changing our conceptualization of the pathophysiology of virus-induced autoimmunity. In this context, it is necessary to reassess the immunomodulatory properties of human defensins that are variably expressed by cerebral microglia, astrocytes and choroid plexus epithelial cells and exhibit complex and often confounding roles in neuroinflammatory processes. Therefore, in this review we describe current contributions in this field and we propose novel hypotheses regarding the potential impact of defensin-related pathways on virus-driven autoimmune neurodegeneration. In this regard, we have previously proposed that abnormal expression of defensins by penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to the pathophysiology of Helicobacter pylori-related brain neurodegenerative disorders through variable modulations of innate and adaptive immune responses. We hereby propose that impaired expression of defensins by structural components of the BBB may impede glymphatic circulation and disrupt receptor signalling in pericytes that is essential for microvascular stability, thereby retaining blood-derived toxins and bystander activated T-cells in the brain and further impairing BBB integrity and hampering viral clearance. Autoreactive T-cell infiltrates in neuronaxonal lesions characteristic of chronic central nervous system diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, are directed against both, myelin and non-myelin, antigens the precise nature of which remains enigmatic. Inadequate expression of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), a gene expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells, induces the recruitment of defensin-specific T-cells. These cells may access the brain, thereby causing a decrease in defensin expression and subsequent down-regulation of CD91/LRP1-mediated clearance of amyloid-β that ultimately accumulates as protein deposits. It should be highlighted that β-amyloid brain deposits are a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. During human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, selective elicitation of the VH1-69 antibody subfamily directed against specific, viral glycoprotein epitopes, often correlates with a higher likelihood of developing autoimmune disorders. In addition, we propose that recently described defensin affinity towards the same epitopes may prevent proper viral fusion, but at the expense of augmenting autoimmune reactivity. Moreover, in the context of complex and largely unknown symbiotic relations between host microbiota and pathogenic viruses, we propose that co-stimulation of defensin expression may modulate adaptive immune responses thereby enhancing inflammatory cascades responsible for autoimmunity. Finally, we describe current evidence that supports the hypothesis of a possible involvement of defensins in HCV-related autoimmunity. Exploring further potential implications of human defensins in virus-related autoimmunity may lead to improved strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders."

Taken together, the evidence we present shows a recurring pattern of hormonal sensitivity at predictable but different times across the lifespan of some women (i.e., menarche, the premenstrual phase, hormonal contraceptive use, pregnancy, the postpartum period, and menopause). These findings provide support for the hypothesis that there is a subgroup of women who are more susceptible to physical, psychological, and sexual symptoms related to hormonal shifts or abrupt hormonal fluctuations that occur throughout the reproductive lifespan. We propose that this pattern reflects a Hormonal Sensitivity Syndrome."

The recent demonstration that far from being benign, “benign” prostatic hypertrophy is a likely a reaction of the prostate to chronic untreated lower genital tract infection, and that this chronic inflammation is likely the usual precursor to the frequent occurrence of prostatic carcinoma has far reaching implications. The obvious source for the chronic inflammatory stimulus in the prostate is the documented dramatically altered lower female genital microbiota associated with the menopause. Hence the major hypothesis is that prostatic cancer may arise due to chronic infection and inflammation in the prostate gland consequent upon the altered microbiome of the menopausal female genital tract. This has implications for testing and diagnosis, treatment, population health and personal hygiene practices. It suggests that male dyspareunia, although almost never encountered in clinical practice may in fact be relatively common in older males, and in particular if diagnosed, represents a critical opportunity for therapeutic intervention to interrupt the chronic inflammation – cancer transformation and progression which has been well documented in other tissues. It implies that the coordinated application of next generation sequencing to the microbiome of the lower genital tracts of male and female couples, including seminal fluid, will have both research applications to further explore this sequence, as well as finding application as a potential population level screening procedure as is presently done for the “Thin Prep” cervical screening for human papillomavirus in females. Moreover this insight opens up new opportunities for chemointervention and chemoprevention for this important clinicopathological progression. These considerations give rise to the exciting possibility that prostatic malignancy may be preventable by various methods of local hygiene in the female partner or some antibacterial method in males. Since the long term application of oral antibiotics is likely to be of limited efficacy this indicates the need for new antimicrobial solutions."

In the kidney, as in other organs and cells with high and fluctuating energy requirements, energy-charged phospho-creatine (PCr) acts as an immediate high-energy source and energy buffer, and as an intracellular energy transport vehicle. A maximally filled total Cr (Cr plus PCr) pool is a prerequisite for optimal functioning of the body and its organs, and health. Skeletal- and cardiac muscles of dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are depleted of Cr in parallel with the duration of dialysis. The accompanying accumulation of cellular damage seen in CKD patients lead to a deterioration of musculo-skeletal and neurological functioning and poor quality of life (QOL). Therefore, to counteract Cr depletion, it is proposed to supplement CKD patients with Cr. The anticipated benefits include previously documented improvements in the musculo-skeletal system, brain and peripheral nervous system, as well as improvements in the common comorbidities of CKD patients (see below). Thus, with a relatively simple, safe and inexpensive Cr supplementation marked improvements in quality of life (QOL) and life span are likely reached. To avoid Cr and fluid overload by oral Cr administration, we propose intradialytic Cr supplementation, whereby a relatively small amount of Cr is added to the large volume of dialysis solution to a final concentration of 1–10mM. From there, Cr enters the patient’s circulation by back diffusion during dialysis. Because of the high affinity of the Cr transporter (CRT) for Cr affinity for Cr (Vmax of CRT for Cr=20–40μM Cr), Cr is actively transported from the blood stream into the target cells and organs, including skeletal and cardiac muscle, brain, proximal tubules of kidney epithelial cells, neurons, and leukocytes and erythrocytes, which all express CRT and depend on the CK/PCr system. By this intradialytic strategy, only as much Cr is taken up by the body as is needed to fill the tissue Cr pools and no excess Cr has to be excreted, as is the case with oral Cr. Because aqueous solutions of Cr are not very stable, Cr must be added immediately before dialysis either as solid Cr powder or from a frozen Cr stock solution to the dialysate, or alternatively, Cr could become an additional component of a novel dry dialysate mixture in a cartridge device."

A hypothesis is postulated that conditional potency of viral protein-derived toxic peptides could at least in part explain cell senescence upon viral infections. The hypothesis can be tested with full length viral proteins against microbial and mammalian cells in various media. Viral protein injections to live animals may reveal that they are critical factors underlying cell destructions when protein degradation pathways and cytokine levels are controlled.

Bumatenide is a specific antagonist of the first isoform of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC1). It is usually used as a diuretic but may also promote a decrease in intraneuronal chloride ion concentration leading to hyperpolarization in neuronal membrane and subsequent decrease in neuronal hyperexcitability. This physiologic effect has been considered to be behind the relative efficacy of bumetanide in improving symptoms of ASD and, to a lesser extent, schizophrenia. However, insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) shows the same physiologic effect. In addition, it may improve brain network dysconnectivity which is known to be an important neurobiological feature in ASD and schizophrenia. IGF-1 has started to prove its efficacy in improving symptoms of children with Rett syndrome, a genetic disorder that shares several clinical similarities with ASD. IGF-1 may also improve oxytocin secretion through the enhancement of the transient potential receptor V2 channel function. Accordingly, IGF-1 should be studied as a potential treatment of ASD and other mental disorders characterized with brain dysconnectivity such as schizophrenia."

With more than 170 million people infected worldwide, eradication remains a challenge even with the revolutionary current direct antiviral agents (DAAs). The risk of resistance, the safety profile in some populations, the genotype specificity and the high price of current DAAs explain why there is still interest in developing host targeting agents (HTA) that may help overcome some of these difficulties. Specifically, targeting the entry of HCV to the cell seems like a promising strategy. Recently it has been shown that the cholesterol transporter NPC1L1, a protein located in the small bowel epithelium and in the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte is also an HCV receptor. Just as this protein is key in the entero-hepatic cycle of cholesterol, we hypothesize that there is an entero-hepatic cycle of HCV that could be disrupted by blocking NPC1L1 with ezetimibe, an already approved and readily available safe drug. Ezetimibe, either alone or in combination with DAAs, could decrease relapse rates, reduce resistance and even make treatments cheaper."

Disruption of this homeostatic balance of bone removal and replacement can manifest as inappropriate new bone formation found in spondylarthritis.

Despite the advances in surgical techniques, together with the improved methods for a meniscal allograft sizing, success is only observed in up to 75% of patients after they experience a meniscal allograft transplantation. Because a meniscal extrusion is associated with a cartilage deterioration and the progression of osteoarthritis there is a great interest in how to prevent this phenomenon. The crucial factor for the minimisation of a meniscal allograft extrusion is by perfectly matching the implant. Most methods for a meniscal allograft sizing only focus on assessing the length and the width of the meniscus. Even though there is some evidence that there is a relationship between the shape of the meniscus in a cross-sectional plane and the meniscal extrusion, any of the planning methods do not take this factor into consideration. Although there is a large variability of meniscus shapes in cross-section, we hypothesise that by taking the meniscal slope into account during surgical planning, as well as performing the correct adjustments of this particular parameter, we can diminish the risk of a meniscal allograft extrusion."

abstract = "Current understanding of the neurobiology of depression has grown over the past few years beyond the traditional monoamine theory of depression to include chronic stress, inflammation and disrupted synaptic plasticity. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a key factor that not only promotes fibrinolysis via the activation of plasminogen, but also contributes to regulation of synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis through plasmin-mediated activation of a probrain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to mature BDNF. ProBDNF activation could potentially be supressed by competition with fibrin for plasmin and tPA. High affinity binding of plasmin and tPA to fibrin could result in a decrease of proBDNF activation during brain inflammation leading to fibrosis further perpetuating depressed mood. There is a paucity of data explaining the possible role of the fibrinolytic system or aberrant extravascular fibrin deposition in depression. We propose that within the brain, an imbalance between tPA and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and neuroserpin favors the inhibitors, resulting in changes in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neuroinflammation that result in depressive behavior. Our hypothesis is that peripheral inflammation mediates neuroinflammation, and that cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) can inhibit the fibrinolytic system by up- regulating PAI-1 and potentially neuroserpin. We propose that the decrement of the activity of tPA and uPA occurs with downregulation of uPA in part involving the binding and clearance from the surface of neural cells of uPA/PAI-1 complexes by the urokinase receptor uPAR. We infer that current antidepressants and ketamine mitigate depressive symptoms by restoring the balance of the fibrinolytic system with increased activity of tPA and uPA with down-regulated intracerebral expression of their inhibitors. We lastly hypothesize that psychedelic 5-ht2a receptor agonists, such as psilocybin, can improve mood through anti- inflammatory and pro-fibrinolytic effects that include blockade of TNF-α activity leading to decreased PAI-1 activity and increased clearance. The process involves disinhibition of tPA and uPA with subsequent increased cleavage of proBDNF which promotes neurogenesis, decreased neuroinflammation, decreased fibrin deposition, normalized glial-neuronal cross-talk, and optimally functioning neuro-circuits involved in mood. We propose that psilocybin can alleviate deleterious changes in the brain caused by chronic stress leading to restoration of homeostatic brain fibrinolytic capacity leading to euthymia."

However, efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in this subtype of patients is inferior to its hormone receptor negative counterpart. Several preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that it was growth rate rather than hormone receptor status that determined sensitivity to chemotherapy. In addition, estrogen was proved to recruit more HR+ breast cancer cells into actively dividing phase according to various studies. For premenopausal females, sexual hormone like estradiol fluctuates with menstrual cycle. When menstruation occurs, women have the lowest level of estradiol, which is resemble to pharmaceutical effect of endocrine therapy. If chemotherapy is given to females during menstruation, it’s almost equal to concurrent use of chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, which is not recommended by guideline. Accordingly, chemotherapy would attain best efficacy applied at the peak of estradiol, because more tumor cells being in actively dividing phase recruited by comparatively high level of estradiol would help cytotoxic agents function better given that majority of chemotherapeutic drugs are cellular phase dependent. We name this rhythmic mode of chemotherapy for premenopausal HR+breast cancer females, giving chemotherapy to patients when estradiol rises and avoiding prescription at menstruation, tidal chemotherapy. It’s postulated that tidal chemotherapy would improve efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for premenopausal HR+breast cancer females, achieve more pathologic complete response and in the long run improve prognosis."

It is generally thought that orbital fat hyperplasia is the main contributing factor to the formation of baggy lower eyelids, and resection of excessive orbital fat pad is routinely performed during the eyelid cosmetic surgery. In our clinical study, however, it was revealed that the adipocytes in orbital fat tissue from older people became smaller compared to those from the young individuals. Based on this finding, we hypothesize that the orbital fat size may not increase, but decrease with age, and the declined fat depot volume is related to the reduced fat cell size and impaired differentiation of preadipocytes into fat cells. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are a population of postnatal stem cells residing in the fat tissue, capable of differentiating into preadipocytes and subsequently into mature fat cells throughout the lifespan. As preadipocytes are a substantial component of fat tissue and can greatly influence the fat composition and function, we speculate that orbital adipose-derived stem cells can be used as an excellent model to determine effects of aging on orbital fat. By evaluating the age-related changes in preadipocyte number, replication, and differentiation, we can reveal alterations in orbital fat cellularity and function with age, and investigate the relationship between orbital fat volume and the of baggy lower eyelid formation."

Although pathogenic mechanisms that may influence the pathophysiology of migraine and its possible chronicity are not fully understood, previous studies have shown in patients with migraine molecular alterations of systemic inflammation, neurogenic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, innate immunity, dysfunction of matrix proteases and blood-brain barrier. Periodontal disease is an inflammatory lesion caused by bacteria. After the bacterial infection begins, an immune response that will be responsible for individual susceptibility appears. More advanced forms of periodontitis have demonstrated molecular alterations of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, dysfunction of matrix proteases and innate immunity, similar to those observed in migraine. Furthermore, the main molecular mediators of neurogenic inflammation related to activation of the trigeminovascular system, which are characteristic of migraine, are overexpressed in gingival crevicular fluid and mucosa in patients with periodontal disease. Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance, stroke or coronary artery disease are comorbidities that periodontal disease and migraine could share. Therefore, several mechanisms and hypotheses could explain the possible association between both diseases. However, epidemiological and molecular studies will be necessary to provide a better understanding of this potential association, which could be implicated in the chronification of migraine."

The link between fragrances as and the multiplicity of pathogens remained latent for decades. However, now this health hazard and its role in homeostasis breakdown is getting attention. The adverse effects of the fragrance constituents as phthalates, paraben, glutaraldehyde, hydroperoxides, oil of turpentine, metals, nitro musks, and essential oils, among others, are being identified.

Hence, the researchers need to further validate the toxicity of fragrance compounds, and raise awareness towards the health risks. In this regard, a number of pathologies triggered by fragrance exposure, yet proven only scantily have been hypothesized. Analysis of the health issues from multiple facets, including the pivotal ‘stressors – extracellular acidosis – aromatase upregulation – estrogen hyperproduction – inflammation’ link has been proposed. Fragrance compounds share configurational similarity with carcinogenic environmental hydrocarbons and they provoke the expression of cytochrome group monooxygenase enzyme aromatase. This enzyme aromatizes androgens to form estrogen, the powerful signaling hormone, which underlies the majority of morbidities.

Current technology allows non-invasive cost-efficient assessment already from the first postnatal month.

In the system that we theorize, genetic material released by cancer cells would travel, either free or packed in exosomes, through the blood. Target cells located in organs deriving from the same embryological layer might uptake this genetic material due to expression of specific receptors. Interplay with the immune system would determine the fate of these oncofactors and would regulate their ability to circulate in the blood, integrate in the genome and be transcribed. We also hypothesize that the expression of cell membrane receptors such as integrins, to which cancer exosomes ligate might be mediated by inherited or acquired oncosuppressor mutations."

High levels of insulin in obesity and metabolic syndrome can induce numerous complications. Insulin can increase proliferation of chondrocyte but simultaneously, it prevents their differentiation. Moreover, hyperinsulinemia reduces the circulating level of serum T4 and conversion of T4 to T3, mimicking hypothyroidism, because thyroid hormones are necessary for the maturation of chondrocytes. So maybe decreasing insulin levels, prevents OA progression or improve the treatment process."

We report for the first time 3 cases of CSWS occurring during the post-operative course following surgical resection of exophytic bulbar pilocytic astrocytomas in children. Since these 3 cases shared in common a medial implication of the medulla, we suggest that specific interconnectivity between the dorso-medial portion of the medulla oblongata and the hypothalamus might thus represent an anatomical pathway of interest in the pathogenesis of CSWS. Our findings suggest that the resection of medially located exophytic bulbar tumors might constitutes a risk factor in the development of CSWS. Particular care should thus be carried towards the prompt detection and treatment of CSWS in the post-operative courses of exophytic bulbar tumors."

NTG is associated with some autoimmune conditions and systemic diseases, such as paraproteinemia, nocturnal hypotension, and migraine. Recently, a simple and cheap test (namely the hemogram) was defined as measure of systemic inflammation, measuring the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). A recent study displayed an altered platelet function in NTG patients. We hypothesize that an automated hemogram analysis for NLR together with IOP measurements may be used to screen NTG patients who are admitted to primary care clinics if any relationship between NTG and NLR could be demonstrated in future researches."

abstract = "Despite many years of research, the causes of biliary atresia still remain elusive. Infection, immune disorder, toxins or maternal microchimerism have been cited as potential triggers of biliary atresia. This is a rare disease with a stable incidence over the years although with sizeable ethnic variations. This stability suggests that environmental factors have in fact only a slight influence. During the search for etiologies, twin studies have often helped disentangle the genetic from the environmental. For this condition, twin studies have mainly demonstrated a lack of concordance between twins (either monozygotic or dizygotic), ruling out Mendelian, infectious or toxic causes. Indeed, for toxic or infectious embryopathy, the concordance for twins (especially monozygotic) is about 80%. Paradoxically, these data suggest that biliary atresia has neither a genetic nor an environmental cause. One way of severing the Gordian knot is to hypothesize a role for post zygotic somatic mutation, leading to genetic mosaicism (as a cause of biliary atresia). In recent years, post zygotic mutation has been identified as a cause of non-cancerous disease ranging from dysmorphic syndrome to specific organ abnormalities. A potential model for this condition could be post zygotic mutation or copy number variations in genes or regulatory regions, triggering the cascade of events leading to inflammatory and obliterative cholangiopathy. These events could be enhanced by genetic susceptibility explaining the ethnic variations. In these models, the rate of mosaicism in different parts of the liver could explain the success rate of the Kasai procedure. This hypothesis can be tested: as most children with biliary atresia are eligible for the Kasai procedure, genetic material from the liver and ductal plate can be collected easily. If the hypothesis is correct, whole genome sequencing or copy number variation studies at individual cell level should allow to identify the expected low level of genetic mosaicism. Thus, we hypothesize that postzygotic somatic mutation may play a part in the physiopathology of biliary atresia."

The Brucella genome contains flagella-specific genes and various hemolysins, but no flagella are formed and nor hemolysis is seen. Selective pressure can cause accumulation of mutations that turn those genes on instead of default off position and provoked the motile and hemolytic phenotypes.

When compared to the free microRNAs in the body fluids, exosomal microRNAs are more resistant to degradation and are easier to isolate.

It is further proposed that interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) is a true mediating risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and that elevated homocysteine predicts coronary disease because it can serve as a marker for increased IL-1β activity. Potent statin therapy may decrease IL-1β production by suppressing inflammasome activation – thereby accounting for the marked protection from cardiovascular events observed in the classic JUPITER study, in which the enrolled subjects had low-normal Low Density Lipoprotein cholesterol but elevated C-reactive protein."

In this regards, our hypothesis supposes that patients with diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease suffering a bacterial disease could experience a therapeutic failure and bacterial resistance when treated with fluoroquinolones. The crucial mechanism could be an inefficient blood distribution of the drug via red blood cell dysfunction induced by oxidative stress that might reduce the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodinamic ratios.

Additionally, this work exhibits the urgent need of studies considering these conditions for quinolone agents."

There is no report about 3BP metabolism to guide researchers and oncologists to improve clinical practice and prevent drug resistance. In this article, we provide evidences that 3BP is metabolized through glutathione (GSH) conjugation as a novel report where 3BP was confirmed to be attached to GSH followed by permanent loss of pharmacological effects in a picture similar to cisplatin. Both cisplatin and 3BP are alkylating agents. Reported decrease in endogenous cellular GSH content upon 3BP treatment was confirmed to be due to the formation of 3BP-GSH complex i.e. GSH consumption for conjugation with 3BP. Cancer cells having high endogenous GSH exhibit resistance to 3BP while 3BP sensitive cells acquire resistance upon adding exogenous GSH. Being a thiol blocker, 3BP may attack thiol groups in tissues and serum proteins e.g. albumin and GSH. That may decrease 3BP-induced anticancer effects and the functions of those proteins. We proved here that 3BP metabolism is different from metabolism of hydroxypyruvate that results from metabolism of D-serine using D-amino acid oxidase. Clinically, 3BP administration should be monitored during albumin infusion and protein therapy where GSH should be added to emergency medications. GSH exerts many physiological effects and is safe for human administration both orally and intravenously. Based on that, reported GSH-induced inhibition of 3BP effects makes 3BP effects reversible, easily monitored and easily controlled. This confers a superiority of 3BP over many anticancer agents."

Patients with T2D have a reduced VO2max when compared with healthy individuals of similar age, weight, and physical activity levels, and this lower aerobic capacity is usually attributed to a reduced oxygen delivery to the working muscles. The oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, as well as increases in cardiac output and blood flow, contribute to the delivery of oxygen to the active muscles during exercise. Hemoglobin mass (Hb mass), a key determinant of oxygen carrying capacity, is suggested to be reduced in patients with T2D following the observation of a lower blood volume (BV) in combination with normal hematocrit levels in this population. Therefore, a lower Hb mass, in addition to a reported lower BV and impaired cardiovascular response to exercise, likely contributes to the reduced oxygen delivery and VO2max in patients with T2D. While exercise training increases Hb mass, BV, and consequently VO2max, the majority of patients with T2D are not physically active, highlighting the need for alternative methods to improve VO2max in this population. Exposure to hypoxia triggers the release of erythropoietin, the hormone regulating red blood cell production, which increases Hb mass and consequently BV. Exposure to mild intermittent hypoxia (IH), characterized by few and short episodes of hypoxia at a fraction of inspired oxygen ranging between 10 and 14% interspersed with cycles of normoxia, increased red blood cell volume, Hb mass, and plasma volume in patients with coronary artery disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which resulted in an improved VO2max in both populations. We hypothesize that 12 exposures to mild IH over a period of 4weeks will increase Hb mass, BV, cardiac function, and VO2max in patients with T2D. Therefore, exposures to mild IH may increase oxygen delivery and VO2max without the need to perform exercise in patients with T2D."

This neuro-immune cross talk seems rely on neuropeptides such as Substance P secreted by nerve fiber terminals. It is hypothesized that local complete or partial cutaneous denervation/defunctionalization of peptidergic fibers in humans could be a feasible approach towards treating allergic contact dermatitis. Recently, human experimental protocols for prominent, temporary defunctionalization of peptidergic fibers have been published relying on prolonged application of 8% topical capsaicin patches. Combined with human experimental ACD models the importance of peptidergic nerve fibers in the induction and elicitation phases of ACD could be accurately established. Understanding the role of cutaneous peptidergic fibers in the pathogenesis and potentially of ACD and how contact sensitization can be modulated by topical defunctionalization of these fibers could lead to new approaches to treatment for ACD. In patients with localized ACD occurring to an allergen that is difficult or unfeasible to evade this would have particular relevance."

Beside the mentioned growth factors and cytokines, cellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) which play roles in both angiogenesis and inflammation are also involved in the pathogenesis. Cannabinoids are active compounds of Cannabina Sativa inducing their effects through cannabinoid receptors (CBs).

Tumour vasculature is known to be significantly variable. The great structural and functional abnormalities of tumour microcirculation cause spatial and temporal heterogeneity in its perfusion. Tumours have constantly been under the influence of pulsatile blood perfusion with variable pressure that initiates inhomogeneous erythrocyte deformation and following impact on oxygen disorder release from red blood cells into plasma within the blood vessel. Furthermore, stochastically released oxygen in tumour vessel, plasma and interstitial fluid may lead to heterogeneity of hypoxia. Under the influence of increased heterogeneity of hemodynamic force, the oxygen molecules dissolved in blood plasma are inclined to form nanobubbles (NBs) in tumour vessels. Considering the fact that tumour interstitial fluid pressure is increased compared to normal tissues, we assume that oxygen NBs may burst under the impact of shear stress. During the course of mechanochemical reaction, when a nanobubble (NB) bursts, both reactive oxygen species and ions form in various charged states. In consequence of a chain reaction, free radical oxygen molecules bind to proteins and lipids, thus reducing oxygen molecules in a chaotic manner within the tumour. The proposed hypothesis should be used as a methodical approach based on the simultaneous ultrasound imaging diagnostic techniques and therapy, regarding the mechanochemical effect on NB conglomerates with drugs in the tumour."

Other Neurological degenerative diseases with potential nutritional components such as Parkinson’s disease, frailty of age and Multiple Sclerosis, a disease with increased activity from vitamin D deficiency, may also be related to untreated exocrine pancreatic insufficiency causing impaired absorption of essential dietary elements. Testing of patients with Neurological degenerative diseases for EPI may enable correction of underlying nutritional deficiencies with enzyme replacement as necessary, possibly resulting in improvement of the underlying Neurological condition."

abstract = "The sport of soccer is the fastest growing and most popular sport worldwide. With this growth and popularity, attention needs to be given to this athletic population. Sports related concussions is a topic that has gained attention both in the media and by governmental organizations, with growing initiatives in diagnosis, prevention and treatment. The act of soccer heading is thought to contribute to increased concussion incidence. Current evidence reveals that within the high school soccer athletic population, female athletes incur a higher concussion rate than males. This is often attributed to many things including differing cervical spinal musculature, skull thickness, etc., but a definitive reason has not yet been found. Other behaviors, such as field awareness and eye discipline™ on the field of play, may also be contributing factors that result in females incurring a greater concussion rate than males. For the purposes of this paper we define eye discipline™ as the ability to keep the eyes engaged in sporting activity with high risk potential. We present our hypothesis that high school female soccer players are more likely to have their eyes closed when in position for heading the ball as compared to high school male soccer players and this lack of visual awareness may increase the risk of concussion. Should these differences be substantiated between males and females, it may initiate and promote discussion of the need for vision training in the high school athletic setting. As a tool for injury prevention, vision training may improve specific visual parameters improving athletes’ abilities to process the field of play and prepare for or avoid injury causing situations. Through ocular motor and visual conditioning, an athlete may become more eye disciplined™, and more likely to have their eyes open during heading of the ball, and more likely to avoid concussions."

In DDH the acetabular malformation of the hip joint alters the weight distribution superiorly in the loading axis. In accordance with Wolff’s Law, we propose that this change in loading may result in the formation of protrusions on either the acetabular rim or femoral head and neck, predisposing to impingement of the hip during to certain movements and consequently, FAI.

The role of cholesterol crystals in progression of atherosclerosis is emphasized. Proposed mechanism of spontaneous cholesterol crystal formation in the organism is discussed. Mechanisms and factors associated with the nanoparticle-mediated modulation of cholesterol crystal behaviour are proposed. Authors hypothesize that specially designed nanoparticles may therapeutically modulate cholesterol crystal behaviour in atherosclerosis. Nano-sized agents used in stent coatings and imaging techniques can possibly prevent cholesterol crystallization in the diseased vessels. On the other hand, new nanotechnologies should be implemented with caution as certain types of nanoparticles could become crystal seeds for cholesterol deposited in the atherosclerotically damaged vascular walls causing destabilization of the plaques. Studying nanoparticle-induced alterations of cholesterol crystal formation requires multidisciplinary approach involving biomedical researchers, computer scientists, and physical chemists specializing in crystal growth. The proposed hypothesis on nanoparticle-mediated modulation of cholesterol crystal behaviour may be relevant to other medical conditions including gallbladder stones, arthritis, and ophthalmological diseases such as synchysis scintillans."

Their beneficial effects are attributed to their ability to elevate endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) at the M1 muscarinic receptor in the brain. However, their side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, loss of appetite and altered heart rate are related to non-specific activation of M2-M5 muscarinic subtypes in various tissues. It is logical, therefore, to develop agonists with M1 receptor selectivity. Unfortunately, this is limited due to a high degree of orthosteric site homology among the receptor subtypes. In contrast, their allosteric sites are unique and, therefore, allow selective targeting using positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). PAMs of M1 receptors are devoid of agonist activity, however, when bound they enhance the binding affinity of orthosteric ligand, ACh. The major limitation of these PAMs is their bioavailability in the brain. In the current hypothesis, we propose surface modified nano-lipid drug conjugates (LDC-NPs) of PAMs of M1 receptors to improve their bioavailability in brain. When co-administered with AChE inhibitors they are expected to increase their efficacy and reduce their therapeutic dose and side effects."

The chronic disease benign prostatic hyperplasia belongs to the same ilk, except that the infection process is much more subtle and complex. The enzyme Phospholipase D (PLD) which is attached to the outer membrane of Escherichia coli (E. coli) has now been almost completely proven to be the basic cause of BPH. The evidence for this process is now extremely strong and compelling. PLD obtained from the organism Streptomyces chromofuscus has been used in past research because of its PLD content. It is commercially available. In vitro, on a culture of prostatic smooth muscle, PLD stimulated the production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) which acted on and caused substantial growth of that muscle in accordance with the quantity of PLD/ LPA generated. It has been asserted that repeated colonization by E. coli of the transitional zone of the prostate gland and the release of PLD following repeated destruction of these colonized bacteria, is the basic cause of BPH. The evidence for colonizing and re-colonizing infection is now overwhelming. PLD is a simple lipid consisting of a phosphate, glycerol and a fatty acid. After absorption into the prostatic stroma (which consists of connective tissue and of smooth muscle), it stimulates the production of LPA which, in turn, apart from directly stimulating prostatic smooth muscle, also acts on the connective tissue in the prostate and induces a complex mixture of growth regulatory proteins, which include members of the fibroblast, insulin-like and growth transforming factor families and implicates autocrine hormones acting on the stroma and paracrine hormones acting on epithelium. Also involved, are a variety of interleukins and other inflammatory cell cytokines, secreted by the stroma, which may further promote autocrine/paracrine proliferation of BPH cells. Cadherins involved in cell adhesion and possibly chalone which exerts negative effects, must also be considered. Overall, the degree of BPH that any older male develops is governed largely by:1.His level of serum testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).2.The number of receptors for E. coli which he possesses. This is at least partly genetically determined. This is the major and by far the most common factor influencing incidence and degree of severity of this disease.3.The number of times he sexually ejaculates after the age of approximately 40years. Apart from providing the existing huge evidence for infection in BPH, this manuscript explains the production, release and absorption of PLD into the prostate gland where it is converted to LPA. This is a growth factor and acts within the prostate both on smooth muscle (research proof given) and on prostatic connective tissue, resulting in BPH. This manuscript indicates the vital research, including the requisite materials, which would readily provide irrefutable and final etiological proof of all of the hormones involved. It explains how, to a large extent, the use of a vaccine which is now being developed, would likely allow the ultimate prevention of this ubiquitous disease."

Due to lack of drugs having endometrium receptivity enhancement properties, oocyte donation seems to be the only solution for women with implantation failure. The euploid oocytes come from young and healthy donors may overcome age associated endometrial receptivity defect. Nevertheless, many reasons restrict us from using oocyte donation in women with implantation failure. We, therefore, hypothesized that by mimicking a young blastocyst’s effect on endometrium, the transfer of genuine embryos and implantation-promoting compounds together might be the new treatment option for infertile women with recurrent implantation failure. Artificial beads, MI or GV oocytes, and empty zona can be used as a container for intrauterine replacement of implantation-promoting compounds."

DCM, occurs in response to both non-genetic and genetic factors, and has been associated with cytoskeletal protein mutations, impairing the contractile apparatus of cardiac myocytes. However, the pathology underlying the marked left ventricular dilatation remains unclear. Moreover, patients with end-stage DCM show alterations in the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and myocardial fibrosis even when the cardiac myocytes are intact. Therefore we hypothesize that DCM is a disease of basement membrane, which functions to support sarcomeric interactions with the ECM, and not only impaired cardiac contractility. We propose that under physiological conditions, the heart could be considered a second-class lever system. Disruption of the basement membrane in DCM would cause disarray in the alignment of cardiac myocytes and alteration in the second-class lever system of the heart. Thus, current inotropic agents show minimal or no effect on therapy as they target cardiac contractility rather than cardiac architecture and the lever systems of the heart."

In some of these cancers, autocrine production of FGF23 drives their proliferation. FGF23 synthesized within bone likely promotes the expansion of prostate cancer bone metastases. Hence, dietary or lifestyle factors which boost bone’s production of FGF23 may encourage the induction and spread of prostate cancer. High dietary intakes of bioavailable phosphorus and of calcium have been found to boost FGF23 levels, and this accords well with prospective epidemiology pointing to high intakes of both phosphate and calcium as risk factors for aggressive prostate cancer. Hence, prospective studies correlating baseline FGF23 levels with subsequent risk for prostate cancer, or advanced prostate cancer, are needed. Natural plant-based diets, though not inherently low in calcium or phosphorus, provide forms of these that are less bioavailable than those in animal products, and hence may be expected to down-regulate bone’s production of FGF23. This may play a role in the lower risk for clinical prostate cancer observed in vegans and quasi-vegan cultures. Other factors, such as decreased IGF-I levels and mTORC1 activity, may also play a role in this regard."

This requires the removal of the prior implant, placement of an antibiotic eluting spacer block made of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), followed by re-implantation of a new implant after treatment with intravenous antibiotics for six to eight weeks. Unfortunately, the use of PMMA as a spacer material has limitations in terms of mechanical and drug-eluting properties. PMMA is brittle and elutes most of the antibiotics within the first few days. Furthermore, the polymerization reaction for PMMA is highly exothermic, thereby limiting the use to heat-stable antibiotics. We hypothesize that the use of a 3D printed polymeric liner made of polylactic acid (PLA) would overcome the limitations of PMMA because it is a stronger and a less brittle material than PMMA. Furthermore, the liner can also act as a controlled drug delivery vehicle by using built in reservoirs and a network of micro-channels as well as by incorporating antibiotics directly into the polymer during manufacturing stage. Finally, the liner can be 3D printed according to the anatomy of the patient and thereby has the potential to transform the manner in which periprosthetic joint infections are currently treated."

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age related macular degeneration (AMD) are two retinal diseases that progress by photoreceptor cells death. In retinal transplantation studies, stem and progenitor cells inject into the sub retinal space or vitreous and then these cells can be migrate to the site of retinal degeneration and locate in the host retina and restitute vision.
Presentation of the hypothesis
Our hypothesis suggests that using human conjunctiva stem cells (as the source for increasing the number of human stem cells progenitor cells in retina dysfunction diseases) with fibrin gel and also assessing its relating in vitro (cellular and molecular processes) and in vivo (vision tests and pathology) could be a promising strategy for treatment of AMD and RP disorders.
Testing the hypothesis
In this idea, we describe a novel approach for retina tissue engineering with differentiation of conjunctiva mesenchymal stem cells (CJMSCs) into photoreceptor-like cells in fibrin gel with induction medium contain taurine. For assessment of differentiation, immunocytochemistry and real time PCR are used for the expression of Rhodopsin, RPE65, Nestin as differentiated photoreceptor cell markers in 2D and 3D culture. The results show that fibrin gel will offer a proper 3D scaffold for CJMSCs derived photoreceptor cell-like cells.
Implications of the hypothesis
Application of immune-privileged, readily available sources of adult stem cells like human conjunctiva stem cells with fibrin gel would be a promising strategy to increase the number of photoreceptor progenitor cells and promote involuntary angiogenesis needed in retina layer repair and regeneration."

The dynamics of the FPU auto recurrence making appropriate electrical dynamics of the normal functioning of the heart in the form of an electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained by a computer model study. The model solutions in the form of the FPU auto recurrence – ECG Fourier spectrum were evaluated for resistance to external disturbances in the form of random effects, as well as periodic perturbation at a frequency close to the heart beating rate of about 1Hz. In addition, in order to simulate the dynamics of myocardial infarction model, studied the effect of the surface area of the myocardium on the stability and shape of the auto recurrence – ECG spectrum. It has been found that the intense external disturbing periodic impacts at a frequency of about 1Hz lead to a sharp disturbance spectrum shape FPU auto recurrence – ECG structure. In addition, the decrease in the surface of the myocardium by 50% in the model led to the destruction of structures of the auto recurrence – ECG, which corresponds to the state of atrial myocardium. Research models have revealed a hypothetical basis of coronary heart disease in the form of increasing the energy of high-frequency harmonics spectrum of the auto recurrence by reducing the energy of low-frequency harmonic spectrum of the auto recurrence, which ultimately leads to a sharp decrease in myocardial contractility. In order to test the hypothesis has been studied more than 20,000 ECGs both healthy people and patients with cardiovascular disease. As a result of these studies, it was found that the dynamics of the electrical activity of normal functioning of the heart can be interpreted by the display of the detected by authors the FPU auto recurrence, and coronary heart disease is a violation of the energy ratio between the low and high frequency harmonics of the FPU auto recurrence Fourier spectrum equal to the ECG spectrum. Thus, the hypothesis has been confirmed."

The hypothetical model provides a description of remission and relapse in leukaemia as two hierarchical and qualitatively different states of normal haematopoiesis with their own phase spaces. Phase space transition is possible through pitchfork bifurcation, which is considered the common symmetrical scenario for relapse, induced remission and the spontaneous remission of leukaemia. Cytopenia is regarded as an adaptive reaction of haematopoiesis to an increase in entropy caused by leukaemia clones. The following predictions are formulated: a) the percentage of leukaemia cells in marrow as a criterion of remission or relapse is not necessarily constant but is a variable value; b) the probability of remission depends upon normal haematopoiesis reaching bifurcation; c) the duration of remission depends upon the eradication of leukaemia cells through induction or consolidation therapies; d) excessively high doses of chemotherapy in consolidation may induce relapse."

The changes have typical localization in basal ganglia and brainstem, and typical histological picture of spongiform appearance, vascular proliferation and gliosis. ATP deprivation, free radicals and lactate accumulation are suspected to be the causes. Hypocapnic hypothesis proposed in the paper questions the energy deprivation as the mechanism of LS. We assume that the primary harmful factor is hypocapnia (decrease in pCO2) and respiratory alkalosis (increase in pH) due to hyperventilation, permanent or in response to stress. Inside mitochondria, the pH signal of high pH/low bicarbonate ion (HCO−3) is transmitted by soluble adenyl cyclase (sAC) through cAMP dependent manner. The process can initiate brain lesions (necrosis, apoptosis, hypervascularity) in OXPHOS deficient cells residing at the LS area of the brain. The major message of the article is that it is not the ATP depletion but intracellular alkalization (and/or hyperoxia?) which seem to be the cause of LS. The paper includes suggestions concerning the methodology for further research on the LS mechanism and for therapeutic strategy."

abstract = "HLA-G is a nonclassical HLA immunotolerogenic molecule expressed in different human cell types. Successful embryo implantation is a consequence of information exchange between the uterus and the blastocyst. It is widely accepted that HLA-G expression by the fetus promotes the establishment of several mechanisms that, ultimately, would protect the developing embryo from maternal immune rejection and seems to be essential to both an adequate implantation and a healthy pregnancy. MicroRNAs miR-148a and miR-152 down-regulate HLA-G expression. The levels of both microRNAs in the placenta are very low. Although various contraceptive methods are available in the market, several of the most popular are based on hormone administration, an approach that have been causing concerns regarding their adverse effects. This scenario has led the research and development of new contraceptive methods meant to induce low disturbances in women body. Based on this context, we hypothesize that the delivery of miR-148a and miR-152 microRNAs, carried by liposomes, into the uterus, would locally induce a down-regulation of the immunotolerogenic HLA-G molecule. In this sense, a local concentration increase of both miR-148a and miR-152 would counteract HLA-G expression and therefore prevent pregnancy development, being a potential tool for the development of a new contraceptive therapy."

This study examined whether hypnosis may alter the pattern and time evolution of maternal and fetal stress. Here we report a 23-yrs-old primigravida woman at 31-weeks’ gestation who underwent daily sessions of hypnosis during one week. An A (baseline)-B (intervention) – A′ (return to baseline) design was used. Each study phase lasted one week. The State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) was completed daily. Uterine contractions as well as maternal and fetal heart rate were recorded over 24-h periods in each of the study phase. Uterine contractions and maternal systolic blood pressure showed clear reductions during the hypnosis phase. In addition, a statistically significant declining trend in anxiety scores was observed during the hypnosis phase, and anxiety re-increased in the return-to-baseline phase (p<0.05). Coefficient of variation of maternal heart rate was found to be considerably lower during the hypnosis phase. Our results suggest that a short-lived hypnosis intervention (combined with standard care) holds sufficient promise for antenatal stress relief to justify testing its efficacy in larger groups of pregnant women."

The forecasts suggest a suffering of more than half a billion worldwide by 2030. Amid all diabetic complications, diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) has attracted much scientific investigations to lead to a better management of this disease. In this paper, a system thinking methodology is adopted to investigate the dynamic nature of the ulceration. The causal loop diagram as a tool is utilized to illustrate the well-researched relations and interrelations between causes of the DFU. The result of clustering causality evaluation suggests a vicious loop that relates external trauma to callus. Consequently a hypothesis is presented which localizes development of foot ulceration considering distribution of normal and shear stress. It specifies that normal and tangential forces, as the main representatives of external trauma, play the most important role in foot ulceration. The evaluation of this hypothesis suggests the significance of the information related to both normal and shear stress for managing DFU. The results also discusses how these two react on different locations on foot such as metatarsal head, heel and hallux. The findings of this study can facilitate tackling the complexity of DFU problem and looking for constructive mitigation measures. Moreover they lead to developing a more promising methodology for managing DFU including better prognosis, designing prosthesis and insoles for DFU and patient caring recommendations."

To investigate the “probable” causal link, information on individual chronobiology is needed to specify exposures to circadian disruption associated with shift work. In epidemiological studies this information is usually assessed by questionnaire. The most widely used Morningness-Eveningness-Questionnaire (MEQ) and MunichChronoTypeQuestionnaire (MCTQ) reveal information on circadian type (MEQ) and actual sleep behaviour (MCTQ). As a further option we suggest to obtain preferred sleep times by using what we call the perfect day (PD) approach. We hypothesize that a PD – as a day of completely preferred sleep behaviour – captures pristine internal time. We argue that the PD approach may measure internal time more accurately than the MEQ and MCTQ which convey influences by work and social time pressures. The PD approach may therefore reduce misclassifications of internal time and reveal circadian disruption caused by different shift systems."

Preeclampsia is known to be of placental origin and a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Our earlier studies suggest that altered metabolism of folic acid, vitamin B12 and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFAs) in the one carbon cycle increases homocysteine levels in preeclampsia. Recent reports indicate that vitamin D deficiency may also have a role in preeclampsia, although the mechanisms are unclear. A disturbed one carbon cycle can influence methylation patterns of various genes involved in placental development. Altered expression of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) gene can result in hyperhomocystenemia. Higher homocysteine levels are known to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production which in turn leads to increased expression of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Higher expression of PLA2 and COX-2 can influence the release of arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipid and result in increased conversion to thromboxane. Vitamin D [1,25(OH)2D3] is known to induce the CBS gene expression while it can suppress the oxidative stress-induced COX-2 up-regulation and thromboxane production. Based on this, we propose a novel hypothesis that a disturbed vitamin D and LCPUFA metabolism influence the regulation of the one carbon cycle which will trigger inflammation through oxidative stress in preeclampsia. This may lead to altered feto-placental growth and development in preeclampsia."

Depleted uranium (DU) is one of them directly pertinent to the military and civilians working in militarized areas. It is considered a weak carcinogen but its implication in cancer development in exposed individuals is supported by various data. Since not all subjects exposed to DU develop cancer, it is likely that DU-dependent carcinogenesis requires cofactors, such as genetic predisposition and deficiencies of the chaperoning and immune systems. It is of the essence to adopt every possible protective measure as well as performing careful screening for early diagnosis to protect the military that work in war areas in which weapons with DU are, or have been, used. These topics are discussed here, along with a proposed working hypothesis for investigating the pathophysiology of DU-related carcinogenesis, including the possible role of the chaperoning system."

It is proposed that these three events must unfold simultaneously because stopping any critical event also stops ferroptosis. These events are hypothesized to amplify in severity through positive feedback loops. The cause of death in ferroptosis is therefore the synergistic combination of antioxidant depletion, iron toxicity, and membrane denaturation. The relevance of these feedback loops for cancer and neurodegenerative therapies is discussed."

Here we propose a hypothesis that the mechanism of brain oedema and death is actually osmotic brain oedema caused by selective diffusion of glycine into the brain while sodium cannot diffuse out of the brain despite favourable concentration gradient because of the absence of sodium transporter on the cerebral capillaries needed for the exit of sodium from the brain. The mechanism for unidirectional diffusion of solutes into the brain in glycine-associated hyponatremia is explained."

This could cause a shortfall in its normal production, leading to a variety of adverse consequences. It might partially explain the pathogenesis of acute mountain sickness, a treatable disease characterized by severe hyperventilation secondary to the hypoxia of high altitude exposure. Milder degrees of hyperventilation due to different forms of stress may produce other conditions which share characteristics with acute mountain sickness. One of these may be the fibromyalgia syndrome, a chronic painful disorder for which no satisfactory treatment exists. Should fibromyalgia and acute mountain sickness have a common etiology, may they also share a common form of treatment? Evidence is presented to support this hypothesis."

This means that many caregivers struggle to manage this problem on a daily basis. This paper presents a hypothesis about the neuronal mechanisms underlying insomnia in patients with autism spectrum disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder based on recent clinical and basic research. It is proposed that three neuronal mechanisms (increased orexinergic system activity, reduced 5-hydroxytryptamine and melatonergic system activity, rapid eye movement sleep reduction) are involved in insomnia in both autism spectrum disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This suggests that antagonists against the orexin receptors may have beneficial effects on insomnia in patients with autism spectrum disorders or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. To the best of the author’s knowledge there has been no research into the effects of this agent on insomnia in these patient groups. Large, controlled trials should be carried out."

abstract = "In type 1 diabetics, hepatic exposure to insulin is chronically subnormal even in the context of insulin therapy; as a result, expression of glycolytic enzymes is decreased, and that of gluconeogenic enzymes is enhanced, resulting in a physiologically inappropriate elevation of hepatic glucose output. Subnormal expression of glucokinase (GK) is of particular importance in this regard. Possible strategies for correcting this perturbation of hepatic enzyme expression include administration of small molecule allosteric activators of GK, as well as a procedure known as chronic intermittent intravenous insulin therapy (CIIIT); however, side effects accompany the use of GK activators, and CIIIT is time and labor intensive. Alternatively, administration of high-dose biotin has potential for modulating hepatic enzyme expression in a favorable way. Studies in rodents and in cultured hepatocytes demonstrate that, in the context of low insulin exposure, supra-physiological levels of biotin induce increased expression of GK while suppressing that of the key gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. These effects may be a downstream consequence of the fact that biotin down-regulates mRNA expression of FOXO1; insulin’s antagonism of the activity of this transcription factor is largely responsible for its modulatory impact on hepatic glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Hence, high-dose biotin may compensate for subnormal insulin exposure by suppressing FOXO1 levels. High-dose biotin also has the potential to oppose hepatic steatosis by down-regulating SREBP-1 expression. Two pilot trials of high-dose biotin (16 or 2mg per day) in type 1 diabetics have yielded promising results. There is also some reason to suspect that high-dose biotin could aid control of diabetic neuropathy and nephropathy via its stimulatory effect on cGMP production. Owing to the safety, good tolerance, moderate expense, and current availability of high-dose biotin, this strategy merits more extensive evaluation in type 1 diabetes."

The definite reason of heart valve injury during RHD is poorly understood. Valvular endothelial cells play an important role in pathogenesis of different cardiovascular diseases. Besides, the regulation of vitamin D (calciferol) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) results in the functional changes in endothelial cells. However, the crosstalk between vitamin D and VEGF in the pathogenesis of RHD is not yet unfurled. Evidences in the concerned fields are documented by searching through Google Scholar and Pubmed. Literature based survey has revealed that vascular endothelium, especially endothelial cells play important roles in valvular remodelling during cardiovascular diseases. Endothelial cell dysfunction leads to heart valve remodelling, which furthermore initiates the pathogenesis of valvular heart disease. Vitamin D has the potential to maintain the concentration of VEGF in the circulation and induce the function of endothelial cells. Hence, we hypothesize that vitamin D and VEGF homeostasis can alter the function of endothelial cells, which may subsequently trigger the valvular remodelling or even damage of heart valves during the progression of RHD pathogenesis. Our hypothesis shed light on the evidence based knowledge translation of plausible cellular phenomena due to vitamin D/VEGF homeostasis during valvular vandalism in RHD."

Although inheritance dominates the less frequent early-onset AD in young and middle-aged individuals, environmental and immunogenetic factors have been identified in the most frequently occurring late-onset AD of higher-aged individuals, comprising 90% of AD patients. Thorough investigations have detected a prevalence of certain microbes which are known to affect brain activities in the brains of AD patients. This microbial prevalence suggests failing immune responses by immune gene variants against specific microbes. In fact, some immune gene variants have been detected significantly more often in AD patients. Failing immune responses can be corrected by activating immune cells outside the body (“in vitro”) for the subsequent therapeutical injections. Activated immune cells digest and present microbial peptides better and differentiate naïve/resting immune cells to powerful effector cells, which can be used for therapy. The patient’s activated immune cells can pass the blood–brain barrier and overcome chronic infections in the brain. Furthermore, activated immune cells can secrete a series of neurotrophins for the restoration of neuronal circuits. Based on the encouraging results of immunotherapy in a patient with late-onset AD, we hypothesize that therapy with the patient’s activated immune cells would safely benefit many AD patients."

Some entities even prefer a particular location or depth within the same tissue (ex. anterior, intermediate or posterior uveitides, chorioretinitides with unique topographic presentations). Though the location of a lesion strongly influences and helps us in our differential diagnosis, we still don’t understand why specific anatomic sites are susceptible to a disease while other areas are spared. We postulate that regional variability in tissue protein expression can sway the immune system’s capacity to trigger an autoimmune response. In addition to this site-specific quantitative and qualitative variability in potential antigen expression, we believe that other proteins implicated in the immune cascade, as well as geographic areas of relative resistance, tolerance and susceptibility, may be unequally distributed within the orbit. To illustrate our hypotheses, we review three major types of ocular myositis and describe how the extraocular muscles different embryologic origins and protein disparities might explain the fundamental clinical differences between these orbital inflammatory diseases. We hope that future differential genomics, proteinomics, epigenomics and analysis of RNA species of affected tissues, compared to their non-affected, yet microscopically similar, counterparts, will help us understand why diseases occur where they do. Hopefully, understanding these immune triggers will pave the way to new treatment options for ocular inflammatory diseases and for other auto-inflammatory conditions with a marked predilection for any given site."

Moreover, additional research has revealed that the levels of some protein makers of exosomes are up-regulated in aged retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and that drusen and oxidative stress may promote the secretion of exosomes derived from RPE cells. Consequently, we hypothesize that RPE cell-derived exosomes may be relevant to CNV in wet AMD. If this hypothesis is proven correct, future studies based on this link may also help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of wet AMD and to find new therapeutic targets for the treatment of AMD."

abstract = "Seasonal affective disorder is defined as recurrent episodes of major depression, mania, or hypomania with seasonal onset and remission. In this class of mood disturbances, a unipolar major depressive disorder known as winter depression is common in populations living in northern latitudes far from the equator. Winter depression repeatedly occurs in the autumn or winter and remits in the spring or summer, and its etiopathogenesis is currently unknown. However, one can surmise that excessive melatonin production during the reduced duration of daily sunlight in the autumn and winter plays a role in its pathophysiology. Melatonin is synthesized from tryptophan within the pineal gland, which is located outside the blood-brain barrier, and overproduction of melatonin may lead to augmented consumption of tryptophan, from which serotonin is synthesized. As tryptophan is captured from the blood and excessively utilized by the pineal gland, tryptophan blood levels may decline; as such, it is more difficult for tryptophan to pass through the blood-brain barrier and reach the serotonergic neurons as the ratio of tryptophan to the other amino acids that compete for the same transporter to enter the brain is diminished. As such, less tryptophan is available for serotonin synthesis. Moreover, melatonin is known to modulate thyrotropin expression in the thyrotrophic cells of the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland, and overproduction of melatonin in the autumn or winter months may cause excessive signaling in the pars tuberalis, diminishing its release of thyrotropin and resulting in central hypothyroidism. Both conditions reduced serotonin production and central hypothyroidism may cause depression. Furthermore, the excessive synthesis of melatonin during the autumn and winter may negatively affect the expression of neuromedin U in the pars tuberalis, causing an increased appetite, which is common in winter depression patients. The hypersomnia common in winter depressive patients can be ascribed to excessive circulating melatonin, a hormone that increases the propensity for sleep. Furthermore, central hypothyroidism may also increase sleepiness, as it is known that hypothyroid patients usually experience excessive somnolence. In this theoretical article, we also propose studies to evaluate winter depression patients with regard to the necessity, or not, of offering them an increased amount of tryptophan in their diets during the autumn and winter. We also suggest that the administration of triiodothyronine to winter depressive patients may mitigate their central hypothyroidism."

It is a complex multi-layer system which determines the absorption of nutrients, water and many other substances. The integrity and permeability of the GBB may be impaired in numerous diseases including gastrointestinal, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Here, we propose that the evaluation of the GBB permeability may have a significant diagnostic potential in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

Traditional treatments (sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones) of diabetes are associated with weight gain, except metformin. Newer agents such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are causing a modest weight reduction, whereas dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) are weight neutral. Oxyntomodulin, a native GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonist produced a superior weight loss and antihyperglycemic effects in obese mice and humans. Recent findings with synthetic dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonists have shown a good weight loss and antihyperglycemic profile in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Targeting combinations of GLP-1 receptor and glucagon receptor simultaneously with a single peptide may be the better strategy to achieve marked weight loss and considerable glycemic control in diabesity. Cardiovascular safety is very important with new antidiabetic agents due to rosiglitazone controversy. Current on-going clinical trials will clarify the cardiovascular effects of incretin-based therapies in near future. Based on current knowledge and rapid progress in the field, there is a strong possibility that the GLP-1/glucagon receptor co-agonists will likely be the new therapeutic treatment for diabesity for decades to come."

At the time incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in Southern France was among the lowest in Europe and was much higher in Northern Ireland. Plasma lutein is a biomarker of vegetable and fruit intake and evidence suggests that high concentrations are generally associated with better cardiometabolic health. At the time we speculated like others that role of the carotenoids may well have been to prevent oxidation of lipid in the lipoproteins and so reduce the uptake of oxidised lipid by macrophages and its deposition within the intimal layers of the major arteries as plaque. It is now widely accepted that CHD is an inflammatory disease and that macrophages within plaque together with tissue damage contribute to this inflammation. Stimulated macrophages release cytokines to activate the immune system both locally and systemically. Precursor complement proteins in the blood are activated to assist immune cells in phagocytosis and cell repair. Individuals with a history of arteriosclerosis display significantly higher concentrations of complement factors C3 and C3a than subjects without such a history. Metabolism of C3 via the alternate complement pathway can give rise to the membrane attack complex (MAC) which creates a hole or pore in pathogens or host cells, killing the cell. Recent studies in patients with early age related macular disease (AMD) who also exhibit similar elevated concentrations of complement proteins in their blood, showed supplementation with lutein progressively decreased the amount of the MAC and other complement factors in the blood. Lutein was used in the supplementation experiments because it is an important constituent of macular pigment. Thus the healthier cardiometabolic features displayed by the people in Toulouse may have been due to the effects of concurrent high concentrations of plasma lutein on the immune system and complement in particular. Other carotenoids may exert similar antioxidant effects but we and others found no differences in antioxidant nutrients between subjects in Toulouse and Belfast or between subjects with asymptomatic markers of atherosclerosis and controls."

Considering human evolution, frontal brain regions are well known for their changes in dimensions and connections. Less known is that parietal and temporal lobes encountered similar changes. These areas, especially in the right hemisphere, are crucial for body representation. Our hypothesis is that evolution of these areas determined a more varied and widespread cross wiring between the temporal and parietal lobes, increasing their communication pathways and their reciprocal influence. As such, these connections could lead to an increased probability of interconnected body and emotional disorders in humans. The prediction of this hypothesis is that all body representation disorders have an associated emotional component and vice versa. Evidence supporting the interconnection between emotional and body representation disorders derives from psychiatric diseases such as eating disorders. This hypothesis opens up new directions to understand body representation and points towards innovative solutions for the clinical treatments of body representation/emotional impairments."

abstract = "Blood oxidative stress (BLOS) is the presence of white blood cells and platelets that are generating high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A mathematical model links the level of BLOS or BLOS# and plasma sulfide concentration. An increase in the BLOS# reduces the plasma sulfide concentration. The reported maximum plasma sulfide concentration for defined health conditions were used to calculate the minimum BLOS#. Elevated BLOS generates high plasma concentration of ROS, which triggers multiple responses in the body that protect the host. First, insulin production by the pancreas is inhibited, which results in elevated blood glucose levels. This results in advanced glycation end products (AGE), which thicken the blood vessel wall. Elevated blood glucose levels also increases urination, which reduces the availability of substrates for infectious bacteria. Second, one or more signaling molecules are stimulated to produce vascular hypertrophy resulting in hypertension. Third, the initial stage of atherosclerosis thickens the blood vessel wall while also protecting the inner surface of the blood vessels from localized infection. The first three mechanisms provide added protection against pathogen migration through the blood vessel wall and reduce the cross-sectional area of blood vessels, which increases the retention time (RT) for improved ROS inactivation of pathogens. Fourth, genes expressed in the liver, which are associated with drug oxidation and uptake transport, are inhibited. This inhibition protects the host from any toxins produced by an anaerobic infection. Elevated BLOS also reduces plasma sulfide concentration, which inhibits wound healing and extends aerobic conditions of the wound. The normal induction of BLOS offers a short-term, cascade of several primary mechanisms for secondary defense against anaerobic infection of a wound. Normal induction of BLOS is due to ultra-exogenous sulfide formation (USF) generated by a local anaerobic infection of a wound in the natural environment. The presence of BLOS without infection is indicative of inadvertent dietary induction. Long-term dietary BLOS results in many severe inflammatory diseases and cancers that are common in an ageing population. Glands were identified as more susceptible to cancers caused by long-term dietary BLOS. Variable BLOS levels in patients of clinical trials may also be reducing effectiveness of experimental drugs and causing drug toxicity. If BLOS is confirmed as a secondary defense against infection that is inadvertently triggered by diet, then a large number of common health problems may be treated and managed by apheresis and dietary changes."

One of the interesting associations is the epidemiologic similarity with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, in addition, at least some of these diseases also correlated inversely with lactase non persistent population (LNP) distributions. It is hypothesized that MS should also have an inverse relationship with LNP. We provide support for this by comparing published MS, CD, UC and LNP national rates to the beginning of the new millennium. Possible links among these diseases may be an evolutionary signature of new genes which may have accompanied emergence of lactase persistence millennia ago. The emergent phenotypic dichotomy also forced different assimilation responses to lactose digestion. While intestinal retention of lactase results in direct host enzymatic digestion, in LNP persons intestinal bacterial metabolism of lactose impacts on the host micro-flora. These microbial changes may play some role in altering rates of diseases including IBD and MS. However, since the late 20th century previously observed patterns are changing. Although industrialization is considered to play an important modifying role, the rising rates of obesity with an emphasis on diet, and microfloral pathogenesis, but with an independent geographic pattern may also facilitate altering rates and geographic distributions of both of these and other diseases."

Our hypothesis proposes a structural mechanism responsible for altering blood flow in the covering epithelium and leading to marked reduction of vascularization in the foci of dysplasia. This mechanism varies from one type of epithelium to another. In squamous epithelium only basal cells are in direct contact with stromal vessels. To supply nutrients to the rest of the cells located at different levels, the subjacent stroma forms excrescences which penetrate upward together with blood capillaries. As soon as precancerous dysplastic alterations start and progress the number of intraepithelial blood vessels simultaneously decreases, thus leading to ischemia which precedes or promotes malignization of the covering squamous epithelium. To compensate for the deficit in blood supply, the dysplastic cells penetrate deeper into the underlying stroma, commencing invasion. Thus, the cells destroy the subjacent stroma not because they are initially “malignant”, but due to ischemia which provokes the search for nutrients. Comparing squamous epithelium with glandular respiratory epithelium shows that the latter contains no blood capillaries at all. However, unlike squamous epithelial coverings, in respiratory epithelial covering, each cell is attached directly to the basal membrane and has ample access to the blood supply. Covering respiratory epithelium itself seldom gives rise directly to malignant growth. Cancerization of this type of epithelium occurs in the foci of squamous metaplasia. The latter are not supplied by a sufficient amount of blood vessels and in the majority of cases remain fragile and vulnerable structures, easily prone to malignization. Further study of these phenomenon should include the clarification of the influence of carcinogenic agents on the mechanism of adequate vascularization at the precancerous stage."

abstract = "Osteoarthritis is a ubiquitous condition, affecting 26 million Americans each year, with up to 17% of adults over age 75 suffering from one variation of arthritis. The hip is one of the most commonly affected joints and while there are conservative options for treatment, as symptoms progress, many patients eventually turn to surgery to manage their pain and dysfunction. Early surgical options such as osteotomy or arthroscopy are reserved for younger, more active patients with less severe disease and symptoms. Total hip arthroplasty offers a viable solution for patients with severe degenerative changes; however, post-surgical discrepancies in leg length, offset and component malposition are common and cause significant complications. Such discrepancies are associated with consequences such as low back pain, neurological deficits, instability and overall patient dissatisfaction. Current methods for managing leg length and offset during hip arthroplasty are either inaccurate and susceptible to error or are cumbersome, expensive and lengthen surgical time. There is currently no viable option that provides accurate, real-time data to surgeons regarding leg length, offset and cup position in a cost-effective manner. As such, we hypothesize that a procedural gap exists in hip arthroplasty, a gap into which fall a large majority of arthroplasty patients who are at increased risk of complications following surgery. These complications and associated treatments place significant stress on the healthcare system. The costs associated with addressing leg length and offset discrepancies can be minor, requiring only heel lifts and short-term rehabilitation, but can also be substantial, with revision hip arthroplasty costs of up to $54,000 per procedure. The need for a cost-effective, simple to use and unobtrusive technology to address this procedural gap in hip arthroplasty and improve patient outcomes is of increasing importance. Given the aging of the population, the projected increases in the volume of procedures over the coming decades and the economic pressures associated with downward pricing pressure and bundled payments, the need to address this gap is underscored."

The dura mater beneath ossified ligamentum flavum may also ossify when the spinal stenosis develops to a certain degree. Preoperative diagnosis of dural ossification (DO) is beneficial for surgical management of OLF. However, currently, accurate diagnosis method still could not be obtained. Based on the association between spinal stenosis and OLF/DO, a potential diagnosis method is proposed in this paper: identifying DO by measuring the degree of spinal stenosis in thoracic OLF. In the early stage of OLF, there is only mild spinal stenosis and no DO. With the progression of OLF, dura may also ossify and further compress the spinal cord, aggravating spinal stenosis. Before DO, the dura mater is presented as a low signal intensity. Once ossifying, the dura mater will be shown as a high signal intensity in CT. It will lead that the degree of spinal stenosis measured in axial CT scan obviously increases. Thus, it provides a possibility to find a critical value of it for distinguishing OLF patients with or without DO."

This interpretation would solve the inconsistencies encountered in explaining the effects of GcMAF in vitro and in vivo. According to our model, the Gc protein or the GcMAF bind to chondroitin sulfate both on the cell surface and in bodily fluids, and the resulting multimolecular complexes, under the form of oligomers trigger a transmembrane signal or, alternatively, are internalized and convey the signal directly to the nucleus thus eliciting the diverse biological effects observed for both GcMAF and chondroitin sulfate."

This theory also helps us in predicting early, which child will resolve spontaneously and which child will need surgery. The methodology to evaluate hypothesis along with techniques and tools are also suggested."

Cathepsin K, expressed predominantly in osteoclasts, can degrade type I collagen and plays an essential role in bone resorption. Recent studies reported the expression of Cathepsin K in various malignant tumors, such as bone, breast, lung and prostate cancers, and its expression is further increased in bone metastasis or invasive subpopulations. In addition, cathepsin K inhibitors (CatKi) were demonstrated to effectively prevent or reduce osteolytic lesions in breast cancers with bone metastasis. In comparable to bone metastasis of breast carcinomas, pituitary adenomas with sphenoid sinus or clivus invasion lead to osteolytic lesions. However, the role of Cathepsin K in sphenoid sinus or clivus invasion of pituitary adenomas has not been identified. Therefore, we presume that Cathepsin K may have a great importance in sphenoid sinus or clivus invasion and CatKi are promising potential therapy for the suppression or prevention of sphenoid sinus or clivus invasion of pituitary adenomas."

The numerical evaluation of these pattern-based notions by another, more placid system of ANNs governs the magnitude of weight disturbances administered to the former assembly, that perturbative intensity in turn controlling the novelty of the resulting ideational stream as well as the retention of newly formed concepts. In search of solution patterns to posed problems, such collaborating neural systems autonomously cycle between two extremes in mean synaptic perturbation level. The higher limit, characterized by chaos and inattentiveness to exogenous input patterns, is the regime in which ideas first form and incubate. The lower bound, marked by relative synaptic tranquility, is favorable to the reactivation and reinforcement of concepts first seeded during heightened perturbation. When considering this synthetic neural architecture as a cognitive model, the proposed source of such synaptic fluctuations is volume neurotransmitter release within cortex where both ideational and critic nets are commingled. As a result of their overlap, not only are the generative cortical networks suffused with neurotransmitters, but also those functioning in a critic role, leading to altered ‘opinions’ about the perturbation-driven stream of consciousness that then govern the injection of neurotransmitters into cortex. The likely effect of such chemical feedback is that the brain constantly cycles between states of idea generating chaos and perception stabilizing tranquility in much the same way that creative artificial neural systems do. Postulating that ideas are potentially useful or interesting false memories born within such turmoil, creativity appears to take place through a cyclic process consisting of alternating phases of (1) cognitive incapacitation, during which confabulatory notions incubate, and (2) synaptic calm when these incubated thoughts reemerge and reinforce themselves as they are then recognized for their value by a lucid perceptual apparatus. Extremes in such cycling, especially within the former dysfunctional phase, would be problematic from a mental health perspective. Whereas the literature is replete with findings linking creativity and various psychopathologies, the main hypothesis advanced herein is that the neurodynamics of both phenomena are the same. If vindicated, this theory may lead to advanced treatments that could potentially boost creativity as well as safeguard against the associated cognitive and psychological disorders, all through control of just one parameter, the difference between cortical concentrations of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters."

Yet, additional stiffness indices such as the augmentation index (AIx), reflection magnitude (RM) and changes in augmentation pressure (AP) have not been studied adequately to facilitate and improve our knowledge regarding the ways that EVAR affects central hemodynamics. In this article it is suggested that the implantation of an aortic stent-graft exerts its immediate effects not only by interposing extra stiffness on the infrarenal segment but by also modifying the pulse wave reflection site and changing the aortic flow field without necessarily causing significant alterations in PWV. Hence, further studies on myocardial performance in large patient populations are expected to delineate the precise influence of different designs of EVAR endografts on the cardiovascular hemodynamic which, in turn, can affect the morbidity and survival of these patients."

Neonatal jaundice is a frequent co-morbidity in sickle cell disease. Phototherapy induces isomerization of bilirubin rendering it extractable through urine and hence it is used as a routine treatment of neonatal jaundice. An exposure to light phototherapy as a treatment of neonatal jaundice induces oxidative stress. It is hypothesized that such exposure of neonates with sickle cell disease to the blue light phototherapy as a treatment of neonatal jaundice induces severe oxidative stress and increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. This hypothesis is supported with two case studies of sickle cell disease suffering neonates who were exposed to blue light phototherapy to treat jaundice. In both these cases, exposure to phototherapy induced oxidative stress (increased lipid peroxidation and superoxide dismutase, slight change in activity of catalase and GSH) and elevated the levels of proinflammatory cytokine (TNFα, IL-1, and IL-6) in the sickle cell disease suffering neonates. These observations warrant further investigations to determine the consequences and clinical significance of the blue phototherapy-induced oxidative and proinflammatory stress in Sickle cell disease suffering neonates exposed to phototherapy as a treatment of jaundice."

abstract = "The addition of phosphate groups is an essential requirement for the proper functioning of cyclin and cyclin dependent kinase which control various stages in the mitotic division of cancer cells. Thus limiting the availability of phosphate is likely to interfere with the metabolism of rapidly growing malignant cells. The human hormone glucagon and the anti metabolite mithramycin reduce serum phosphate by increasing phosphaturia and are both very effective in treating Paget’s disease of bone, a precancerous condition. In this disorder large doses of glucagon given intravenously relieve bone pain and cause serum phosphate and alkaline phosphatase as well as urine hydroxyproline to fall, indicating a marked reduction in bone turnover. A constant iv infusion of glucagon was given to each of three patients all of whom had secondary malignant bone deposits. Two of the patients had primary prostate cancer and one had a squamous cell lung tumour. All three patients had relief of bone pain and a fall in serum alkaline phosphatase. Serum acid phosphatase also fell in the two patients with prostate cancer. It is proposed that the marked drop in serum phosphate due to glucagon causes intracellular phosphate to fall. This in turn disrupts the addition and removal of phosphate groups essential for the proper functioning of cyclin and cyclin dependent kinase. These two proteins control the transition from G1 to S (DNA synthesis phase) and G2 to M (mitotic phase) in the dividing cycle of malignant cells. Depriving a tumour of an essential ingredient used in phosphorylation reactions will disrupt its growth. It is also proposed that, by the same mechanism, glucagon induced hypophosphataemia renders malignant cells more sensitive to established chemotherapeutic agents and radiation waves. If this hypothesis proves to be correct, lowering intracellular phosphate may become an useful tool in cancer therapy. However extensive studies are necessary to determine whether mitosis in cancer cells can be advantageously disrupted by glucagon induced hypophosphataemia."

It is not registered as drug in some countries and therefore its medical use there is illegal, while in others it is often among the top 10 of the best-selling medications. It could be also found in the list of the “most useless drugs” and was banned for short time by World Anti-Doping Agency as performance enhancer. However, the degree of its usefulness or uselessness remains unclear and there is not enough convincing data to make reliable conclusions. HPCH is claimed to have wound/muscular injuries healing, neuroprotective and antioxidant properties, to enhance glucose uptake and oxygen consumption, and possibly to improve performance of athletes. Since HPCH consists of over 200 naturally occurring substances which potentially may exert some pharmacological effects, it is extremely difficult to perform pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamical studies. In this paper we have analyzed the available literature concerning clinical evidence, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo effects of HPCH. Based on these data we suggest that the main target of the drug may be endothelium and improvement of endothelial function may be responsible for numerous largely nonspecific effects. We also propose the improvement of protein quality control by the means of activation of ubiquitin-proteasomal system as the most important biochemical mechanism responsible for its effects. The role of sphingolipids as potential proteasome-activators is extensively discussed. The effects of HPCH may also include direct or indirect ones on NF-kB-, Nrf2- and FOXO-mediated regulation of metabolic processes in the cells, which result in improved protein quality control, enhanced energy metabolism and increased resistance to oxidative stress."

Vitamin D blood levels of 60–80ng/ml promote normal sleep. The present study was undertaken to explore why this beneficial effect waned after 2years as arthritic pain increased. Pantothenic acid becomes coenzyme A, a cofactor necessary for cortisol and acetylcholine production. 1950s experiments suggested a connection between pantothenic acid deficiency, autoimmune arthritis and insomnia. The B vitamins have been shown to have an intestinal bacterial source and a food source, suggesting that the normal intestinal microbiome may have always been the primary source of B vitamins. Review of the scientific literature shows that pantothenic acid does not have a natural food source, it is supplied by the normal intestinal bacteria. In order to test the hypothesis that vitamin D replacement slowly induced a secondary pantothenic acid deficiency, B100 (100mg of all B vitamins except 100mcg of B12 and biotin and 400mcg of folate) was added to vitamin D supplementation.
Methods
Vitamin D and B100 were recommended to over 1000 neurology patients. Sleep characteristics, pain levels, neurologic symptoms, and bowel complaints were recorded by the author at routine appointments.
Results
Three months of vitamin D plus B100 resulted in improved sleep, reduced pain and unexpected resolution of bowel symptoms. These results suggest that the combination of vitamin D plus B100 creates an intestinal environment that favors the return of the four specific species, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria that make up the normal human microbiome.
Hypotheses
1) Seasonal fluctuations in vitamin D levels have normally produced changes in the intestinal microbiome that promoted weight gain in winter. Years of vitamin D deficiency, however, results in a permanently altered intestinal environment that no longer favors the “healthy foursome”. 2) Humans have always had a commensal relationship with their intestinal microbiome. We supplied them vitamin D, they supplied us B vitamins. 3) The four species that make up the normal microbiome are also commensal, each excretes at least one B vitamin that the other three need but cannot make. 4) Improved sleep and more cellular repairs eventually depletes body stores of pantothenic acid, causing reduced cortisol production, increased arthritic pain and widespread “pro-inflammatory” effects on the immune system. 5) Pantothenic acid deficiency also decreases available acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter used by the parasympathetic nervous system. Unopposed, increased sympathetic tone then produces hypertension, tachycardia, atrial arrhythmias and a “hyper-adrenergic” state known to predispose to heart disease and stroke."

Here, we propose a role for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling in the biological changes that occur with urbanization and suggest a critical area of convergence in GPCR signaling might provide a molecular signature for exposure to environmental factors. As a first step in investing this hypothesis, we examined the expression of the G protein α, β and γ subunit, G protein related kinase, and β-arrestin genes in a rural and urban population living in Morocco (NCBI GSE8847). Three genes associated with the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway (GNAQ, GNA11 and GNA15), and one gene controlling the cyclic adenosine monophosphate pathway (GNAI2) was altered by urbanization. Of note, the expression of ARRB1 gene, which encodes the β-arrestin 1 protein and dampens the cellular responses to extracellular signals, was greater in the rural compared to the urban population (P<0.00002). These preliminary findings support our hypothesis that urbanization fundamentally alters GPCR signaling, resulting in both a qualitative and quantitative change in the signaling process. Because GPCR signaling is involved in a broad spectrum of cellular functions, further research is needed confirm these preliminary findings and to investigate what role GPCRs might have in the biological changes that occur with urbanization."

It states, that the probability of the leading number d (d∈{1,…,9}) in many natural datasets follows: P (d)=log10 (d+1)−log10 (d)=log10 (1+1/d). It was successfully used through tax authorities and “forensic accounting” in order to detect fraud and other irregularities. Benfords law was almost neglected for its use outside financial accounting. The planning for health care systems in developing countries is extremely dependant on good, valid data. Whether you plan the catchment area for the future district hospitals, the number of health posts, the staff establishment for the central hospital or the drug budget in the Ministry. The “first digit law” can be used in medicine, public health, physiology and development aid to unmask questionable data, to discover unexpected challenges, difficulties in the data collection process, loss through corruption and criminal fraud. Our hypothesis suggests, that the “first digit law” is a cost effective tool, which is easy to use for most people in the medical profession, which does not really needs complicated statistical software and can be used on the spot, even in the resource restricted conditions of developing countries. Several preconditions (like the size of the data set and its reach over more than two dimensions) have to be fulfilled, but then Benfords law can be used by any clinician, physiologist, public health specialist or aid consultant without difficulties and without deeper statistical knowledge in the four steps, we suggest in this article. The consequences will be different depending on the level (local regional, national, continental, international) on which you will use the law. All levels will be enabled to get insight into the validity of the data-challenges for the other levels without the help of trained statisticians or accountants. We believe that the “first digit law” is a vastly underestimated and neglected, but extremely useful tool for the identification of unexpected challenges, supervision and control in various parts of medicine and public health for almost all aspects of development aid."

abstract = "A large body of data suggests that body weight influences puberty onset and adult reproduction. However, the underlying mechanism of how body weight influences puberty onset and fertility is not completely understood. The hypothalamic neuronal circuit regulating reproduction is restrained by inhibitory signals during childhood. At the time of puberty, these inhibitory signals are weakened and supplanted by stimulatory signals that, in turn, stimulate the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) – a hypothalamic neuropeptide governing reproduction. A number of studies, however, suggest that puberty commencement occurs when body (fat) weight reaches a certain threshold, which is critical for the initiation of puberty and for support of the adult reproductive function. Previously, various signals have been studied which might link body (fat) weight-related information to the hypothalamic neuronal network regulating reproduction. However, the nature of the signal(s) that may link body fat and/or muscle mass with the hypothalamic neuronal network governing reproduction is still unclear. It has been intuitively speculated that augmentation of such signal(s) will cause a restriction of inhibitory input and activation of stimulatory input to GnRH secreting neurons at the time of puberty onset. Therefore, the unveiling of such signal(s) will greatly help in understanding the mechanism of puberty onset. Recently, it has been shown that expression of fibronectin type III domain containing-5 (FNDC5) mRNA in central and peripheral tissues upsurges during postnatal development, especially around the time of puberty onset. Moreover, the systemic level of irisin – one of the protein products of the FNDC5 gene that is secreted as myokine and adipokine – also rises during postnatal development and correlates with the timing of puberty onset. Therefore, we propose here that irisin might serve as a possible signal for linking body fat/muscle mass with the hypothalamic center governing reproductive function. We hypothesize that irisin acts as a trigger for the activation of the hypothalamic neuronal network monitoring the onset of puberty."

abstract = "Obesity and metabolic syndromes are major threats to health in both developed and developing countries. This opinion article is a holistic attempt to understand the obesity epidemic, by connecting it to the widespread narcissism in society. The narcissism epidemic refers to an increased prevalence of status-striving individualism and a decreased sense of community, observed in Westerns populations and spreading worldwide. Based on social personality and evolutionary psychology approaches, I speculate that this rise of narcissism underlies a steep social hierarchy resulting in increase of social stress. This social stress markedly affects individuals who are sensitive to social hierarchy dominance due to their personality, yet are relegated at a lower social position. I speculate that over-eating is one major mechanism for coping with this stress, and discuss the possibility that visceral fat may constitute an adaptive behaviour to the lower social hierarchy position, which is perceived as unjust. Connecting the prevalence of obesity to the narcissism epidemic allows for a more thorough examination of factors, which contribute to obesity, which includes early difficult childhood experience, lower rank, and the overall competitive framework of the society."

The transfer of testosterone into memory and the mode of consolidation and storage of that memory are discussed.

Cardiac dysautonomia has been found in diseases where other branches of the autonomous nervous system are damaged, as Parkinson disease and multiple system atrophy. In this perspective, an impaired HRV not only is a risk factor for sudden cardiac death mediated by arrhythmias, but also a potential biomarker for monitoring a progressive decline of the autonomous nervous system. This slope may lead to an acute imbalance of the regulatory pathways of vital functions after seizure and then to SUDEP."

abstract = "The role of the physiological processes involved in human vision escapes clarification in current literature. Many unanswered questions about vision include: 1) whether there is more to lateral inhibition than previously proposed, 2) the role of the discs in rods and cones, 3) how inverted images on the retina are converted to erect images for visual perception, 4) what portion of the image formed on the retina is actually processed in the brain, 5) the reason we have an after-image with antagonistic colors, and 6) how we remember space. This theoretical article attempts to clarify some of the physiological processes involved with human vision. The global integration of visual information is conceptual; therefore, we include illustrations to present our theory. Universally, the eyeball is 2.4cm and works together with membrane potential, correspondingly representing the retinal layers, photoreceptors, and cortex. Images formed within the photoreceptors must first be converted into chemical signals on the photoreceptors’ individual discs and the signals at each disc are transduced from light photons into electrical signals. We contend that the discs code the electrical signals into accurate distances and are shown in our figures. The pre-existing oscillations among the various cortices including the striate and parietal cortex, and the retina work in unison to create an infrastructure of visual space that functionally “places” the objects within this “neural” space. The horizontal layers integrate all discs accurately to create a retina that is pre-coded for distance. Our theory suggests image inversion never takes place on the retina, but rather images fall onto the retina as compressed and coiled, then amplified through lateral inhibition through intensification and amplification on the OFF-center cones. The intensified and amplified images are decompressed and expanded in the brain, which become the images we perceive as external vision.
Summary
This is a theoretical article presenting a novel hypothesis about the physiological processes in vision, and expounds upon the visual aspect of two of our previously published articles, “A unified 3D default space consciousness model combining neurological and physiological processes that underlie conscious experience”, and “Functional representation of vision within the mind: A visual consciousness model based in 3D default space.” Currently, neuroscience teaches that visual images are initially inverted on the retina, processed in the brain, and then conscious perception of vision happens in the visual cortex. Here, we propose that inversion of visual images never takes place because images enter the retina as coiled and compressed graded potentials that are intensified and amplified in OFF-center photoreceptors. Once they reach the brain, they are decompressed and expanded to the original size of the image, which is perceived by the brain as the external image. We adduce that pre-existing oscillations (alpha, beta, and gamma) among the various cortices in the brain (including the striate and parietal cortex) and the retina, work together in unison to create an infrastructure of visual space thatfunctionally “places” the objects within a “neural” space. These fast oscillations “bring” the faculties of the cortical activity to the retina, creating the infrastructure of the space within the eye where visual information can be immediately recognized by the brain. By this we mean that the visual (striate) cortex synchronizes the information with the photoreceptors in the retina, and the brain instantaneously receives the already processed visual image, thereby relinquishing the eye from being required to send the information to the brain to be interpreted before it can rise to consciousness. The visual system is a heavily studied area of neuroscience yet very little is known about how vision occurs. We believe that our novel hypothesis provides new insights into how vision becomes part of consciousness, helps to reconcile various previously proposed models, and further elucidates current questions in vision based on our unified 3D default space model. Illustrations are provided to aid in explaining our theory."

These standard matrices are not enough to monitor the outcome and progression of AKI. The prognosis prevents proper treatment and timely delay in providing putative therapeutic agents. The cost effective therapies to get delayed, patient health gets compromised and ultimately requires renal transplant due to end-stage renal disease, which is another major problematic factor due to shortage kidney donors. To establish effective therapies for AKI the need will be facilitated by developing and identifying reliable, sensitive biomarkers which can be detected early during all stages of AKI, even during preclinical and clinical studies. Although reaching to human clinical trials takes years of thorough evaluations, preliminary studies should be carried out effectively by: (a) Employing cell culture analysis, (b) use of AKI animal models, studying various gene regulated networks, and biomarkers, and (c) patient serum sampling and testing. As elevated phenylalanine are indicative of AKI onset within 4h, its levels is controlled, 4a-Hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin dehydratase/dimerization cofactor of HNF-1 (DCoH). There is a possibility of targeting DCoH to the current bedside list of biomarkers involved in AKI onset."

Ageing is associated with consistent impairments in cognitive processes (e.g., processing speed, memory, executive function and learning) important for work, well-being, life satisfaction and overall participation in society. Recently, there has been increased effort to conduct research examining methods to improve cognitive function in older citizens. Cognitive training has been shown to improve performance in some cognitive domains; including memory, processing speed, executive function and attention in older adults. These cognitive changes are thought to be related to improvements in brain connectivity and neural circuitry. Bacopa monnieri has also been shown to improve specific domains of cognition, sensitive to age associated cognitive decline (particularly processing speed and memory). These Bacopa monnieri dependent improvements may be due to the increase in specific neuro-molecular mechanisms implicated in the enhancement of neural connections in the brain (i.e. synaptogenesis). In particular, a number of animal studies have shown Bacopa monnieri consumption upregulates calcium dependent kinases in the synapse and post-synaptic cell, crucial for strengthening and growing connections between neurons. These effects have been shown to occur in areas important for cognitive processes, such as the hippocampus. As Bacopa monnieri has shown neuro-molecular mechanisms that encourage synaptogenesis, while cognitive training enhances brain connectivity, Bacopa monnieri supplementation could theoretically enhance and strengthen synaptic changes acquired through cognitive training. Therefore, the current paper hypothesises that the combination of these two interventions could improve cognitive outcomes, over and above the effects of administrating these interventions independently, as an effective treatment to ameliorate age associated cognitive decline."

Human and animal studies demonstrate atrophy and ultrastructural alteration of diaphragmatic muscular fibers attributable to increased oxidative stress, depression of the anabolic pathway regulated by Insulin-like growing factor 1 and increased proteolysis. The renin-angiotensin system, through its main peptide Angiotensin II, plays a major role in skeletal muscle diseases, mainly increasing oxidative stress and inducing insulin resistance, atrophy and fibrosis. Conversely, its counter-regulatory peptide Angiotensin (1–7) has a protective role in these processes. Recent data on rodent models show that renin-angiotensin system is activated after mechanical ventilation and that infusion of Angiotensin II induces diaphragmatic skeletal muscle atrophy. Given: (A) common pathways shared by ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction and skeletal muscle pathology induced by renin-angiotensin system, (B) evidences of an involvement of renin-angiotensin system in diaphragm atrophy and dysfunction, we hypothesize that renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction, while Angiotensin (1–7) can have a protective effect on this pathological process. The activation of renin-angiotensin system in ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction can be demonstrated by quantification of its main components in the diaphragm of ventilated humans or animals. The infusion of Angiotensin (1–7) in an established rodent model of ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction can be used to test its potential protective role, that can be further confirmed with the infusion of Angiotensin (1–7) antagonists like A-779. Verifying this hypothesis can help in understanding the processes involved in ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction pathophysiology and open new possibilities for its prevention and treatment."

In addition, we believe that a low release of exosomes can be more beneficial for the DC-IT response than a high release of exosomes. Our data reinforce the concept that exosomes can act as an immune regulatory tool, however not in a generalized manner, but in a highly precise way. Our hypothesis is based in preliminary experimental data, thus, it should be tested using experimental and functional strategies involving a great number of patients. Once the hypothesis confirmed, the immunomodulatory role of the exosomes during DC-IT must be considered as an important factor in the (I) evaluation, (II) modulation, and (III) success of DC-IT against HIV."

The analytical approach here is based on the hypothesis that the skin thermal shock during a WBC session can be thermally modelled by the sum of both radiative and free convective heat transfer functions. The validation of this scientific approach and the derivation of temporal evolution thermal laws, both on skin temperature and dissipated thermal power during the thermal shock open many avenues of large scale studies with the aim of proposing individualized cryotherapy protocols as well as protocols intended for target populations.

Abundant PLTP is considered to be expressed on the foam cells derived from monocyte/macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques, suggesting that high level of active PLTP may promote the formation of foam cells. However, the exact role of PLTP on the process of macrophage derived foam cell formation remains unclear. The accumulation of free cholesterol (FC) in the cytoplasm may lead to the prolonged endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERs) and the imbalance of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. Different PLTP level definitely alternates the phospholipids (PL) and cholesterol level in plasma, strongly suggesting that active PLTP may change the level of FC and PL intracellularly, which subsequently induced the ERs in macrophage. Thus, we hypothesize that high level of PLTP may promote the accumulation of cholesterol in macrophage via the alteration ratio of FC to PL. Therefore, validating this hypothesis may clarify the role of PLTP in macrophage ERs in AS and also raise a novel strategy in the regression of AS plaques via restoring intracellular membrane lipid homeostasis and attenuating ERs."

There is growing observational and experimental evidence that regular exposure to sunlight contributes to the prevention of colon-, breast-, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, hypertension and diabetes. Initially, these beneficial effects were ascribed to vitamin D. Recently it became evident that immunomodulation, the formation of nitric oxide, melatonin, serotonin, and the effect of (sun)light on circadian clocks, are involved as well. In Europe (above 50 degrees north latitude), the risk of skin cancer (particularly melanoma) is mainly caused by an intermittent pattern of exposure, while regular exposure confers a relatively low risk. The available data on the negative and positive effects of sun exposure are discussed. Considering these data we hypothesize that regular sun exposure benefits health."

In the last decades, the regulation and contribution of microRNAs in tumorigenesis including breast cancers have been well-documented. Thus, here it is hypothesized that by identifying the microRNAs responsible for chemoresistance in TNBC and targeting the microRNAs along with chemotherapeutic approaches might exert an improved response. To accomplish this, an in vivo screening has to be performed by transfecting tumor cell line with lentiviral pool of library expressing microRNAs. Following treatment of primary tumors in mice and growth of relapsed tumors, microRNA profile has to be analyzed by qRT-PCR and sequencing to detect the microRNAs contributing to the chemoresistance which can be targeted by anti-microRNA strategies."

abstract = "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a complex multifactorial and polygenetic disease in which the interaction of numerous genes, genetic variants, and environmental factors plays a major role in its development. In an attempt to demonstrate the association between certain genetic variants and CVD, researchers have run large genomic wild association studies (GWAS) in recent decades. These studies have correlated several genomic variants with the presence of CVD. Recently, certain polymorphisms in the phosphatase and actin regulator 1 (PHACTR1) gene have been shown to be associated with CVD (i.e., coronary artery disease, coronary artery calcification, early onset myocardial infarction, cervical artery dissection and hypertension) in different ethnic groups. It is important to state that all of the described PHACTR1 genetic variants associated with CVD are located in non-translating gene regions known as introns. Thus, the purpose of this article is to hypothesize the effect of certain intronic polymorphisms in the PHACTR1 gene on pathological processes in the cardiovascular system. In addition, we present compelling evidence that supports this hypothesis as well as a methodology that could be used to assess the allelic effect using in vitro and in vivo models, which will ultimately demonstrate the pathophysiological contribution of PHACTR1 intronic polymorphisms to the development of CVD."

Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induces hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) in M1 or HIF-2α in M2 polarized macrophages. HIF-1α promotes neoangiogenesis while HIF-2α facilitates morphogenic normalization of neovasculature. Melanoma exosomes induce GM-CSF expression by endothelial cells in vitro and HIF-1α expression in pre-metastatic lymph nodes in vivo. This suggest a relationship between melanoma exosome induced endothelial GM-CSF and macrophage mediated angiogenesis in lymph nodes. Theoretically, induction of endothelial cell derived GM-CSF by melanoma exosomes mediates different angiogenic functions in pre-metastatic lymph nodes depending on subcapsular sinus (SCS) macrophage polarity. To explore this hypothesis, experiments utilizing melanoma exosomes in a lymph node model are outlined. Despite their opposing immune functions, indirect melanoma exosome stimulation of M1 or M2 SCS macrophages via endothelial derived GM-CSF in lymph nodes may induce different although complementary pro-tumor angiogenic processes."

The mechanisms of this phenomenon are not quite understood and have been explained by inflammation, stress, etc. In particular the epidemic of obesity, with more than 64% of women being overweight or obese, has been associated with conditions in later life such as mental disorders, diabetes, asthma, and irritable bowel syndrome. Interestingly, these diseases were classified a decade ago as Clinical Syndrome of Endocannabinoid Deficiency (CECD), which was first described by Russo in 2004. Cannabinoids have been used for the treatment of chronic pain for millenniums and act through the mechanism of “kick-starting” the components of the endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS). ECS is a pharmacological target for the treatment of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular and neuronal damage, and pain. We hypothesize that the deteriorating effect of maternal obesity on offspring health is explained by the mechanism of Fetal Syndrome of Endocannabinoid Deficiency (FSECD), which accompanies maternal obesity. Here we provide support for this hypothesis."

With various new modalities available to prolong life span in this group of patients, the effect is distant from optimum. Prevalent strategy of treating postmenopausal HR+ HER2− MBC is application of chemotherapy (CT) after progression of disease on endocrine therapy (ET) of several lines. Generally, ET targets HR+ ingredients and CT works better with HR− tumor cells. HR+ MBC, though hormone-sensitive, has HR− portion which reacts poorly to ET. Thus, sequential use of ET and CT neglects its insensitive part and gives rise to drug resistance, while alleviation of tumor burden is the top priority in metastatic setting. Chemohormonal therapy (i.e. concomitant use of ET and chemotherapy) complements for the shortcoming of current therapy strategy targeting both HR+ and HR− ingredients theoretically. Fulvestrant, a pure estrogen receptor antagonist and down-regulator, could be a promising agent using concurrently with CT based on chemosensitizing character shown in preclinical and pilot clinical studies. It is hypothesized in this article that chemohormonal therapy with concurrent fulvestrant and CT would be a promising strategy in postmenopausal HR+ HER2− MBC patients. Proof of this hypothesis would help control evolvement of tumor burden and acquirement of drug resistance over a short period of time."

Man has same fundamental needs to live as animals but modern man’s life-style compels him to acquire certainty of resources for all his needs in a complex social network. Today money has become the sole life essential need. Contrarily none of the animals needs to earn money. Brain is also an organ of the human body with a unique thought process to define logical actions to achieve a person’s goals. This way life is a flow of desires followed by logical actions. The person struggles to attain desired goals via the allostatic load but a perceived insurmountable threat can make his flow of life stalled to freeze him. Published data from varied branches of medical science indicates role of hormones in overall homeostasis. Particularly multifaceted role of serotonin is well documented. Adrenalin being the primary mediator of Cori cycle is also well known. From the integration of observations from published data with reference to common human’s modern lifestyle, it is hypothesized that a perceived trapped situation in life creates acute chaos of thoughts in brain, which results in acute excess of stress hormones and concurrent depletion of resting hormones, which in turn triggers MS. In global terms, MS indicates an acute imbalance of a few hormones and implies psychosomatic roots of the disorder. This may pave a better way in deciding a personalized holistic protocol with combination of counter regulatory psychoactive medications."

More than 20years ago it was demonstrated that cervical spinal cord stimulation could engender an increase in cerebral blood flow. Cerebral blood flow has been shown to be decreased in many patients with dementia and in various neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Furthermore, there is evidence that reduced cerebral blood flow worsens neurodegenerative disease and may also predict which patients progress from mild cognitive impairment to full blown Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, the identification of decreased cerebral blood flow in patients with early cognitive problems may offer clinicians a window of opportunity to intervene and prevent further brain damage. Further evidence that supports augmenting cerebral blood flow as an effective strategy for preventing and treating cognitive brain dysfunction comes from experimental studies with omental transposition. The author proposes cervical spinal cord stimulation as a titratable, programmable extracranial neuromodulation technique to increase cerebral blood flow for the purposes of improving cognitive function and preventing cognitive deterioration in patients with dementias and neurodegenerative disorders."

abstract = "Keloids and hypertrophic scars are fibroproliferative disorders (FPDs) of the skin that result from abnormal healing of injured or irritated skin. They can be called pathological or inflammatory scars. Common causes are trauma, burn, surgery, vaccination, skin piercing, folliculitis, acne, and herpes zoster infection. The pathogenesis of these scars clearly involves local conditions such as delayed wound healing, wound depth, and the tension of the skin around the scars. Scar severity is also shaped by interactions between these local factors and genetic and systemic factors such as hypertension and sex hormones. Notably, to evaluate scar severity, the Japan Scar Workshop (JSW) has established the JSW Scar Scale. Our studies show that tension on the skin around the wound results in prolonged and/or repeated bouts of inflammation in the reticular layer of the dermis and that this inflammation generates abnormal numbers of blood vessels (as well as collagen and nerve fibers) in the dermal reticular layer. We hypothesize that local factors, such as the mechanobiology of the dermis and blood vessels, along with genetic and systemic factors promote pathological scar development by inducing endothelial dysfunction (i.e., vascular hyperpermeability) during the inflammatory stage of wound healing. The continued presence of these factors prolongs the influx of inflammatory cells and factors, thereby leading to fibroblast dysfunction. Evidence for this hypothesis includes the fact that all effective treatments of keloids, namely, radiotherapy, compression therapy, steroid administration, and long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser therapy, act, at least partly, by suppressing blood vessels. At present, keloids are classified as strongly inflammatory scars, while hypertrophic scars are considered to be mildly inflammatory scars. However, we propose that keloids and hypertrophic scars are simply manifestations of the same skin FPD and differ only in the degree of endothelial dysfunction and therefore inflammation. We therefore suggest that these pathological scars should be classified on the basis of the factor that causes the endothelial dysfunction. Thus, primary scars are caused by congenital endothelial dysfunction (e.g., a mutation prevents endothelial gaps from closing smoothly) while secondary scars are caused by endothelial dysfunction that results from aging, arterial sclerosis, and/or repeated/very strong local mechanical forces. We expect that primary keloids develop at younger ages and tend to become severe, while secondary keloids are seen in all ages and can vary in clinical severity. Thus, abnormal blood vessel regulation may underlie keloid and hypertrophic scar pathogenesis, which suggests that inhibiting abnormal angiogenesis and vascular hyperpermeability may be an important therapeutic approach."

The gasotransmitters hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and nitric oxide are mutually dependent on each other for their angiogenesis-related functions. Pregnancy-related requirements for increased endogenous H2S could create a temporary excess of sulfite, an H2S catabolite, which is toxic and can induce nausea. Sulfite oxidase, a molybdenum-containing enzyme, catalyzes oxidation of sulfite to sulfate, which can then be excreted or reused by the body. Supplementation with molybdenum should facilitate enhanced sulfite oxidase activity, thus lowering gestationally-elevated sulfite levels in the gastrointestinal tract and easing NVP."

Clinical and biologic characteristics that are independently prognostic of outcome in NB are currently used for risk stratification to optimally the therapy. It includes age at diagnosis, International Neuroblastoma Staging System tumor histopathology and MYCN amplification. However, even in patients with theoretically good prognosis, such as localized tumor and non-amplified MYCN, either disease progress or recurrence may occur. Potential genetic determinants of this unfavorable behavior are not yet fully clarified. The presence of elevated expression of AHCY, PKMYT1, and BLM has accompanied poor prognosis MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma patients. Considering the potential implication of these genes on the clinical management of NB, we hypothesize that the identification of genetic variations may have significant impact during development of the recurrent or progressive disease. Using targeted DNA sequencing, we analyzed the mutation profiles of the genes PKMYT1, AHCY, and BLM in tumor samples of five patients with MYCN amplified and 15 MYCN non-amplified NB. In our study, BLM germline variants were detected in two patients with MYCN-non-amplified neuroblastoma. Our data allow us to hypothesize that, regardless of MYCN status, these mutations partially abolish BLM protein activity by impairing its ATPase and helicase activities. BLM mutations are also clinically relevant because BLM plays an important role in DNA damage repair and the maintenance of genomic integrity. We also found a novel variant in our cohort, PKMYT1 mutation localized in the C-terminal domain with effect unknown on NB. We hypothesize that this variant may affect the catalytic activity of PKMYT1 in NB, specifically when CDK1 is complexed to cyclins. The prognostic value of this mutation must be further investigated. Another mutation identified was a nonsynonymous variant in AHCY. This variant may be related to the slow progression of the disease, even in more aggressive cases. It affects the maintenance of the catalytic capacity of AHCY, leading to the consequent functional effects observed in the NB patients studied. In conclusion, our hypothesis may provide that mutations in BLM, AHCY and PKMYT1 genes found in children with MYCN-amplified or MYCN-non amplified neuroblastomas, may be associated with the prognosis of the disease."

abstract = "Secondary headache is one of the most common side effect during oral contraceptive (OC) treatment and it leads many patients to stop the therapy. Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is an interatrial communication that spontaneously closes at birth in about 75% of the population. However, in the rest of adults PFO maintains a direct communication between the right and left side of circulation. In these patients PFO is a tunnel-like structure that could allow a blood clot to pass from the right to the left side of circulation, thus can cause paradoxical embolization. Although an increased frequency of PFO in patients with migraine was already reported, the relationship between PFO and migraine remains uncertain. In patients with migraine, the prevalence of moderate or large PFO is 35% and seems not associated with the presence of aura or the frequency of headache. Basing on these assumptions, we hypothesize that asymptomatic PFO could play a role in secondary headache due to OC. The procoagulant effect of OC improves the production of microemboli that through the POF could pass from the right to the left atrium and than to the brain, where they could be responsible of secondary headache. If our hypothesis would be confirmed in future studies, it would be possible to identify high-risk patients for developing OC-induced headache and other cerebrovascular major diseases through transcranial Doppler and transesophageal echocardiography. This scenario may radically change the management of reproductive-age woman who have to undergo OC therapy for contraception or other medical conditions."

In 2009, Goldstein and colleagues tentatively speculated that the greed, impulsiveness, and lack of foresight that lead to the worldwide economic collapse in 2007–2008 could have been caused (in part) by depressed population cholesterol levels resulting from the widespread use of statins by workers in the financial services industry.

Recent studies suggest that infants who develop dysbiosis may be at risk for lifelong adverse health consequences. Exposure to opioid drugs during pregnancy is a factor of potential importance for microbiome health that has not yet been investigated. Since these infants are born after an entire gestation exposed to mu opioid receptor agonists and have severe gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, we hypothesize that these infants are at risk for dysbiosis. We speculate that opioid exposure during gestation and development of NAS at birth may lead to a dysbiotic gut microbiome, which may impair normal microbiome succession and development, and impact future health of these children."

abstract = "Eccentric exercise training is effective for increasing muscle mass and strength, and improving insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profiles. However, potential muscle damage symptoms such as prolonged loss of muscle function and delayed onset of muscle soreness may restrict the use of eccentric exercise, especially in clinical populations. Therefore, strategies to reduce eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) are necessary, and an extensive number of scientific studies have tried to identify potential intervention modalities to perform eccentric exercises without adverse effects. The present paper is based on a narrative review of current literature, and provides a novel hypothesis by which an ischemic preconditioning (IPC) of the extremities may reduce EIMD. IPC consists of an intermittent application of short-time non-lethal ischemia to an extremity (e.g. using a tourniquet) followed by reperfusion and was discovered in clinical settings in an attempt to minimize inflammatory responses induced by ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion-injury (I/R-Injury) during surgery. The present hypothesis is based on morphological and biochemical similarities in the pathophysiology of skeletal muscle damage during clinical surgery and EIMD. Even though the primary origin of stress differs between I/R-Injury and EIMD, subsequent cellular alterations characterized by an intracellular accumulation of Ca2+, an increased production of reactive oxygen species or increased apoptotic signaling are essential elements for both. Moreover, the incipient immune response appears to be similar in I/R-Injury and EIMD, which is indicated by an infiltration of leukocytes into the damaged soft-tissue. Thus far, IPC is considered as a potential intervention strategy in the area of cardiovascular or orthopedic surgery and provides significant impact on soft-tissue protection and downregulation of undesired excessive inflammation induced by I/R-Injury. Based on the known major impact of IPC on skeletal muscle physiology and immunology, the present paper aims to illustrate the potential protective effects of IPC on EIMD by discussing possible underlying mechanisms."

abstract = "Neutrophils are the first cells to achieve the sites of infection or inflammation in the lungs. The massive accumulation of these cells is associated with acute and chronic lung injury. Therefore, they have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many lung diseases through the release of reactive oxygen intermediates, proteolytic enzymes and Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs). The excessive and continuous release of NETs, fibers composed by decondensed chromatin coated with neutrophil proteins, are associated to the impairment of lung function in different pathological settings. Flavonoids inhibit the respiratory burst of neutrophils in mammals. However, one of these flavonoids, resveratrol has a particular chemical property. It reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) form with concomitant formation of reactive oxygen species, which can produce DNA breakage as reported in several in vitro models. We hypothesize that direct resveratrol administration in lungs can cleave DNA in NETs, improving lung function during acute airway infections or chronic inflammatory lung diseases. If the hypothesis is correct, the control of NET formation can be used to reduce the inflammatory environment in lung after neutrophil stimuli. Additionally, the production of proinflammatory cytokines by neutrophils could be also diminished by resveratrol administration. In this sense, this flavonoid provides a multifaceted opportunity for treatment of lung diseases with strong or chronic neutrophil activation."

Although it can be cured with internal urethrotomy easily, post-surgery stricture recurrence is challenging. Several adjuvant therapies have been used in conjunction with internal urethrotomy but none of them are used routinely because the pathophysiology of the disease is still obscure. Fibrosis is the most accused hypothesis for the action. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous blood product containing a high concentration of platelets that is being used for a very wide range of clinical healing applications. It comprises a concentration of fundamental protein growth factors shown to be actively excreted by platelets to initiate accurate wound healing. Although PRP can play a critical role in wound healing and has been used in fibrotic diseases successfully, it has some deleterious cytokines such as transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1) which can also cause fibrosis. The new hypothesis is that the subcutaneous injection of neutralized platelet-rich plasma with TGFβ1 antibody at the planned urethrotomy site may prevent recurrence and provide superior healing and long-term results."

First line treatment of mRCC includes drugs such as sunitinib, temsirolimus and pazopanib, with overall survival now reaching up to 43,6months in patients with favorable-risk metastatic disease. Several side-effects in mRCC treatment, such as hypothyroidism, can be used as positive prognostic factors and indicate good response to therapy. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia independent of hypothyroidism are reported as side-effects in temsirolimus treatment and recently in sunitinib treatment, but the exact mechanism and significance of the changes remains elusive. Most likely, metabolic changes are caused by inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a positive target of tumor growth suppression, but also a regulator of iron homeostasis. There are no clinical studies reporting changes in iron and ferritin levels during mRCC biotherapy, but we hypothesize that inhibition of mTOR will also affect iron and ferritin levels. If both lipid and iron changes correlate, there is a high possibility that both changes are primarily caused by mTOR inhibition and the level of change should correlate with the inhibition of mTOR pathway and hence the efficacy of targeted treatment. We lastly hypothesize that mRCC biotherapy causes hypercholesterolemia with a possibly improved cholesterol profile due to increase HDL/LDL ratio, so statins might not have a role as supplementary treatment, whereas a sharp rise in triglyceride levels seems to be the primary target for additional therapy."

Key medical management options are directed towards controlling plasma calcium and phosphate concentrations (e.g. parathormone inhibition, phosphate binders, dialysis), enhancing the effect of calcification inhibitors (e.g. fetuin-A, pyrophosphate, vitamin K, osteopontin, matrix Gla protein) and decreasing the effect of promoters of calcification (e.g. vitamin D, lipids, cytokines). Dietary phytate prevents the calcification of ageing in rats and epidemiological data suggest that phytate rich diets are associated with a lower incidence of CVC in the elderly. Intravenous phytate prevents aggressive CVC induced by vitamin D in rats. We propose that phytate should be added to the list of inhibitors of vascular calcification. We further suggest that adequate dietary phytate could prevent mild forms of calcification and that the low phytate content of diets for patients with renal disease can contribute to the increased risk of vascular calcification. It is also our contention that supra-physiological systemic phytate concentrations not achievable orally, might prevent aggressive vascular calcification. Appropriate epidemiological (to determine nutritional value) and clinical studies (evaluating safety and efficacy) are required to confirm, modify or reject our hypothesis."

These molecules are expressed on the surface of dysfunctional endothelial cells, causing inflammatory cells from the circulation to adhere and migrate through the endothelium. Their expression is upregulated in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The contact between stent struts and endothelium upregulates endothelial cell gene expression, endothelial cell activation and inflammation. The paclitaxel or sirolimus eluting stents inhibited expression of adhesion molecules in several studies and reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) after drug-eluting stent (DES) over bare metal stent (BMS) implantation. Therefore, we propose that elevated serum levels of the soluble adhesion molecules after primary PCI in patients treated with BMS or DES implantation versus drug-coated balloon (DCB) application to the vulnerable coronary plaque might be a predictor of MACE and further adverse outcomes. Consequently, DCB-only strategy in patients with ACS might be a superior approach in comparison to BMS implantation and non-inferior approach when compared to DES implantation."

Early detection of lung, colon, and ovary cancer has been reported by the use of Partial Wave Microscopy Spectroscopy (PWS) and has been explained in terms of the field cancerization effect. Until now, field cancerization has been studied as a field effect and we hypothesize that it can be understood as an amplifying effect of biochemical abnormalities in cells, which leads us to ask the question: Could field cancerization be interpreted as a biochemical anomaly amplification due to transformed cells? We propose this question because the biochemical changes due to field cancerization alter the dynamics of molecules and cells in abnormal tissues in comparison to normal ones, these alterations modify the interaction of intracellular and extracellular medium, as well as cellular movement. We hypothesize that field cancerization when interpreted as an amplification effect can be used for the early detection of cancer by measuring the change of cell dynamics."

Despite the strong correlative data demonstrating the protective role of bilirubin, the mechanism by which bilirubin can protect against these pathologies remains unknown. Bilirubin has long been known as a powerful antioxidant and also has anti-inflammatory actions, each of which may contribute to the protection afforded by increased levels. We have recently described a novel function of bilirubin as a ligand for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα), which we show specifically binds to the nuclear receptor. Bilirubin may function as a selective PPAR modulator (SPPARM) to control lipid accumulation and blood glucose. However, it is not known to what degree bilirubin activation of PPARα is responsible for the protection afforded to reduce hepatic steatosis. We hypothesize that bilirubin, acting as a novel SPPARM, increases hepatic fatty acid metabolism through a PPARα-dependent mechanism which reduces hepatic lipid accumulation and protects against hepatic steatosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)."

Conceivably, CSD could trigger a somatosensory pathway-induced disinhibition of dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) activity in the auditory pathway; furthermore, CSD can cause inner ear blood impairment induced by vertebral arteries hemodynamic alterations and trigeminal irritation. In genetically -predisposed CSD patients with reduced serotoninergic tone, signals from chronically stimulated DCNs could activate specific cortical neuronal networks and plastic neural changes resulting in tinnitus. Therefore, an early specific tailored CSD treatments and/or boosting serotoninergic activity may be required to prevent the creation of ‘tinnitus memory circuits’ in CSD patients."

An increase in the recruitment of leukocytes and production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and oxidative stress are generated by this shift. In periodontitis, an exacerbated, poorly specific and effective inflammatory response is mounted. Moreover, failure in the inflammation resolving mechanism leads to establishment of a chronic inflammatory process, resulting in the progressive destruction of bone and soft tissue. In different diseases presenting chronic inflammation some important players of immune response are defectives. Thus, an immunosuppressive environment could be induced during chronic inflammation. Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), a heterogenic group of immature myeloid cells with potent immune suppressive activity, are increased in several acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Dysbiosis-mediated inflammation can induce increased frequency of MDSC. In addition, mediators generated in diverse inflammatory diseases have demonstrated to promote expansion, activation and recruitment of MDSC, similar mediators have been described in periodontal disease. MDSC promote generation of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, MDSC can differentiate in functional osteoclasts. We hypothesize that MDSC are generated during periodontal disease. Review of literature evaluating this hypothesis and possible implications are assed in this work. It encourages the study of MDSC in this common disease."

This is because some cancers have been found to be associated with longer telomeres in circulating white cells whilst other cancer types are more common in individuals with shorter telomeres. Hence, there has been some skepticism as to whether telomere length may be helpful in estimating cancer risk. For melanoma, however, results have been fairly consistent showing that longer telomeres are associated with an increased risk. This link was first discovered because of a link between longer telomeres and a high number of naevi. In contrast, for cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, the relationship is reversed with higher risk in individuals with shorter telomeres. Differences in skin phenotypes with the presence of high number of naevi versus photoageing with solar elastosis and solar keratoses have already been valuable for dermatologists as the former phenotype is associated with melanoma whilst the latter is more common in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. The hypothesis is that the differences in cutaneous phenotypes already observed by dermatologists for skin cancers may, in fact, be useful as well for cancer prediction in general as it may reflect underlying telomere biology. This manuscript will address the evidence for links between telomere biology, skin phenotypes and cancer risk."

Therefore here we present a hypothesis: whether the presence of Demodex mites in eyelash hair follicles significantly correlates with the presence of pterygia, which could point to a potential role of these mites in the development of such lesions. We present preliminary data for supporting this hypothesis. These results were collected from a group of 69 subjects, including 39 with pterygium. Subjects were studied for the presence of Demodex folliculorum and/or D. brevis within eyelash follicles. The sample was defined as positive if at least one parasite, larva or egg were present. Preliminary statistical analyses were performed, and indicated a significant relationship between Demodex mite infestation and the presence of pterygium (p<0.05). This suggests that demodicosis could be one of the factors causing pterygium and significantly contribute to its development. Subjects who had both pterygium and Demodex infestation formed a dominant group. The proportion of subjects with both pterygia and Demodex presence is high at 93.33%, while the proportion of subjects without pterygia who have mites is low at 20.51%. Aforementioned results support our working hypothesis that infestation with Demodex mites may result in pterygium development and therefore patients diagnosed with pterygium should be assessed for the presence of Demodex to verify our preliminary results. In the present paper, we discuss potential influence of Demodex on conjunctiva and propose a hypothetical pathological mechanism linking the development of pterygia with demodicosis."

abstract = "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises a group of neurodevelopmental disorders for which various theories have been proposed. Each theory brings valuable insights and has experimental evidence backing it, yet none provides an overarching explanation for each of the pathological aspects involved in ASD. Here we present an integrative theory of ASD, centered on a sequence of events spanning from the molecular to the behavioral level. We propose that an abnormality in the interplay between retinoic acid and sex hormones predisposes an individual to specific molecular malfunctions. In turn, this molecular syndrome generates an altered brain connectivity between the cerebellum, the midbrain dopaminergic areas, and the prefrontal cortex. Lastly, this disconnection would generate specific behavioral traits traditionally involved in ASD. Therefore, this paper represents a step forward in unifying different levels of pathological features into novel integrated testable hypotheses."

A large number of studies have shown beneficial effects of ESW in promoting fracture healing by inducing bone regeneration; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. ESW has been shown to induce the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is essential for gap junction intercellular communication in response to mechanical stress. Among the 19 known gap junction subunits, connexin43 (Cx43) is the most prevalent for mediating the response of mechanical stress. However, to our knowledge, the effect of ESW on Cx43 expression has not been reported before. Herein, we propose that a crosstalk between PGE2 and Cx43 is involved in the enhancement of osteogenesis induced by ESW. We review the currently available data to propose an unrevealed, but important mechanism via which ESW treatment affects osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells."

abstract = "Multiple lines of evidence suggest the hypothesis that high dose thyroid therapy corrects for cellular hypothyroidism found in bipolar disorders. Evidence indicates that bipolar disorders are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction which results in low cellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) levels. Transport of thyroid hormones into cells is energy intensive and dependent on ATP except in the pituitary gland. Inadequate ATP levels makes it difficult to get thyroid hormone into cells leading to cellular hypothyroidism. This creates a condition where the blood and pituitary levels of thyroid hormone are normal but low in other tissues. High dose thyroid therapy produces a gradient that is sufficient for thyroid hormone to diffuse into cells correcting cellular hypothyroidism. If this hypothesis is correct there are number of implications. The two most important are: On average patients suffering from a bipolar disorder die 10–20years earlier than the general population. The medical sequelae associated with bipolar disorders cause far more deaths than suicide. If high dose thyroid corrects for cellular hypothyroidism it could well decrease the medical morbidity and mortality associated with bipolar disorders that are the result of cellular hypothyroidism. Thus high dose thyroid would be a first treatment that decreases the considerable medical morbidity and mortality associated with the bipolar disorders. This would stand in stark contrast to most psychiatric medications that can that increase morbidity and mortality. It would also reinforce the safety of HDT. The second implication is thyroid hormone blood levels in patients suffering from a bipolar disorder do not accurately reflect the true thyroid status."

We propose that in earlier stages of the continuum of DM2-related metabolic disorders, a group of susceptible patients who do not yet meet the diagnostic criteria to be considered as persons with DM2 may present chronic vascular impairment and end organ damage, including hair follicle damage, which can be evaluated to identify an early risk marker. This hypothesis is based in the association found between insulin resistance and alopecia in non-diabetic persons, and the hair loss on the lower limbs as a manifestation of long-term peripheral arterial disease among subjects with DM2. In order to test this hypothesis, studies are required to evaluate if hair follicle characteristics are related to and can predict hyperglycemic complications, and if they do so, which feature of the hair follicle, such as hair growth, best characterizes such DM2-related conditions. If this hypothesis were proven to be true, significant advances towards a personalized approach for early prevention strategies and management of DM2 would be made. By focusing on the hair follicles, early stages of metabolic-related organ damage could be identified using non-invasive low-cost techniques. In so doing, this approach could provide early identification of DM2-susceptible individuals and lead to the early initiation of adequate primary prevention strategies to reduce or avoid the onset of large internal organ damage."

Although the use of immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma has shown promising results, there remains a lack of predictive biomarkers indicating treatment benefit from immunotherapy. There is growing evidence suggesting that microsatellite instability (MSI) as a product of DNA mismatch repair deficiency, may be one of possible predictive markers in malignant melanoma. It has been proposed that the immunogenicity of some tumors might be determined by mutational heterogeneity and could be the key to the success of immune therapies. This is also supported by the fact that tumors with the highest amount of somatic mutations, such as malignant melanoma have showed positive results with immune checkpoint inhibitors. There are promising data regarding the association between MSI status and immunogenicity from studies with colorectal cancer, where MSI is linked to improved prognosis compared to microsatellite stable cancers. MSI in colon cancer is linked to a significant increase of immunocompetent cells responsible for the antitumor activity – CD3+, CD8+, CD45RO+, and T-bet+ lymphocytes and decrease of inhibition factors such as Foxp3, IL-6, IL-17, and TGF-β. On the other hand, taking into account the progression-dependent accumulation of somatic mutations in MSI tumors and consequent high levels of neo-antigens, the possible drug resistance of MSI tumors to traditional treatment, and the presence of inhibition checkpoints within the MSI tumors, there is a solid rationale for the use of novel therapeutic strategies such as immunotherapy in MSI melanomas. We presume that the MSI phenotype in malignant melanoma might be helpful to identify patients, who would be more likely to profit from immunotherapy than from conventional therapy."

abstract = "Worldwide, 387 million adults live with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and an additional 205 million cases are projected by 2035. Because T2D has numerous complications, there is significant morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Identification of early events in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and T2D might lead to more effective treatments that would mitigate health and monetary costs. Here, we present our hypothesis that impaired bone blood flow is an early event in the pathogenesis of whole-body metabolic insulin resistance that ultimately leads to T2D. Two recent developments in different fields form the basis for this hypothesis. First, reduced vascular function has been identified as an early event in the development of T2D. In particular, before the onset of tissue or whole body metabolic insulin resistance, insulin-stimulated, endothelium-mediated skeletal muscle blood flow is impaired. Insulin resistance of the vascular endothelium reduces delivery of insulin and glucose to skeletal muscle, which leads to tissue and whole-body metabolic insulin resistance. Second is the paradigm-shifting discovery that the skeleton has an endocrine function that is essential for maintenance of whole-body glucose homeostasis. Specifically, in response to insulin signaling, osteoblasts secret osteocalcin, which stimulates pancreatic insulin production and enhances insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, adipose, and liver. Furthermore, the skeleton is not metabolically inert, but contributes to whole-body glucose utilization, consuming 20% that of skeletal muscle and 50% that of white adipose tissue. Without insulin signaling or without osteocalcin activity, experimental animals become hyperglycemic and insulin resistant. Currently, it is not known if insulin-stimulated, endothelium-mediated blood flow to bone plays a role in the development of whole body metabolic insulin resistance. We hypothesize that it is a key, early event. Microvascular dysfunction is a primary cause of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy and poor bone blood flow is associated with bone loss. Therefore, we also hypothesize that dysfunction of the bone vascular endothelium contributes to the bone fragility observed in T2D. The most important consequence of our-dual hypothesis is the public health significance. Namely, identification of the proximal cause of T2D and associated bone complications allows pursuit of the appropriate therapeutic target to treat and prevent T2D. If our hypothesis that reduced bone blood flow is an early event in the pathogenesis of T2D and diabetic bone fragility is correct, then the endothelium of the bone vasculature should be a therapeutic target."

Besides ischemia-related cardiac malfunction there is growing evidence for non-ischemic diabetes-associated heart failure in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The underlying pathophysiology of non-ischemic diabetic cardiomyopathy (NIDC) is poorly understood and data on myocardial mechanics in early stages of the disease are rare. However, several studies in both human and experimental animal settings have reported prima facie unexplained features indicating myocardial hyperdynamics early in the course of the disease. The new hypothesis is that – other than previously thought – NIDC may be non-linear and initially feature an asymptomatic subclinical phase of myocardial hypercontractility that precedes the long-term development of diabetes-associated cardiac dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Diabetes-induced metabolic imbalances may lead to a paradoxic inotropic increase and inefficient myocardial mechanics that finally result in a gradual deterioration of myocardial performance. In conclusion, diabetic patients should be screened regularly and early in the course of the disease utilizing ultra-sensitive myocardial deformation imaging in order to identify patients at risk for diabetes-associated heart failure. Moreover, hyperdynamic myocardial deformation might help distinguish non-ischemic from ischemic diabetic cardiomyopathy. Further studies are needed to illuminate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, the exact spatiotemporal evolvement of diabetic cardiomyopathy and its long-term relation to clinical outcome parameters."

Very low doses of ASA will, on repeat dosing, produce near maximal platelet COX-1 inhibition. Evidence for cancer prophylaxis is based on ASA doses of at least 75mg/day. Pleiotropic mechanisms underlie low dose ASA’s undoubted efficacy in preventive medicine but the key barrier to its more widespread use is gastrointestinal toxicity.

A process of their formation in this disease is proposed based on a band 3-based mechanism of the erythrocyte shape control, able to explain the erythrocyte echinocytosis by glucose depletion. It indicates that their formation is due to a stomatocytogenic slow outward transport of the dibasic form of endogenous Pi with an H+ by band 3, promoted by the decrease of the Donnan ratio, which decreases cell pH and volume, attributed by a decrease of cell KCl concentration by the higher efflux of K+Cl− cotransport and Ca2+ activation of the Gardos channel. Its implications are briefly discussed with respect to target cells per se, target cell formation in other hemoglobinopathies, acquired and inherited disorders of the lipid metabolism and dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis as well as a stomatocyte presence in a double heterozygote of Hb S and Hb C and of an involvement of the process of target cell formation in acanthocytosis in acquired and inherited disorders."

Biological variations may occur during these times, without implying the process of disease. This paper takes into account new paediatric hormonal and other evidence which has accumulated in the past two decades concerning the causation of male homosexuality or bisexuality. It includes indirect genetic influence which has now been shown to be present. It also includes the implications of infant male breast development in regard to sexuality. It is asserted that the major cause of male homosexuality is due to failure of masculinisation of the male brain due to temporary but critical prolactin secretion from microprolactinoma present in their pituitary glands. Genes appear to be involved in the production of these tumours and sometimes in their demise. The assessment of their numbers at any one time in infancy has not been correctly addressed. Secondly, there is absolutely compulsive evidence concerning increased male infant breast development and the true nature of “Witch’s Milk” and how it is produced and the profound implications of its presence in male neonates. It adds much persuasion to the causation of male homosexuality as enunciated in this paper. Measurement of testosterone levels at exactly and precisely the right time, are able to predict homosexual or bisexual development in adults. This knowledge would be of great help to parents."

abstract = "Introduction
Obesity constitutes a serious global health concern reaching pandemic prevalence rates. The existence of functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans has provoked intense research interest in the role of this metabolically active tissue in whole-body energy balance and body weight regulation. A number of environmental, physiological, pathological, and pharmacological stimuli have been proposed to induce BAT-mediated thermogenesis and functional thermogenic BAT-like activity in white adipose tissue (WAT), opening new avenues for therapeutic strategies based on enhancing the number of beige adipocytes in WAT.
Hypothesis
Recent evidence support a role of l-menthol cooling, mediated by TRPM8 receptor, on UCP1-dependent thermogenesis and BAT-like activity in classical WAT depots along with the recruitment of BAT at specific anatomical sites. l-Menthol-induced BAT thermogenesis has been suggested to occur by a β-adrenergic-independent mechanism, avoiding potential side-effects due to extensive β-adrenergic stimulation mediated by available beta receptor agonists. l-Menthol has been also linked to the activation of the cold-gated ion channel TRPA1. However, its role in l-menthol-induced UCP1-dependent thermogenic activity in BAT and WAT remains undetermined. White adipose tissue plasticity has important clinical implications for obesity prevention and/or treatment because higher levels of UCP1-dependent thermogenesis can lead to enhanced energy expenditure at a considerable extent. We hypothesize that chronic dietary l-menthol treatment could induce TRPM8- and TRPA1-dependent WAT adaptations, resembling BAT-like activity, and overall improve whole-body metabolic health in obese and overweight individuals.
Conclusions
The putative impact of chronic l-menthol dietary treatment on the stimulation of BAT-like activity in classical WAT depots in humans remains unknown. A detailed experimental design has been proposed to investigate the hypothesized l-menthol-induced browning of WAT. If our hypothesis was to be confirmed, TRPM8/TRPA1-induced metabolic adaptations of WAT to BAT-like activity could provide a promising novel therapeutic approach for increasing energy expenditure, regulating body weight, and preventing obesity and its related co-morbidities in humans."

abstract = "Introduction
Acute acquired distance esotropia (AADE) is a poorly understood moderate-angle strabismus, affecting young adult myopes and determining bothersome diplopia. Symptoms can be intermittent in the early stages, becoming constant in long-lasting disease. Symptomatic therapy includes prism correction, while surgery is the only curative treatment. However, the latter is affected by high rate of symptoms recurrence with the frequent need for reoperation.
Hypothesis
We hypothesize that AADE could be caused by the increase of the accommodative demand, often secondary to a myopic overcorrection. This condition could determine an increase in induced hyperopia at near, dominated by an excess of accommodation and therefore of convergence. The latter cannot be relaxed at distance and diplopia develops. We speculate that early-stage AADE could be successfully treated by cycloplegic eye drops slowly tapered within three months. On the other hand, surgery remains the only option in long-lasting AADE. In these cases, we propose a new pre-operative assessment of esotropia by asking the patient to fix alternatively a stimulus at near and at distance in order to stimulate the accommodative convergence. This technique allows to unmask the total amount of the angle of deviation and to plan a wider bilateral medial rectus muscle recession avoiding long-term residual esotropia.
Discussion
Currently, AADE curative therapy is surgical regardless of onset time but it is usually affected by poor outcomes. If our hypothesis was to be confirmed, pharmacological treatment could solve early-stage AADE, avoiding any surgery. Furthermore, a wide bilateral medial rectus muscle recession, quantified on the basis of the above mentioned test for measuring the total amount of the strabismus angle, could improve outcomes eliminating the need for reoperation in long-lasting AADE."

abstract = "Fructose may be a key contributor to the biochemical alterations which promote the metabolic syndrome (MetS), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM): (a) its consumption in all forms but especially in liquid form has much increased alongside with incidence of MetS conditions; (b) it is metabolized almost exclusively in the liver, where it stimulates de novo lipogenesis to drive hepatic triglyceride (TG) synthesis which (c) contributes to hepatic insulin resistance and NAFLD (Lustig et al., 2015; Weiss et al., 2013; Lim et al., 2010; Schwarzet al., 2015; Stanhope et al., 2009, 2013) [1–6]. The specifics of fructose metabolism and its main location in the liver serve to explain many of the possible mechanisms involved. It also opens questions, as the consequences of large increases in fructose flux to the liver may wreak havoc with the regulation of metabolism and would produce two opposite effects (inhibition and activation of AMP dependent kinase-AMPK) that would tend to cancel each other. We posit that (1) surges of fructose in the portal vein lead to increased unregulated flux to trioses accompanied by unavoidable methylglyoxal (MG) production, (2) the new, sudden flux exerts carbonyl stress on the three arginines on the γ subunits AMP binding site of AMPK, irreversible blocking some of the enzyme molecules to allosteric modulation, (3) this explains why, even when fructose quick phosphorylation increases AMP and should therefore activate AMPK, the effects of fructose are compatible with inactivation of AMPK, which then solves the apparent metabolic paradox. We put forward the hypothesis that fructose loads, via the increase in MG flux worsens the fructose-driven metabolic disturbances that lead to unrestricted de novo lipogenesis, fatty liver and hepatic insulin resistance. It does so via the silencing of AMPK. Our hypothesis is testable and if proven correct will shed some further light on fructose metabolism in the liver. It will also open new roads in glycation research, as modulation of MG catabolism may be a way to dampen the damage. Research on this area may have important therapeutic potential, e.g., more momentum to find new and improved carbonyl quenchers, new insights on the action of metformin, more evidence for the role of GAPDH inactivation due to mitochondrial overload in diabetes complications. AMPK plays a central role in metabolism, and its function varies in different tissues. For that reason, synthetic activators will always stumble with unwanted or unpredictable effects. Preventing MG damage on the protein could be a safer therapeutic avenue."

But those with hepatic metastases may insensitive to EGFR-TKIs due to MET activation by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). In our retrospective analysis, 164 lung adenocarcinoma patients with known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status who received the treatment of erlotinib as 2nd/3rd line setting were reviewed. The disease control rate (DCR) in patients without hepatic metastases group was higher than that in patients with hepatic metastases (66.1% vs 54.5%, p<0.001). In EGFR mutation-positive patients, median PFS was significantly longer in patients without hepatic metastases than that in those with hepatic metastases (9.9months 95% CI 7.74–12.06months vs. 7.9months 95% CI 5.88–9.92months; p=0.017).

More than 90% of the human species are right handed. Although outwardly our body appears symmetrical, a 50/50% lateralization in handedness never occurs. Neither have we seen more than 50% left handedness in any subset of the human population. By 12–15weeks of intrauterine life, as many as 6 times more fetuses are noted by ultrasound studies to be sucking on their right thumbs. Distinct difference in oxygenation leading to dissimilar energy availability between right and left subclavian arteries in place by week 9 of life may hold the clue to the lateralization of hand function and eventually, the same in the brain. We know there is a higher incidence of left handedness in males, twins, premature babies and those born to mothers who smoke. They may represent a subset with less distinct difference in oxygenation between the 2 subclavian arteries during the fetal stage. This hypothesis if correct not only closes the gap in understanding human handedness and lateralization but also opens a vista for new research to focus on in utero tissue energy availability and its impact on outcome in life."

Circulating molecules associated with obesity, such as saturated fatty acids and cholesterol crystals, stimulate the innate immune system to incite a chronic inflammatory state. Studies in mouse models suggest that suppressing the obesity-induced chronic inflammatory state may prevent or reverse obesity-associated metabolic dysregulation. Human studies, however, have been far less positive, possibly because targeted interventions were too far downstream of the inciting inflammatory events. Recently, it has been shown that, within adipose tissue macrophages, assembly of a multi-protein member of the innate immune system, the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, is essential for the induction of this inflammatory state. Microtubules enable the necessary spatial arrangement of the components of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the cell, leading to its activation and propagation of the inflammatory cascade. Colchicine, a medication classically used for gout, mediates its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting tubulin polymerization, and has been shown to attenuate macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome arrangement and activation in vitro and in vivo. Given these findings, we hypothesize that, in at-risk individuals (those with obesity-induced inflammation and metabolic dysregulation), long-term colchicine use will lead to suppression of inflammation and thus cause improvements in insulin sensitivity and other obesity-related metabolic impairments."

During periods of pain, endothelial dysfunction progresses more aggressively due to elevated secretion of these pro-inflammatory mediators, which are involved in both atherosclerosis and the sensation of pain. Concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their antagonists, activating and decoy receptors of the broad interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-17 families, IL-15, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 should be measured in peripheral blood samples of OA patients and compared with (I) OA clinical severity; (II) subclinical parameters of atherosclerosis; (III) ischemic heart disease risk factors; (IV) soluble factors indicating endothelial dysfunction; (V) degree of bone destruction; and (VI) results of a six-minute walk test. Arthroscopy and joint replacement surgery provide an opportunity to estimate mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory mediators in specimens of synovial fluid, synovial membrane, cartilage, and/or subarticular bone. A range of methods, including questionnaires, X-ray, computed tomography, ultrasound, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistology, immunofluorescence, and reverse transcription and in situ polymerase chain reaction are available. Understanding the inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying OA may allow the early identification of patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, independently of classical coronary risk factors. Pain may constitute an extrinsic indicator of currently worsening endothelial function."

Although waterholes are the preferred feeding locations of large carnivores, waterholes are shared by all type of herbivores of all sizes and shapes, including elephants. Recent research shows that the homeostatic disturbances leading to the “thirst feeling” not only activate specific substances regulating water and mineral household, but also the “trust and love” hormone oxytocin, while decreasing the production of the typical stress hormone cortisol. People using drugs, seem to be in search for oxytocin, as evidenced in studies with individuals on drugs such as ecstasy and gamma-hydroxybyturate. Hot environment, drought and increased sweating also activate specific oxytocin-producing parts of the hypothalamus, just as breastfeeding does in mother and infant. Water homeostasis is the only allostatic system activating trust neuro-anatomy and we suggest that this is due to the fact that all animals depend on water, whereas food type is species specific. Our hypothesis; regulating drinking behaviour through intermittent bulk drinking could increase oxytocin signalling, recover human trust and increase health by down-regulation of stress axis activity and inflammatory activity of the immune system. Intermittent bulk drinking should be defined as water (including tea and coffee) drinking up to a feeling of satiety and regulated by a mild feeling of thirst. This would mean that people would not drink less quantity but less frequently and that’s how all animals, but also human newborns behave. It is the latter group, which is probably the only group of humans with a normal fluid homeostasis."

Many hypotheses were made in the literature but none has explained conceivably the two histo-morphological appearances of RBs and their association with inflammation. In the present paper the various pathogenesis for the formation of RBs proposed till date are discussed along with proposal for a novel hypothesis. The given hypothesis is mainly related to inflammation and its effect on pore size of basement membrane of odontogenic cystic epithelium. It explains RBs association with inflammation as well as existence of two histo-morphological appearances. The proposed hypothesis also justifies the RB’s presence inside the lining epithelium of odontogenic cyst despite its hematogenous origin. Future studies are advocated for isolating RBs using laser capture microdissection and subsequent biochemical, histochemical and electron microscopic analysis to substantiate the proposed hypothesis."

Future studies to test the hypothesis are needed and verification of the hypothesis can potentially yield highly effective measures to prevent allergic diseases."

The actions of EETs in brain closely parallel the effects which is observed in the peripheral tissues. Since many of these effects could potentially contribute to neuroprotection, EETs are, therefore, one of the potential therapeutic candidates in PD.

These days, researchers have successfully completed CTC cluster separation, CTC cell culture, and PD-L1 was found to be related with histological grading of tumor. Meanwhile, the high expression of PD-L1 in CTC surface has also been reported. Since PD-L1 can mediate Treg to play the role of immunosuppression, we propose that CTC with positive PD-L1 is easier to connect PD-L1, immune cells (Treg regulatory T cells, MDSC bone marrow inhibitory cells) and CK cytokines etc. On one hand, Treg cells can protect CTC from being attacked by the immune system through the immunosuppression, on the other hand, they can weaken CTL killing ability and trigger more MDSC. Finally, CTC formed the metastatic lesion."

The mainstream of research is focused on the promotion of spinal axons growth, which is strongly inhibited in mammals. Assuming that the inhibition of the axonal growth may be ever overcome, the complexity of neural reconnections may be the second serious stand to overcome. Peripheral nerve axons regeneration seem to form a random pattern of their targets reconnections. The hypothesis is that due to the laws of entropy or irreversible information loss the full spinal cord restoration after the transection is not possible. The hypothesis is discussed based on several assumptions. Simplifying the dissertation spinal cord is represented by 2millions of pyramidal axons. After the transection each of these axons has to make a growth and reconnect with exactly matching targets below the transection, in the same number. Axons are guided by neurotrophic factors and afterwards reconnected with neuroplasticity mechanisms. Assuming random reconnections, there are 2,000,000! permutations (10(107.069426636687223)), therefore the chance of ideally random but correct reconnection of pyramidal axons with adequate targets is 1/2,000,000!. Apart from pyramidal axons, there are other axons, like extrapyramidal, sensory and associative. Empirical data and analysis of neurotrophic factors and organogenesis mechanisms may seem to slightly contradict the hypothesis, but strictly adhering to the second law of thermodynamics and entropy laws the full restoration of the transected cord may never be possible."

Even though it counts as one of the most common benign anorectal disorders, its precise etiology and pathophysiology remains unclear. Current thinking is that anal fissures are caused by anal trauma and pain, which leads to internal anal sphincter hypertonia. Increased anal basal pressure leads to diminished anodermal blood flow and local ischemia, which delays healing and leads to chronic anal fissure. The current treatment of choice for chronic anal fissure is either lateral internal sphincterotomy or botulinum toxin injections. In contrast to current thinking, we hypothesize that the external, rather than the internal, anal sphincter is responsible for increased anal basal pressure in patients suffering from chronic anal fissure. We think that damage to the anal mucosa leads to hypersensitivity of the contact receptors of the anal-external sphincter continence reflex, resulting in overreaction of the reflex. Overreaction causes spasm of the external anal sphincter. This in turn leads to increased anal basal pressure, diminished anodermal blood flow, and ischemia. Ischemia, finally, prevents the anal fissure from healing. Our hypothesis is supported by two findings. The first concerned a chronic anal fissure patient with increased anal basal pressure (170mmHg) who had undergone lateral sphincterotomy. Directly after the operation, while the submucosal anesthetic was still active, basal anal pressure decreased to 80mmHg. Seven hours after the operation, when the anesthetic had completely worn off, basal anal pressure increased again to 125mmHg, even though the internal anal sphincter could no longer be responsible for the increase. Second, in contrast to previous studies, recent studies demonstrated that botulinum toxin influences external anal sphincter activity and, because it is a striated muscle relaxant, it seems reasonable to presume that it affects the striated external anal sphincter, rather than the smooth internal anal sphincter. If our hypothesis is proved correct, the treatment option of lateral internal sphincterotomy should be abandoned in patients suffering from chronic anal fissures, since it fails to eliminate the cause of high anal basal pressure. Additionally, lateral internal sphincterotomy may cause damage to the anal-external sphincter continence reflex, resulting in fecal incontinence. Instead, higher doses of botulinum toxin should be administered to those patients suffering from chronic anal fissure who appeared unresponsive to lower doses."

Noteworthy, there is a lack of published evidence for treatment. Cell-mediated cytotoxicity is actually regarded as a major mechanism of pathogenesis. The interferon-gamma induced chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL9 are strongly expressed in serum of patients as well as in both skin and mucosal lesions. Therefore the interferon gamma/CXCL10 axis is considered a key process for both progression and maintenance of chronic cytotoxic inflammation. According to these findings, the interferon gamma/CXCL10 axis could be considered a therapeutically attractive target to reverse inflammation. Since interferon gamma signal transduction occurs through JAK 1 and 2, JAK inhibitors could lead to blockade of interferon gamma signaling and downstream CXCL10 expression."

EDCs are hormone like agents that are readily present in the environment, which may alter the endocrine system of humans and animals. Approximately 800 chemicals are known or suspected to have the potential to function as EDC. Potential role of EDCs on reproductive disease has gained attention in medical literature in recent years. We hypothesize that exposure to low doses of EDCs in a chronic manner could cause hormone dependent genital cancers including ovarian and endometrial cancer. Long term exposure to low concentrations of EDCs may exert potentiation effect with each other and even with endogenous estrogens and could inhibit enzymes responsible for estrogen metabolism. Exposure time to these EDCs is essential as we have seen from Diethylstilbestrol experience. Dose–response curves of EDCs are also unpredictable. Hence mode of action of EDCs are more complex than previously thought. In the light of these controversies lower doses of EDCs in long term exposure is not harmless. Possibility of this relationship and this hypothesis merit further investigation especially through in vivo studies that could better show the realistic environmental exposure. With the confirmation of our hypothesis, possible EDCs could be identified and eliminated from general use as a public health measure."

However, there is mounting evidence that components of the acute phase protein response (APPR), and, in particular, certain cationic host defense peptides (HDPs), also contribute to anti-cancer host defense. In a number of in vitro studies, certain HDPs have been shown to be cytotoxic to tumor cells either directly through cancer cell membrane destabilization and lysis or through the initiation of apoptosis in the cancer cell. In addition, many cancer cells elaborate the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6, which in turn produces an APPR that involves the release of HDPs. It is therefore possible that the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by cancer cells initiates a poorly understood anti-tumor response by the host that involves HDP induction. We hypothesize that the APPR may form an important anti-cancer host defense response. This may be an important consideration in light of cancer treatments designed to decrease systemic inflammation. Blunting of the anti-cancer effect of the APPR may also contribute to the increased cancer rates seen in chronic immunosuppressive states."

The review of geographical knowledge suggests that there is a well-expressed anthropogenic element within the complex environmental trigger of T1D. On the other hand, the initiation of T1D’s directed autoimmunity is temporally related to the organism’s immune response, induced by entero-viruses, most expectedly. Consequently, the searched for anthropogenic environmental factor is a player temporally linked to enteroviral infections. This paper discusses the participation of antipyretic medicines, and especially paracetamol, with a whole century’s history of growing sales and popularity, including indirect influence through phenacetin during the first half of the 20th century. As proposed by several independent studies, the use of pharmaceuticals to reduce fever may counteract with the protective features of the immune system and create favourable conditions for a virus to spread within the organism and damage specific tissue. A preliminary comparison of paracetamol sales with the incidence of T1D data in Lithuania and the other countries in the North-eastern Baltic region supports this hypothesis."

abstract = "Treatment of obesity and its associated immune mediated diseases is challenging due to impaired function of leptin system. Thus leptin is providing an interesting target for therapeutic intervention. Leptin, an adipose tissue-derived adipokine, displays a variety of immune functions, and regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. The increased secretion of leptin (hyperleptinemia) and production of proinflammatory cytokines has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-related immune diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerosis, cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, crohn’s disease and multiple sclerosis. These disorders are managed through antibiotics and by cytokines replacement. However, the effectiveness of cytokines coupled to the complexity of the cytokine network leads to severe side-effects, which can still occur after careful preclinical evaluation. In addition, synthetic immunotherapeutics carries a degree of risk, is time-consuming and expensive. Hence, the complexity of existing therapy and adverse effects emphasizes the need of an alternative approach for the management of immune dysfunction associated with obesity and its related diseases. For the aforementioned diseases that are related to leptin overabundance, new drugs blocking leptin signaling need to be generated. The research on the discovery of clinically important novel compounds from natural source is expanding due to their safety and no side effect. The fungal endophytes are the microbes that colonize internal tissue of plants without causing negative effects to the host. They produce plethora of substances of potential use to modern medicinal and pharmaceutical industry. The increasing body of evidence associated with application of bioactive metabolites derived from fungal endophytes in diverse disease states merits its use as therapeutic drugs. In particular, the saponins have been extensively proved to modulate the immune system, which has raised a significant interest in their potential as immunomodulators. Thus, our hypothesis is that the saponins derived from fungal endophytes can be explored as clinical applicable leptin inhibitors for treating immune mediated diseases."

Hence, the time has come to utilize novel approaches, particularly those drawing upon contemporary advances in fields outside of established neuroscience and psychiatry. Put another way, the time has come for a paradigm shift in the addiction sciences. Apropos, a revolution in the area of human health is underway, which is occurring at the nexus between enteric microbiology and neuroscience. It has become increasingly clear that the human microbiota (the vast ecology of bacteria residing within the human organism), plays an important role in health and disease. This is not surprising, as it has been estimated that bacteria living in the human body (approximately 1kg of mass, roughly equivalent to that of the human brain) outnumber human cells 10 to 1. While advances in the understanding of the role of microbiota in other areas of human health have yielded intriguing results (e.g., Clostridium difficile, irritable bowel syndrome, autism, etc.), to date, no systematic programs of research have examined the role of microbiota in drug addiction. The current hypothesis, therefore, is that gut dysbiosis plays a key role in addictive disorders. In the context of this hypothesis, this paper provides a rationale for future research to target the “gut–brain axis” in addiction. A brief background of the gut–brain axis is provided, along with a series of hypothesis-driven ideas outlining potential treatments for addiction via manipulations of the “ecology within.”"

In particular, 17α-alkylated AAS appear to be hepatotoxic, whereas nonalkylated AAS appear not to be. The 17α-alkyl substitution retards hepatic metabolism of the AAS rendering it orally bioavailable. The mechanism responsible for the hepatotoxicity induced by 17α-alkylated AAS remains poorly understood. However, oxidative stress has been repeatedly shown to be associated with it.

Her access to episodic memories felt, subjectively, as if it was facilitated by her calendar line. Intriguingly, if she turned her sideways to look to the right, the calendar remained ‘stuck to the chest’ – meaning that it was body centered rather than head centered. Even more surprising is how, when she rotated her head rightward, the left portion of her calendar became “fuzzy”, and memories of February and March became less accessible; a striking example of embodied cognition – memories gated by information from neural networks representing the activity of neck muscles. We postulate that the human calendar is mediated by connections between the angular gyrus and hippocampal place and time cells-via the inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Other aspects of EA’s synaesthesia were also explored. The colors evoked by graphemes spread outside the grapheme itself, but the spread could be blocked by real as well as illusory contours. These interactions might be mediated by cells signaling illusory contours (in V2) and color/texture sensitive cells in (V4). Tastes also evoked colors, but, intriguingly, the colors were experienced inside her mouth rather than out there in the world. We discuss the deeper implications of these findings for understanding the nature of quale, and the manner in which the self anchors itself in space and time."

A hypothesis is presented suggesting that the pathogenesis of apical lung disease is due to progression of subclinical congenital apical bullae in people with low Body Mass Index (BMI), a combination present in 15% of the population, due to high pleural stress levels present in the antero-posteriorly flattened chests of these individuals.
Design
The hypothesis was tested for validity in two apical lung pathologies with widespread epidemiological literature, namely tuberculosis (TB) and primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP), assessing whether the hypothesis could identify high-risk populations, explain exceptional cases like apical lower lobe disease and confirm predictions.
Results
The biomechanical hypothesis can explain the high-risk factors of apical location, age, gender and low-BMI build, as well as the occurrence of disease in the apex of the lower lobe, in both TB and PSP patients. A predicted common pathogenesis for apical lung disease was confirmed by the higher-than-expected incidence of concomitant TB and PSP.
Conclusion
Pleural stress levels depend on chest wall shape, but are highest in the apex of young males with low BMI, leading to growth of congenital bullae that can eventually limit clearance inhaled material, superinfect or burst. This hypothesis suggests that low-dose computerized tomography may be used to screen for TB eradication. This paper is the first to propose a biomechanical mechanism for all apical lung disease pathophysiology."

This decreased coordination can be caused by a change in the organization of the eukaryote environment (mainly chronic inflammation), damage to mitochondrial DNA and/or to its membrane composition by many agents (e.g. viruses, chemicals, hydrogenated fatty acids in foods) or damage to nuclear DNA that controls mitochondrial energy production or metabolic pathways, including glycolysis. Here, we postulate that the two subsystems (the evolutionarily inherited archaea and the prokaryote) in a eukaryotic differentiated cell are well integrated, and produce the amount of clean energy that is constantly required to maintain the differentiated status. Conversely, when protracted injuries impair cell or tissue organization, the amount of energy necessary to maintain cell differentiation can be restricted, and this may cause gradual de-differentiation of the eukaryotic cell over time. In cirrhotic liver, for example, this process can be favored by reduced oxygen availability to the organ due to an altered vasculature and the fibrotic barrier caused by the disease. Thus, hepatocarcinogenesis is an ideal example to support our hypothesis. When cancer arises, the pre-eukaryote subsystems become predominant, as shown by the metabolic alterations of cancer cells (anaerobic glycolysis and glutamine utilization), and by their capacity for proliferation and invasion, resembling the primitive symbiotic components of the eukaryotic cell."

The present paper reports an alternative hypothesis suggesting a central role of micro-vascular ischemia in fibrogenesis and cirrhosis development, whatever is the aetiology of liver chronic injury. In fact, since chronic liver injury could finally result in endothelial damage and micro-vascular thrombosis, leading to a trigger of inappropriate hepatocyte proliferation and fibrosis, finally cirrhosis development could arise from chronic micro-vascular ischemia. Recently, some important confirmation of this hypothesis has been reported. In fact, in a murine experimental model of congestive hepatopathy, it was found that chronic hepatic congestion leads to sinusoidal thrombosis and strain, which in turn promote hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, a study on a murine model of cirrhosis reported enoxaparin to reduce hepatic vascular resistance and portal pressure by having a protective role against fibrogenesis. In conclusion, the hypothesis giving a central role of micro-vascular ischemia in fibrogenesis and cirrhosis development could change the clinical scenario of chronic liver disease and have several main implications on management of various liver disease."

Severe hypocalcemia is a life-threatening condition. At present, both medical and surgical treatments are offered to improve the blood calcium, but they are not a cure. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), derived from the adipose tissue, are confirmed to be multipotent with adipogenic, chondrogenic, neurogenic, myogenic and osteogenic capabilities. Our hypothesis is that human ADSCs in culture can be differentiated into parathyroid cells, and used to reconstitute function."

Negative CNS pressure is caused by the combination of gravitational force and body movement. The venous system imposes pressure fluctuations on the CNS due to changes in posture and body cavity pressure. It is proposed here that filling of veins, arteries and cerebrospinal (CSF) spaces are all assisted by negative CNS pressure. Hyperemia in the CNS in response to pressure changes with movement was described in the first part of this hypothesis. By this means parenchyma water levels may increase (Williams, 2008). In the developmental forms of hydrocephalus expansion of CSF spaces is a more prominent feature than parenchyma water changes. This feature is explained by this second part of the hypothesis where the negative pulsatility of pressure that can accompany positive pressure pulsatility, which occurs with body movement, is described as the pathological force that leads to cavity filling. When CNS compliance is lost there is overrepresentation of low and well as high pressure pulsations in response to body movements. Pressure that leads to the development of hydrocephalus can be described as being abnormally labile. Negative CNS pressure causes cavity filling in an analogous way to pleural cavity filling, with water passing from parenchyma tissue. Positive pressure within the pressure profile may cause expansion of regions of the CNS skeletal system that are able to grow such as the cranial vault so that large head size is a frequent accompaniment to hydrocephalus that is caused by this mechanism. Hydrocephalic disorders that are characterised by negative pressure filling mechanism often have a skeletal anatomical abnormality that causes reduced CNS compliance and adversely affect neural development. This is often in the form of obstruction to CSF flow around the base of the brain that then leads to vault expansion by means of high pressure pulsation and ventricle enlargement by means of low pressure pulsation. In health pressure pulsatility does not lead to enduring changes in water distribution within the CNS compartments but it assists physiological water balance."

Drug addiction is defined as a “pathological pattern of use of a substance”, characterized by the loss of control on drug-taking-related behaviors, the pursuance of those behaviors even in the presence of negative consequences, and a strong motivated activity to assume substances. Three different theories guide experimental research on drug addiction. Each of these theories consider singles features, such as an aberrant motivation, a hedonic dysregulation, and an aberrant habit learning as the main actor to explain the entire process of the addictive behaviors. The major goal of this study is to present a new hypotheses of transitionality from a controlled use to abuse of addictive substances trough the overview of the three different theories, considering all the single features of each single theory together on the same “temporal continuum” from use to abuse of addictive substances. Recently, it has been suggested that common neural systems may be activated by natural and pharmacological stimuli, raising the hypotheses that binge-eating disorders could be considered as addictive behaviors. The second goal of this study is to present evidences in order to highlight a possible psycho-bio-physiological superimposition between drug and “food addiction”. Finally, interesting questions are brought up starting from last findings about a theoretical/psycho-bio-physiological superimposition between drug and “food addiction” and their possibly same transitionality along the same “temporal continuum” from use to abuse of addictive substances in order to investigate new therapeutic strategies based on new therapeutic strategies based on the individual moments characterizing the transition from the voluntary intake of substances to the maladaptive addictive behavior."

abstract = "Clinicians often experience the reduced efficacy of general and local anesthetics and anesthesia-related drugs in habitual drinkers and chronic alcoholics. However, the mechanistic background underlying such anesthetic tolerance remains unclear. Biogenic indoleamines condense with alcohol-derived aldehydes during fermentation processes and under physiological conditions to produce neuro-active tetrahydro-β-carbolines and β-carbolines, many of which are contained not only in various alcoholic beverages but also in human tissues and body fluids. These indoleamine–aldehyde condensation products are increased in the human body because of their exogenous and endogenous supply enhanced by alcoholic beverage consumption. Since tetrahydro-β-carbolines and β-carbolines target receptors, ion channels and neuronal membranes which are common to anesthetic agents, we propose a hypothesis that they may pharmacodynamically interact at GABAA receptors, NMDA receptors, voltage-gated Na+ channels and membrane lipid bilayers to attenuate anesthetics-induced positive allosteric GABAA receptor modulation, NMDA receptor antagonism, ion channel blockade and neuronal membrane modification, thereby affecting anesthetic efficacy. The condensation products may also cooperatively interact with ethanol that induces adaptive changes and cross-tolerance to anesthetics and with dopamine–aldehyde adducts that act on GABAA receptors and membrane lipids. Because tetrahydro-β-carbolines and β-carbolines are metabolized to lose or decrease their neuro-activities, induction of the relevant enzymes by habitual drinking could produce an inter-individual difference of drinkers in susceptibility to anesthetic agents. The present hypothesis would also provide a unified framework for different modes of anesthetic action, which are inhibited by neuro-active indoleamine–aldehyde condensation products associated with alcoholic beverage consumption."

abstract = "In spite of advances in neonatal care and the new generation of antibiotics, neonatal sepsis is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is difficult because clinical signs are non-specific. Thus, new biomarkers are still needed for diagnosis. Gelsolin is an actin-binding plasma protein. Furthermore, extracellular gelsolin binds lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid, which are major virulence factors of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The result of this binding is the inhibition of gelsolin’s F-actin depolymerizing activity. Thus, gelsolin inhibits the release of IL-8 from human neutrophils subjected to lipoteichoic acid, lipopolysaccharide and heat-inactivated bacteria treatment. Our hypothesis is that pGSN levels decrease in neonatal infants with sepsis and this decrease might be used as a reliable biological marker. Forty patients who were diagnosed with severe sepsis at a neonatal intensive care unit were enrolled in the sepsis group. Twenty patients who were followed for prematurity were enrolled in the control group. The pGSN level at the time of diagnosis in the sepsis group was 33.98±11.44μg/ml, which was significantly lower than that of control group (60.05±11.3μg/ml, P<0.001) and after treatment (53.38±31.26μg/ml, P=0.003). Area under ROC curve was 0.96 (p: 0.0001, 95% CI; 0.90–0.99). Sensitivity was 90.32 (95% CI; 74.2–97.8), specificity was 95 (95% CI; 75.1–99.2). Plasma gelsolin significantly decreased in septic patient and recovery of decreased gelsolin levels correlated with clinical improvement.

Angiotensin-(1–7), a heptapeptide with vasodilatory properties, has been found to restore vascular reactivity and endothelial cell function, mostly in experiments on larger isolated animal vessels and in cell cultures. The presented hypothesis suggests that angiotensin-(1–7) might have beneficial effects on microvascular function that is damaged in diabetic patients, alleviating endothelial dysfunction and increasing microvascular reactivity to various vasoactive agents in diabetes. It is further proposed that iontophoresis with angiotensin-(1–7) might be used to explore this potential beneficial effect, as well as provide a possible future therapeutic delivery method for angiotensin-(1–7). Since other peptides and proteins have been previously tested and used in iontophoretic transdermal delivery, it is plausible that angiotensin-(1–7) would be a suitable candidate for transdermal iontophoretic application for research (and potentially therapeutic) purposes. If confirmed, the delineated hypothesis would have immense implications for more effective care of diabetic patients, as well as for better understanding of microcirculatory pathophysiological mechanisms in diabetes."

The balance of effect between the two, the noradrenergic balance, is the controlled variable of the sympathetic system and determines the effect of noradrenaline. Neuronal noradrenaline stimulates tissues by diffusion from their sympathetic nerve endings, plasma noradrenaline does so by diffusion from their microcirculations. Changes in microcirculatory flow, by altering the flow mediated effect of plasma noradrenaline, are mainly responsible for altering the noradrenergic balance in the peripheral tissues; changes in CSF flow are speculated to be mainly responsible for doing the same in the brain, by altering the balance between synaptic noradrenaline in the brain and nonsynaptic noradrenaline in the subarachnoid CSF. When plasma noradrenaline alters the noradrenergic balance it triggers afferent sympathetic activity that alerts hypothalamic neurons to the event and they restore the balance and tissue homeostasis, within milliseconds, by adjusting the level of efferent sympathetic activity they project back to the affected tissue. Because the restoration is so rapid the effect of plasma noradrenaline is normally unobservable and dismissed as not having occurred. Because the hypothalamus is not involved with the responses of isolated canine lateral saphenous vein segments to noradrenaline, the effects of plasma noradrenaline in that preparation are not countered by reactive efferent activity and, consequently, are readily apparent in it. Quantitatively, they have been found to be a function of microcirculatory flow and noradrenaline concentration and, qualitatively, to be inhibitory, dilator, pro inflammatory and neurodegenerative. In life, due to a progressive increase in plasma noradrenaline concentration and, more so, in microcirculatory flow, the noradrenergic balance moves progressively in favour of the neurodegenerative and inflammatory effects of plasma noradrenaline. These observations are the basis of an hypothesis that ageing is caused by a genetically programmed shift in balance away from the growth and anti-inflammatory effects of neuronal noradrenaline, early in life, towards the neurodegenerative and pro-inflammatory effects of plasma noradrenalin, later in life. Death is believed to occur when plasma noradrenaline has damaged the structure of the sympathetic system so much that it can no longer create the minimum quantity of neurotransmitter needed to maintain the level of noradrenergic balance and homeostasis necessary for life."

Although previous reports suggest the involvement of EBV in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis, its exact role in periapical bone resorption has not yet been fully elucidated. We hypothesize that EBV infection in apical periodontitis is capable of inducing periapical bone resorption via stimulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction. Increased levels of ROS induce expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL). RANKL binding to receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) present on the surface of preosteoclasts induces their maturation and activation which consequently leads to bone resorption. The potential benefit of antiviral and antioxidant-based therapies in periapical bone resorption treatment remains to be assessed."

abstract = "Aim
One of the technical problems which can be encountered during the endovascular repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms, is represented by the challenge of cannulation of the contralateral gate after the opening of the main body of the endograft, especially in case of tortuous aorta-iliac anatomy. Aim of this work is to propose a hypothesis of simplification, verifying the possibility to maximize the area available for the cannulation of the contralateral gate by simulating an oblique distal end of the leg of the most used devices, without affecting the correct sealing between the main body and the iliac extension.
Methods
Data about the contralateral gate of the main body of endografts most used for EVAR were analyzed. The elliptical sectional area resulting from the simulation of the oblique cut was calculating with some geometric formulas. Then the gain of “disposable area” for the cannulation of the contralateral gate was calculated as a percentage of the elliptical area resulting in maximum distal oblique cut, with respect to the nominal circular area of the base.
Results
The only endografts which could undergo an oblique cut without losing the sealing between the main body and the contralateral limb were the Incraft, the Treovance and the Ovation, for which it would be possible to obtain a surface gain up to 84%, 22.8% and 14.4% respectively (being 9.8% in case of Ovation with the main body 29 and 34). A simulation of oblique cut was also performed on the endografts which currently do not allow to do so without a loss of sealing, assuming to lengthen the contralateral gate of an arbitrary measure of 10mm. In these cases, the percentage of surface gain was greater for endoprostheses which had a smaller diameter of the contralateral leg.
Conclusions
The oblique cut of the contralateral gate allowed a gain of the surface available for the cannulation, however it was not applicable to all models of currently available endoprostheses, unless of a loss of sealing between the main body and the contralateral iliac limb."

Hence, RetSat is speculated to be involved in a rapid unusual conversion of α-ESA to conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), giving a less priority to its usual substrate all trans retinol, which would subsequently be converted into “all trans retinoic acid” (atRA). Otherwise, all trans retinol is converted by RetSat into all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol and eventually forms all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid, but not the atRA. The atRA controls differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of cells and it’s deficiencies end up as neoplasms. Thus, here it is emphasized that safeguarding atRA would help controlling cell division and growth in a favourable manner. Hence, inhibition of RetSat could be a hot target to control unwarranted cell growths within the body. This hypothesis could be easily tested in a RetSat ablated (RetSat −/−) animal model or using antagonists on RetSat activity or α-ESA."

abstract = "In all mammalian species studied to date, the initiation of oocyte activation is orchestrated through alterations in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signaling. Upon sperm binding to the oocyte plasma membrane, a sperm-associated phospholipase C (PLC) isoform, PLC zeta (PLCζ), is released into the oocyte cytoplasm. PLCζ hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce diacylglycerol (DAG), which activates protein kinase C (PKC), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which induces the release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores. Subsequent Ca2+ oscillations are generated that drive oocyte activation to completion. Ca2+ ionophores such as ionomycin have been successfully used to induce artificial human oocyte activation, facilitating fertilization during intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedures. Early studies have also demonstrated that the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) acts synergistically with Ca2+ ionophores to induce parthenogenetic activation of mouse oocytes. Interestingly, the Ca2+-induced signaling cascade characterizing sperm or chemically-induced oocyte activation, i.e. the “shock and live” approach, bears a striking resemblance to the reactivation of latently infected HIV-1 viral reservoirs via the so called “shock and kill” approach, a method currently being pursued to eradicate HIV-1 from infected individuals. PMA and ionomycin combined, used as positive controls in HIV-1 latency reversal studies, have been shown to be extremely efficient in reactivating latent HIV-1 in CD4+ memory T cells by inducing T cell activation. Similar to oocyte activation, T cell activation by PMA and ionomycin induces an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and activation of DAG, PKC, and downstream Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways necessary for proviral transcription. Interestingly, AMPK, a master regulator of cell metabolism that is activated thorough the induction of cellular stress (e.g. increase in Ca2+ concentration, reactive oxygen species generation, increase in AMP/ATP ratio) is essential for oocyte maturation, T cell activation, and mitochondrial function. In addition to the AMPK kinase LKB1, CaMKK2, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase that also activates AMPK, is present in and activated on T cell activation and is also present in mouse oocytes and persists until the zygote and two-cell stages. It is our hypothesis that AMPK activation represents a central node linking T cell activation-induced latent HIV-1 reactivation and both physiological and artificial oocyte activation. We further propose the novel observation that various compounds that have been shown to reactivate latent HIV-1 (e.g. PMA, ionomycin, metformin, bryostatin, resveratrol, etc.) or activate oocytes (PMA, ionomycin, ethanol, puromycin, etc.) either alone or in combination likely do so via stress-induced activation of AMPK."

Theorists tried to explain it with the diversity threshold theory in which accumulated mutations in the HIV genome make the virus so diverse that the immune system will no longer be able to recognize all the variants and fail to control the viraemia. Although the theory could apply to a number of cases, macaque AIDS models using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) have shown that failed viral control at the set point is not always associated with T-cell escape mutations. Moreover, even monkeys without a protective major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allele can contain replication of a super infected SIV following immunization with a live-attenuated SIV vaccine, while those animals are not capable of fighting primary SIV infection. Here we propose a recursion-based virus-specific naive CD4+ T-cell depletion hypothesis through thinking on what may happen in individuals experiencing primary immunodeficiency virus infection. This could explain the mechanism for impairment of virus-specific immune response in the course of HIV infection."

abstract = "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication that presents in the postoperative stage, especially in elderly patients. Despite years of considerable progress, the detailed molecular mechanisms of POCD remain largely unknown. Neuroinflammation has been increasingly pointed out as one of the core mechanisms for the pathogenesis of POCD. However, application of anti-inflammatory drugs failed to show consistent beneficial effect in patients with cognitive decline. Hence, it might be of great importance to identify the inflammatory initiators that are involved in the mediation, amplification and perpetuation of postoperative neuroinflammatory reactions. Extracellular RNAs (exRNAs), released from necrotic cells, were demonstrated to initiate the inflammatory responses in various pathological conditions. Recent study has suggested neuroprotective and edema protective effects of ribonuclease (RNase), the counterpart of RNA, in acute stroke. It was theorized that RNase acted against endogenous RNA that was released from tissue damage. Similarly, we have observed significant attenuation of cognitive impairment by RNase in aged mice after unilateral nephrectomy. Damping the systemic initiators at early stages may help to prevent the chain reaction that triggers the central inflammatory or apoptotic response. Therefore, we propose the hypothesis that exRNAs released upon stress, through acting on the peripheral and/or central receptors, may trigger a damaging cascade leading to the development of POCD. Undoubtedly, further study is urgently needed to elucidated the exact signaling mechanisms and confirm the proposed hypothesis."

Though the diagnosis can be relatively straightforward in the persistent form of SND, it can be elusive when the dysfunction is intermittent. For intermittent SND, the diagnosis may require prolonged electrocardiographic recordings with an external or internal loop recorder, or an invasive electrophysiologic study. Ivabradine, an If inhibitor that slows sinoatrial discharge rate, is widely used for the treatment of chronic angina or heart failure. Though the drug is contraindicated in patients with known SND as it may exacerbate symptoms, we propose that a simple ivabradine suppression test, followed by a 24-h monitorization of heart rhythm, could be valuable to aid diagnosis of intermittent SND. The test we propose could be used prior to prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring in patients with suspected SND, but both the diagnostic accuracy and the safety should be evaluated with studies prior to implementation."

The underlying hypothesis is based on the fact that the sexually dimorphic neuropeptide vasopressin has its receptors in the part of the brain involved in music and dance performance (the basal ganglia), and its concentrations rise during sexual arousal in men. In addition, music, dance, and courtship phenotypes seem to be in part regulated by vasopressin and its genes. Hence, to test this hypothesis, a rhythmic synchronization task was employed here on one male subject during sexual arousal. Results revealed a significant effect of sexual arousal on rhythm synchronization. This is the first report that empirically supports the hypothesis on the role of music in sexual selection. Further studies are clearly required."

So far, the study of the maximum fluence of the healthy heart sample proteome has mapped the cardiac proteomics map and builded a model of the heart proteome at the subcellular level. Compared with the normal sample, the most significantly downregulated proteins in the AF group were enriched for “mitochondrion”. Succinylation of proteins appears to be prevalent in mechanisms involving cellular metabolism within the mitochondria. Experiment has show that heart has a much higher concentration of succinyl-CoA than any other organ. This supports the knowledge that the heart would need to prioritize energy production through the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

abstract = "The French paradox – high saturated fat consumption but low incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality – is still unresolved and continues to be a matter of debate and controversy. Recently, it was hypothesised that the high consumption of dairy products, and especially cheese by the French population might contribute to the explanation of the French paradox, in addition to the “(red) wine” hypothesis. Most notably this would involve milk bioactive peptides and biomolecules from cheese moulds. Here, we support the “dairy products” hypothesis further by proposing the “alkaline phosphatase” hypothesis. First, intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), a potent endogenous anti-inflammatory enzyme, is directly stimulated by various components of milk (e.g. casein, calcium, lactose and even fat). This enzyme dephosphorylates and thus detoxifies pro-inflammatory microbial components like lipopolysaccharide, making them unable to trigger inflammatory responses and generate chronic low-grade inflammation leading to insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, type-2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity, known risk factors for CVD. Various vitamins present in high amounts in dairy products (e.g. vitamins A and D; methyl-donors: folate and vitamin B12), and also fermentation products such as butyrate and propionate found e.g. in cheese, all stimulate intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Second, moulded cheeses like Roquefort contain fungi producing an alkaline phosphatase. Third, milk itself contains a tissue nonspecific isoform of alkaline phosphatase that may function as IAP. Milk alkaline phosphatase is present in raw milk and dairy products increasingly consumed in France. It is deactivated by pasteurization but it can partially reactivate after thermal treatment. Experimental consolidation of the “alkaline phosphatase” hypothesis will require further work including: systematic alkaline phosphatase activity measurements in dairy products, live dairy ferments and intestine of model animals. Furthermore, stool residual IAP, a possible early marker of diabetes, should be assayed in human cohorts. If confirmed, this “alkaline phosphatase” hypothesis will highlight the protective effects of milk alkaline phosphatase and promote the consumption of (microbiologically safe) raw milk and dairy products. Microorganisms secreting alkaline phosphatases may be privileged as ferments in dairy products."

They are crucial for replication of an organism, including viruses. HCV and HIV are two clinically significant pathogens, responsible for millions of infections and deaths worldwide. Due to similar transmission routes, these viruses can establish co-infection in an individual. Individually, these infections are difficult to treat, however, in case of co-infection, the treatment becomes more difficult. Additionally, these viruses accumulate mutation in response to drug therapy that renders the treatment ineffective. HCV and HIV both encode enzyme containing helicase activity. The viral-encoded helicase plays a significant role in HIV and HCV life cycle. Here we propose viral helicases as an ideal single-hit target that can inhibit HIV and HCV co-infection. We also hypothesize that search for natural analogs sharing basic ring structure with a class of helicase inhibitors called fluoroquinolones can yield natural agents with superior antiviral (anti-helicase) activity with lower toxicity index. The fluoroquinolones and their analogs are currently not part of any antiviral regimens. Our proposal is to include fluoroquinolones-derived natural analogs as a conjugate therapy along with main regimens available against HCV and HIV co-infection."

However, the mechanisms responsible for the two modi of host response remain unclear. COX-2−/− animal models showed the dependence of osseointegration on prostaglandins. PGE2, a product of COX-2, augments Wnt signalling, a pathway that promotes the regeneration in many types of tissues. Recently, we demonstrated the ability of bioactive implants to recruit neutrophils and to trigger neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are a potent source of PGE2. In bioinert implants no PGE2 release has been ascertained. Collectively, these findings suggest that osseointegration might be the host response to bioactive implants, novel and quite different to the so-called foreign body reaction."

Humans spend a third of their life sleeping, and the quality of sleep has been related to co-morbidity, Alzheimer disease, etc. Excessive wakefulness induces rapid changes in cognitive performances, and it is claimed that one could die of sleep deprivation as quickly as by absence of water. In this context, the fact that a few people are able to go without sleep for months, even years, without displaying any cognitive troubles requires explanations. Theories ascribing sleep to memory consolidation are unable to explain such observations. It is not the case of the theory of sleep as the hebbian reinforcement of the inhibitory synapses (ToS-HRIS). Hebbian learning (Long Term Depression – LTD) guarantees that an efficient inhibitory synapse will lose its efficiency just because it is efficient at avoiding the activation of the post-synaptic neuron. This erosion of the inhibition is replenished by hebbian learning (Long Term Potentiation – LTP) when pre and post-synaptic neurons are active together – which is exactly what happens with the travelling depolarization waves of the slow-wave sleep (SWS). The best documented cases of months-long insomnia are reports of patients with Morvan’s syndrome. This syndrome has an autoimmune cause that impedes – among many things – the potassium channels of the post-synaptic neurons, increasing LTP and decreasing LTD. We hypothesize that the absence of inhibitory efficiency erosion during wakefulness (thanks to a decrease of inhibitory LTD) is the cause for an absence of slow-wave sleep (SWS), which results also in the absence of REM sleep."

Obesity, main outcome of these changes, increases the risk for developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome, the leading cause of death in adult and middle age population. Body weight and energy homeostasis are maintained via complex interactions between orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides that take place predominantly in the hypothalamus. Overeating may disrupt the mechanisms of feeding control, by decreasing the expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and increasing orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP), which leads to a disturbance in appetite control and energy balance. Studies have shown that regular physical exercise might decrease body-weight, food intake and improve the metabolic profile, however until the currently there is no consensus about its effects on the expression of orexigenic/anorexigenic neuropeptides expression. Therefore, we propose that the type and length of physical exercise affect POMC/αMSH and NPY/AgRP systems differently and plays an important role in feeding behavior. Moreover, based on the present reports, we hypothesize that increased POMC/αMSH overcome NPY/AgRP expression decreasing food intake in long term physical exercise and that results in amelioration of several conditions related to overweight and obesity."

Prostaglandins present in seminal fluid are actively involved in vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle maintenance, reproduction, and inflammatory processes. Seminal plasma contains molecules, such as oxylipins, which possess cell signaling functions. Several studies have shown that specific molecules in seminal fluid can increase passive diffusion, and cause interactions in the female reproductive tract. This may provoke a cascade of cellular and molecular changes in general health and certain diseases. This study examines the hypothesis that the molecules in seminal fluid are involved in platelet activity. The molecules diffuse through cells and membranes, affecting Hoxa 10, binding ganglioside pathways, and acting over platelet function. When these molecules are at low levels, they may trigger prothrombotic states, explaining the pathophysiology of haemostatic response, such as preeclampsia, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease."

Infact, even though in recent years numerous staging parameters have been largely studied and unanimously recognized for their clinical and prognostic value, today too many shadows still exist around the capacity to predict exactly the natural history or post-treatment behavior of this cancer even among patients of the same stage. This study has identified the presence of isolated cancer cells as well as tumor markers (CEA, Ca 19.9, Ca 72.4 and Ca 50) from the gastric lavage of patients affected by gastric adenocarcinoma. Such findings led to the hypothesis that endoluminal exfoliation of neoplastic cells and the release of their products (tumor markers) into the gastric juice might be an expression of neoplastic behavior as well as aggressive malignancy. Should this hypothesis become a reality, some important progress could be made in the knowledge, staging, prediction as well as management and follow-up of this inauspicious type of cancer."

In schizophrenia, hypofrontality has been further suggested to cause both the negative and cognitive symptoms, and overactivity of dopamine neurons that project to subcortical areas. The latter may contribute to the development of positive symptoms of the disorder. Nevertheless, what causes hypofrontality and how it alters dopamine transmission in subcortical structures remain unclear due, in part, to the difficulty in modeling hypofrontality using previous techniques (e.g. PFC lesioning, focal cooling, repeated treatment with psychotomimetic drugs). We propose that the use of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) chemogenetic technique will allow precise interrogations of PFC functions. Combined with electrophysiological recordings, we can investigate the effects of PFC hypofunction on activity of dopamine neurons. Importantly, from a drug target discovery perspective, the use of DREADDs will enable us to examine whether chemogenetically enhancing PFC activity will reverse the behavioral abnormalities associated with PFC hypofunction and dopamine neuron overactivity, and also explore druggable targets for the treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders associated with abnormalities via modulation of the G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway. In conclusion, the use of the DREADDs technique has several advantages over other previously employed strategies to simulate PFC hypofunction not only in terms of disease modeling but also from the viewpoint of drug target discovery."

Systemic age-related depression of mitochondrial function, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and depressed expression of genes supporting energy homeostasis is more severe in IPD than normal aging such that energy supply may exceed regional demand. In IPD, the overall risk of malignancy is reduced. Cancer is a collection of proliferative diseases marked by malignant transformation, dysregulated mitosis, invasion and metastasis. Many cancers demonstrate normal mitochondrial function, preserved OXPHOS, competent mechanisms of energy homeostasis, and metabolic reprogramming capacities that are lacking in IPD. Metabolic reprogramming adjusts OXPHOS and glycolytic pathways in response to changing metabolic needs. These opposite metabolic features form the basis of a two component hypothesis. First, that depressed mitochondrial function, OXPHOS deficiency and impaired metabolic reprogramming contribute to focal energy failure, neurodegeneration and disease expression in IPD. Second, that the same systemic metabolic deficits inhibit development and proliferation of malignancies in IPD. Studies of mitochondrial aging, familial PD (FPD), the lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher’s disease, Parkinson’s disease cybrids, the mitochondrial cytopathies, and disease-related metabolic reprogramming both in IPD and cancer provide support for this model."

These multi-protein complexes can be activated by exposure of cells to low osmolality. The inflammasome nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) is hereby the main sensor of cellular osmolality. IL-1β was found to stimulate the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland either by action of prostaglandins or indirectly by causing the release of IL-6. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the hyponatremia caused by a wide range of CNS diseases is able to induce significant cell swelling with induction of a hyposmotic intracellular environment, which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, causing the release of IL-1β and induced by IL-1β, IL-6, which increases the production of ADH that leads to more profound hyponatremia. Supportive evidence for this hypothesis is the finding that IL-1 injection can induce ADH release and hyposmotic effect of ADH induced hyponatremia can, via the mechanical effect of cell swelling, activate transient receptor potential channels, which via transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 activate NLRP3. Implications of this hypothesis, if confirmed, would include that hyponatremia can be exacerbated through this vicious cycle but also that the inflammasomes are key mediators of this process. Confirmation of this hypothesis would have implications for prevention and clinical management of changes in patients sodium levels related to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) with interventions targeting inflammatory mediator production and function of inflammasomes with the potential of prevention of permanent brain damage in a wide range of CNS diseases."

We propose that production of AC by bacteria is a part of microbial biological strategy under natural conditions. We propose that bacteria in soils, in water and on plants do not meet human tumors and their AC serve for the competition with eukaryotic organisms. Most probably, an epiphytic growth of bacilli is accompanied with production of compounds inhibiting eukaryotes. According to awaited profit for the AC-producing bacteria, the epiphytic groups of bacilli show inhibition of mycelial fungi which are a natural model of eukaryotic cells.

In our opinion, a precise distinction between acute/fluctuating disorders and progressive hearing loss must be made in order to identify the possible circulatory causes. Actually, it is conceivable to hypothesize that an acute lack of perfusion plays a major role in the inner ear microcirculation, and may be responsible for acute hearing damages; on the other hand, systemic atherosclerosis may coexist with good hearing provided that a sufficient local perfusion is maintained. This distinction, supported by our findings over the year, appears logical considering the autoregulatory properties of the cochlea and the differences between large/middle vessels and microvasculature; moreover, it can explain the finding of both people with no cardiovascular risk factors and (usually) unilateral inner ear affections and people with diffuse atherosclerosis and well preserved hearing, not exceptionally occurring in daily practice."

Among most mammals, the placenta is not effective at transferring antibodies to the fetus: antibodies are transferred immediately after birth via the colostrum. Among humans (and other mammals with hemochorial placentas) the transplacental transfer of antibodies (namely IgG) is effective. In humans, foetal concentrations of IgG sub-classes approximate to maternal concentrations at 38weeks and continue to increase thereafter. These facts explain inter-species differences regarding the basic needs of neonates. Among most mammals, the early colostrum is, strictly speaking, vital. Among humans, the main questions are about the bacteriological environment in the birthing place and how familiar it is to the mother. Today, most human beings are born in unfamiliar bacteriological environments characterized by a low microbial diversity. The effects of clinical environments may be amplified by the use of antibiotics and birth by caesarean, i.e. by-passing the bacteriologically rich perineal zone. There is already an accumulation of data confirming that the maturation of a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response is affected by the mode of delivery. There is also an accumulation of epidemiological studies detecting risk factors in the perinatal period for health conditions such as type 1 diabetes (and other autoimmune diseases), atopy, autism and obesity. In such a context there are reasons to plan randomized controlled trials with long term follow-up of the effects of BCG given immediately after birth, as a modulator of Th-1/Th-2 responses. A follow-up period in the region of 6–10years would be long enough to evaluate the prevalence of several nosologically well defined diseases. These studies would be ethically acceptable, since BCG is the only infancy vaccine that has been evaluated through randomised controlled trials with long term follow-up. Furthermore, whatever the standard of living of the populations and the research protocols, concordant results suggest that BCG has positive non-specific long term effects on health. Meanwhile, some simple adaptive practices are possible, such as, after a caesarean section, wrapping the neonate in clothes recently worn by the mother and, occasionally, putting the neonate in the arms of a person who is cohabiting with the mother."

These disseminated tumor cells can reside in the tissues for a long period that do not form the tumor mass, however, the potential of metastasis still remains. It is pivotal to tumor diagnosis and therapy to explore how these tumor cells behave after departing from the primary site. Once detached from the maternal site, the tumor cells firstly enter into the circulation and then into the tissues surrounded by the stromal cells, which may influence the tumor behaviors. In our previous study, we found that the normal fibroblasts were capable of inducting the epithelial into mesenchymal cells of the gastric tumor cells by the down regulation of the E-cadherin. The transformed gastric cancer cells exhibited impaired tumor colonization but increased metastasis, providing the preliminary cues for the fact that the transformed tumor cells exist in not only the circulation, but the tissue as well. Emerging studies have been focused on the biological behaviors of tumor cells in the circulation, while it is still not clear about of those cells out of circulation, especially in the early stage of cancer. In this article, we propose a hypothesis of the “traveling tumor cells” to include these tumor cells in the tissues based on our previous findings, which describe the tumor cells that migrate through the tissue with no evidence of tumor metastasis. Furthermore, we discuss the generation and underlying mechanisms of the “traveling tumor cells”, which we believe that they would be of great value to refresh our understanding of tumor metastasis."

In addition to the well-established catabolic effects (activation of bone resorption) of PTH, it is recognized that the PTH intermittent administration has anabolic effects (promotion of bone formation). However, there is no information regarding the effects of the PTH intermittent administration on the eruption tooth rate. Studies have shown that tooth eruption depends on the presence of osteoclasts to create an eruption pathway through the alveolar bone. It may also be controlled by osteoblast, precursor of osteoclast, and cells of periodontal ligament. Our hypothesis is based on previous studies showing that the PTH intermittent administration can promote bone formation, particularly in the areas around which the tooth erupts. Furthermore, the PTH intermittent administration influenced periodontal ligament fiber, what may be seen as greater organization, and isomerization, as well as higher birefringence of the periodontal ligament fiber, which then offers increased resistance to the process, delaying tooth eruption. Thus, this article opens new perspectives for the treatment and maintenance of teeth that can erupt early."

abstract = "Our preliminary data show high levels of adenosine in the blood of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, positively correlating to their prematurity (i.e. body weight class). This prompted us to look for a mechanism promoting such impressive adenosine increase. We hypothesized a correlation with oxygen challenge. In fact, it is recognized that either oxygen lack or its excess contribute to the pathogenesis of the injuries of prematurity, such as retinopathy (ROP) and periventricular white matter lesions (PWMI). The optimal concentration of oxygen for resuscitation of VLBW infants is currently under revision. We propose that the elevated adenosine blood concentrations of VLBW infants recognizes two sources. The first could be its activity-dependent release from unmyelinated brain axons. Adenosine in this respect would be an end-product of the hypometabolic VLBW newborn unmyelinated axon intensely firing in response to the environmental stimuli consequent to premature birth. Adenosine would be eventually found in the blood due to blood–brain barrier immaturity. In fact, adenosine is the primary activity-dependent signal promoting differentiation of premyelinating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) into myelinating cells in the Central Nervous System, while inhibiting their proliferation and inhibiting synaptic function. The second, would be the ecto-cellular ATP synthesized by the endothelial cell plasmalemma exposed to ambient oxygen concentrations due to premature breathing, especially in lung. ATP would be rapidly transformed into adenosine by the ectonucleotidase activities such as NTPDase I (CD39), and NT5E (CD73). An ectopic extra-mitochondrial aerobic ATP synthetic ability was reported in many cell plasma-membranes, among which endothelial cells. The potential implications of the cited hypotheses for the neonatology area would be great. The amount of oxygen administration for reviving of newborns would find a molecular basis for its assessment. VLBW infants may be regarded as those in which premature exposure to ambient oxygen concentrations and oxidative stress causes a premature functioning of the extra-mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation primarily in axons and endothelium. Adenosine may become a biomarker of prematurity risk, whose implications further studies may assess."

We suggest that dissemination of metastatic “seed cells” occur at an early stage of the disease together with the development of primary melanoma and cannot be detected by standard diagnostic methods. These cells are masked between healthy cells and have the potential to proceed in true metastasis following the activation triggered by signal from primary tumor or other source. Other possibility includes the existence of two different genes, one responsible for development of primary melanoma, and the other with a roll in development of metastases. We believe that future investigation should be directed toward better understanding of mechanisms involved in metastases development keeping in mind that melanoma behavior is irrational and defies logical thinking."

In human cell lines and in animal studies, phytoalexins have been shown to be highly beneficial, with protective effects against cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, hyperglycemia, as well as potential effects on longevity. However, in clinical studies, there are multiple factors that restrict this plethora of health benefits attributed to phytoalexins. One of these barriers is rapid metabolism in the intestines and liver. As a means to overcome this barrier, there is evidence that retaining resveratrol in the mouth for extended periods allows for higher plasma levels of resveratrol. Processing, transport or storage may cause degradation due to light and air exposure. When the berries have been picked, they may not be at their peak phytoalexin production due to lack of elicitor induction. To overcome these barriers inherent in phytoalexin production and uptake, it is proposed that berries and possibly the edible leaves be directly ingested off of a grapevine, without harvesting. In addition to the benefit of removing these barriers to potential health benefits, this method introduces a variety of known phytoalexin elicitors, in the form of plant wounding and human saliva, which may enhance the levels of phytoalexins dramatically. The combined effect of multiple phytoalexins may also play a role in enhanced health benefits. To test this hypothesis, experiments with direct ingestion would be performed, followed by testing the participants’ plasma levels of resveratrol and potentially other phytoalexins. Proposed variables to be tested include: different subjects, elicitors, cultivars of grapevine, ripeness of fruit, and a range of time for the ingestion process. The potential implications include a direct means of obtaining, in clinically beneficial doses, the tremendous health benefits that have been documented for phytoalexins in vitro and in animal studies, but that have so far remained elusive in clinical studies. This study on direct ingestion may lead to alternative methods for obtaining these clinically beneficial doses."

The strategy requires daily dietary supplementation with magnesium (Mg), folic acid, and vitamins B6 and B12, daily consumption of silicic acid-rich mineral water in order to lower the body burden of Al, and several plasma exchange procedures in order to replace Aβ-bound albumin with fresh albumin. Evidence suggests that the deteriorating cognitive performance associated with AD may be improved by supplementation with either Mg alone or with the combination of the above three B vitamins (B vitamin combo), or by drinking silicic acid-rich mineral water, or by undergoing plasma exchange. However, for the following reasons the combination of all four therapeutic approaches may have a synergistic effect on improving cognitive performance of AD patients.1.Various studies suggest that AD represents a form of diabetes of the brain, otherwise known as Type 3 diabetes. Proper functioning of carbohydrate metabolism requires both Mg and the B vitamin combo.2.High levels of homocysteine associated with gray matter atrophy found in AD patients can be lowered by the B vitamin combo, which has also been found to prevent loss of intracellular Mg induced by homocysteine.3.Consumption of silicic acid-rich mineral water not only removes Al, but lowering the body burden of Al enables more Mg to access the brain and regulate neurochemical processes that would otherwise be disrupted by Al.4.As a result of plasma exchange, fresh albumin, not bound to the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide that is associated with AD and which binds extensively to albumin, replaces Aβ-bound albumin. Compared to Aβ-bound albumin, the fresh albumin has an increased affinity for Mg, thereby facilitating the distribution of Mg across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and into brain tissue."

Analogous to the organ failure that can result from severe sepsis, repeated application of the proposed procedure could lead to tumor necrosis and regression. Biomarkers including heat shock proteins and circulating endothelial cells, and intravital microscopy of intravascular NETs, microthrombi, and bleeding in tumors can be used to test predicted consequences of this therapy.

abstract = "When an individual is facing a stressor and normal stress-response mechanism cannot guarantee sufficient adaptation, special emotional states, adaptive modes, are activated (for example a depressive reaction). Adaptive modes are involuntary states of mind, they are of comprehensive nature, they interfere with normal functioning, and they cannot be repressed or controlled the same way as many emotions. Their transformational nature differentiates them from other emotional states. The object of the adaptive mode is to optimize the problem-solving abilities according to the situation that has provoked the mode. Cognitions and emotions during the adaptive mode are different than in a normal mental state. These altered cognitions and emotional reactions guide the individual to use the correct coping skills in order to deal with the stressor. Successful adaptation will cause the adaptive mode to fade off since the adaptive mode is no longer necessary, and the process as a whole will lead to raised well-being. However, if the adaptation process is inadequate, then the transformation period is prolonged, and the adaptive mode will turn into a dysfunctional state. Many psychiatric disorders are such maladaptive processes. The maladaptive processes can be turned into functional ones by using adaptive skills that are used in functional adaptive processes."

abstract = "Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a phenomenon expressed by many tumors affecting the chemotherapy efficacy, treatment decision, and the disease prognosis. Considering its great implication, non-invasive approaches are needed to identify this phenomenon in early stages of the disease. This article discusses the potential of the emerging non-invasive bacterium-mediated imaging of cancer in diagnosis of MDR. This potential is derived from the effect of cancer MDR on the pharmacokinetics of certain antibiotics, which are substrates of the MDR proteins. Since MDR proteins actively pump their substrates outside the resistant cancer cells, the elimination of the employed reporter bacteria, proliferating within MDR cancer cells, would require a larger dose of these antibiotics compared to those inside non-MDR cancer cells. These bacteria bear reporter genes that produce specific signals such as bioluminescent, fluorescent, magnetic, or radioactive signals that can be detected by non-invasive imaging modalities. Therefore, the presence, degree, and mechanism of MDR can be estimated by comparing the concentration of the employed antibiotic, required to cease these signals (reflecting the elimination of the bacteria), to a pre-determined reference. The real time imaging of MDR cancer and the early diagnosis of MDR, offered by this approach, would provide a better tool for preclinical studies of MDR, and allow a prompt choice of the most appropriate therapy."

abstract = "Since 1985, at least nine studies of the average rate of cone loss in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) populations have yielded conflicting average rate constant values (−k), differing by 90–160%. This is surprising, since, except for the first two investigations, the Harvard or Johns Hopkins’ protocols used in these studies were identical with respect to: use of the same exponential decline model, calculation of average −k from individual patient k values, monitoring patients over similarly large time frames, and excluding data exhibiting floor and ceiling effects. A detailed analysis of Harvard’s and Hopkins’ protocols and data revealed two subtle differences: (i) Hopkins’ use of half-life t0.5 (or t1/e) for expressing patient cone-loss rates rather than k as used by Harvard; (ii) Harvard obtaining substantially more +k from improving fields due to dormant-cone recovery effects and “small −k” values than Hopkins’ (“small −k” is defined as less than −0.040year−1), e.g., 16% +k, 31% small −k, vs. Hopkins’ 3% and 6% respectively. Since t0.5=0.693/k, it follows that when k=0, or is very small, t0.5 (or t1/e) is respectively infinity or a very large number. This unfortunate mathematical property (which also prevents t0.5 (t1/e) histogram construction corresponding to −k to +k) caused Hopkins’ to delete all “small −k” and all +k due to “strong leverage”. Naturally this contributed to Hopkins’ larger average −k. Difference (ii) led us to re-evaluate the Harvard/Hopkins’ exponential unchanging −k model. In its place we propose a model of increasing biochemical stresses from dying rods on cones during RP progression: increasing oxidative stresses and trophic factor deficiencies (e.g., RdCVF), and RPE malfunction. Our kinetic analysis showed rod loss to follow exponential kinetics with unchanging −k due to constant genetic stresses, thereby providing a theoretical basis for Clarke et al.’s empirical observation of such kinetics with eleven animal models of RP. In contrast to this, we show that cone loss occurs in patients with increasing −k values during RP progression. And as the Hopkins’ protocol selects more advanced RP cases than Harvard’s to assure avoidance of ceiling effects (Harvard does this by kinetic monitoring), we show increasing −k kinetics to be the reason Harvard obtains more +k and small −k values. Thus the combined effects of (i) and (ii) produce Harvard’s smaller average −k value. The relevance of the increasing biochemical stress model for optimizing clinical trials is discussed."

abstract = "Formaldehyde is extremely toxic reacting with proteins to crosslinks peptide chains. Formaldehyde is a metabolic product in many enzymatic reactions and the question of how these enzymes are protected from the formaldehyde that is generated has largely remained unanswered. Early experiments from our laboratory showed that two liver mitochondrial enzymes, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH) and sarcosine dehydrogenase (SDH) catalyze oxidative demethylation reactions (sarcosine is a common name for monomethylglycine). The enzymatic products of these enzymes were the demethylated substrates and formaldehyde, produced from the removed methyl group. Both DMGDH and SDH contain FAD and both have tightly bound tetrahydrofolate (THF), a folate coenzyme. THF binds reversibly with formaldehyde to form 5,10-methylene-THF. At that time we showed that purified DMGDH, with tightly bound THF, reacted with formaldehyde generated during the reaction to form 5,10-methylene-THF. This effectively scavenged the formaldehyde to protect the enzyme. Recently, post-translational modifications on histone tails have been shown to be responsible for epigenetic regulation of gene expression. One of these modifications is methylation of lysine residues. The first enzyme discovered to accomplish demethylation of these modified histones was histone lysine demethylase (LSD1). LSD1 specifically removes methyl groups from di- and mono-methylated lysines at position 4 of histone 3. This enzyme contained tightly bound FAD and the products of the reaction were the demethylated lysine residue and formaldehyde. The mechanism of LSD1 demethylation is analogous to the mechanism previously postulated for DMGDH, i.e. oxidation of the N-methyl bond to the methylene imine followed by hydrolysis to generate formaldehyde. This suggested that THF might also be involved in the LSD1 reaction to scavenge the formaldehyde produced. Our hypotheses are that THF is bound to native LSD1 by analogy to DMGDH and SDH and that the bound THF serves to protect the FAD class of histone demethylases from the destructive effects of formaldehyde generation by formation of 5,10-methylene-THF. We present pilot data showing that decreased folate in livers as a result of dietary folate deficiency is associated with increased levels of methylated lysine 4 of histone 3. This can be a result of decreased LSD1 activity resulting from the decreased folate available to scavenge the formaldehyde produced at the active site caused by the folate deficiency. Because LSD1 can regulate gene expression this suggests that folate may play a more important role than simply serving as a carrier of one-carbon units and be a factor in other diseases associated with low folate."

abstract = "The incidence of both obesity and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has dramatically increased during the last decades. Moreover, the most recent studies have revealed increased risk of ASD in offspring of overweight and obese women. However, the mechanisms of association between ASD and maternal obesity are unknown. Taking into account the existing data indicating the association between mercury (Hg) exposure and development of obesity and ASD, we hypothesize that Hg may serve as an additional link between maternal obesity and ASD. In particular, it is supposed that obesity is associated with excessive accumulation of Hg in the maternal organism. After conception, the fetus is developing in the conditions of Hg overload within the body of obese women thus predisposing to the development of ASD. The proposed hypothesis may be confirmed by the existing data. In particular, previous studies demonstrated that overweight and obese persons are characterized by a significantly higher level of Hg in hair, blood and urine than the lean ones. Therefore, an obese organism is characterized by elevated Hg burden that may be transferred to the fetus during pregnancy. Moreover, multiple studies have demonstrated a tight association between maternal and children Hg status being indicative of placental transfer of metal from maternal organism to offspring. Finally, a growing body of data indicates the influence of Hg exposure and Hg status on the risk of ASD in children. However, additional experimental and clinical studies are required to prove the hypothesis and provide novel data on the role of Hg in maternal obesity-associated ASD development. In particular, the contribution of Hg to ASD development in children from obese mothers should be determined. If a significant role of Hg in maternal obesity ASD risk will be confirmed, this will open additional perspectives of risk modification. Taking into account the universal mechanisms of Hg toxicity, transport, and accumulation, further preventive actions may be undertaken to reduce the risk of Hg toxicity and Hg-associated ASD development. In particular, it is supposed that the use of Hg chelators (like N,N′bis-(2-mercaptoethyl)isophthalamide, NMBI), antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory compounds prior or during pregnancy may have a beneficial effect. However, the safety of such actions should repeatedly be tested to avoid adverse health effects in a developing fetus."

When the dura mater ossifies, the difficulty of surgery and the risk of complications significantly increase. The cause of dural ossification (DO) is still unknown. Based on the existing research and clinical studies, we propose a potential mechanism of DO in OLF. Firstly, with the progression of OLF, it will compress the dura mater and even the spinal cord. Then, with flexion and extension of spine, relative movement (friction) between the ossified ligamentum flavum and compressed dura mater will lead to local inflammation, subsequently causing dural adhesion. Finally, the adhesion tissue can serve as a pathway for the transportation of osteogenic cytokines (BMP for example) from the ossified ligamentum flavum to the compressed dura mater. Dura will ossify under exposure of these osteogenic cytokines. If this hypothesis is confirmed, it will contribute to the prevention and management of DO. For progressive OLF patients, early surgical treatment before DO should be recommended."

abstract = "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystemic disease characterized by autoimmune inflammatory disturbance. Pleomorphic manifestations are present and a potentially progressive and debilitating course can be detected. SLE rarely manifests before age 5, and its onset peaks is around puberty. Although clinical manifestations, immunological alterations and treatment do not differ between juvenile and adult SLE, children tend to present with a more aggressive disease course than adults. Hence, autoimmune rheumatic diseases are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric populations. Blood serum analysis plays an especially important role in the detection and monitoring of autoantibodies in SLE. However, since blood sampling is an uncomfortable procedure, especially in children, novel less invasive techniques and approaches are of utmost importance to evaluate pediatric subjects. In this regard, saliva samples have several advantages, such as: easy access, fast collection, painless and riskless procedure. Saliva has antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as several other relevant features. The whole saliva is a complex mixture of major and minor salivary gland secretion, gingival crevicular fluid, transudates plasma protein, keratinocyte products and oral microbiota. This biological fluid reflects the physiological state of the body, including the emotional condition, and endocrine, nutritional and metabolic changes. Therefore, salivary proteomics is becoming increasingly used for the early diagnosis of several diseases such as breast cancer, oral cancer, Sjögren’s syndrome, diffuse systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, among others. Considering the detection of some potential markers related to SLE in serum and urine, this study aims to conduct an initial evaluation of the possible presence of such biomarkers in saliva. Furthermore, it is expected to track down new salivary proteins that could be correlated with the disease. As such, it is important to evaluate whether the analysis of the salivary proteome of children whose mothers have SLE may help identify biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of the condition."

Building upon the growing literature showing that left–right asymmetry exist at the biomolecular and at the cellular levels, we propose a new hypothesis to explain why HLA-B27-positive acute anterior uveitides tend to affect one eye selectively. We postulate that left and right uveal tissue may present quantitatively and qualitatively different proteins to the immune system, capable to trigger an autoimmune response, and that other variables, including anatomical, cellular and molecular barriers, as well as our own eye-derived immunological tolerance and immune suppressive intraocular microenvironment may also be unequally distributed, and impact differently the immune privileges of the left and right eye. These same quantitative and qualitative differences might also explain why HLA-B27-positive acute anterior uveitides can flip-flop between the left and the right eye, after the first attack. By trying to figure out why one eye is targeted by an autoimmune reaction while the other is clinically unaffected, we might be able to better understand how and why an autoimmune reaction starts. Hopefully, this will help us devise better treatments for ocular autoimmune diseases, and contribute to the management of autoinflammatory conditions with a marked asymmetric clinical presentation in other fields."

Several studies have postulated that fungal and bacterial nephrotoxins are a possible etiological factor; however, the precise link between hypothesized risk factors and the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease has yet to be proven in prior studies. Leptospirosis and Hantavirus infections are important zoonotic diseases that are naturally maintained and transmitted via infected rodent populations and which present similar clinical and epidemiological features. Both infections are known to be a cause of acute kidney damage that can proceed into chronic renal failure. Several studies have reported presence of both infections in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we hypothesized that pathogenic Leptospira or Hantavirus are possible causative agents of acute kidney damage which eventually progresses to chronic kidney disease in Sri Lanka. The proposed hypothesis will be evaluated by means of an observational study design. Past infection will be assessed by a cross-sectional study to detect the presence of IgG antibodies with further confirmatory testing among chronic kidney disease patients and individuals from the community in selected endemic areas compared to low prevalence areas. Identification of possible risk factors for these infections will be followed by a case-control study and causality will be further determined with a cohort study. If the current hypothesis is true, affected communities will be subjected for medical interventions related to the disease for patient management while considering supportive therapies. Furthermore and possibly enhance their preventive and control measures to improve vector control to decrease the risk of infection."

Investigations performed on PPARγ and one of the essential micronutrients selenium (Se) have shown that both parameters may lead to alterations in obesity-related or mood disorders. Therefore, it is plausible to consider PPARγ and Se together as a powerful combination during the treatment of two associated diseases; obesity and depression. PPARγ has been shown to be involved in the antidepressant-like activity. It is also an important parameter to be considered in obesity as the master regulator of adipogenesis. The mechanism of action of PPARγ is initiated by ligand binding which induces a conformational change in the receptor. Se is capable of alleviating inflammatory signaling pathways. Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. Depression is also defined as an inflammatory disorder. Inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) participate in the progression of depression. They are also obesity-associated parameters. Due to TNFα induced depressive-like behaviors and the positive association between this proinflammatory cytokine and obesity, TNFα-activated signaling pathways and those inhibiting them have recently gained importance as potential targets and therapeutic tools, respectively. More studies are necessary to develop compounds with therapeutic nature against depressive disorders and obesity. PPARγ is an important signaling pathway that occurs at the crossroads of depression and obesity. Se, aside from its anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic and antioxidative nature, affects also the way of PPARγ action. Se supplementation or fortification as well as the development of the partial agonists of PPARγ in which lipophilic Se compounds are used as ligand followed by experimental trials and human studies using the newly developed compounds will be promising approaches for future hope during the treatment of these diseases."

The metabolic feedback pathway is much faster than 20-HETE-dependent myogenic feedback, and the former thus initiates the cerebral autoregulatory response, while myogenic feedback comprises a relatively slower mechanism that functions to set the basal cerebrovascular tone. Therefore, assessments of dynamic cerebral autoregulation, which may provide information on the response time of the cerebrovasculature, may specifically be used to yield information on metabolic feedback mechanisms, while data based on assessments of static cerebral autoregulation represent the integrated functionality of myogenic and metabolic feedback."

Unfortunately these therapies showed disappointing results mainly due to undesirable mechanisms tending to dampen the antitumor immune response. We will discuss a novel approach of autologous tumor immunization using a surgical technique: autologous tumor immunizing devascularization (ATID). This approach involves complete surgical devascularization of a tumor which is then left isolated in situ in the body. The stressing pathophysiological condition of the completely isolated tumor provokes a generalized immune response which, as shown from clinical cases, leads to the elimination of the devascularized tumor and distant metastases without causing sepsis. Until now no clinical study was properly executed. The possible significance of this method which resides in its curative potential has thus escaped attention in the field of cancer therapy. This article will hypothesize optimal physiological criteria and necessary clinical conditions for ATID to be performed effectively. The main criteria are (1) complete isolation of the tumor from the vascular system, (2) sufficient devascularized tumor load to trigger a sustained generalized immune response to cancer antigens until elimination of all cancer loci, (3) tumor cell killing rate corresponding to the elicited immune response is higher than the tumor cell growth rate, and (4) patients with an uncompromised immune system. Future studies have to be performed under the indicated conditions in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of ATID as a novel approach in the treatment of cancer."

Some therapies have used this rate solely to establish initial fluency, while others use extremely slowed speech to establish fluency and add other strategic techniques such as easy onsets and diaphragmatic breathing. Extreme prolongations generate effective, efficient, and immediate forward flowing fluent speech, removing the signature behaviors of discrete stuttering (i.e., syllable repetitions and audible and inaudible postural fixations). Prolonged use of extreme prolongations establishes carry-over fluency, which is spontaneous, effortless speech absent of most, if not all, overt and covert manifestations of stuttering. The creation of this immediate fluency and the immense potential of extreme prolongations to generate long periods of carry-over fluency have been overlooked by researchers and clinicians alike. Clinicians depart from these longer prolongation durations as they attempt to achieve the same fluent results at a near normal rate of speech. Clinicians assume they are re-teaching fluency and slow rates will give rise to more normal rates with less control, but without carry-over fluency, controls and cognitive mediation are always needed for the inherently unstable speech systems of persons who stutter to experience fluent speech. The assumption being that the speech system is untenable without some level of cognitive and motoric monitoring that is always necessary. The goal is omnipresent “near normal rate sounding fluency” with continuous mediation via cognitive and motoric processes. This pursuit of “normal sounding fluency” continues despite ever-present relapse. Relapse has become so common that acceptance of stuttering is the new therapy modality because relapse has come to be understood as somewhat inevitable. Researchers and clinicians fail to recognize that immediate amelioration of stuttering and its attendant carry-over fluency are signs of a different pathway to fluency. In this path, clinicians focus on extreme prolongations and the extent of their carry-over. While fluency is automatically generated under these extreme prolongations, the realization is that communication at this rate in routine speaking tasks is not feasible. The perceived solution is a systematic reduction in the duration of these prolongations, which attempts to approximate “normal speech.” Typically, the reintroduction of speech at a normalized rate precipitates a laborious style that is undesirable to the person who stutters (PWS) and is discontinued, once departed from the comforts of the clinical setting. The inevitable typically occurs; the well-intentioned therapist instructs the PWS to focus on the techniques while speaking at a rate that is nearest normal speech, but the overlooked extreme prolongations are unlikely to ever be revisited. The foundation of this hypothesis is that the departure from fluency generators (e.g. extreme prolongations) is the cause of regression to the stuttering set point. In turn, we postulate that the continued use of extreme prolongations, as a solitary practice method, will establish and nurture different neural pathways that will create a modality of fluent speech, able to be experienced without cognitive or motoric mediation. This would therefore result in fewer occurrences of stuttering due to a phenomenon called carry-over fluency. Thus, we hypothesize that the use of extreme prolongations fosters neural pathways for fluent speech, which will result in carry-over fluency that does not require mediation by the speaker."

abstract = "Ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBL) are the most troublesome biliary complication after liver transplantation (LT) from non-heart-beating donors (NHBD) and frequently result in death or re-transplantation. In transplantation process, warm ischemia (WI) in the donor, cold ischemia and reperfusion injury in the recipient altogether inducing ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) is strongly associated with ITBL. This is a cascading injury process, involving in a complex series of inter-connecting events causing variety of cells activation and damage associated with the massive release of inflammatory cytokines and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These damaged cells such as sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells (BECs), coupled with immunological injury and bile salt toxicity altogether contribute to ITBL in NHBD LT. Developed therapeutic strategies to attenuate IRI are essential to improve outcome after LT. Among them, single pharmaceutical interventions blocking a specific pathway of IRI in rodent models play an absolutely dominant role, and show a beneficial effect in some given controlled experiments. But this will likely prove ineffective in complex clinical setting in which more risk parameters are involved. Therefore, we intend to design a multidrug cocktail approach to block different pathways on more than one stage (WI, cold ischemia and reperfusion) of the process of IRI-induced ITBL simultaneously. This multidrug cocktail will include six drugs containing streptokinase, epoprostenol, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), hemin and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDC). These drugs show protective effects by targeting the different key events of IRI, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrosis, anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis and reduced bile salt toxicity. Ideally, the compounds, dosage, and method of application of drugs included in cocktail should not be definitive. We can consider removing or adding some drugs to the proposed cocktail based on further research. But given the multitude of different combinations, it is extremely difficult to determent which combination is the optimization design. Nevertheless, regardless of the difficulty, our multidrug cocktail approach designed to block different mechanisms on more than one stage of IRI simultaneously may represent a future preventive and therapeutic avenue for ITBL."

The fact that both early-life adversity and reproductive effort are associated with shorter telomeres and increased oxidative stress raises the prospect, consistent with life-history theory, that these two theoretical frameworks currently informing much research are tapping into the same evolutionary-developmental process of increased senescence and reduced longevity.

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread in the world including the vulnerable group of pregnant women. Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is hypothesized to contribute to the cause of autism. Further, it is hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and early childhood will reduce the recurrence rate of autism in newborn siblings.
Methods
To investigate the hypothesis an open label prospective study was performed prescribing vitamin D during pregnancy to mothers of children with autism at a dose of 5000IU/day. The newborn siblings were at high risk for the recurrence of autism. The newborn infants were also prescribed vitamin D, 1000IU/day to their third birthday. The newborn siblings were followed for three years and during that time, were assessed for autism on two separate occasions: at 18months and 36months of age. The results were compared to the reported recurrence rates in siblings of autistic children in the literature.
Results
The final outcome was 1 out of 19 (5%) developed autism in contrast to the recurrence rate of approximately 20% in the literature. We did not have a control group, nor was there blinding.
Conclusions
The results are promising, however, this is a preliminary study with very small numbers and was uncontrolled. Further study with larger numbers is indicated. The ethics of prescribing a low dosage of vitamin D such as 400IU D3/day to a control group of mothers in comparison to a large dose such as 5000IU D3/day are problematic in our opinion."

abstract = "Introduction
Medical records often contain free text created by harried clinicians. Free text often contains errors which make it an unsuitable target for computerized data extraction. The cost of healthcare can be reduced by creating medical records that are fully computerized at their inception. We examine hypotheses that enable us to construct such records.
Methods
We regard the text of the medical record as being an ordered collection of meaningful fragments. The intellectual content (or “lexeme”) of each text fragment in the record is considered separately from the language that used to express it. We further consider that each lexeme exists as a combination of a lexeme query (defining the issue being addressed) and a lexeme response to that query. The medical record can then be perceived as a stream of these responses. The responses can be expressed in any style or language, including computer code. Examining medical records in this light gives rise to a number of observations and hypotheses.
Observations and Hypotheses
The physical location and nature of the medical episode (which we term “context”) determines the general layout of the record. The order that lexeme-queries are addressed in within the record is highly consistent (“coherence”). Issues are only addressed if they are logically called-for by the context or by a previously-selected lexeme response (“predicance”), and only to a needed depth of detail (“level”). We hypothesize that all of the lexeme queries required to write any clinical notes can be stored in a large database (“lexicon”) in coherence order, wherein each lexeme query is associated with its own collection of lexeme responses. We hypothesize that the issue a note-writer will need to address next is identifiable purely by using the rules of coherence, level and predicance.
Testing the hypotheses and their utility
We have tested these hypotheses with a computer program which repeatedly offers the user a menu of lexeme responses with associated text. On selection, the program issues the text fragment, and its corresponding computer code, to output files. The program then uses coherence, predicance and level to navigate to the next appropriate lexeme query for presentation to the user. The net result is that the user creates a grammatically correct and completely computerized note at the time of its inception. The value of this approach and its practical implementation to create medical records are discussed. In our work so far, the hypotheses appear not to be false, but further testing is needed using a larger lexicon to establish their robustness in actual clinical practice."

abstract = "Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), is the most common vector-borne illness in the United States. It is a complex disease which may affect the skin, joints, heart, eyes, and central nervous system. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is curative in most instances. However, a significant percentage of patients experience ongoing symptoms after treatment. Currently, there is much controversy regarding the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of Lyme disease. Pathogen persistence despite treatment lies at the heart of this debate. Many believe that the ongoing symptoms are due to factors such as autoimmunity or permanent damage that is incurred during the active infection. However, there is an emerging school of thought that states that ongoing symptoms are due to a persistent infection that is able to survive both the immune response and antibiotic therapy. Numerous studies have shown that Bb can indeed persist within the host despite treatment and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain Bb’s persistence capabilities. These include: polymorphism, antigenic variance, biofilm formation, persister cells, and immunomodulation. There is evidence that Bb is able to alter cytokine profiles within the host which may allow the organism to survive the immune response. This immunomodulation follows a pattern of T-helper 1 (TH1) suppression in favor of T-helper 2 (TH2) processes. In contrast, it has been shown that the optimal immune response to Bb infection involves an early, robust TH1 response and a later conversion to TH2 dominance once the infection is controlled or cleared. It has been proposed that a reconstitution of proper immune-competency in the infected host may improve clinical outcomes in Lyme disease. Cimetidine (CIM) is an over-the-counter histamine-2 (H2) antagonist that is primarily used to lower acid secretions in the stomach. T-regulatory (Treg) cells also possess the H2 receptor, which has spurred interest in CIM as a potential immunomodulator. CIM therapy has been shown to increase levels of the TH1 associated cytokines IL-12, TNF-α, and IFN-γ while decreasing levels of the TH2 associated cytokine IL-10. The author proposes a novel theory that CIM therapy during early Bb infection may promote a more appropriate immune response and increase the utility of antibiotic therapy during early stage Lyme disease, thus improving clinical outcomes of the disease."

For signal transmission in neurons, a neurotransmitter must bind to its receptor in order to produce an action potential. It is known that in Myasthenia Gravis (MG) cases, autoantibodies could block this binding. In the future, the treatment of MG could be achieved via modulation of molecular interaction between ACh and acetylcholine receptor (AChR). This study suggests that if an atom on a ligand (i.e. a neurotransmitter) is replaced with its isotope, it may cause charge redistribution such as that the binding between ligand and its receptor may be improved. Hence suggesting that with replacement of atoms with their isotopes in any biologically important ligand could alter its affinity towards its corresponding receptor, which would have a wide array of applications in medicine."

The inhibitory effect of calcium on heme iron absorption has been previously reported in the literature. This paper postulates that the gastrointestinal Ca transporter, TRPV6, might be a putative transporter of heme and might account for reduced heme absorption in the presence of Ca. The hypothesis needs to be investigated in vitro and in vivo with targeted TRPV6 deletion models to explore the nature of the competitive inhibition of heme uptake by Ca. Studies are required to characterize fully this function in the gut and in systemic metabolism. If the hypothesis is proven, modulators of TRPV6 expression could have clinical implications in the management of heme-induced disorders."

Obesity and metabolic syndrome, which are strongly associated with chronic low grade inflammation, are becoming increasingly understood to underlie a raft of morbid states including upper limb pain syndromes, diabetes (DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer and central nervous system dysfunction and degeneration. Notwithstanding age, two of the strongest established risk factors for AC are DM and CVD. The hypothesis argues that similar to DM and CVD, the inflammation and capsular fibrosis seen in AC is precipitated by metabolic syndrome and chronic low grade inflammation. These pathophysiological mechanisms are highly likely to be perpetuated by upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, sympathetic dominance of autonomic balance, and neuro-immune activation. The hypothesis predicts and describes how these processes may etiologically underpin and induce each sub-classification of AC. An improved understanding of the etiology of AC may lead to more accurate diagnosis, improved management, treatment outcomes, and reduce or prevent pain, disability and suffering associated with the disease. The paper follows on with a discussion of similarities between the pathophysiology of AC to general systemic inflammatory control mechanisms whereby connective tissue (CT) fibrosis is induced as a storage depot for leukocytes and chronic inflammatory cells. The potential role of hyaluronic acid (HA), the primary component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and CT, in the pathophysiology of AC is also discussed with potential treatment implications. Lastly, a biochemical link between physical and mental health through the ECM is described and the concept of a periventricular-limbic central driver of CT dysfunction is introduced."

The authors assume that an increased tissue pressure due to local and/or relapsing edema may be the cause for incomplete necrosis (e.g. demyelinated lesions) or seldom complete necrosis in the brain. Newly forming demyelinating lesions seldom show small tissue bands with normal appearing myelin sheaths in the immediate vicinity of precursor lesions (Baló type of MS). The small myelinated bands are the result of a “protected zone” on the edge of previous demyelinated lesions. The authors explain this protected zone with two arguments. Firstly, the resorptive granulation tissue of more or less older lesions is relatively rich in capillaries. These capillaries may act as an energy reservoir that can nourish not only the plaque, but also a narrow adjacent myelinated tissue band by diffusion, even if the capillary blood flow in this tissue band is limited due to the greater tissue pressure of a new developing lesion in the neighborhood. Secondly, another protective mechanism may act simultaneously: older or more sclerosed lesions and small adherent bands of myelinated tissue with them may swell less in cases of an edema than in normal tissue. The hardening of the older lesions is caused by proliferated fiber-forming astrocytes in the sense of scarring. In an area with an increased tissue pressure, the capillaries are less compressed in a sclerosed lesion than in regions of normal grey and white matter. In addition, the adherent myelinated tissue band closest to the edge of a hardened plaque is better protected against swelling and compression than the further away tissue. Theoretically, this protection zone is comparable with protected blood vessels in the Haversian canals or the medullary spaces of bones. Both theses of protecting mechanisms at the edges of demyelinated lesions support the assumption of a hypoxic causation principle of demyelinating lesions in Baló’s concentric sclerosis and multiple sclerosis."

Extensive literature on its mechanisms of action has come to characterize MDMA as a “messy” drug with multiple mechanisms, but the consensus is that the distinctive entactogenic effects arise from the release of neurotransmitters, primarily serotonin. I propose an alternative hypothesis: •The entactogenic mental state is due to the simultaneous direct activation of imidazoline-1 (I1) and serotonin-2 (5-HT2) receptors by MDMA. This hypothesis emerges from “mental organ” theory, which embodies many hypotheses, the most relevant of which are: •“Mental organs” are populations of neurons that all express their defining metabotropic receptor, and each mental organ plays a distinct role in the mind, a role shaped by evolution as mental organs evolve by duplication and divergence. Mental organs are the mechanism by which evolution sculpts the mind.•Mental organs can be in or out of consciousness.•In order for a mental organ to enter consciousness, three things must happen:○The mental organ must be activated directly at its defining receptor.○5-HT2 must be simultaneously activated. One of the functions of activated 5-HT2 is to load other simultaneously activated mental organs fully into consciousness.○In some cases THC must be introduced to remove long-term blocks mediated by the cannabinoid system. I propose the “primer/probe” method to test these hypotheses. A “primer” is a drug that selectively activates 5-HT2 (e.g. DOB or MEM) or serotonin-1 (5-HT1) and 5-HT2 (e.g. DOET or 2C-B-fly). A “probe” is a drug that activates a receptor whose corresponding mental organ we wish to load into consciousness in order to understand its role in the mind. The mental organ is loaded into consciousness when the primer and probe are taken together, but not when taken separately. For example, the blood pressure medications rilmenidine and moxonidine are selective for imidazoline-1 and can be used to test the hypothesis that the entactogenic mental effects of MDMA are due to loading the imidazoline-1 mental organ into consciousness. The primer/probe method is not limited to testing the specific hypothesis about MDMA and imidazoline, but is a general method for studying the role of mental organs in the mind. For example, the role of dopamine mental organs can be studied by using Parkinson’s drugs such as ropinirole or pramipexole as probes."

Although the etiology, progression and outcome of different neurodegenerative diseases are varied, they share chronic inflammation maintained largely by central nervous system (CNS)-derived antigens recognized by T cells. Inflammation can be beneficial by recruiting immune cells to kill pathogens or to clear cell debris resulting from the primary insult. However, chronic inflammation exacerbates and perpetuates tissue damage. An increasing number of therapies that attempt to modulate neuroinflammation have been developed. However, so far none has succeeded in decreasing the secondary damage associated with chronic inflammation. A potential strategy to modulate the immune system is related to the induction of tolerance to CNS antigens. In this line, it is our hypothesis that this could be accomplished by using anterior chamber associated immune deviation (ACAID) as a strategy. Thus, we review current knowledge regarding some neurodegenerative diseases and the associated immune response that causes inflammation. In addition, we discuss further our hypothesis of the possible usefulness of ACAID as a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate damage to the CNS."

abstract = "Patients with cervical spondylosis often present with some atypical symptoms such as vertigo, headache, palpitation, nausea, abdominal discomfort, tinnitus and blurred vision and hypomnesia. Although there are a few hypotheses about the etiology of those symptoms, none of them have provided evidence convincing enough to explain the clinical, pathological and anatomic manifestation of those symptoms. One of the more acceptable explanations is that those symptoms are the results of stimulation of the sympathetic nerves in the posterior longitudinal ligament. The clinical fact that dissection of the posterior longitudinal ligament significantly alleviates the severity of those symptoms seems like an evidence for the validity of this hypothesis. However, recent clinical studies showed that laminoplasty, which has no effect on the posterior longitudinal ligament, can achieve the similar effect. In this paper, we hypothesize that stimulation of the dura mater and spinal cord might be the cause of atypical symptoms in patients with cervical spondylosis."

abstract = "Acute dissection of the ascending aorta is a life-threatening condition in which the aortic wall develops one or more tears of the intima associated with intramural rupture of the media layer with subsequent formation of a two lumina vessel. The remaining outer layer is just the adventitia, with high risk of complete rupture. Vital organs may be under-perfused. Mortality rate in this acute event is about 50% if an emergent surgical procedure is not performed as soon as possible to replace the tract affected by the primary rupture. Nevertheless, the emergent surgical procedure is affected by high risk of mortality or severe neurologic sequelae, due to the need for deep hypothermia and cardiocirculatory arrest and different methods of cerebral protection. If the patient survives the acute event, a frequent outcome is the establishment of a chronic aortic dissection in the remaining aorta and late chronic dissecting aneurysm, usually starting from the surgical suture itself. Traumatism of surgical stitches and of direct blood flow pressure on weak aortic wall can be important contributing factors of the chronic disease. In conclusions, the majority of these patients undergoes a high risk operation without a complete solution of the disease. We hypothesize that excluding the aortic layers from the blood direct flow and using an anastomotic technique which does not include surgical stitches could help to significantly reduce the recurrence of aortic dissection after the acute event and shorten hypothermic arrest duration. We devised a double tubular prosthesis consisting of two concentric artificial tubes between which the aortic wall is confined and excluded from direct blood flow. We also devised a magnetic assisted sutureless anastomotic technique that seals the aortic tissue between the two prostheses and avoids the perforation of the fragile aortic wall with surgical stitches. We are presenting here this new prototype and draw a few different models. Both acute and chronic diseases of the aorta could benefit from the proposed technique, although acute dissection is the ideal scenario for its use."

Positive finding of the hypothesis will open possibility of using incretin based treatment modalities to treat or prevent acute OP induced disruption of glucose homeostasis."

However, the detailed mechanism involved has not been fully elucidated. Owing to its importance in the regulation of Ca2+ signaling, ER–mitochondrial distance in the neurons is tightly controlled in the physiological conditions. When the distance is decreased, Ca2+ overload occurs both in the cytosol and mitochondria. The cytosolic Ca2+ overload can (1) hyperactivate Ca2+-dependent enzymes, which in turn regulate activities of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, causing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and thereby resulting in the release of cytochrome c to activate caspase-3; (2) indirectly activate caspase-3 through the activation of caspase-12; and (3) promote the production and aggregation of β-amyloid. The three pathways eventually trigger neuronal apoptotic cell death. The mitochondrial Ca2+ overload can lead to increased generation of reactive oxygen species, inducing the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and ultimately causing neuronal apoptotic and necrotic cell death. The resultant death of neurons which are responsible for memory and cognition would contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, we propose that the reduction in the distance between ER and mitochondria may be implicated in AD pathology by enhanced Ca2+ signaling, which provides a more complete picture of the Ca2+ hypothesis of AD."

The labile nature of the intermediates has made proof of their existence difficult in natural biological conditions. In our studies on estrogen metabolism in vitro, in various tissues from several laboratory and domestic species, there was chromatographic evidence of formation of a stable estrogen metabolite that could be seen after incubation with radiolabeled estrone, but not with unlabeled substrate. Investigation with acid treatment of the metabolite yielded material detected as 6-hydroxy-estrone—suggesting the presence of an additional oxygen atom in the molecule. An identification of the “unknown compound” has not yet been made but, with this evidence, the properties revealed so far can best be met by assuming the presence of 5,6-epoxy-estrone. The recent favorable reports on the role of 5α,6α-epoxy-cholesterol in breast cancer has led to the hypothesis that the formation of a similar, stable epoxide of an estrogen could potentially be a compound of interest. If a metabolic pathway from estrone to 6-hydroxy-estrone through a stable epoxide has indeed been observed, it would suggest that identifying and screening for the enzymes responsible for its production, as opposed to those generating the catecholestrogens, could provide valuable information in relation to breast cancer. The balance in production of estrogen epoxides could be a key factor in determining normal health or risk of tumor development."

Recent research has demonstrated that low-load resistance training can elicit comparable hypertrophy to that of high-load resistance training when each set is performed until failure. The degree of metabolic fatigue would be greater for resistance training with lower loads compared to higher loads at the point of muscle failure, which may compensate for the lower mechanical stress. This may also explain why muscle hypertrophy occurs to varying magnitudes when activities such as cycling and walking are performed. Furthermore, the application of blood flow restriction to the working muscles during these activities induces greater hypertrophy albeit at the same level of mechanical stress, which would suggest a possible contribution from metabolic stress. Thus, it is plausible that both mechanical and metabolic stimuli are primary mechanisms for muscle hypertrophy and the degree of contributions of both stimuli determines the exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy."

The condition is characterised by a clinical triad of symptoms; homogentisic aciduria from birth, ochronosis (darkening) of collagenous tissues (from ∼30years of age) and ochronotic osteoarthropathy in weight bearing joints due to long term ochronosis in them (from ∼40years of age). Tyrosinase, a polyphenol oxidase has been shown in many species to contribute to the darkening of tissues in many organisms; including humans in the production of melanin. Tyrosinase under the right conditions shows alterations in its substrate specificity and may contribute to the darkening seen in AKU where it moves away from polymerising tyrosine but also homogentisic acid, the causative molecule in alkaptonuria, that is present in excess."

Intrathecal IgG is produced by B lineage cells that entered the CNS, but why and when these cells invade the CNS of patients with MS is unknown. The intrathecal IgG response in patients with MS is polyspecific and part of it is directed against different common viruses (e.g. measles virus, rubella virus, varicella zoster virus). Strong and consistent evidence suggests an association of MS and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection and EBV seroprevalence in patients with MS is practically 100%. However, intriguingly, despite of the universal EBV seroprevalence, the frequency of intrathecally produced IgG to EBV in patients with MS is much lower than that of intrathecally produced IgG to other common viruses. The acute phase of primary EBV infection is characterized by a strong polyclonal B cell activation. As typical for humoral immune responses against viruses, EBV specific IgG is produced only with a temporal delay after acute EBV infection. Aiming to put the above facts into a logical structure, we here propose the hypothesis that in individuals going on to develop MS antibody producing B lineage cells invade the CNS predominantly at the time of and triggered by acute primary EBV infection. Because at the time of acute EBV infection EBV IgG producing B lineage cells have not yet occurred, the hypothesis could explain the universal EBV seroprevalence and the low frequency of intrathecally produced IgG to EBV in patients with MS. Evidence supporting the hypothesis could be provided by large prospective follow-up studies of individuals with symptomatic primary EBV infection (infectious mononucleosis). Furthermore, the clarification of the molecular mechanism underlying an EBV induced invasion of B lineage cells into the CNS of individuals going on to develop MS could corroborate it, too. If true, our hypothesis would link EBV infection, the most important environmental risk factor for MS, with intrathecal IgG synthesis, the most characteristic laboratory feature of MS. Besides explaining the origin of intrathecal IgG synthesis in patients with MS, the hypothesis could thus also provide a conceptual framework for clarifying the mechanism through which EBV contributes to the development of MS."

CD is a chronic, immune-mediated condition of the small intestine caused by permanent intolerance to dietary gluten.

In this hypothesis we propose to apply a well-known and used image processing technology in echocardiography, speckle tracking (ST), to lung sliding – the marker of normal lung function. If implementing ST to lung sliding is technically feasible, several outcomes are expected: (1) Lung sliding will become an objective, operator-independent marker of normal lung function. (2) Subsequently, ST will provide normal values for lung sliding. (3) Lastly, the effects of pulmonary pathologies on lung sliding may be assessed. It is stressed, however, that the preliminary idea suggested here is limited to a single physiological phenomenon (lung sliding). Only when technical feasibility is demonstrated then ST technology may potentially be applied and investigated in other clinical settings of lung diseases."

Low and middle income countries have a higher burden of refractive error, which we propose could be a consequence of a shorter exposure time to a westernized lifestyle, a phenomenon that may also explain the rapid increase in cardiometabolic diseases, such as diabetes, among those populations. We suggest that interactions between genetic, epigenetic and a rapidly changing environment are also involved in myopia onset and progression. Furthermore, we discuss several possible mechanisms by which insulin resistance may promote abnormal ocular growth and myopia to support the hypothesis that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are involved in its pathogenesis, providing a link between trends in myopia and those of cardiometabolic diseases. There is evidence that insulin have direct ocular growth promoting effects as well an indirect effect via the induction of insulin-like growth factors leading to decreases insulin-like growth factor-binding protein, also implicated in ocular growth."

Thus, since cytokine levels in tumor bearing host would be differential among local (intratumoral lesion, peritumoral normal tissue), and systemic sample site (serum), these differences might be significantly correlated to prognosis and treatment outcome for cancer patients. Previously, despite small number of patients, we demonstrated the feasibility of this proposition via only cytokine profiling.

However, some theorists have argued that delusions are normal or rational cognitive responses to abnormal experiences. That is, when a recently experienced peculiar event is more plausibly explained by an extraordinary hypothesis, confidence in the veracity of this extraordinary explanation is reinforced. As the number of such experiences, driven by the primary disease process in the perceptual domain, increases, this confidence builds and solidifies, forming a delusion. We tried to understand the formation of delusions using a simulation based on Bayesian inference. We found that (1) even if a delusional explanation is only marginally more plausible than a non-delusional one, the repetition of the same experience results in a firm belief in the delusion. (2) The same process explains the systematization of delusions. (3) If the perceived plausibility of the explanation is not consistent but varies over time, the development of a delusion is delayed. Additionally, this model may explain why delusions are not corrected by persuasion or rational explanation. This Bayesian inference perspective can be considered a way to understand delusions in terms of rational human heuristics. However, such experiences of “rationality” can lead to irrational conclusions, depending on the characteristics of the subject."

abstract = "Type 2 diabetes and its comorbidity insulin resistance is a major public health problem in developed countries and those with the disorder have up to a fourfold increased risk of cardiovascular disease relative to those without the disease. The cardiovascular complications are believed to be due largely to multiple mechanisms relating to hyperglycemia that defines the disease. Overweight and obesity are the predominant risk factors and lifestyle changes aimed at reducing weight and increasing physical activity are the basis for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. The role of diet in type 2 diabetes has been investigated widely, but the results have been inconclusive. Recently two large meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies found that dairy product consumption was inversely associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. Numerous observational studies including large prospective studies found that a high intake of dairy fat or markers of dairy fat were inversely associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. These observations suggest that dairy fat could contain components with anti-diabetogenic properties. Candidates for the antidiabetic affect are rumenic and vaccenic acids, phytanic and pristanic acids vitamin A and β-carotene and butyric acid. The role of these compounds in glucose homeostasis and energy balance is discussed. A common feature is that all are agonists for one or more of the three PPAR isoforms that are expressed in metabolically active tissue, such as the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue where they play a critical role in regulating energy balance and the metabolism of fatty acids and glucose, the main energy sources. Because PPARs have a larger ligand binding pocket than other nuclear receptors they can be activated by a wide range of agonists. Whereas individual components may not be present in sufficient concentration to produce a physiological effect such an effect may be obtained by several components acting in concert, and forms the basis of the hypothesis. PPAR agonists such as anthocyanidins and resveratrol present in nondairy items may also contribute to outcome. In addition, PPAR-α, -β and -γ are abundant in brown adipose tissue where agonists and cold exposure induce uncoupling protein-1 expression in the mitochondria where it acts to generate heat at the expense of storing energy. Animal studies demonstrated that most milk fat bioactive compounds induced uncoupling protein-1 expression in brown adipose tissue, which was associated with suppression of diet-induced obesity and improvement in insulin sensitivity."

When given parenterally DHAA minimizes infarct volume and facilitates functional recovery. I hypothesize the same effect will occur in humans with acute ischemic stroke. Efficacy in reducing infarct volume is demonstrable in mice and rats even when DHAA is infused three hours after the experimental infarct. Moreover, there is fivefold mechanistic rational for DHA beside excellent pharmacokinetics and rapid penetration of brain and conversion to protective AA: (1) in ischemic brain, there is a precipitous decline in AA which can be reversed by intravenous DHAA; (2) after reduction of DHAA to AA in both normal and ischemic brain, AA can reduce oxidized vitamin E and glutathione, other protectors of brain against damaging reactive oxygen species which build up in ischemic brain; (3) AA itself can protect brain against damaging reactive oxygen species; (4) AA is an essential cofactor for several enzymes in brain including ten-eleven translocase-2 which upregulates production of protective molecules like brain-derived neurotrophic factor; and (5) DHAA after conversion to AA prevents both lipid oxidation and presumably oxidation of other labile substances (e.g., dopamine) in ischemic brain. In terms of safety, based on all available animal information, DHAA is safe in the proposed dosing regimen. For human clinical trials, the methodology for conducting the proposed animal safety, clinical pharmacology and phase II efficacy studies is straightforward. Finally, if DHAA preserved brain substance and function in humans, it could be employed in pre-hospital stroke patients."

abstract = "Currently, immune activation is proven to be the basis for the HIV infection pathogenesis and a strong predictor of the disease progression. Among the causes of systemic immune activation the virus and its products, related infectious agents, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and regulatory CD4+ T cells’ decrease are considered. Recently microbial translocation (bacterial products yield into the bloodstream as a result of the gastrointestinal tract mucosal barrier integrity damage) became the most popular hypothesis. Previously, we have found an association between immune complexes present in the bloodstream of HIV infected patients and the T cell activation. On this basis, we propose a significantly modified hypothesis of immune activation in HIV infection. It is based on the immune complexes’ participation in the immunocompetent cells’ activation. Immune complexes are continuously formed in the chronic phase of the infection. Together with TLR-ligands (viral antigens, bacterial products coming from the damaged gut) present in the bloodstream they interact with macrophages. As a result macrophages are transformed into the type II activated forms. These macrophages block IL-12 production and start synthesizing IL-10. High level of this cytokine slows down the development of the full-scale Th1-response. The anti-viral reactions are shifted towards the serogenesis. Newly synthesized antibodies’ binding to viral antigens leads to continuous formation of the immune complexes capable of interacting with antigen-presenting cells."

abstract = "Migraine is a prevalent disease, which may cause significant discomfort and reduced functioning for days, including the preictal and postictal periods. During the interictal period, however, migraineurs seem to function normally. It is puzzling, therefore, that event-related potentials (ERPs) of migraine patients often differ at the group level also in the asymptomatic, interictal phase, both in early and later ERP waves. Furthermore both types of ERP waves demonstrate changes, which are often noticed 12–48h before a migraine attack and continue throughout it. On the basis of previous work, it might be possible to associate these ERP differences and their dynamics with changes in patient attention, which might be further associated with stress. This paper suggests that such stress-related dynamics can explain both the ERP findings as well as the dynamics in clinical symptoms throughout the migraine cycle. It further suggests that migraine can be viewed as a (dysfunctional) stress-reducing solution. In this sense migraine can be viewed as a representative case for other stress-related and psychopathological disorders, which are also stress-reducing solutions."

On the contrary, inositol administration to women suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been proven to efficiently counteract most of the clinical hallmarks displayed by PCOS patients, including insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism and oligo-amenorrhea. We have recently observed that myo-inositol induces significant changes in cytoskeletal architecture of breast cancer cells, by modulating different biochemical pathways, eventually modulating the epithelial–mesenchymal transition. We hypothesize that inositol and its monophosphate derivatives, besides their effects on insulin transduction, may efficiently revert histological and functional features of cystic ovary by inducing cytoskeleton rearrangements. We propose an experimental model that could address not only whether inositol modulates cytoskeleton dynamics in both normal and cystic ovary cells, but also whether this effect may interfere with ovarian steroidogenesis. A more compelling understanding of the mechanisms of action of inositol (and its derivatives) would greatly improve its therapeutic utilization, by conferring to current treatments a well-grounded scientific rationale."

It almost exclusively occurs in young children. While risk factors and the underlying histopathology have been identified, the pathogenesis of postpump chorea, crucially, remains largely unknown. Transient cerebral hypoperfusion associated with cardiopulmonary bypass is considered a likely candidate mechanism, but the evidence is insufficient and inconclusive. It is hypothesized in this article, that postpump chorea may be caused by mechanical trauma to red blood cells and resulting acanthocytosis. These dysfunctional erythrocytes could then lead to damage to the globus pallidus and disease development akin to that presumed in neuroacanthocytosis. In patients with neuroacanthocytosis an association between acanthocytosis and basal ganglia pathology has been suggested. To test the mechanism hypothesized here, the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass on erythrocyte morphology and function could be systematically tested in children undergoing cardiac surgery. Ideally, the extent of erythrocyte damage could be correlated with the risk of developing postpump chorea. Finally, if the proposed hypothesis is supported by empirical findings, efforts to reduce blood cell damage during extracorporeal circulation in children might prevent this devastating complication."

The most effective regimen for treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria is based on artemisinin and its derivatives. The drugs are highly effective, resulting in rapid clearance of parasites even in severe P. falciparum malaria patients. During the last five years, artemisinin-resistant parasites have begun to emerge first in Cambodia and now in Thailand and Myanmar. At present, the level of artemisinin resistance is relatively low with clinical presentation of delayed artemisinin clearance (a longer time to reduce parasite load) and a small decrease in artemisinin sensitivity in cultured isolates. Nevertheless, multiple genetic loci associated with delayed parasite clearance have been reported, but they cannot account for a large portion of cases. Even the most well-studied kelch 13 propeller mutations cannot always predict the outcome of artemisinin treatment in vitro and in vivo. Here we propose that delayed clearance by artemisinin could be the result of convergent evolution, driven by multiple trajectories to overcome artemisinin-induced stress, but precluded to become full blown resistance by high fitness cost. Genetic association studies by several genome-wide approaches reveal linkage disequilibrium between multiple loci and delayed parasite clearance. Genetic manipulations at some of these loci already have resulted in loss in artemisinin sensitivity. The notion presented here is by itself consistent with existing evidence on artemisinin resistance and has the potential to be explored using available genomic data. Most important of all, molecular surveillance of artemisinin resistance based on multi-genic markers could be more informative than relying on any one particular molecular marker."

The majority of the rubella virus replication complexes originate from the endomembrane system. The rubella virus perturbs the signaling pathways regulating the formation of autophagic membranes in the infected cells, including the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. It is widely accepted that these pathways inhibit autophagy. In contrast, the class III PI3K enzymes are essential for autophagy initiation. By manipulating the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, class I PI3K/Akt and class III PI3K axes of signal transduction, the rubella virus may differentially regulate the autophagic cascade, with consequent stimulation of the initiation and strong suppression of the later phases. Dysregulation of autophagy by this virus can have a significant impact on the construction of replication compartments by regulating membrane trafficking. We hypothesize that the rubella virus perturbs the autophagic process in order to prevent the degradation of the virus progeny, and to ensure its replication by hijacking omegasomes for the construction of the replication complexes. The virus is therefore able to utilize an antiviral mechanism to its own advantage. Therapeutic modalities targeting the autophagic process may help to ameliorate the serious consequences of the congenital rubella syndrome."

In foraging societies, women contribute nutrients to their social groups/family units to a greater degree as overall effective temperatures (ETs) rise. Where the ET is favorable for women’s contributions (ETs between 15 and 20), selection does lengthen the PRLS of women because women contribute sufficiently to enhance their own inclusive fitness. Paleo-environment records suggest that the climate necessary to encourage an increase PRLS occurred shortly after the younger dryad in emerging subtropical settings.

Presentation of the hypothesis
There might be is a causal link between the plasma membrane lipid composition and the miRNA expression of monocytes and endothelial cells. PUFA enrichment of cells may affect the type and the amount of particular miRNAs produced. In this way dietary fatty acids are supposed to impact the miRNA-mediated regulation of vascular inflammatory processes.
Proposed experimental setting to test the hypothesis
PUFA-supplemented monocytes and endothelial cells are analyzed with respect to membrane fatty acid patterns, typical markers of vascular inflammation and miRNA expression. Experiments are performed both for undifferentiated/unstimulated as well as for differentiated/stimulated cells. Verification of identified miRNA targets is performed by means of mimics/antagomirs.
Implications of the hypothesis
Innovative mechanism of action, which could point the way to a new understanding of the PUFA-mediated modulation of cellular signal transduction. If confirmed experimentally, it might stimulate vascular inflammation research and immunologic lipid science, hence, acting as source of inspiration for future therapeutic interventions in vascular diseases."

abstract = "Background
Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are increasingly used for long-term mechanical circulatory support and are effective in improving survival and quality-of-life of patient with advanced heart failure. Nonetheless, they are associated with significant early and late morbidity rates (including pump thrombosis, thromboembolic events, and pump dysfunction). These complications are at least partially associated with suboptimal pump positioning. Currently, we are missing tools to further improve the positioning of LVAD devices in a patient-specific fashion.
Methods and evaluation of the hypothesis
We hypothesized that the analysis of the implanted device in patients presenting selected LVAD-related complications through segmentation and three-dimensional reconstruction of CT scans may provide patient-specific information into mechanical factors contributing to pump dysfunction and thromboembolic events, with potential to guide preventive interventions against development of new complications. We also hypothesized that preoperative virtual implantation and computer-assisted surgery in candidates to LVAD implantation may help in the customization of device positioning, with potential to minimize severe complications. The hypothesis was evaluated in a multidisciplinary fashion (cardiac surgeons, biomedical engineers and biomedical images processing experts). CT scans of 14 LVAD recipients were reconstructed through semi-automatic segmentation (including the whole heart, the implanted device and the chest wall). A coordinate system was built to quantify the coaxiality of the LVAD apical cannula with the mitral annulus. Patients were stratified into Group 1 (presenting complications such as thromboembolic events, pump dysfunction or thrombosis) and Group 2 (no complications). Group 1 patients presented significantly greater average rotation of the apical cannula towards the interventricular septum (p=0.015), although no difference was observed in terms of average rotation towards the anterior or posterior left ventricular wall.
Conclusions
Several patient-specific factors (including left ventricular morphology and chest wall conflict with the device after wound closure) may influence the effectiveness and safety of LVAD therapy, but they are difficultly managed through the current implantation techniques. We suggest that the clinical results of LVAD treatment can be improved through preoperative virtual implantation and computer-assisted surgery (in order to guide device selection, exact site of left ventricular wall coring site). Given these preliminary results, we are examining larger patient datasets in order to further test the hypothesis. Dedicated tools for virtual implantation are currently under development."

These injuries result from difficult first labours, persistent physical efforts during defaecation, and, medical and surgical techniques for evacuation of the uterus. The neuro-immunohistochemical “signatures” of these injuries are variations of the Dixon–Robertson–Brosens (DRB) lesion in preeclampsia, where there is hyperplasia of the tunica intima and media of arterioles with narrowing of the lumen of the vessel. In stage IV, nulliparous “endometriosis” (and other gynaecological conditions) there are circumferential layers of abnormal nerves around a narrowed arteriole, whereas in early-onset preeclampsia (and other obstetric conditions) there are similar histological findings in uterine arterioles but there is no sign of injured nerves. During pregnancy there is elongation of blood vessels but no elongation of injured nerves leading to relative denervation of the myometrium. These lesions are detectable in most of the “great” obstetric syndromes, and, across the spectrum of gynaecological syndromes. They provide a coherent explanation of the natural history and clinical presentations of many of these syndromes. Clinical features vary with the site, nature and extent of the injury; a minor injury may enable pregnancy though it is complicated by late-onset pre-eclampsia whereas a more extensive injury may prevent pregnancy and present with chronic pelvic pain with, or without, endometriosis."

Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of death in these patients. Although several drugs are approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that reduce factors associated with myocardial infarction, an excess risk of death is still present. In this regard, the American Diabetes Association recommends metformin (oral glucose lowering drug) as the first-line therapy in type 2 diabetic subjects, based on its amply confirmed positive metabolic effects; however, its capacity to reduce cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic subjects is inconclusive. Thus, mortality reduction in these patients has been an elusive goal, and is therefore, imperative to evaluate new pharmacological interventions that may favorably impact mortality in these individuals. On the other hand, epidemiological studies have suggested that moderate consumption of cacao-derived products (i.e., chocolate and cocoa) may reduce the risk of diabetes, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease-associated mortality. Moreover, interventional studies have also suggested that dark chocolate and cocoa consumption is vasculoprotective in normal and type 2 diabetic individuals. (−)-Epicatechin ((−)-EPI) is the main flavanol present in cacao, and suggested to be responsible for the beneficial effects observed after dark chocolate/cocoa consumption. Interestingly, in vivo studies have evidenced the capacity of (−)-EPI to reduce infarct size, and preserve cardiac mechanics in rodent models of ischaemia–reperfusion injury. Nonetheless, long-term studies using (−)-EPI and evaluating its effects on mortality are lacking. Thus, based on their particular properties, it is valid to speculate that (−)-EPI and metformin in conjunction may favorably impact mortality in type 2 diabetic individuals. Here, we provide the evidence that allow us to propose our hypothesis, and further suggest a reasonable way to perform the study needed for such investigation."

abstract = "The survival of multi-cellular organisms depends on the organism ability to maintain glucose homeostasis for time of low/high nutrient availability or high energy needs, and the ability to fight infections or stress. These effects are realized through the insulin controlled transport of blood glucose into the insulin-responsive cells such as muscle, fat and liver cells. Reduction in the ability of these cells to take glucose from the blood in response to normal circulating levels of insulin is known as insulin resistance (IR). Chronic IR is a key pathological feature of obesity, type 2 diabetes, sepsis and cancer cachexia, however temporal IR are widely met in fasting/ hibernation, pregnancy, anti-bacterial immunity, exercise and stress. Paradoxically, a certain part of the IR-cases is associated with catabolic metabolism, whereas the other is related to anabolic pathways. How can this paradoxical IR-response be explained? What is the metabolic basis of this IR variability and its physiological and pathological impacts? An answer to these questions might be achieved through the hypothesis in which IR is considered as a two-sided mechanism acting under opposite metabolic conditions (catabolism and anabolism) but with the common aim to sustain glucose homeostasis in a wide metabolic range. To test this hypothesis, I examined the main metabolic distinctions between the varied IR-cases and their dependence on the blood glucose concentration, level of the IR-threshold, and catabolic/anabolic activation. On the basis of the established interrelations, a simple model of IR-distribution has been developed. The model revealed the «U-type distribution» form with separation into two main IR-groups, each determined in the catabolic or anabolic conditions with one exception – type 2 diabetes and its paradoxical catabolic activation in anabolic conditions. The dual opposing (or complementary) role for the IR opens a new possibility for better understanding the cause and consequences of transition from adaptive IR-responses to its pathological forms."

The Wnt signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the proper development and maintenance of brain and bone structure and function. Dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dkk1), a vital antagonist of the Wnt signaling, was reported to be closely associated with bone homeostasis and osteoporosis. Interestingly, high level of Dkk1 in the brain increases the risk of AD. It is suggested that Dkk1 may be a common potent risk factor involved in osteoporosis and AD. Therefore, we hypothesize that Dkk1 may play a role in both osteoporosis and AD. Our hypothesis will shed new light on the understanding of the relationship between these two diseases and help to explain some common characters of osteoporosis and AD."

Lithium, in pharmacological doses, has been used successfully for decades in treating bipolar disorders, and has been shown to decrease violent crime in this situation. Interestingly, lithium, in trace amounts, as occurs in some drinking water, has been inversely related to aggression, and suicidal and homicidal violence. Lithium is naturally found in vegetables, grains and drinking water, and dietary intake varies from nearly zero to 3mg daily. Elemental lithium, in trace doses, has been shown to improve mood in weeks. Moreover, lithium, in trace amounts, has no toxicity. In order to ensure adequate dietary intakes of elemental lithium daily for the purpose of decreasing aggression and violence, we propose considering the fortification of cereal grain products with lithium and also the addition of lithium to vitamin preparations for adults. Importantly, randomized trials in various populations are needed to test this hypothesis."

In the current article, we propose that dysfunction of the mesocortico-limbic reward system contributes to the emergence of the WHO-identified risk behaviors (tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol), behaviors that underlie the evolution of major non-communicable diseases (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases). Given that dopaminergic neurons of the mesocortico-limbic system are tightly associated with reward-related processes and motivation, their dysfunction may fundamentally influence behavior. While nicotine and alcohol alter dopamine neuron function by influencing some receptors, mesocortico-limbic system dysfunction was associated with elevation of metabolic set-point leading to hedonic over-eating. Although there is some empirical evidence, precise molecular mechanism for linking physical inactivity and mesocortico-limbic dysfunction per se seems to be missing; identification of which may contribute to higher success rates for interventions targeting lifestyle changes pertaining to physical activity. In the current article, we compile evidence in support of a link between exercise and the mesocortico-limbic system by elucidating interactions on the axis of muscle – irisin – brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) – and dopaminergic function of the midbrain. Irisin is a contraction-regulated myokine formed primarily in skeletal muscle but also in the brain. Irisin stirred considerable interest, when its ability to induce browning of white adipose tissue parallel to increasing thermogenesis was discovered. Furthermore, it may also play a role in the regulation of behavior given it readily enters the central nervous system, where it induces BDNF expression in several brain areas linked to reward processing, e.g. the ventral tegmental area and the hippocampus. BDNF is a neurotropic factor that increases neuronal dopamine content, modulates dopamine release relevant for neuronal plasticity and increased neuronal survival as well as learning and memory. Further linking BDNF to dopaminergic function is BDNF’s ability to activate tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor that shares signalization with presynaptic dopamine-3 receptors in the ventral tegmental area. Summarizing, we propose that the skeletal muscle derived irisin may be the link between physical activity and reward-related processes and motivation. Moreover alteration of this axis may contribute to sedentary lifestyle and subsequent non-communicable diseases. Preclinical and clinical experimental models to test this hypothesis are also proposed."

On the other hand, several studies indicated the pivotal role of inflammation in the etiology of miscarriage, preeclampsia and adverse pregnancy outcome. Here, it is hypothesized that excessive salt intake around the time of conception or during pregnancy can trigger inflammatory processes, which consequently associated with increased risk of miscarriage, preeclampsia or adverse pregnancy outcome. Thus, this hypothesis suggests that low salt intake around the time of conception or during pregnancy can decrease the risk of miscarriage or adverse pregnancy outcome.

We hypothesize that during development some of the “hits” needed for the onset of leukemia are usually occurring (being part of the normal development), so leukemogenesis needs less mutations than in adults to take place and therefore it’s more probable. The switch between the relative incidence of acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemias may be related to the changes of the percentage of lymphoid-deficient and lymphoid-proficient sub-set of HSCs during development. Further investigations may clarify this hypothesis, elucidating also the roles of the different microenvironments in determining the myeloid/lymphoid predisposition of the HSCs."

The characteristics of cartilage structure, especially avascular, make it a limited capacity of self-renewal. Articular cartilage defect or damage result from various causes will lead to degenerative osteoarthritis (OA). Surgical treatment and non-surgical treatment can temporarily alleviate symptoms to some extent but can’t fundamentally restore the normal structure and function of cartilage, and therefore give rise to progressive degeneration. Autologous or allogeneic cartilage transplantation has been employed to the treatment of osteoarthritis for years. Nevertheless, the major deficiency of cartilage grafting is the inability and insufficiency to repair large cartilage defect. Implants are also unable to integrate with native tissue well. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) can be easily isolated from subcutaneous fat tissues and harvest as intact cell sheets containing extracellular matrix (ECM), intercellular connect, ion channel, growth factor receptors, nexin and other important cell surface proteins by means of temperature-responsive culture dish (TCD). A cell sheet can provide a large amount of extracellular matrix, fibronectin, and cells contributing to the integration of cartilage. Decellularized extracellular matrix (DECM) of cartilage debris with excellent cell affinity and signal transduction is capable of driving cartilage homeostasis and regeneration. Appropriate decellularization process would remove cellular remnants of cartilage debris, keep the mechanical properties, and avoid the adverse immune response of allografts effectively. Micro-porous cartilage debris conduces to cell migration and angiogenesis. The cell-round shape of adipose-derived stem cells cultured in the three-dimensional (3D) system provided by hydrogel is more susceptible to chondrogenic stimulation and prevents it from fibroblast-like phenotypic conversion. We hypothesize that adipose-derived stem cell sheet encapsulated construct of micro-porous decellularized cartilage debris and hydrogel can effectively promote regeneration of cartilage defect. The construct of decellularized cartilage debris and hydrogel provide a favorable microenvironment for stem cells. Adipose-derived stem cells sheet supply fibronectin, collagen, and cells contributing to integration and regeneration of cartilage restore. Moreover, the constructs can be shaped and fabricated according to the configuration of target defect, especially in osteoarthritis, which is promising for clinical application."

While stem cell transplantation is a promising approach to stimulating cardiac repair, its success in humans has thus far been limited. Harnessing the therapeutic benefits of stem cells requires a better understanding of their mechanisms of action and methods to optimize their function. Cardiac stem cells (CSC) represent a particularly effective cellular source for cardiac repair, and pre-conditioning CSC with electrical stimulation (EleS) was demonstrated to further enhance their function, although the mechanisms are unknown. Recent studies suggest that transplanted stem cells primarily exert their effects through communicating with endogenous tissues via the release of exosomes containing cardioprotective molecules such as miRNAs, which upon uptake by recipient cells may stimulate survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Exosomes are also effective therapeutic agents in isolation and may provide a feasible alternative to stem cell transplantation. We hypothesize that EleS enhances CSC-mediated cardiac repair through its beneficial effects on production of cardioprotective exosomes. Moreover, we hypothesize that the beneficial effects of biventricular pacing in patients with heart failure may in part result from EleS-induced preconditioning of endogenous CSC to promote cardiac repair. With future research, our hypothesis may provide applications to optimize stem cell therapy and augment current pacing protocols, which may significantly advance the treatment of patients with heart disease."

Among all the recommended clinical options, cartilage tissue engineering (CTE) which is highlighted of dominant features and less drawbacks for functional cartilage restoration, has been emphasized recently. Shock waves, a mode of therapeutic mechanical forces, utilized in extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), is hypothesized to enhance proliferation, chondrogenic differentiation, and cartilage extracellular matrix production of target cells seeded on bioactive scaffolds. The hypothesis is firstly based on cellular mechanotransduction by which cells convent the shockwave mechanical signals into biochemical responses via integrins, iron channels, cytoskeletal filaments, growth factor receptors and nuclei. Secondly, by modulating gene expression and up-regulating the release of various growth factors which are of vital importance in three-dimensional cartilage culture environment, ESWT holds a promising potential to favor the cell sources (e.g. chondrocytes and stem cells) to mimic the optimal functional cartilage. In all, on the basis of cellular mechanotransduction and previous evidence, the hypothesis is developed to support the beneficial effects of ESWT on chondrogenesis in CTE. If this hypothesis is confirmed, shockwaves may allow a better success in combination with other stimulating factors for cartilage repair. There is a paucity of studies investigating the assistant role of shockwave stimulation in CTE. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms, and explore effectiveness and appropriate protocols of this novel stimulative factor in cartilage tissue engineering."

Our field has focused on positive symptoms to the exclusion of cognitive deterioration and emotional blunting. Dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter responsible for the accumulation and processing of new information as well as the expression of emotions modulated via the nucleus accumbens. Data suggests that patients receiving less accumulated antipsychotic agents do better over the years in achieving meaningful recoveries. In addition to clinical improvement, there is the financial benefit in giving less medication, which is often costly, over several decades. Finally, there is the possibility, albeit not yet demonstrated, that less accumulated antipsychotic agents might reduce the occurrence of significant weight gain, the metabolic syndrome, with its accompanying medical complications which not only impacts the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it, but also increases the financial burden to society."

Most surgical techniques are associated with a variety of intraoperative and postoperative complications. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is extremely rich in growth factors and cytokines, which regulate tissue reconstruction and has been studied extensively among trauma patients and trauma experimental models. To date, however, there is no evidence to support or oppose its use in women who suffer from SUI due to PUL damage. PRP is an easily produced and relatively inexpensive biologic material. It is produced directly from the patient’s blood and is, thus, superior to synthetic materials in terms of potential adverse effects such as from foreign body reaction. In the present article we summarize the existing evidence in the field, which supports the conduct of animal experimental and clinical studies to elucidate the potential role of PRP in treating SUI."

abstract = "Osteoporosis is a disorder of bone in which the mass of the bone is reduced and the bone’s architecture at the microscopic level is disordered. Together those abnormalities predispose affected individuals to experience fractures despite only minimal trauma (i.e., fragility fractures). Age related osteoporosis is a common type of osteoporosis that occurs with aging in both men and women usually beginning after the age of peak bone mass. Research has found that the disorder can be partially reversed by reducing the net amount of acid that is produced when consuming typical Western diets. However, the amelioration that results has not been so dramatic or so consistent that physicians have adopted the procedure as part of the standard treatment for age-related osteoporosis. We propose that reducing the net acid load from the diet is not sufficient to reverse age related osteoporosis because it fails to supply base needed to restore the large amount of base in bone that had been lost by reacting with the net acid load of the diet that had been consumed for years or decades. Reducing the net acid load from the diet might be expected to have little ameliorative effect or merely slow the progression of the disorder. We hypothesize that both to restore osteoporotic bone to, or nearly to, its pre-disease state, as well as to eliminate the risk of fragility fractures, requires consuming diets that produce net amounts of base to restore the base lost from years to decades of consuming diets that produce net amounts of acid. We hypothesize also that the excess base and attendant subclinical metabolic alkalosis will both stimulate the cellular process of bone formation and suppress the cellular process of bone resorption, and thereby implement the restorative process."

abstract = "Blood pressure (BP) monitoring devices are very commonly used by the general public for self-measurement. Approximately 19% of people using these devises check their BP every day or almost every day and only one third use them because their doctor recommended it. Measurement often causes anxiety and anxiety increases blood pressure in the short term. Elderly patients often visit the emergency room (ER) due to these BP elevations. Almost 10% of patients presenting to ERs complained of high BP, and between 50–75% of them receive antihypertensive drugs (sometimes with serious adverse effects) despite the fact that only 7.5% are classified as hypertensive emergencies, and only 2.8% are at risk of serious outcome. Two studies suggested the use of anxiolitics in the treatment of excessive hypertension. When compared to captopril, treatment with diazepam or alprazolam showed to be effective in lowering BP, with no significant difference between the two groups. We therefore suggest that patients with acute elevations of BP (measured at home) try an anxiolytic before deciding to go to the ER. Patients in which BP lowers with the use of tranquilizers do not need to go to the ER. We also suggest using this strategy in patients visiting community clinics and ER for the same reason. Our hypothesis is that by using our suggestions there will be a significant reduction in the number of unnecessary visits to the ER, the use of medication that may produce serious adverse effects, and an important health cost reduction, without increasing the risk for patients (a 10% reduction of ER visits may save up to 300 million dollars/year in the US alone and prevent unnecessary use of medical facilities and manpower)."

Each psychotic episode causes irreversible cortical gray matter loss, that causes the patients to never regain their previous state of functioning. Microglial cells are part of the innate immune system and their functions, among others, include phagocytosis and release of neurotrophic factors. They have a key impact on developmental and plasticity-induced removal of neuronal precursors, live-but-stressed neurons and synapses, while also stimulating synaptic growth and development. We hypothesize that microglia are the culprit for the cortical gray matter loss in schizophrenia through abnormal synaptic pruning, phagocytosis of stressed neurons and lacking neurotrophic factor release. Furthermore, we propose a research that could validate the hypotheses using serum samples of first-episode early-onset patients. By measuring the serum levels of milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8), subcomponent in the classical pathway of complement activation (C1q), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), we could gain an insight into the state of microglial activation during various stages of the disease. If this hypothesis is valid, new targeted drugs could be developed in order to reduce the deterioration of cortical gray matter, thereby possibly improving negative symptoms and cognitive deficits."

The intracellular transport of vitamin A is assisted by proteins called cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBP I/II). The absorption, storage and usage of vitamin A are regulated by a protein called lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), a retinol-related enzyme that transfers an acyl group derived from an sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine to retinol. LRAT is a member of the protein family which includes HRAS-like tumor suppressors (HRASLS). However, the HRASLS proteins never use retinol as an acyl acceptor. The mechanisms underlying the different substrate specificities between LRAT and HRASLS proteins are unknown. We propose in this report that LRAT physically interacts with CRBP and the LRAT–CRBP complex represents the binding pockets for both an acyl group and retinol, thus assuring the substrate specificity of LRAT."

Considering this, we propose that reactive oxygen species (ROS) including especially nitric oxide (NO) are likely to be a key concept to understand the emergency related to CO poisoning and to discover new therapeutic modalities in CO toxicity. If we consider the hypothesis that ROS is involved greatly in acute and chronic toxic effects of CO on CNS and some other vital organs such as heart, it follows that the antioxidant and anti-NO therapies might give the clinicians more opportunities to prevent deep CNS injury. In support of this, we review the subject in essence and summarize clinical and experimental studies that support a key role of ROS in the explanation of pathophysiology of CO toxicity as well as new treatment modalities after CO poisoning."

In addition numerous researchers have claimed links between cancer and other viruses and bacteria, many of which have been isolated from tumours. Excluding the non-causal HIV, 33 infectious agents linked with cancer have been identified in the literature, 27 of which have one thing in common: they are all present in mosquitoes. There are over 3000 species of mosquito and very few have been fully analysed, so the six remaining infectious agents may be present in some unexamined species. This hypothesis proposes that more cancers than are presently appreciated may arise from the long-term outcome of a mosquito bite, which by releasing a complex cocktail of up to 60 infectious agents directly into the blood stream, often results in contemporaneous immuno-suppression and a multiplicity of co-infections. These co-infections may act synergistically in whole, or in part, and in complex ways. Whether and if so which type of cancer ensues will depend on the constituent ingredients in the cocktail, determined by multiple factors such as the mosquito’s drinking and feeding patterns, number of previous blood-meals and the variety of intermediate hosts from which these meals are taken. Only a few mosquito species carry malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya and the other recognised serious human ailments. This hypothesis suggests that the number of species carrying the cancer cocktail will be few in number but collectively have a worldwide presence."

Consequently, research investigating environmental causes for this increase has become a Public Health priority. We have summarized the experimental observations and epidemiological data that could link repeated acetaminophen and ibuprofen exposure in early infancy to this increase. Recent observations on the maturational immunity of the intestinal sub-mucosal lamina propria underscore indeed the importance of prostaglandins (PGE2s). PGE2 appearing at this sub-mucosal level is a product of arachidonic acid metabolism mediated by type-2 cyclooxygenase (COX-2) situated on the membrane of many immune cells. Moreover, it seems that acetaminophen – like ibuprofen – also carries a non-selective inhibitory action on peripheral COXs, besides its central action. This inhibitory action of acetaminophen on COX2 only relates to physiological, low arachidonic acid concentrations. This explains the difference in anti-inflammatory effects. The impact of repeated inhibition of mucosal PGE2 synthesis due to COX-inhibitor exposure on maturational immunity has been demonstrated in animal experiments. Repeatedly exposed young animals do not develop tolerance to food antigens and exhibit autoimmune deviations. Several recent epidemiological studies have also reported on the magnitude of acetaminophen and ibuprofen exposure in children and the increase in immune deviations, it is important to better understand the potential negative impact of repeated inhibitions of prostaglandin synthesis by COX2s during infancy. Since acetaminophen and ibuprofen are commonly administered analgesics and antipyretics, a well-designed prospective strategy for pharmacovigilance and -epidemiology of COX-inhibitor exposure in infancy is urgently needed."

This correspondence, therefore, merges these heretofore distinct ideas in order to highlight two mechanisms of how gestational exposure to certain environmental pollutants may confer protection against AD. The hyperplasticity undergirding this protection may include limited noradrenergic discharge from locus coeruleus through MeCP2 deficiency (an emerging biomarker in ASD) and a heightened kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) system. While these endogenous dynamics in ASD may exert neural protection against development of AD, long-term pharmacologic intervention that enhances central catecholaminergic activity may disrupt this benefit, and this may be an important follow-up to address in future studies exploring the novel hypothesis from Oberman and Pascual-Leone."

Tremendous clinical observations have found the correlation of subdural effusion (SDE) and CSDH. However, systematic elucidation of CSDH’s origin and progression is lacking while almost all the current hypothesis only explained partial phenomenon. This hypothesis proposes Interleukin (IL)-8 inducing neutrophil respiratory burst is the crucial impact when SDE evolves into CSDH. IL-8 initially secreted by dural border layer cells, accumulates and the concentration of IL-8 rises in the SDE cavity. Accompanied by the formation of neo-membrane under the dura meninges, IL-8 firstly prompts to establish the neo-vasculature in it, and then attracts lymphocytes aggregation in the neo-membrane. Both the newly recruited lymphocytes and endothelial cells assist the further elevation of local IL-8 concentration. When the IL-8 concentration elevated to a particular level, it attracts neutrophils to the inner wall of neo-vessels and primes them to oxidative burst. Lysosomes and superoxide released by these neutrophils make the fragile neo-capillary became leaky, and subsequently the plasma and blood cells run into SDE. However, as long as the erythrocytes come into the cavity, they shall bind large quantity of IL-8 and decrease IL-8 concentration to a lower level relatively that reduce the neutrophils recruit. When this negative feedback is stagnancy, for example, the SDE space is so large in elder man who is experiencing brain atrophy, the neo-vessels have to release more erythrocytes to bind IL-8, the liquid cavity will expand and the high intracranial pressure symptoms appeared. Our hypothesis holds potential for the proper therapeutic intervention of CSDH. IL-8 antagonist and other anti-inflammation drugs like macrolides antibiotics, glucocorticoid and atorvastatin might be optional to resist the liquid cavity expanding as actually occurs obvious bleeding soon."

Fingolimod is an immunomodulating drug, approved for treating relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.

Highly selective rhizotomy of specific dorsal rootlets could change the intravesical pressure and urethral perfusion pressure respectively. We hypothese that for neurogenic bladder following spinal cord injury, highly selective rhizotomy of specific dorsal rootlets maybe improve the bladder capacity and the detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, and at the same time, the function of other pelvic organ could be maximize retainment."

abstract = "A synergistic-healing strategy that combines molecular targeting within a system-wide perspective is presented as the Multiple Integrated Complementary Healing Approaches: Energetics And Light (MICHAEL). The basis of the MICHAEL approach is the realization that environmental, nutritional and electromagnetic factors form a regulatory framework involved in bone and nerve healing. The interactions of light, energy, and nutrition with neural, hormonal and cellular pathways will be presented. Energetic therapies including electrical, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and light based treatments affect growth, differentiation and proliferation of bone and nerve and can be utilized for their healing benefits. However, the benefits of these therapies can be impaired by the absence of nutritional, hormonal and organismal factors. For example, lack of sleep, disrupted circadian rhythms and vitamin-D deficiency can impair healing. Molecular targets, such as the Wnt pathway, protein kinase B and glucocorticoid signaling systems can be modulated by nutritional components, including quercetin, curcumin and Mg2+ to enhance the healing process. The importance of water and water-regulation will be presented as an integral component. The effects of exercise and acupuncture on bone healing will also be discussed within the context of the MICHAEL approach."

abstract = "For more than a century type 2 diabetes has been looked upon mainly as an insulin-related disease and it is well-acknowledged that insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction play important roles in the pathophysiology of the disease. During the last couple of decades, glucagon has also been recognised to play a significant role in type 2 diabetic pathophysiology. However, the mechanisms underlying disturbances in the regulation of glucagon remain unclear. Glucagon constitutes the primary stimulus for hepatic glucose production and, thus, upholds adequate blood glucose levels during fasting conditions. Many – but not all – patients with type 2 diabetes are characterised by inappropriately elevated plasma levels of glucagon contributing to their hyperglycaemic state. We believe that phenotypical dissimilarities within this group of patients may determine the presence and degree of hyperglucagonaemia. Results from our group show that both normoglycaemic individuals and patients with type 2 diabetes with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) exhibit fasting hyperglucagonaemia compared to similarly grouped individuals without NAFLD. Therefore, we speculate that NAFLD – and not type 2 diabetes per se – is the main driver behind fasting hyperglucagonaemia. We hypothesise that in the majority of type 2 diabetic individuals hepatic sensitivity to glucagon is compromised due to hepatic steatosis, and that this provides a feedback mechanism acting at the level of pancreatic alpha cells, leading to elevated levels of glucagon. Here we present our hypothesis and propose a way to test it. If our hypothesis holds true, hepatic glucagon resistance would constitute a parallel to the obesity-induced insulin resistance in muscle and liver tissue, and underpin a central role for glucagon in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. This would provide a crucial step forward in understanding the interaction between NAFLD and the alpha cell in the pathophysiology underlying type 2 diabetes."

As a consequence, an accepted curative treatment is still lacking and rehabilitation programmes are not very effective, as few patients recover. Increased knowledge of the mechanisms leading to the emergence and maintenance of the illness is called for. In this study, I will put forth an alternative hypothesis to explain some of the pathologies associated with ME/CFS, by concentrating on one of the major strategic organs of the brain, the hippocampus. I will show that the ME/CFS triggering factors also impact the hippocampus, leading to neurocognitive deficits and disturbances in the regulation of the stress system and pain perception. These deficits lead to a substantial decrease in activity and to sleep disorders, which, in turn, impact the hippocampus and initiate a vicious circle of increased disability."

Ketamine has become a popular recreational drug of abuse in many parts of the world in recent years. The preclinical studies demonstrate the reinforcing effects of ketamine and long-term ketamine abuse induces a delayed and persistent upregulation of dopamine system. In humans, there have been concerns about its liability to development of addiction. The dilemma of mental professionals in managing the treatment-seeking ketamine abusers comes from a lack of effective pharmacotherapy. Limiting evidence showed that lamotrigine, which inhibits glutamate release, is effective to reduce cocaine craving. We propose that lamotrigine might be beneficial for managing ketamine use disorder clinically. We also reported one case of ketamine use disorder who experienced a great reduction in craving and ketamine use after taking lamotrigine. Although the mechanisms underlying neuroadaptation and reward related to ketamine are not entirely clear, future clinical trials are needed to advance our understanding of the benefit yielded by lamotrigine to treat ketamine use disorder."

Drug-induced long QT syndrome (DILQTS) is hypothesized to increase the risk of drowning by similar mechanisms. It is suggested that QT prolongation caused by a drug or drugs, when combined with the autonomic conflict associated with the mammalian dive reflex and/or the cold shock reflex, sets up conditions that may result in a sudden fatal arrhythmia while in water – thus an increased risk of drowning related to a drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval. Many widely used drugs prolong the QT interval thus raising a drug safety issue that needs confirmation or refutation."

abstract = "Accurate detection and prevention of overuse musculoskeletal injuries is limited by the nature of somatic tissue injury. In the pathogenesis of overuse injuries, it is well recognized that an abnormal inflammatory response occurs within somatic tissue before pain is perceived which can disrupt the normal remodeling process and lead to subsequent degeneration. Current overuse injury prevention methods focused on biomechanical faults or performance standards lack the sensitivity needed to identify the status of tissue injury or repair. Recent evidence has revealed an apparent increase in the prevalence and impact of overuse musculoskeletal injuries in athletics. When compared to acute injuries, overuse injuries have a potentially greater negative impact on athletes’ overall health burden. Further, return to sport rehabilitation following overuse injury is complicated by the fact that the absence of pain does not equate to complete physiological healing of the injured tissue. Together, this highlights the need for exercise monitoring and injury prevention methods which incorporate assessment of somatic tissue response to loading. One system primarily involved in the activation of pathways and neuromediators responsible for somatic tissue repair is the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Although not completely understood, emerging research supports the critical importance of peripheral ANS activity in the health and repair of somatic tissue injury. Due to its significant contributions to cardiac function, ANS activity can be measured indirectly with heart rate monitoring. Heart rate variability (HRV) is one index of ANS activity that has been used to investigate the relationship between athletes’ physiological response to accumulating training load. Research findings indicated that HRV may provide a reflection of ANS homeostasis, or the body’s stress-recovery status. This noninvasive marker of the body’s primary driver of recovery has the potential to incorporate important and as yet unmonitored physiological mechanisms involved in overuse injury development. We hypothesize that abnormal somatic tissue response to accumulating microtrauma may modulate ANS activity at the level of HRV. Exploring the link between HRV modulation and somatic tissue injury has the potential to reveal the putative role of ANS homeostasis on overuse musculoskeletal injury development."

Antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection has been implicated in the development of severe dengue disease, previously referred to as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.

Although it has been demonstrated time-after-time that, while venous gas emboli (VGE) often accompany decompression sickness (DCS), they are also frequently observed in high quantities in asymptomatic divers following even mild recreational dive profiles. Despite this VGE are commonly utilized as a quantifiable marker of the potential for an individual to develop DCS. Certain interventions such as exercise, antioxidant supplements, vibration, and hydration appear to impact VGE production and the decompression process. However promising these procedures may seem, the data are not yet conclusive enough to warrant changes in decompression procedure, possibly suggesting a component of individual response. We hypothesize that the impact of exercise varies widely in individuals and once tested, recommendations can be made that will reduce individual decompression stress and possibly the incidence of DCS. The understanding of physiological adaptations to diving stress can be applied in different diseases that include endothelial dysfunction and microparticle (MP) production. Exercise before diving is viewed by some as a protective form of preconditioning because some studies have shown that it reduces VGE quantity. We propose that MP production and clearance might be a part of this mechanism. Exercise after diving appears to impact the risk of adverse events as well. Research suggests that the arterialization of VGE presents a greater risk for DCS than when emboli are eliminated by the pulmonary circuit before they have a chance to crossover. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that exercise increases the incidence of crossover likely through extra-cardiac mechanisms such as intrapulmonary arterial-venous anastomoses (IPAVAs). This effect of exercise has been repeated in the field with divers demonstrating a direct relationship between exercise and increased incidence of arterialization."

abstract = "Earliest identifiable findings in autism indicate that the autistic brain develops differently from the typical brain in the first year of life, after a period of typical development. Twin studies suggest that autism has an environmental component contributing to causation. Increased availability of audiovisual (AV) materials and viewing practices of infants parallel the time frame of the rise in prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies have shown an association between ASD and increased TV/cable screen exposure in infancy, suggesting AV exposure in infancy as a possible contributing cause of ASD. Infants are attracted to the saliency of AV materials, yet do not have the experience to recognize these stimuli as socially relevant. The authors present a developmental model of autism in which exposure to screen-based AV input in genetically susceptible infants stimulates specialization of non-social sensory processing in the brain. Through a process of neuroplasticity, the autistic infant develops the skills that are driven by the AV viewing. The AV developed neuronal pathways compete with preference for social processing, negatively affecting development of social brain pathways and causing global developmental delay. This model explains atypical face and speech processing, as well as preference for AV synchrony over biological motion in ASD. Neural hyper-connectivity, enlarged brain size and special abilities in visual, auditory and motion processing in ASD are also explained by the model. Positive effects of early intervention are predicted by the model. Researchers studying causation of autism have largely overlooked AV exposure in infancy as a potential contributing factor. The authors call for increased public awareness of the association between early screen viewing and ASD, and a concerted research effort to determine the extent of causal relationship."

It presents a unitary account of the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis and embolism that is rooted in the pathophysiological tradition of Hunter, Virchow, Lister, Welch and Aschoff, a tradition traceable back to Harvey. In this paper we summarise the thesis in its mature form, consider its compatibility with recent advances in the DVT field, and ask why it has not yet been assimilated into the mainstream literature, which during the past half century has been dominated by a haematology-orientated ‘consensus model’. We identify and discuss seven ways in which the VCHT is incompatible with these mainstream beliefs about the aetiology of venous thrombosis, drawing attention to: (1) the spurious nature of ‘Virchow’s triad’; (2) the crucial differences between ‘venous thrombus’ and ‘clot’; the facts that (3) venous thrombi form in the valve pockets (VVPs), (4) DVT is not a primarily haematological condition, (5) the so-called ‘thrombophilias’ are not thrombogenic per se; (6) the conflict between the single unitary aetiology of DVT and the tacit assumption that the condition is ‘multicausal’; (7) the inability of anticoagulants to prevent the initiation of venous thrombogenesis, though they do prevent the growth of thrombi to clinically significant size. In discussing point (7), we show that the VCHT indicates new approaches to mechanical prophylaxis against DVT. These approaches are then formulated as experimentally testable hypotheses, and we suggest methods for testing them preclinically using animal trials."

These treatments prolonged the survival of patients but did not assure complete cure of the disease. Recent scientific evidences suggest that cancer stem cells (CSC) are responsible for recurrence, resistance and existence of this disease even after various therapeutic treatments. Therefore, we hypothesize that the best approach is to target CSCs along with cancer cells for complete remission of the disease. Before targeting these cells, studying their morphological, proliferation, behavioral aspects, physico-chemical interaction and characterizations are very important. For therapeutic approach the differentiation capacity of these cells to cancer cells with or without drugs is critical. To study basic parameters; the best approach would be aseptic sorting of CSCs from cancer cells based on specific cell surface markers by flowcytometer or magnetic cell sorter. The sorted cells have to be grown in culture conditions and treat with optimum concentrations of drugs to target CSC and cancer cell to find appropriate potential combination."

abstract = "Strifert has recently put forward an interesting hypothesis regarding the role of oral contraceptive (OC) use in mothers and risk of offspring autism spectrum disorder (ASD). First, the author reports that combined oral contraceptives (COCs), containing both estrogen and progesterone, were developed in the late 1950s and early 60s, which is a time-frame distinct from Leo Kanner’s documentation of infantile ASD in 1943 that Strifert just briefly mentions. While this important temporal inconsistency of ASD origin does not invalidate the potential role of OC use in contributing to the rise of ASD, it does support the likely possibility of other environmental exposures at play. Second, the epigenetic basis of the hypothesis is that the endocrine-disrupting components (i.e., ethinylestradiol) of OC perturb estrogenic signaling in the fetal brain by triggering aberrant DNA methylation of the estrogen receptor β (ERβ) gene, and such methylation patterns may be imprinted to future generations and could theoretically increase subsequent ASD offspring risk. The premise of the hypothesis is challenged, however, with the recognition that MeCP2, a “reader” of DNA methylation sites, is not only associated with age-dependent alteration in ERβ in females but is also significantly reduced in ASD brain. Furthermore, Strifert does not clearly address how the OC hypothesis accounts for the male bias in ASD. Therefore, the purpose of this correspondence is to address these inconsistencies by proposing a hypothesis that challenges these points. That is, gestational exposure to the agricultural and combustion air pollutant, nitrous oxide (N2O), may be a leading contributor to the development of an ASD phenotype. The mechanism undergirding this hypothesis suggests that compensatory estrogenic activity may mitigate the effects of fetal N2O exposure and thereby confer a protective effect against ASD development in a sex-dependent manner (i.e., male bias in ASD)."

Unfortunately, early investigations that used recycled “pedigree” virus strains seem to have led microbiologists to dismiss the common folk belief that vARIs often follow chilling. Today, incontrovertible evidence shows that ambient temperature dips and host chilling increase the incidence and severity of vARIs. This review considers four possible mechanisms, M1 - 4, that can explain this link: (M1) increased crowding in winter may enhance viral transmission; (M2) lower temperatures may increase the stability of virions outside the body; (M3) chilling may increase host susceptibility; (M4) lower temperatures or host chilling may activate dormant virions. There is little evidence for M1 or M2, which are incompatible with tropical observations. Epidemiological anomalies such as the repeated simultaneous arrival of vARIs over wide geographical areas, the rapid cessation of influenza epidemics, and the low attack rate of influenza within families are compatible with M4, but not M3 (in its simple form). M4 seems to be the main driver of seasonality, but M3 may also play an important role."

It is based on the knowledge that PS babies are hypersecretors of acid which pre-dates the development of PS and is an inherited constitutional feature. This acidity will become temporarily and dangerously high due to an insensitivity of the negative feed-back between gastrin and gastric acidy within the first few weeks of life. Normal babies who have inherited normal acidity will also experience peak acid secretions at that time but will be much less acid than babies destined to develop PS. Acid entering the duodenum causes contraction of the pyloric sphincter. Hyperacidity will naturally lead to repeated pyloric sphincter contractions and sphincter hypertrophy. Inappropriate repeated feeding of the vomiting PS baby by a first-time overanxious mother to her ever hungry baby, by provoking feed related sphincter contraction is considered to play a significant part in pathogenesis. Should the baby with PS survive beyond the age of around 6weeks, the matured negative feed-back between gastrin and acid will ensure that dangerous hyperacidity is kept in check. This coupled with the natural pyloric canal widening with age, will lead then to an long lasting cure. This theory explains satisfactorily all the known and hitherto unexplained features of this condition."

The majority of T lymphocytes infiltrating dermis are CD4+ T lymphocytes secreting type 1 and type 17 cytokines. These cytokines are responsible for triggering keratinocyte proliferation as well as chemokine secretion and subsequent migration of other inflammatory cells in the skin. Contrarily, lymphocytes that accumulate in epidermis are mainly CD8+ T lymphocytes. According to the recent findings, these cells can also secrete type 1 and type 17 cytokines. However, it is demonstrated so far that epidermal CD8+ T lymphocytes contain higher amounts of cytolytic molecules, such as perforin, granzyme B and granulysin whose role in psoriasis pathogenesis is still unknown. Therefore, in this article we hypothesize the active involvement of cell mediated cytotoxicity in killing the proliferating keratinocytes as a mechanism of potential self-defense and possible brake in psoriatic plaque formation, maintaining skin homeostasis."

It has been shown that over 70% of circulating LDL-C is metabolized through binding and activation of hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR). Genetic LDLR mutations cause hypercholesterolemia in the patients. Therefore, elevation of LDLR levels is beneficial for the treatment of dyslipidemia. LDLR expression is regulated by the SREBP2/PCSK9 pathways. Targeting SREBP2/PCSK9 pathways by statins and human monoclonal PCSK9 antibody has been shown to reduce the progression of ASVCD. Recent studies identified that inducible degrader of LDLR (IDOL) is a novel regulator of LDLR. IDOL is an E3-ubiquitin ligase regulated via liver X receptors (LXRs) binding to the upstream of translation start site of IDOL. IDOL modulates LDLR distribution through ubiquitination and degradation of LDLR in lysosomes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed that the nonsynonymous substitution rs9370867 of IDOL probably contributes to the variability of circulating LDL levels. Recently studies also demonstrated that IDOL influences PCSK9 expression in a LDLR/SREBP2-dependent manner. Based upon these novel findings, we hypothesize that IDOL and PCSK9 would have a synergistic effect on LDLR distribution. Specifically, loss of IDOL increases LDLR distribution in the hepatic cell, and subsequently reduces serum LDL-C levels in dyslipidemic patients. IDOL might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ASCVD."

Circulating tumor cells (CTC) derived from the primary cancer initiate distant metastasis by entering and traversing the bloodstream. Current methods to detect CTC are based on the notion that CTC do not express the common leukocyte antigen CD45. However, these methods neglect the fact that CTC can directly adhere to platelets and immune cells and therefore appear to be CD45-positive. The potential effects of interactions between CTC and adhesive immune cells have been largely overlooked, despite the fact that most CTC are killed by immune effector cells and only those that evade immune surveillance result in clonal expansion and metastatic lesions. It is crucial to define the characteristics that allow a select CTC population to escape immune surveillance; particularly, it must be determined whether interactions between CTC and adhesive immune cells provide a protective effect on CTC survival. If interactions between CTC and adhesive immune cells offer a selective advantage to those CTC cells, the next consideration is which characteristics of a CTC–immune cell population allow sufficient protection to facilitate immune evasion. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are a large heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that accumulate during cancer progression to induce extensively systemic and local immunosuppression, a phenomenon that has been demonstrated to facilitate cancer distant metastasis. We hypothesize, therefore, that CTC populations interacting with adhesive immune cells will have different biological behavior than CTC populations alone. Further, we hypothesize that CTC can create a defensive shield consisting of adhesive MDSC, which allows evasion of immune surveillance and therefore facilitates distant metastatic lesions. This possibility highlights the importance of direct interactions between CTC and adhesive immune cells and suggests the potential target that the CTC–MDSC cluster represents for prevention and treatment of distant metastasis of malignancies."

Antigen-binding IgE cross-links FcεRI on mast cells involves the generation and activation of PKCδ, ERK, tyrosine kinases (Syk and Lyn) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), inducing the release of chemical mediators which provoke inflammation and hypersensitive reaction. Other stimuli, including, cytokines, neuropeptides, chemical and physical activators, can also act on MCs to release a plethora of inflammatory compounds. Activated MCs produce a broad spectrum of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, lipid compounds and vasoactive amines, all involved in immune response. By producing TNF, MCs have an antibacterial defense and a protective function; while pathogenic bacteria and their products, such as LPS, have an inflammatory response through MC activation. LPS binding TLR4 produce MC generation IL-1 family members, and chemokines, which may recruit inflammatory cells at the infection site; whereas in KitW/W-v mice, where MCs are genetically absent, the inflammatory effect is not present. We report for the first time a link between MCs and bacteria emphasizing the mediation of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. We can conclude that mast cells fight bacteria, and their immune response is perfectly integrated in the immune network. We hope that the understanding of microbial and mast cell interaction leads to more efficient therapeutic development in relation to microbial resistance."

Anhedonia was considered a cardinal symptom of endogenous depression, but the potential of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors to treat anxiety disorders has increased the relevance of stress-induced morbidity. This shift has led to an important heterogeneity of current major depressive disorder. The complexity can be disentangled by postulating the existence of two different but mutually interacting neuronal circuits regulating the intensity of anhedonia (lack of pleasure) and dysphoria (lack of happiness). These circuits are functionally dominated by partly closed limbic (regulating misery-fleeing behaviour) and extrapyramidal (regulating reward-seeking behaviour) cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits. The re-entry circuits include the shell and core parts of the accumbens nucleus, respectively. Pleasure can be considered to result from finding relief from the hypermotivation to exhibit rewarding behaviour, and happiness from finding relief from negative or conflicting circumstances. Hyperactivity of the extrapyramidal CSTC circuit results in craving, whereas hyperactivity of the limbic system results in dysphoria."

Furthermore, treatment of these cancers in patients who have HIV/AIDS is complex and challenging due to the underlying immunosuppression and risk for infections. Often, the diagnosis of some of these malignancies is made at the same time as the diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, which further complicates treatment decisions, especially when CD4 counts are extremely low. The risks of giving chemotherapy in the setting of severe immunosuppression warrants a paradigm shift in how we should be treating malignancies in patients with HIV/AIDS. We hypothesize and propose that alongside combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), some patients with HIV/AIDS associated malignancies should be treated with immunotherapy targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway rather than chemotherapy.

As asthma occurs through triggered activation of various immune cells due to different stimuli, it poses a great challenge to uncover specific targets for therapeutic interventions. Recent pharmacotherapeutic approaches for asthma have been focused on molecular targeting of transcription factors and their signaling pathways; mainly nucleus factor kappa B (NFκB) and its associated pathways which orchestrate the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, GM-CSF), chemokines (RANTES, MIP-1a, eotaxin), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) and inflammatory enzymes (cyclooxygenase-2 and iNOS). 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and sodium salicylate are known to suppress NFκB activation by inhibiting inhibitor of kappa B kinase (IKκB). In order to target the transcription factor, a suitable carrier system for delivering the drug to the intracellular space is essential. 5-ASA and sodium salicylate loaded liposomes incorporated into PEG-4-acrylate and CCRGGC microgels (a polymer formed by crosslinking of trypsin sensitive peptide and PEG-4-acrylate) could probably suit the needs for developing a disease responsive drug delivery system which will serve as a prophylactic therapy for asthmatic patients."

Deuterium depleted water delays tumor progression in mice, dogs, cats and humans. Hydratase enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle control cell growth and deplete deuterium from redox cofactors, fatty acids and DNA, which undergo hydride ion and hydrogen atom transfer reactions. A model is proposed that emphasizes the terminal complex of mitochondrial electron transport chain reducing molecular oxygen to deuterium depleted water (DDW); this affects gluconeogenesis as well as fatty acid oxidation. In the former, the DDW is thought to diminish the deuteration of sugar-phosphates in the DNA backbone, helping to preserve stability of hydrogen bond networks, possibly protecting against aneuploidy and resisting strand breaks, occurring upon exposure to radiation and certain anticancer chemotherapeutics. DDW is proposed here to link cancer prevention and treatment using natural ketogenic diets, low deuterium drinking water, as well as DDW production as the mitochondrial downstream mechanism of targeted anti-cancer drugs such as Avastin and Glivec. The role of 2H in biology is a potential missing link to the elusive cancer puzzle seemingly correlated with cancer epidemiology in western populations as a result of excessive 2H loading from processed carbohydrate intake in place of natural fat consumption."

Regression of LVH is associated with improved prognosis. Regression of LVH with antihypertensive therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics) has been reported, although only after long-term treatment. Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), the most potent endogenous NO synthase inhibitor, is emerging as an important cardiovascular risk factor in patients with arterial hypertension and LVH, and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) is the mechanism that most frequently leads to accumulation of ADMA (plasma ADMA is cleared in small part by renal excretion, although the bulk of ADMA is degraded by DDAH). Left ventricular mass is strongly modulated by the NO system. As an important inhibitor of the bioavailability of NO, ADMA is an underlying mechanism of LVH. Beta-blockers can induce regression of LVH and reduced plasma ADMA levels. Oxidative stress is increased in patients with LVH, and this in turn increases generation of ADMA. In a previous preclinical study of spontaneously hypertensive rats, we found that short-term treatment (48h) with esmolol reverses early LVH, increases the bioavailability of NO, and improves antioxidant status in plasma. Therefore, we propose that the ADMA/DDAH/NO pathway could modulate early regression of LVH with esmolol."

abstract = "Fistula in ano is a very common presentation to colorectal clinic. Embarrassment due to the symptoms makes accurate estimations of incidence difficult. It is estimated that up to 40% of peri-anal abscess will be accompanied by or preceded by a fistula. Fistulae can be classified into simple fistulae that involve no or minimal sphincter muscle and complex, which involve significant amounts of the anal sphincter muscle, possibly with multiple tracts. For complex fistulae a seton suture is usually placed through the tract and out through the anus to form a loop allowing pockets of sepsis to drain internally and externally and a mature tract of fibrous tissue to develop. Following this period definitive fistula treatment is considered. This can involve a number of procedures that have tremendously varied success rates in the literature. The first stage of surgical treatment is often a core fistulectomy, which entails surgical removal of the tract. This may be followed by insertion of fibrin glue, a collagen plug or formation of a rotation skin flap from surrounding tissue in order to close the resultant tissue defect. All current treatments have a significant failure rate. If this wound breaks down the surgery can leave a large painful peri-anal wound that can lead to ongoing fistulation. Should this occur resiting of the seton will be required with the patient only getting back to square one after months of healing around the seton. In addition removing cores of fibrous tissue passing through the sphincter can threaten the sphincter function resulting in impaired continence. Having seen radiofrequency ablation used to close varicose veins the authors propose that one could use similar techniques to close a fibrous tract matured with a seton in order to close a fistula. The authors propose that a short length radiofrequency catheter could be used to treat fistula in ano. This would in theory be less painful with less tissue destruction. In addition there would be no necessity for extensive incisions. As the energy penetration can be controlled the procedure will be safe even if it fails, without causing a large wound or tissue necrosis. All other treatment options will still be available."

abstract = "Despite the tremendous progress in last few years, the cancer immunotherapy has not yet improved disease-free because of the tumor-associated immune suppression being a major barrier. Novel trends to enhance cancer immunotherapy aims at harnessing the therapeutic manipulation of signaling pathways mediating the tumor-associated immune suppression, with the general aims of: (a) reversing the tumor immune suppression; (b) enhancing the innate and adaptive components of anti-tumor immunosurveillance, and (c) protecting immune cells from the suppressive effects of T regulatory cells (Tregs) and the tumor-derived immunoinhibitory mediators. A particular striking example in this context is the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A type I (PKAI) pathway. Oncogenic cAMP/PKAI signaling has long been implicated in the initiation and progression of several human cancers. Emerging data indicate that cAMP/PKAI signaling also contributes to tumor- and Tregs-derived suppression of innate and adaptive arms of anti-tumor immunosurveillance. Therapeutically, selective PKAI inhibitors have been developed which have shown promising anti-cancer activity in pre-clinical and clinical settings. Rp-8-Br-cAMPS is a selective PKAI antagonist that is widely used as a biochemical tool in signal transduction research. Collateral data indicate that Rp-8-Br-cAMPS has shown immune-rescuing potential in terms of enhancing the innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity, as well as protecting adaptive T cells from the suppressive effects of Tregs. Therefore, this proposal specifically implicates that combining selective PKAI antagonists/inhibitors with cancer immunotherapy may have multifaceted benefits, such as rescuing the endogenous anti-tumor immunity, enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, and direct anti-cancer effects."

Carcinogenic bracken fern (Pteridium spp.) is one of these. Toxins from this plant are consumed as bracken culinary preparations, through milk and meat of bracken-exposed livestock, and drain waters from bracken swards. Bracken toxin ptaquiloside (PtQ), a suspected human carcinogen, elicits complex responses in animals leading to death. PtQ and Hp might cooperate in gastric pathologies. This paper presents an hypothesis on PtQ–Hp association leading to the enhancement of carcinogenesis in the human gastric environment that might explain the high gastric cancer incidence and death rates among Hp-infected people living in bracken zones at two levels: (1) The macroscopic scale comprising the flow of PtQ in the human diet. (2) the microscopic scale encompassing (A) gastric luminal medium; (B) gastric mucus structure and mucin degradation elicited by Hp; (C) bacterial pH gradient modification of the gastric mucosa that favors PtQ survival and its penetration into epithelial tissue; (D) combined PtQ/Hp effects on gastric immune and inflammatory responses; (E) PtQ–Hp complementary activity at selected cell signaling cascades and genome disturbance."

To this end, the effects of neurosurgical resection on cognition is reviewed and an overview of the role of complex network analysis in the understanding of brain structure and function is provided. The literature describing network, behavioral, and cognitive effects resulting from lesions to, and disconnections of, centralized hub regions will be emphasized as evidence for the espousal of the concept of cognitive eloquence."

Approximately 25% of the patients with BCBM have a hormone receptor-negative, HER2-positive disease. Given the short life expectancy in patients with BCBM, researchers have tried many new approaches, including cesium-131(131Cs) brachytherapy, radretumab radioimmunotherapy and nanoparticles. Novel biological drug delivery techniques have successfully delivered nanobioconjugates across the blood–brain barrier (BBB). However, nanobioconjugates have significant toxicities and other drawbacks that prevent therapeutic concentrations of the active drug from being delivered to the brain lesions. Radretumab radioimmunotherapy combined with nanotrastruzumab can theoretically overcome this challenge. Radiotherapy can increase the BBB permeability, which can promote the transport and effect of nanotrastuzumab, reduce radretumab radioimmunotherapy dose and target patients with HER2-positive BCBM lesions more specifically. In this article, we propose that nanotrastuzumab in combination with radioimmunotherapy could be a viable treatment option for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with brain metastasis."

The present article hypothesizes that enhancing autophagy in neuronal cells may help them to get rid of bioenergetic crisis, necrosis, apoptosis associated with DN. Some forms of autophagic turnover also help to maintain integral, healthy mitochondria, malfunctioning of which produces cellular reactive oxygen species and may prevent accumulation of damaged protein aggregates. Involvement of various energy derived metabolic, cellular death pathways and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of DN and how autophagy may halts the progression of DN has been discussed with supporting literature."

GDM is a metabolic syndrome produced by various degrees of carbohydrate intolerance during pregnancy. Various risk factors such as obesity, genetics, environmental factors, and hypertension have been described previously. Maternal and fetal complications occur in around 7% of pregnant women with GDM. In these patients, a relation between proteoglycans and ADAMTS proteases located in extracellular matrix in fetal membranes (placenta, cord, amnion) and complicated pregnancies has already been determined by various animal experiments. Changes in expression, structure and function of ADAMTS proteases and proteoglycans in fetal membranes lead to alteration in the structure of extracellular matrix. If we can establish a balance between these proteoglycans and ADMTS proteases or determine the changes in their structure and functions, it will be possible to predict the risk in high risk pregnancies at early weeks and to initiate treatment early or to follow the target population regularly. In addition, prevention or reduction of maternal and fetal complications may be possible. For this purpose, ADAMTS and proteoglycans the synthesis of which is too much or less, may be targeted and if we would be able to determine and prevent the changes in their levels in the early period of pregnancy, the development of GDM and its complications may be prevented or decreased. Thus, we may identify a marker for early diagnosis and treatment and reduce prematurity, which is the most common cause of fetal death. Fetal and maternal complications, and especially treatment and care costs of prematurity, may also be decreased."

It has already been used for printing surgical models for preoperative planning and in constructing personalized prostheses for patients. The ultimate goal is to achieve the development of functional human organs and tissues, to overcome limitations of organ transplantation created by the lack of organ donors and life-long immunosuppression. We hypothesized a precision medicine approach to human organ fabrication using 3D printed technology, in which the digital volumetric data would be collected by imaging of a patient, i.e. CT or MRI images followed by mathematical modeling to create a digital 3D image. Then a suitable biocompatible material, with an optimal resolution for cells seeding and maintenance of cell viability during the printing process, would be printed with a compatible printer type and finally implanted into the patient. Life-saving operations with 3D printed implants were already performed in patients. However, several issues need to be addressed before translational application of 3D printing into clinical medicine. These are vascularization, innervation, and financial cost of 3D printing and safety of biomaterials used for the construct."

Th2-driven response has been well described under first RSV vaccine (formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine antigens) and replicated in some conditions for RSV-infected mice, in which a Th2-dependent lung eosinophilia increases illness severity, accompanied of tissue damage. Currently, several prototypes of RSV vaccine are being tested, but there is no vaccine available so far. The advance of bioinformatics can help to solve this issue. Systems biology approaches based on network topological analysis may help to identify new genes in order to direct Th1 immune response during RSV challenge. For this purpose, network centrality analyses from high-throughput experiments were performed in order to select major genes enrolled in each T-helper immune response. Thus, genes termed Hub (B) and bottlenecks (H), which control the flow of biological information (Th1 or Th2 immune response, in this case) within the network, would be identified. As these genes possess high potential to promote Th1 immune response, they could be cloned under regulation of specific promoters in a plasmid, which will be available as a gene-transfer adjunctive to vaccines. Th1 immune response potentiated by our strategy may contribute to accelerate Th1/Th2 shift from neonatal immune system, which might favor protective immunity against RSV infection and reduce lung damage."

The search for biological correlates in resilient patients has led to the hypothesis that certain endogenous biomarkers (namely neuropeptide Y (NPY), testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)) are altered in resilient patients. The concept of surgical resilience raises the question of whether enhanced recovery following surgery can be demonstrated in patients with high titres of resilience biomarkers as compared to patients with low titres of resilience biomarkers. To determine the prognostic value of resilience biomarkers in surgical recovery, a cohort of patients undergoing major surgery should initially be psychometrically tested for their resilience levels before and after surgery so that biomarker levels of NPY, testosterone and DHEA can be compared to a validated psychometric test of resilience. The primary outcome would be length of hospital stay with and without an enhanced recovery program. Secondary outcome measures such as complications, time in rehabilitation and readmission could also be included. If the hypothesis is upheld, resilience biomarkers could be used to support more individualised perioperative management and lead to more efficient and effective allocation of healthcare resources."

The highest GBC rates occur in Southern Chile (ASMR=18), characterized by: high Amerindian ancestry, associated with high bile acid synthesis and gallstones; high poverty and high cereal agriculture, both associated with aflatoxin exposure. Aflatoxins have been detected in imported and locally grown foods items. We estimated population dietary exposure ranging from 0.25 to 35.0ng/kg-body weight/day. The only report on human exposure in Chile found significantly more aflatoxin biomarkers in GBC than in controls (Odds Ratio=13.0). The hypothesis of aflatoxin-GBC causal link in the Chilean population is supported by: genetically-determined rapid cholesterol excretion and high gallstones prevalence (49.4%); low prevalence of HCC (ASMR=4.9) and low HBV infection (0.15%) the main co-factor of aflatoxins in HCC risk.

Based on many indirect evidences in human studies such as unchanged β-cell replication, apoptosis and size during compensation in insulin resistance in humans, we suggest successful β-cells mass compensation in metabolically healthy obesity is contributed by neoformation of β-cells, through expansion of progenitor cells/stem cells in synergy with β-cell replication."

abstract = "Concentrations of different adipokines in human breast milk are thought to be able to affect energy intake of the infant. Leptin is a hormone synthesized by adipose tissue and the human placenta and favors satiety. The availability of leptin in breast milk is influenced by epithelial cells of the mammary gland that are known to be able to produce leptin, as well as leptin from maternal circulation that is transported to the breast milk, and which can thus in turn reach neonatal blood after absorption. Research so far as mainly focused on leptin concentrations in breast milk. However, evidence suggests that in addition to leptin concentrations levels of the so-called soluble leptin receptor (sOb-R), the main high-affinity binding protein for leptin in humans, are necessary in order to calculate the free leptin index (FLI) and to assess function of the leptin axis. FLI is calculated from the ratio of leptin to the sOb-R, and serves as the main parameter for assessing function of the leptin axis throughout maturation and development. Here we propose that assessing sOb-R levels in addition to leptin concentrations in breast milk could serve as a valuable tool to investigate effects of the leptin axis in breast milk because sOb-R concentrations can impact available leptin levels, and which in turn can have significant implications for infant energy intake and related development."

Centrally acting ACE inhibitors (CACE-Is) are widely used in the perioperative period. The current evidence showed CACE-Is could upregulate SP level in the central nervous system which may contribute to the occurrence of PONV in 0–72h. Here, we present our hypothesis that the use of CACE-Is in the perioperative period may increase patients’ risk for both early (0–24h) and late (24–72h) PONV. The identification of this new risk factor may improve patients’ risk assessment and thus lead to better prophylaxis strategies for PONV that are base on risk stratification."

The ACS contains elevated levels of various anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 RA (receptor antagonist), IL-4 and IL-10 and several growth factors. It contains a combination of cytokines and growth factors, and their specific contribution to clinical effects have yet to be determined. Serum conditioned in that specific way does not always have the same content and concentration of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. We hypothesize that ACS should not be prepared and administered if elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are present at the moment of obtaining the patient’s blood because of the potential detrimental effect of elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in the same blood, namely IL-1 and TNF. We propose introduction of CRP measuring before any ACS treatment. The cut off value would be set at 5mg/dL as an usual value suggesting inflammation. Avoidance of collecting and administering ACS if elevated CRP is present would potentially eliminate low quality ACS."

In other words, neonatal hypoglycemia results from excessive insulin secretion from fetal/neonatal beta cells. Given that insulin causes fat to be stored rather than to be used for energy, one would expect that chronic hyperinsulinemia would result in large-for-gestational-age neonates. The finding that many small-for-gestational-age neonates have hypoglycemia suggests that the stimulus for insulin production occurs close to delivery. We postulated that a potent stimulation of maternal insulin production close to delivery would also provide a potent stimulus for fetal and neonatal insulin production, causing neonatal hypoglycemia. This study has evaluated 155 mothers with markers of excessive insulin production (such as acanthosis or grade III obesity), or with situations characterized by increased insulin requirements (such as an invasive bacterial infection or use of systemic corticosteroid within a week before delivery; or sedentariness or high-carbohydrate intake within 24h before delivery) and their 158 neonates who were screened for glycemic levels at 1, 2 and 4h after birth. The minimum glucose level was correlated to the maternal parameters, and to classical predictors of neonatal hypoglycemia, such as low-birth weight and preterm delivery. The only independent predictors were sedentariness and high-carbohydrate intake within 24h before delivery. The risk of neonatal hypoglycemia increased five-fold with sedentariness, 11-fold with high-carbohydrate intake, and 329-fold with both risk factors. The risk of neonatal hypoglycemia seems to be highly influenced by maternal lifestyle within 24h before delivery. Controlled randomized trials may help determine whether a controlled carbohydrate diet combined with regular physical activity close to delivery can prevent neonatal hypoglycemia and all its severe complications to the newborn."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Many studies have investigated the cause for the development of AF, however, the question remains unanswered.
Methods
A comparison of hydrodynamics between AF and sinus rhythm was performed.
Results
I proposed the hypothesis that atrial fibrillation is a protective physiological mechanism, based on the termination of atrial mechanical systole. This reduces the pressure in the system of the pulmonary veins and alveolar capillaries in pathological situations, and thus reduces the likelihood for development of pulmonary congestion and edema.
Conclusions
The hypothesis is well correlated with the known facts and phenomenons associated with AF, and explains the causes of the onset of AF in different conditions and diseases."

abstract = "Summary
Extraocular muscle weakness occurs in most of the myasthenia gravis (MG) patients and it is often the initial complaint. Approximately 10–20% of MG patients with extraocular muscle weakness display only ocular symptoms and rest of the patients subsequently develop generalized muscle weakness. It is not entirely clear why some MG patients develop only ocular symptoms and why extraocular muscle weakness almost always precedes generalized muscle weakness. These facts are often explained by increased susceptibility of extraocular muscles due to their reduced endplate safety factor and lower complement inhibitor expression. Findings of a recently developed animal model of ocular MG suggest that additional factors might be in play. While immunization of HLA transgenic and wild-type (WT) mice with the native acetylcholine receptor (AChR) pentamer carrying conformational epitopes generates severe generalized muscle weakness, immunization of the same mouse strains with recombinant unfolded AChR subunits containing linear epitopes induces ptosis with or without mild generalized muscle weakness. Notably, immunization of mice with deficient T helper cell-mediated antigen presentation with recombinant AChR subunits or whole native AChR pentamer also induces ocular symptoms, AChR-reactive B cells and AChR antibodies. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that ocular symptoms observed in the earlier stages of MG might be triggered by linear and non-conformational AChR epitopes expressed by thymic cells or invading microorganisms. This initial AChR autoimmunity might be managed by T cell-independent and B cell mediated mechanisms yielding low affinity AChR antibodies. These antibodies are putatively capable of inducing muscle weakness only in extraocular muscles which have increased vulnerability due to their inherent biological properties. After this initial attack, as AChR bearing immune complexes form and the immune system gains access to the native AChR expressed by muscle and thymic myoid cells, a more robust anti-AChR autoimmunity develops giving way to high affinity AChR antibodies, thymic germinal center formation and severe generalized muscle weakness. Accurate characterization of chain if events leading to ocular and generalized symptoms in MG might enable development of novel therapeutics that might prevent the transition from mild ocular symptoms to severe generalized weakness in earlier stages of the disease."

It is advocated that revascularization may improve survival rates, presumably due to improved cardiovascular performance; however no experimental or clinical data exist to identify a clear causative correlation and provide a relevant pathophysiologic background. Therefore we conducted a pilot study based on pulse wave analysis to detect the hemodynamic changes immediately after revascularization, in a group of six consecutive patients with CTOA. All patients were subjected to non-invasive measurements 1day before surgery and at the end of the 1st postoperative month. Pulse wave analysis was performed noninvasively with a novel validated brachial cuff-based automatic oscillometric device. All patients had markedly preoperative high Augmentation Index (adjusted at heart rate 75beats/min, AI@75). The AI@75 decreased from 46±6.6 preoperatively to 24±5.7 (p 0.0002). Wave reflection magnitude decreased from 72.3±5.2% to 63±6.7% (p 0.02). Cardiax index increased from 2.8±1.2 to 3.4±1.2l/min×1/m2 (p 0.41). Pulse wave velocity remained practically unchanged post-interventionally. These findings show that central aorta hemodynamics can be improved immediately following revascularization procedures in patients with complete occlusion of the entire length of the infrarenal aorta and can constitute the background of improved postoperative life-expectancy."

However, numerous studies have underscored its dynamic nature with a host of compartmentalized physiological processes. As the individual ages, the normal lens develops two inescapable processes, presbyopia and cataracts. Yet, to date, there is no uniform explanation for presbyopia and many factors have been proposed as contributors including continuous enlargement of the lens, loss of power of the ciliary muscle and hardening of the lens fibers. Proposed explanations are incomplete and need experimental confirmation. This paper analyzes the possible causes for presbyopia and proposes a new one for it: a decrease in the permeability of aquaporin zero (AQP-0) also known as major intrinsic protein (MIP). Based on original findings of our laboratory, this paper proposes that a fluid flow exists inside the avascular lens. This fluid enters and leaves the lens during the accommodation process. We believe that for this to occur the lens utilizes the permeability of aquaporin zero which is abundant in the membrane of the fiber cells. Volume change due to fluid traversing the surface of the lens occurs during accommodation. We present the hypothesis that increasing the permeability of AQP-0 would facilitate accommodation. Therefore, defects in AQP-0 permeability may be a cause for presbyopia. We would also like to propose that it is possible to visualize and measure the fluid volume lost during un-accommodation and determine if the fluid is lost across the anterior, posterior or both surfaces. An age-related loss in lens water permeability could reduce fluid fluxes during the shape changes of accommodation potentially contributing to presbyopia."

abstract = "Pineal gland is an important organ for the regulation of the bio-clock in all vertebrate species. Its major secretory product is melatonin which is considered as the chemical expression of darkness due to its circadian peak exclusively at night. Pineal melatonin can be either released into the blood stream or directly enter into the CSF of the third ventricle via the pineal recess. We have hypothesized that rather than the peripheral circulatory melatonin circadian rhythm serving as the light/dark signal, it is the melatonin rhythm in CSF of the third ventricle that serves this purpose. This is due to the fact that melatonin circadian rhythm in the CSF is more robust in terms of its extremely high concentration and its precise on/off peaks. Thus, extrapineal-generated melatonin or diet-derived melatonin which enters blood would not interfere with the bio-clock function of vertebrates. In addition, based on the relationship of the pineal gland to the CSF and the vascular structure of this gland, we also hypothesize that pineal gland is an essential player for CSF production. We feel it participates in both the formation and reabsorption of CSF. The mechanisms associated with these processes are reviewed and discussed in this brief review."

abstract = "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary tumor of liver and its incidence continues to increase worldwide. HCC is a disease with multifactorial causes and genetic variability has been discussed as a risk factor for its development. Liver is a hormone-sensitive organ and therefore is influenced by gonadal hormones, such as estrogen. Estrogen is known to participate in various biological functions, but its role in development of HCC, on the other hand, is controversial and presents evidence suggesting a role as both a carcinogen and protective effect in liver. Estrogen way of action is mediated by estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), that belong to a family of nuclear receptors that may regulate the expression of many genes. The ER subtypes exert a variety of roles in many stages of liver disease and may play a part in the process of signal transduction, according to some studies. However, the many functions of ER subtypes in hepatic diseases, in special of the ERβ, are yet to be clarified. The genetic modifications related to HCC are not yet fully clarified and accumulation of multiple genetic alterations appears to have an important role in carcinogenesis of HCC. The presence of some certain single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may have a functional repercussion related to final product of a gene, which can be measured and may participate in some alterations related to a pathological condition. Our hypothesis is based on the fact that liver tissue express ER and its different variants exert multiple functions in various stages of liver disease and participate in an extremely complicated signal transduction process, therefore we believe that the presence of one or more SNPs of ESR1 and ESR2 genes may be related with the increase of risk in developing and the severity of HCC, as well as in the response to different treatments. The confirmation of our hypothesis by scientific studies may provide knowledge of markers that act as prognostic factors of this disease, as well as enabling alternatives to development of anti tumoral therapies."
