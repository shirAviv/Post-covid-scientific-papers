abstract = "Aims
Metabolic syndrome (MS) and atherosclerosis are chronic inflammatory conditions. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (LpPLA2) is a circulatory marker of systemic inflammation and a risk predictor for cardiovascular diseases. This study aims to evaluate the expression of this enzyme in an effort to understand the underlying mechanism of atherosclerosis in MS.
Methods
This study included twenty patients of MS and same number of healthy controls. Anthropometry and clinical examination were carried out in both groups. Real time PCR was performed for LpPLA2 mRNA and relative expression was calculated using ΔΔCT method keeping β2 microglobin and β-actin as internal controls.
Results
LpPLA2 mRNA expression was higher in patients of MS. Fold change was 5.7 when β2 microglobin was used as normaliser and 4.97 when β-actin was used. mRNA levels of LpPLA2 correlated significantly with waist circumference (r=0.462, p=0.003) and systolic blood pressure (r=0.392, p=0.015) as well as high density lipoprotein cholesterol (r=−0.453, p=0.003).
Conclusions
High expression of LpPLA2 mRNA indicates that systemic inflammation has role in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in patients of MS. This is evident from its direct correlation with blood pressure. The study also suggests that expression of LpPLA2 may be associated with obesity. Therefore, LpPLA2 mRNA expression levels may develop as an important risk predictor for vascular complications in MS."

abstract = "Aims
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is considered to be one of the important risk factors for cardiac diseases. Frank diabetes is usually preceded by long term abnormality in glucose homeostasis which is called pre-diabetes. The hypothesis that diabetic patients have greater risk and worse prognosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) than pre-diabetics is controversial. Considering that India has been declared as a diabetic capital of the world, the study aimed to assess the load of pre diabetics, diabetics and non-diabetics landing in myocardial infarction.
Materials and methods
The study consisted of through physiological and biochemical evaluation of 200 patients of newly diagnosed AMI and evaluating the load of non-diabetics, pre-diabetics and diabetics among them.
Result
It was found that the total non-diabetic population (normoglycaemic and pre-diabetic) formed the bulk of AMI patient (69%) in our study. The degree of biochemical alterations seen among the three groups suggests that abnormal glucose homeostasis is not the sole determinant of the severity of AMI. The study data also suggests that glycaemic status, which poses a risk for AMI, differs in male and female individuals. Males even with normal glucose level are at increased risk to develop MI.
Conclusion
The study concludes that both males and females with their blood glucose in pre-diabetic range are seen to be vulnerable to develop AMI. Thus all individuals irrespective of their glycaemic status around the age of forty should be screened and individuals with fasting sugar in pre-diabetic range should take extra precaution in terms of healthy diet, life style and regular check up"

The relationships between the waist circumference (WC), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) thickness and three components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) were explored to verify which of the obesity indices might be superior.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted of 1256 subjects (840 males and 416 females) aged 26–89 years, who were individuals undergoing intensive health checkup. The three components of MetS examined were high blood pressure, glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were used for the analyses.
Results
The mean values of the WC and VAT thickness were significantly higher in the subject group positive for each of the metabolic syndrome components than in the subject group that was negative for all the components (p<0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that the WC showed an advantage over the VAT thickness only for predicting high blood pressure in men. Logistic regression analysis revealed increase of the odds ratios of the WC for glucose intolerance (p<0.001), high blood pressure (p<0.001) and dyslipidemia (p<0.01) in men. In contrast, the odds ratio of the VAT thickness was significantly increased only for dyslipidemia (p<0.01) in men. In women, the odds ratios of the WC for glucose intolerance (p<0.01) and dyslipidemia (p<0.001) were significantly increased, and odds ratio of the VAT thickness for high blood pressure (p<0.01) was significantly increased.
Conclusion
This survey presented an advantage of WC over VAT thickness as an obesity index for identifying all the three components of metabolic syndrome, although sex differences in the study outcomes were found."

Participants and methods
A retrospective study included 77 participants (BMI≥25kg/m2; HbA1c level>8% and<9.5%) with overweight/obese T2DM. These participants were treated with either voglibose or acarbose. Glycemic parameters (fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]), bodyweight, BMI and lipid parameters were evaluated at baseline, 3-month, 6-month and 9-month of treatment. Adverse events were also captured at respective time points.
Results
Voglibose showed significant reduction in HbA1c and bodyweight with short duration of treatment (6 months; P<0.05 and 9 months; P<0.01) whereas acarbose showed significant reduction with longer duration of treatment (9 months; P<0.05) when compared with baseline. Moreover, both treatment groups were reported with reduction in BMI. Further, significant improvement in lipid parameters except LDL and HDL were observed in both treatment groups when compared with baseline. None of participant was discontinued due to side effects of the treatment. In addition, the frequency of hypoglycemia was decreased in both treatment groups.
Conclusion
Voglibose or acarbose as an add-on treatment with metformin and sulfonylureas in uncontrolled obese/overweight T2DM provides desired glycemic control, reduces bodyweight and improves lipid parameters with good tolerability profile."

Physical activity is an essential determinant of health. However, there is dearth of evidence regarding prevalence of physical activity in developing countries, especially its association with metabolic syndrome risk factors. This study assessed the association of physical activity with metabolic syndrome in a Nigerian population.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study was carried out on apparently healthy persons who are ≥18 years old. The World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) was used to collect five domains of physical activity. Participants were classified as physically active or inactive based on meeting the cut-off value of 600 MET-min/week. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed using the Joint Scientific Statement on Harmonizing the Metabolic Syndrome criteria.
Results
Overall prevalence of physically active individuals was 50.1% (CI: 45.6–54.7%). Physical inactivity is significantly more in females (p<0.01) and among participants >40 years old (p<0.0001). Whereas individuals with metabolic syndrome appeared more likely to be physically active (OR=1.48, CI: 0.71–3.09); physical inactivity showed to exist more among participants who were living in urban area (OR=6.61, CI: 3.40–12.85, p<0.001). Participants with prediabetes (OR=1.69, CI: 0.62–4.61) and diabetes (OR=1.91, CI: 0.65–5.63) were more likely to be physically inactive as compared to other metabolic syndrome risk factors.
Conclusion
The high prevalence of physical inactivity in this study population is a clear indication that concerted efforts to improve physical activity may be required. However, it seems that metabolic syndrome is not improved by being physically active. This suggests that interventions directed at physical activity alone may not produce optimal efficacy in this study population."

It is important to identify the risk factors for metabolic syndrome (MetS) in order to prevent the development of cardio-/cerebrovascular diseases. The authors estimated the risk factors for the development of MetS with special emphasis on the severity of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).
Methods
We conducted as a cross-sectional study in subjects undergoing intensive health examination (581 men aged 33–84 years). Diagnosis of MetS was based on the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel.
Results
The prevalence of MetS in subjects with severe SDB, which was defined as an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) of 30 or higher, was 40.7%, which was significantly higher than that in the subjects without severe SDB (29.3%). The odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) of the logarithmic-transformed AHI for MetS was 1.6 (1.1–2.4) after adjustments for age, serum uric acid, logarithmic-transformed serum C-reactive protein, smoking history, exercise history and alcohol history. When the subjects were categorized by the severity of SDB, the OR (95% CI) of severe SDB, which was the only category that showed significant association, was 2.2 (1.2–4.0).

Diabetes mellitus has considerable public health implications for communities, individuals, and health services. Increasing prevalence of diabetes all over the world intensifies the demand for health care services, and particularly for inpatient care.
Aim
The present study aims to assess the current prevalence of diabetes and its etiology among hospitalized Jordanian adults.
Methods
This was a cross sectional study conducted at Specialist Hospital (SH) in the Jordanian capital of Amman, with data collection taking place between June and August 2015, and data was extracted manually from medical records. Patients were divided into three groups: (a) those with a medical history of diabetes, (b) those with unrecognized diabetes or new hyperglycemia, and (c) those with no diabetes. Data management and analysis were conducted using the SPSS program. Means ±SD were used to present all continuous variables, as well as the numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and we used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare between means. For differences between categorical variables, we used (x2). A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
A total of 392 patients (266 female, 126 male) were admitted during the 10-week study period. Of these, 204 fell into category (a), 45 into category (b), and 143 into category (c). Diabetes was the principal diagnosis in 52% of the hospitalizations. Patients who had diabetes or new hyperglycemia were considerably older than non-diabetic patients. The five most common reasons for hospitalization were congestive heart failure (25.0%), pneumonia (22.5%), DKA (22.0%), coronary atherosclerosis (16.20%), and septicemia (14.20%).
Conclusion
The common etiologies for hospitalization were congestive heart failure, pneumonia, DKA, coronary atherosclerosis, and septicemia. Keeping in view the results of this study it is recommend that regular screening should be performed for diabetic patients, as this will increase the chances that many diabetes complications will be prevented, particularly for elderly subjects."

abstract = "Aims
Chronic inflammation in obesity is associated with co-morbidities such as, hyperglycemia, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Leukocytes play an important role in this inflammation and C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin-2 (IL-2) can be important effectors during the immune response in obesity; however, the initial inflammatory events in obesity remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the circulating levels of CRP, IL-2, insulin and adiponectin, their association and the association with leukocyte count in obese individuals without co-morbidities and with or without insulin resistance (IR).
Materials and methods
Nineteen obese non-diabetic and 9 lean subjects were studied for serum levels of CRP, IL-2, insulin, adiponectin, lipids, glycated hemoglobin, glycemia, for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), arterial pressure and anthropometric parameters, and for leukocyte counts. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (N/L) was calculated using the loge of leukocyte counts. Associations were determined by Pearson's correlation.
Results
None of the studied groups presented co-morbidities and two groups of obese individuals with normal or high levels of insulin (IR) were found. Increased CRP concentration and decreased IL-2 and adiponectin concentrations in obese were observed. Positive correlation between leukocyte type counts with CRP in obese with IR was found; however, no correlations with IL-2 in obese were observed. Insulin in obese were positively correlated with CRP and negatively correlated with IL-2 in IR obese individuals. Adiponectin in obese was negatively correlated with CRP.
Conclusion
CRP and IL-2 may represent two important effectors in the early inflammatory events in obese individuals without co-morbidities. Adiponectin and insulin may be involved in anti-inflammatory events."

The simple screening test of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) has not been established yet. We aimed to clarify the usefulness of simple measurement of AGEs for screening tests.
Methods
The subjects were healthy participants and patients with metabolic syndrome. Urine samples were diluted from 1:10 to 1:200 using phosphate-buffered saline, and the fluorescence intensity was measured at 440nm after excitation at 370nm in a 96-well microplate spectrophotometer. The obtained intensities were adjusted according to the urinary creatinine levels.
Results
In patients with metabolic syndrome, urinary AGE levels were significantly higher than in healthy individuals (median [range], 168.25 [82.51–1276.15] AU/g creatinine [n=37] versus 134.67 [37.86–776.31] AU/g creatinine [n=350], respectively; p=0.0066). We found significant positive correlations between urinary AGEs and systolic and diastolic blood pressures (Spearman's correlation r=0.119 [p=0.019] and r=0.128 [p=0.012], respectively). There was no significant correlation between estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary AGEs (r=0.018 [p=0.744]), confirming that renal dysfunction did not influence results of urinary AGE measurements. When all of the participants in the study were classified into four groups according to the numbers of components of metabolic syndrome, we found a significant tendency (p=0.0127) for urinary AGE levels to be higher with the increasing number of metabolic syndrome components.
Conclusion
These results suggested that measurement of urinary AGE levels may be useful for evaluating the risk of metabolic syndrome."

Background
Type 2-diabetes (T2D), is a public health problem which has reached epidemic proportions due to the rapidly increasing rates of this disease worldwide. It is known that adipose tissue can synthesize and release pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, adiponectin and leptin that are associated with body fat mass. Hence comparing the biomarkers with individuals without hyperglycemia would help us to understand the level of increase in their values though the vascular complications have not begun.
Materials and methods
This was a cross sectional study comprising 229 diabetic persons and 205 healthy individuals. High sensitivity reactive protein (hs-CRP) was estimated using nephelometry technique. Inflammatory markers and adiponectin were measured using ELISA instrument.
Results
Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) (40.56%) and Leptin (45.43%) were significantly increased in the diabetic group when compared with normal study population. Adiponectin was significantly decreased in diabetic study population (11.94%). This was supported by a significant correlation between the glycemic index HbA1c and TNF-α (r=0.376, p=0.01), adiponectin (r=−0.381, p=0.01) and leptin (r=0.269, p=0.01) in diabetic population, but the significance was lost among the normal healthy individuals.
Conclusions
The most promising biomarkers of diabetes such as TNF-α, adiponectin, leptin has shown a marked difference in this diabetic population. This study proves the assessment of these biomarkers as future predictors of type 2 diabetes."

We analyzed data on 1653 workers in a financial corporation (698 males and 955 females) who may have gained weight during 1 year but nevertheless remained non-obese. Data were collected twice: baseline data were collected between April 2010 and March 2011, and follow-up data were collected the next year. We calculated weight gains over the year and assigned all subjects into one of four groups according to the amount of weight gained: 0–0.99kg weight gain (reference), 1.00–1.99kg, 2.00–2.99kg, and more than 3.00kg. We compared changes in MetS parameters between the reference and other groups using Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
Results
Significant between-group differences were evident among males in terms of abdominal circumference (AC), blood pressure, and triglyceride (TG) levels. More weight gain was associated with worse results with regard to these MetS parameters. The AC changes were 0.60, 1.55, 2.86, and 4.42cm in the reference group, those who gained 1.00–1.99kg, those who gained 2.00–2.99kg, and those who gained over 3.00kg, respectively; the differences between the reference group and all other groups were significant (all p values <0.001).
Conclusions
Weight gain (in kg) is a useful index of weight change and influences several parameters of MetS even over the course of 1 year."

Aim
Recent studies highlight barriers of diabetes educational programs in Iran and also present some successful experiences carried out for improving the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of type-2 diabetic patients. Hence, evaluation of patients’ KAP seems to be needed. We designed a multicenter study evaluating level of KAP in type-2 diabetic patients in the capital city of Tehran and identifying variables that affect this KAP level.
Methods
This multicenter analytical cross-sectional study was approved by Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee. Questionnaires were designed for evaluation of diabetes-related KAP in patients. After validating the questionnaires by endocrinologists, test–retest method was used for questionnaire reliability by checking in 15 diabetic patients. Two hundred type-2 diabetic patients admitted to 4 hospitals of Tehran filled out the questionnaires. Using SPSS software, the level of KAP and its confounders were evaluated in patients.
Results
Two hundred type-2 diabetic patients with the mean age of 60.17 years were evaluated (106 male and 94 female). The mean diabetes duration was 13.06 years. The levels of patients’ good knowledge, attitude, and practice were 61.41%, 50.44% and 52.23%, respectively. Age, treatment methods, DM duration, and existence of diabetic retinopathy had significant correlations with KAP level.
Conclusions
The results of this study showed that recent educational programs in Iran improved KAP level. Patients’ KAP increases as their condition worsens/progresses. Hence education should be considered as a priority for newly diagnosed patients and those with lower KAP levels before occurrence of diabetes complications."

Approximately 10–15% of diabetic patients developed foot ulcers at some state in their life and 15% of all load in amputations are performed in patients with diabetes. There is a need to provide extensive education to both primary care physicians and the patients regarding the relationship between glucose control and complications encountered in the foot and ankle. The management of diabetic foot disease is focussed primarily on avoiding amputation of lower extremities and should be carried out through three main strategies; identification of the “at risk” foot, treatment of acutely diseased foot, and prevention of further problems. These are several obstacles in the management of DFI that include poor knowledge and awareness of diabetes and its complications, lack of appropriate podiatry services. These goals are possible only by the establishment of a dedicated team of podiatrist, endocrinologist, vascular surgeon and a pedorthist. The plastic surgeons, orthopaedic surgeons & diabetes teaching nurses/educator dedicated to foot care could be a part of the team. Identifying the patients with diabetes at risk for ulceration requires feet examination, including the vascular & neurological systems, skin conditions, and foot structure. Conservative management of foot problems has dramatically reduced the risk of amputation by simple procedures, such as appropriate foot wear, cleanliness, aggressive surgical debridement, regular wound dressing by simple wet-to-dry saline guage, and ulcer management."

Epidemiological studies suggest that vitamin D status influences type 2 diabetes mellitus. We investigate the metabolic effects of vitamin D.
Material and methods
We studied consecutive type 2 diabetic patients without insulin therapy with vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) lower than 20ng/ml). They were treated with 16,000IU of calcifediol orally once a week for a minimum of 8 weeks.
Results
Twenty eight patients were treated for a mean time of 84.1 days (range 56 to 120 days). All patients achieved serum levels of 25(OH)D higher than 20ng/ml. There was a significant reduction in fasting glucose (145.6±35.5 vs. 131.7±30.4mg/dl, p<0.001). There were small non-significant reductions in HbA1c, fasting insulin and Homeostasis Model Assesment (HOMA)-insulin resistance (IR). There were small non-significant increases in HOMA-insulin sensitivity (S) and HOMA-beta cell function (B) and a small significant increase in Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI).
Conclusions
Correction of vitamin D deficiency in type 2 diabetic patients decreases fasting glucose. Our results do not rule out improvements in metabolic control, insulin-resistance and function of the beta cell."

abstract = "Background
Although optimizing glycemic and non-glycemic targets reduced micro- and macro-vascular complications in type 2 diabetes, multiple barriers hinder turning evidence into practice. Mounting evidence suggests that those with onset of disease in early or mid-adult life, compared with those with onset at an older age, may have a more severe disease course and worse glycemic control.
Aims & objective
We tested the hypothesis that those diagnosed at younger age would have worse glycemic control, even after adjustment for duration of diabetes, higher BMI and other known risk factors for worse glycemic control.
Materials & methods
A cross-sectional analysis of 560 type 2 diabetic subjects from North Indian populace in the year 1999–2012 who reported to endocrine clinic was performed. Sixty patients did not report in the successive year and final data analyses were done in 500 patients attending clinic regularly over a period of 10 years for evaluation of glycemic and non-glycemic targets. They were followed up at 3 monthly intervals with all patients undergoing anthropometric measurement (BMI (weight in kg/height in m2), diet and lifestyle advice by a diabetic educator and consultation by endocrinologist. Fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, A1c (3 monthly), besides evaluation of SMBG that was performed in 50% of these patients regularly. Fasting lipids, S. creatinine and microalbuminuria were assessed annually and blood pressure recoding was done at each visit. The treatment was modified as per the investigation reports. We classified age at diabetes diagnosis as younger (<60 years) vs older (≥60 years). The primary outcome of interest was HbA1c ≥9%. Secondary outcomes were HbA1c ≥8% to <9% and HbA1c ≥7% to <8%.
Results
After adjustment for sex, duration of diabetes, hyperglycemic medications, BMI, co-morbid conditions, age <60 years at diagnosis remains significantly associated with greater odds of HbA1c ≥9% [OR 0.95(0.84–1.07)], HbA1c ≥8% to <9% [OR 1.04(0.93–1.15)] and HbA1c ≥7% to <8% [OR 1.05(0.85–1.17)] for female sex. Seventy two (72.7%) of patients <60 years achieved BP <140/90mmHg (p<0.001) as compared to 62.3% of patients ≥60 years who achieved BP <150/90mmHg (p<0.001) and LDL-cholesterol <100mg/dl in 33.7% patients and 39.1% respectively (p<0.002).
Conclusion
Younger age (<60 years) at type 2 diabetes diagnosis is significantly associated with worse subsequent glycemic control and lipid control, as younger patients at diagnosis have fewer competing co-morbidities and complications. As patient-centeredness is a priority in type 2 diabetes care, safe, aggressive and individualized treatment could benefit this higher-risk group."

It included 378 diabetes patients seeking care from two hospitals in Ghana. Standard methods and tools were used to assess participants’ weight, height, waist circumference (WC), blood pressure (BP) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Weight management behaviours were measured using a questionnaire.
Results
The prevalence of general obesity, abdominal obesity and hypertension was 20.1%, 46.6% and 67.7% respectively. Abdominal obesity was more likely in participants who: skipped breakfast, engaged in exercise to lose weight and were generally overweight/obese. General overweight and obesity was more likely in participants who: reported receipt of weight management counselling, engaged in exercise to lose weight, had a weight management plan/goal, and were abdominally obese. Hypertension was less likely in participants who had: no formal education, diabetes for ≥5 years and modified their dietary habits to lose weight but more likely in those who skipped breakfast.

Aims
To compare adiposity indices and to assess their various cut-off values for the prediction of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in postmenopausal women.
Methods
One hundred forty nine volunteers (67.17±6.12 years) underwent body composition assessment using DXA and had 5 anthropometric indices measured (Waist Circumference, WC; Waist-to-Height Ratio, WHtR; Body Mass Index, BMI; Body Adiposity Index, BAI; and Conicity Index). Blood pressure was assessed using an oscillometric device and fasting blood samples were collected. MetS was classified according NCEP-ATP III. Cut-off values to predict MetS were obtained using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses and odds ratios were also calculated.
Results
MetS prevalence was 29.5% and subjects who were classified with MetS showed worse cardiometabolic outcomes and higher anthropometric indices values (p<0.05). With the exception of total- and LDL-cholesterol, all remaining variables were significantly correlated with at least one of the adiposity indices, with the strongest relationships observed for the indices reflecting central body fat. The cut-off values were 88cm, 0.57cm/cm, 26.85kg/m2, 43.7%, 36.34%, and 1.24 units for WC, WHtR, BMI, DXA-derived body fat percentage, BAI, and conicity index, respectively. Significant greater risks for MetS were found for volunteers who had WHtR (odds=9.08; CI: 1.81–45.47) or WC (odds=5.20; CI: 1.30–20.73) measurements above cut-off values.
Conclusion
Adiposity indices are associated with MetS in postmenopausal women in different degrees. Indices which consider central adiposity such as WC and WHtR have a stronger relationship with MetS compared to DXA-derived body fat percentage, which is considered a gold standard."

To determine the effect of genetic variants within the FTO gene (rs9939609) on obesity related traits and type 2 diabetes in South Asian population of Karachi, Pakistan.
Methods
A case-control study was conducted at Baqai Institute of Diabetology and Endocrinology (BIDE), Baqai Medical University situated in Karachi. A total of 296 patients with known type 2 diabetes and 198 controls aged greater than and equal to 45 years were recruited. The Anthropometric, clinical and biochemical data was collected on a structured questionnaire. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in FTO gene was identified by Amplification Refractory Mutation System-Polymerase Chain Reaction (ARMS-PCR). Association between the single nucleotide polymorphism and categorical variables such as type 2 diabetes and obesity category was tested through logistic regression analysis.
Results
We observed a strong association of the minor allele A at rs9939609 with type 2 diabetes. Significant difference was observed in frequency of FTO genotype when diabetic subjects were compared with controls in co dominant, dominant and recessive models. This association remained significant even after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and for waist circumference. The frequency of homozygous risk Alleles (AA) was found to be higher in obese & overweight (≥23kg/m2) and females with central obesity in our study population. The association of FTO variant with BMI and central obesity does not reach to statistical significance.
Conclusion
In the study population of South Asian ancestry, variants of the FTO gene predispose to type 2 diabetes, but not entirely through their effect on BMI."

Materials and methods
To evaluate the prevalence of Met Syn among long-haul drivers, 1018 male drivers were studied. Definition of Met Syn was based on ATP III, IDF and AHA. The statistical tests were composed of chi-square and independent t tests.
Results and conclusion
The participants’ mean age was 42.17±10.65 years. The prevalence of Met Syn according to ATP III, IDF and AHA criteria was 26.1%, 35.2% and 31.6% respectively. 6.6% of drivers were impaired fasting glucose. The drivers with the bus, minibus, taxi formed the greatest number of smokers (82.9%) among all drivers (p=0.023). The average of body mass index (BMI) was 26.2±4.06. The most prevalence of Mets according to IDF criteria were observed in drivers of heavy vehicles and also the ones of passenger vehicles, with 36.7% and 43.9% respectively. Based on high prevalence of Met Syn and other risk factors in this study, and considering these factors, should be more careful about this point. It is recommended to control risk factors such as, control of high BMI and TG, LDL, waist circumfernce, education."

Aims
Serum chemerin concentrations are elevated in obese individuals and may play a role in type 2 diabetes. Exercise improves insulin sensitivity, which may be related to changes in chemerin. This study explored how an acute bout of aerobic exercise affected chemerin levels in non-diabetic obese adults.
Methods
Blood samples from 11 obese adults were obtained during two separate conditions: sedentary (SED) and exercise (EX; 60–65% VO2peak). Samples were drawn at baseline, immediately following exercise and hourly for an additional 2h. ANOVA was used to test for differences in chemerin between conditions.
Results
Unadjusted analysis showed no difference in overall change (baseline to 2h post) in chemerin between conditions. During the 2-h post-exercise period, chemerin decreased to 12% below baseline, compared to a 2.5% increase above baseline during that time period on the sedentary day (p=0.06, difference in post-to-2h change between conditions). Controlling for homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), a significant difference existed between EX and SED in the change in chemerin from baseline to 2-h post (p=0.02). Stratified analyses showed a consistent exercise-induced decrease in chemerin among non-insulin resistant subjects, while chemerin increased during exercise among insulin resistant subjects, and then decreased post-exercise.
Conclusion
An acute bout of exercise in obese individuals may elicit a drop in chemerin levels during the post-exercise period, and this response may vary based on insulin resistance."

Aims
Non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is gaining importance over low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as cardiovascular risk marker in patients with type 2 diabetes. It represents the overall lipid burden and is a surrogate marker for the apolipoprotein B. We studied the discordance between the old (LDL-C) and the new (non-HDL-C) lipid markers in a large group of diabetes patients.
Methods
The lipid profile data of all diabetes (T2DM, aged 18–75, using oral or injectable anti diabetic agents) patients was analyzed in this study. We excluded patients with type1 diabetes, secondary forms of diabetes and gestational diabetes. Elevated lipid parameters (LDL>100mg/dL and non HDL-C>130mg/dL) were defined as per the guidelines of Adult Treatment Panel III.
Results
The study participants (409 M:360 F) had a mean age of 47.3±12.4 years, BMI of 28.4±5.6kg/m2 and an A1c of 8.8±2.2%. Elevated LDL-C was observed in 383 patients (49.8%) and elevated non HDL-C in 418 (54.4%) patients. Of the 383 patients with elevated LDL-C, 346 (90.3%) had corresponding elevated levels of non-HDL-C and out of 418 patients with elevated non HDL-C, 346 (83%) had elevated LDL-C. Discordance between the elevated LDL-C and non-HDL-C values were greater among patients with low triglyceride levels when compared with those with high triglycerides (Pearson's χ2 test=67.7; P<0.001).
Conclusion
Our data suggest a significant discordance between the LDL-C and non-HDL-C in patients with diabetes. This discordance leads to the residual cardiovascular risk in diabetes patients."

The study was conducted on 170 obese and 81 non-obese individuals. After collecting the blood samples, serum levels metabolic parameters as well as three circulating adipokines and body composition were measured.
Results
No significant difference was noted regarding the mean serum levels of omentin-1 and vaspin between the obese and non-obese groups, while, serum level of RBP4 was significantly higher in the non-obese group. We found the 0.22 increased risk of MD in obese individuals with higher RBP4 concentration. After the adjustment for confounding factors, this association was still significant. No significant association was noted between MD and its components relative risks with omentin-1 and vaspin levels.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrated that circulating RBP4 was significantly higher in the obese individuals which may increase the risk of MD in them. Further researches are needed to address this association."

In the present study we examined the association of serum GGT and HOMA-IR with NAFLD in Bangladeshi adult subjects.
Materials and methods
Under a cross-sectional analytical design a total of 110 subjects were recruited who came for their routine health check up in the BIHS Hospital, Darussalam, Dhaka, Bangladesh. After whole abdomen ultrasonography, 62 were diagnosed as non-NAFLD and 48 were NAFLD subjects. Serum glucose was measured by glucose-oxidase method, lipid profile and liver enzymes by enzymatic colorimetric method, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), serum insulin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HOMA-IR was calculated by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA).
Results
NAFLD subjects had significantly higher levels of GGT and HOMA-IR as compared to their non-NAFLD counterparts. Multiple linear regression analysis showed a significant positive association of HOMA-IR with GGT after adjusting the effects of waist circumference (WC) and HbA1c. In binary logistic regression analysis, HOMA-IR and GGT were found to be significant determinants of NAFLD after adjusting the effects of WC and HbA1c.
Conclusion
These results suggest that elevated levels of GGT and insulin resistance are more likely to develop NAFLD and thus support a role of these determinants in the pathogenesis of NAFLD in Bangladeshi adult subjects."

abstract = "Aims
Sustained hyperglycemia is a causative factor for glycation of proteins. Glycated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is strongly associated with an increased risk of CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) in diabetics. Hence, we planned to evaluate the association of glycated apo B with subclinical atherosclerosis.
Method
Forty-five non obese and 45 obese diabetics were recruited. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were estimated by HPLC (High Pressure Liquid Chromatography) and small dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) was calculated using standard formula. Plasma Insulin was done by RIA. Insulin resistance was calculated using homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) model. Glycated apo B in serum was estimated using ELISA. Carotid intimal media thickness (CIMT) was estimated using B mode USG of carotid arteries.
Results
Glycated apo B levels were correlated significantly with fasting blood glucose (FBG) (p=0.001), post prandial glucose (PPG) (p=0.001), HbA1c (p=0.013). The percent glycated apo B levels correlated significantly with FBG (p=0.032), PPG (p=0.004) in obese diabetic group. Multivariate regression analysis of glycated apo B and percent glycated apo B, showed that glycated apo B (p=0.009) and percent glycated apo B (p=0.006) were significantly correlated to FPG in diabetic population. The percent glycated apo B was also significantly correlated to PPG (p=0.003) and sdLDL (p=0.009). CIMT levels were higher in obese diabetics with 2 plaques positive when compared to obese non diabetic controls; however levels were not statistically significant.
Conclusion
Persistent hyperglycemia and sdLDL are independently associated with glycation of apo B. Presence of plaques and increased thickness of intima indicates that glycated apo B predisposes diabetics to atherosclerosis."

Disparities in learning skills, resources, education, and physician practices make it difficult to practically implement the diabetes management guidelines recommended by international scientific organizations. In its guidelines, the International Diabetes Federation advocates for three different levels of care based on availability of resources. This study investigates the differences in intermediate health outcomes between two diabetes care programs: one a comprehensive diabetes centre, the other a limited care setting. The comprehensive centre offers telemedicine and periodic diabetes education, empowering patients and providing 24-hour advice on lifestyle modifications, diet, and exercise. All patients of this centre practice self-monitoring of blood glucose. The subjects in the limited care setting receive minimal investigations and periodic physical follow-ups, and few patients have access to home glucose monitoring. The results showed that HbA1c (7.62 vs. 8.58, p=0.003), cholesterol (134.4 vs. 173.4, p<0.001), and diastolic blood pressure (72.9 vs. 77.0, p=0.016) were significantly lower in patients receiving comprehensive care, while the reductions in systolic blood pressure (134.6 vs. 138.7, p=0.202) did not achieve statistical significance. These reductions, which remained significant after correcting for confounding factors, could be attributed to more aggressive treatment regimens in the comprehensive care centre, as well as the real-time, frequent communication with medical professionals in the telemedicine program."

Insulin sensitizers might influence oxidative stress to improve insulin resistance in diabetes mellitus. The present study was designed with the aim to study the effect of Metformin & Pioglitazone on markers of oxidative stress after 4 weeks of therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Type 2 DM).
Research design and methods
This was a prospective study with follow up of 4 weeks in patients with Type 2 DM. They were randomized into metformin treated group (N=20) and Pioglitazone treated group (N=20) and healthy age-matched control group (N=20). Data was presented as mean±S.D. Student “t” test, ANOVA and Pearson correlation co-efficient tests were performed to analyze the parametric data in this study.
Results
Baseline clinical characteristics of the two study groups were similar. There is a significant difference for Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2h-Post Prandial Plasma Glucose (PPPG) after 30 days of metformin and pioglitazone treatment. Metformin significantly reduced MDA (p=0.041) and increased SOD (p<0.001). Pioglitazone significantly reduced MDA (p<0.001) but failed to raise SOD level (p=0.132). Mean MDA was 4.57±0.57μM/L in metformin and 2.91±0.66μM/L in pioglitazone treatment with a p-value of <0.001. Further, a similar significant difference was obtained for SOD value by metformin and pioglitazone treatment (7.87±0.72U/ml vs. 6.94±0.53U/ml; p<0.001).
Conclusion
Pioglitazone was superior to Metformin to improve oxidative stress as reflected by reduction in MDA but the antioxidant effect i.e. increase in SOD was seen with metformin only. The differing mechanism of actions of the two drugs on oxidative stress favors co prescription of these drugs for better outcome in improving insulin resistance and diabetic complications."

Metabolic syndrome progresses to diabetes and determinants of this progression like hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia and genetic factors have been speculative. The present study was aimed at quantifying the insulin resistance and influence of family history of diabetes in subjects with metabolic syndrome developing prediabetes and diabetes.
Methods
Consecutive subjects attending the endocrine clinic were evaluated for metabolic syndrome as per definition of International Diabetes Federation, 2005. The family history of diabetes in their first degree relatives was ascertained and Homeostasis model assessment of Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), Homeostasis model assessment for beta cell function (HOMA-B) and Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated in 163 subjects enrolled.
Results
HOMA-IR was higher (p<0.05) but HOMA-B and QUICKI were lower (p<0.0001) in subjects with metabolic syndrome+prediabetes or diabetes compared to metabolic syndrome with normal glucose tolerance. HOMA-B was lower and prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes was higher in metabolic syndrome subjects with family history of diabetes than in those without such family history (p<0.05).
Conclusions
subjects with metabolic syndrome having prediabetes and diabetes had more severe insulin resistance than those with metabolic syndrome only. Beta cell dysfunction was remarkable and prevalence of prediabetes was high in metabolic syndrome subjects with family history of diabetes. Both the severity of the insulin resistance and family history of diabetes are therefore proposed to be determinants of diminished Beta cell function leading to diabetes in metabolic syndrome."

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have a well-known effect on glycaemic control in patients with diabetes but little is known on their wound healing role in this group of population. This paper reviews the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors on wound healing of diabetic foot ulcers.
Methods
Published data on effects and mechanism of DDP-4 inhibitors on wound healing were derived from Medline, PubMed and Google Scholar search of English language literature from 1994 to 2014 using the key words such as “DPP-4 inhibitors”, “endothelial healing” “diabetes” and “chronic ulcers”.
Results
DPP-4 inhibitors show a potential benefit in processes of wound healing in diabetic chronic foot ulcers. The enzyme inhibitors promote recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells and allow the final scaffolding of wounds. Furthermore DPP-4 inhibitors augment angiogenesis and have widespread effects on optimising the immune response to persistent hypoxia in chronic diabetes wounds.
Conclusion
DPP-4 inhibitors show promise in the local wound healing of diabetic foot ulcers in addition to its already established glycaemic control. In the light of high rate of amputations due to non-healing ulcers with profound psychological and economical liability, more investigations on the usefulness of DPP-4 inhibitors in the high risk diabetes population are needed."

Cardiac autonomic dysfunction (CAD) is associated with both prediabetes and metabolic syndrome (MS). Heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate turbulence (HRT) are reliable 24-h Holter-ECG findings of cardiac autonomic function. This study aimed to investigate the relation between MS and its components and CAD using HRV and HRT.
Materials and methods
The study included 80 non-diabetic patients with MS and 70 control subjects. All study population and the patients with MS were further analyzed for each diagnostic component of MS to investigate which criteria impaired HRV and HRT.
Results
HRV and HRT parameters were disturbed in patients in the MS group. While impairment in HRV and HRT was significantly related to the presence of the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) criterion, there were no differences between groups in terms of the other 4 MS criteria. Moreover, FPG level was significantly correlated with SDNN (r=−0.352, p<0.001), SDNN index (r=−0.423, p<0.001), SDANN (r=−0.301, p<0.001), RMSSD (r=−0.237, p<0.001), pNN50 (r=−0.237, p<0.001), turbulence onset (TO) (r=0.365, p<0.001) and turbulence slope (TS) (r=−0.365, p<0.001). Among the MS diagnostic criteria, only FPG level was an independent determinant of all HRV and HRT parameters.
Conclusions
This study confirms the relation between MS and CAD. Increased FPG alone appears to be responsible for the mentioned findings among the 5 diagnostic criteria. Accordingly, CAD may be the result of prediabetes, not MS in patients with MS."

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is autoimmune diabetes with a slow progression characterized by the presence of antibodies associated with Type I diabetes. The present study aimed to assess autoimmune characteristics in patients with LADA in Iran. We attempted to obtain a clear view of autoimmune conditions in LADA among our population.
Methods
This study was sourced from the population-based survey of KERCARDS aiming assessment of cardiovascular risk factors among a great sample of Iranian population who were resident in Kerman, a great province in southern Iran. Among all diabetic patients who were negative for Anti Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD) antibody test, 120 were selected as the controls and among 80 patients who were positive for this test diagnosed as LADA, the recorded files of 57 patients were complete considered as the cases.
Results
The level of thyroxin is significantly lower in patients with LADA compared with the controls so 73.7% and 45% of patients had normal level of thyroxin, respectively. Also, those with LADA had considerably lower levels of both thyroid peroxydaseantibody (TPO-Ab) and C-peptide when compared with non-LADA group. Using multivariate analyses and with the presence of baseline variables including gender, age, and duration of disease, the diagnosis of LADA was associated with lower serum levels of Anti-TPO, C-peptide, and thyroxin, but not associated with the level of Anti-TTG in serum.
Conclusion
LADA patients may face with lower serum levels of C-peptide and thyroid-specific antibodies indicating insulin therapy requirement and authoimmune fundaments of the disease, respectively."

The existence of early factors which, acting during critical periods of intrauterine or immediate postnatal development, determine long-term health has become increasingly recognized. Both high and low birth weight have been associated with cardiovascular risk factors in adulthood. Therefore, body composition at birth rather than birth weight may be a marker to predict future diseases. Maternal weight previous to and gained during pregnancy is associated with intrauterine fetal growth.
Objective
To evaluate the correlation between maternal nutritional status before and during pregnancy and neonatal body composition.
Material and methods
We studied consecutive mother–child pairs at delivery at an Argentinean public hospital during 5 months period, evaluating maternal and neonatal anthropometry before 24h of life as well as the history of the mother before and during pregnancy. Neonatal body composition was calculated according to a mathematical formula based on skinfold thickness measurement validated in newborns.
Results
Mothers of newborns with high body fat mass were more frequently obese (72.7% versus 35.1%, p 0.005), and more frequently showed weight gain above 18kg during pregnancy (76.4% versus 31%, p 0.03).
Conclusions
Our findings confirm the hypothesis that maternal obesity before pregnancy is highly correlated with neonatal fat mass in the first hours of life."

abstract = "Aims
To determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) and its risk factors in a middle-aged population in Iran.
Methods
The sample was 5190 individuals aged 40–64 years participated in the first phase of the Shahroud eye cohort study. Prevalence of MS was determined in terms of the age and sex. Other variables were evaluated by using simple and multiple logistic regression methods.
Results
The prevalence of MS was 10.88% in men, 13.03% in women and 12.14% in total. The prevalence proportion increased with increasing age. In multivariate logistic regression model, age (odds ratio (OR)=1.06), education (OR=0.98) and smoking (OR=0.50), had significant effects on MS. In this model, gender, marital status and economic status had no significant effect on MS. Higher prevalence of obesity and overweight in non-smokers (79.9%) compare to smokers (47.4%, P<0.001), indicated that the association of smoking and MS is confounded.
Conclusions
Despite the low prevalence of MS in this study, older age was associated with increased risk of developing MS and higher education was associated with decreased this risk, therefore health education, changing the lifestyle, and taking greater attention in elderly is needed in order to prevent the MS and its complications."

Objective
This study investigates the relationship between change in job status and mortality of newly diagnosed type II diabetes patients by gender.
Methods
Newly onset of individuals diagnosed with type II diabetes in the years 2003 and 2004, had 7 years follow-up using National Health Insurance Corporation (NHIC) sample cohort data. The individuals diagnosed with type II diabetes within this period were 14,861. After adjusting for age, initial income group, insulin treatment and medical service utilization, hazard ratio was analyzed using Cox's proportional hazard model.
Results
Mortality hazard ratio of continuously unemployed individuals is 3.78 times higher in males and 9.78 times higher in females than in those who keep their jobs. Also, individuals with a change in job status (e.g. from industrial worker to unemployed or self-employed), the mortality hazard ratio is 2.24 times higher in males and 5.23 times higher in females than in those who keep their jobs. The impact of change in job status change is largest for the middle class males. The middle class males has the higher mortality hazard ratio, 6.14 times in maintain unemployed and 4.12 times in change his job (industrial worker to unemployed or self-employer) than maintain one's job.
Conclusions
The continuous unemployment and the loss of job are related to risk of death in diabetic patients. The impact of unemployed is stronger than job change (loss or change). The impact of job status change is largest for the middle class man."

abstract = "Summary
Obesity and its complications are emerging in an epidemic manner in Latin American countries.
Aims
To estimate the prevalence of Cardio-Metabolic Risk Factors (CMRFs) and Metabolic Syndrome (MS) in overweight/obese (OW/OB) and normal weight (NW) adolescents and to examine the associated variables.
Material and methods
A cross-sectional comparative study was conducted in two groups of children, between 10 and 19 years of age, in seven Argentine provinces. A survey on dietary habits, physical activity, anthropometric and biochemical data was collected to identify CMRF and MS. The WHO definition adapted to children was used.
Results
1009 children were assessed; 398 were male (39.4%), 601 (59.6%) were NW and 408 (40.4%) were OW/OB. The OW/OB had a significantly higher proportion of values defined as CMRF: 3.7% impaired fasting glucose >110mg/dl; 27.9% insulin >15 or 20μU/l as they were pubertal/prepubertal; 53.2% Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA)>2.5; 45.6% High Density Lipoprotein (HDL)<40mg/dl; 37.7% TG>110mg/dl and 13.5% hypertension (SBP and/or diastolic Blood Pressure percentile >90). Prevalence of the MS in OW/OB patients was 40.3%. The MS was not observed in NW children. Significant differences were found for: family history of OW/OB, birth weight (BW), age at menarche, presence of acanthosis nigricans, waist circumference (WC) >90th percentile. The WC was positively correlated with BP, TG, insulin, HOMA and Body mass index Z score and negatively with HDL in the study population.
Conclusions
We confirm obesity as a major determinant of CMRF and MS (40%), especially fat centralization. We stress the need to address obesity prevention plans in children and adolescents."

The aim of this study was to determine if osteocalcin is related to adiposity and hyperglycaemia in metabolic syndrome irrespective of the presence of diabetes mellitus.
Materials and Methods
This was a cross sectional study of 90 patients (59 men and 31 women) with metabolic syndrome as defined by the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Based on medical history 50 out of 90 patients had a diabetes. Anthropometric data were collected and blood taken for measurement of osteocalcin, fasting lipids, fasting glucose and insulin resistance (using homeostatic model assessment index, HOMA-IR).
Results
Osteocalcin correlated negatively with fasting glucose (r=−0.366, p<0.001) and HOMA-IR (r=−0.305, p<0.05) but not with waist circumference (r=0.079), body mass index (r=0.028), total cholesterol (r=0.061) or triglycerides (r=0.009). Diabetics had higher HOMA-IR (p<0.01) and lower osteocalcin levels (p<0.01) than non-diabetics. Among diabetics, osteocalcin correlated with glucose only (r=−0.341, p=0.015). In non-diabetics, osteocalcin correlated with HOMA-IR (r=−0.359, p=0.023) via insulin (r=−0.402, p=0.010). Patients with impaired fasting glucose levels (5.6–6.9mmol/L) had the same HOMA-IR as diabetics (p=0.076) but not low osteocalcin (p=0.025).
Conclusions
In this cross-sectional study of subjects with metabolic syndrome and central obesity, low osteocalcin was associated with diabetes but not adiposity."

Exercise plays significant role in the health outcomes of patients with diabetes, however, little is known about patients’ knowledge of exercise for plasma blood glucose control among patients with type-2 diabetes (T2D). This study investigated knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of exercise for plasma blood glucose control among patients with T2D.
Materials and Methods
This cross-sectional study recruited 299 patients with T2D (male=105; female=194) from selected government hospitals in Osun State, Nigeria using purposive sampling technique. Validated questionnaires were used to assess of exercise for plasma blood glucose control and socioeconomic status (SES) of the patients. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha level was set at <0.05.
Results
The mean age of respondents was 51.9±9.8 years. A majority, 245(81.9%) were married individuals and more than half, 195(65.3%) were in the low SES. One hundred and forty-eight (49.5%) had good knowledge of exercise whilst 269(90.0%) had negative attitude to exercise practice. Less than a third, 82(27.4%) engaged in exercise practice for plasma blood glucose control. There was significant association between knowledge and practice of exercise (2=12.535; p=0.002).

The main objective is to assess the prevalence of elevated liver enzymes levels among patients with type 2 diabetes from Algerian west region and to determine associated risk factors.
Materials and methods
A descriptive cross sectional study was performed on 180 type 2 diabetic patients in whom anthropometric and biochemical parameters were determined.
Results
Twenty-five patients had abnormal elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) (13.9%) with the gender-wise prevalence being 15.9% (n=17) in women and 10.9% (n=8) in men. The prevalence of abnormal elevated aspartate transaminase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase level was respectively 10% (n=18), 6.1% (n=11) and 8.9% (16). High waist circumference (OR: 5, CI: 1.04–24.04) and high blood pressure (OR: 4.86, CI: 0.94–25.12) were only associated with elevated AST. Fasting glucose >1.4g/l were associated both with elevated ALT (OR: 3.03, CI: 0.86–10.67) and AST (OR: 5.7, CI: 1.09–29.8).

abstract = "Summary
The study aim was to evaluate the impact of dysmetabolic comorbidities including subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) on pattern of circulating endothelial-derived microparticles (EMPs) in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients.
Methods
It was retrospectively involved a cohort of 388 patients with CHF. Fifty three CHF subjects had SH and 335 patients were free from thyroid dysfunction. Circulating levels of NT-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total and free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) EMPs were measured at baseline. SH was defined per contemporary clinical guideline as state associated with elevated level of serum TSH>10μU/L and basal normal free T3 and T4 concentration.
Results
Circulating CD31+/annexin V+ EMPs were higher in SH patients compared with none SH subjects. In contrast, activated CD62E+ EMP numbers were not significantly different between both patient cohorts. Using C-statistics for Models with TSH, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, dyslipidemia, and circulating biomarkers (hs-CRP, NT-proBNP, serum uric acid) as Continuous Variables we found that adding of NYHA class alone, NT-proBNP alone or their combination to the based model (TSH) improved the relative integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) for increased CD31+/annexin V+ to CD62E+ ratio by 4.9%; 9.2% and 9.6% respectively. NT-proBNP improves significantly predictive model based on TSH for increased CD31+/annexin V+ to CD62E+ ratio. Among patient study population for category-free net reclassification improvement (NRI), 4% of events (P=0.026) and 6% of non-events (P=0.012) were correctly reclassified by the addition of circulating NT-proBNP to the base model (TSH) for Increased CD31+/annexin V+ to CD62E+ ratio. Therefore, 4% of events (P=0.028) and 5% of non-events (P=0.014) were correctly reclassified using category-free NRI for increased CD31+/annexin V+ to CD62E+ ratio.
Conclusion
We found that SH state in CHF patients associates with impaired pattern of circulating EMPs with predominantly increased number of apoptotic-derived microparticles."
