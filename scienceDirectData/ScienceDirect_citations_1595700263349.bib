abstract = "Background
Type 2 diabetes has a high spread and growing process. Using appropriate food diets is among therapeutic approaches has been applied for diabetic patients. Soya utilization has shown effective results in controlling metabolic abnormalities of these patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of soy nut on glycemic conditions, blood pressure, lipid profile, antioxidant effects and vascular endothelial function of these patients.
Methods
70 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly divided into two groups of the test (35 people) and control (35 people). The patients in the intervention group were subjected to 60 g soy nut diet as a part of daily protein for 8 weeks and the control group under the usual diet of diabetes. The fasting glucose, blood pressure, lipid profile, brachial blood flow, the level of serum E-Selectin and total antioxidant capacity in control and test group were assessed before and after diet.
Results
Consuming 60 g soy nut for 8 weeks significantly decreased the fasting blood glucose (P = 0.03), total serum cholesterol (P < 0.01), LDL-c (P = 0.01), and E-Selectin (P < 0.01) and increased the capacity of serum total antioxidants (P < 0.01), brachial blood flow (P < 0.01) but didn't have any significant effect on systolic/diastolic blood pressure, HDL-c, and TG.
Conclusion
Soy nut utilization in the patients with type-2 diabetes can significantly improve the glycemic condition, increase brachial blood flow, decrease E-selectin (improvement of endothelial function), increase serum total antioxidants and lipid profile but has no significant effect on blood pressure and HDL-c."

To compare the acute and chronic effects of high-intensity intermittent training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on indices of cardio-metabolic health: (HDL-c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, heart ratio, and phase angle/PhA) in physically active men.
Methods
Twenty active men were randomly allocated to HIIT (n = 10), or MICT (n = 10) for 5 weeks, three times per week. HIIT consisted of running 5 km with 1-min at 100% of maximal aerobic speed interspersed by 1-min passive recovery while subjects in MICT group ran continuously the same 5 km at 70% of maximal aerobic speed. Blood samples were collected at different moments during the first and last exercise session. Before and after 5 weeks of both exercise training protocols, heart ratio (during exercise session) and PhA were measured pre and post-exercise training.
Results
Fasting HDL-c levels did not change after 5 weeks of HIIT or MICT. Perceptual variation of HDL pre and post training (fed state) tended to differ between HIIT and MICT (p = 0.09). All lipoproteins parameters (HDL-c, total cholesterol, triglycerides and non-HDL) were increased in post-acute exercise session compared to pre-exercise during the first and last training session, these being observed after both training protocols. PhA and heart rate measured at different times during the first and last training session were not affected in both training protocols.
Conclusion
These results indicate that HIIT and MICT modify the post-exercise lipoprotein profile acutely. On the other hand, only HIIT tended to increase HDL-c levels chronically."

The aim of this study was to study the effects of metformin therapy on serum chemerin levels in some phenotypes of polycystic ovarian syndrome cases, and to correlate chemerin levels with insulin resistance parameters and with hormonal profile.
Material and methods
This study was carried on 100 polycystic ovary cases and 70 control women. These cases were further subdivided into obese and normal weight cases. Fasting serum chemerin was measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay method. Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows 7.
Results
Before metformin therapy, the serum chemerin were significantly increased in PCOS cases as compared with the control cases. Also, a significantly higher chemerin levels were found in obese polycystic ovarian syndrome cases as compared with normal weight cases with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The serum chemerin levels were significantly positively correlated with glucose levels, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR in polycystic ovarian syndrome cases. After three months of metformin therapy, the serum chemerin, insulin, and HOMA-IR concentrations were significantly decreased in polycystic ovarian syndrome cases as compared with the levels before therapy.
Conclusion
The serum chemerin levels were significantly higher in cases of PCOS cases as compared with the controls. Metformin therapy resulted in a significant decrease in chemerin levels in polycystic ovarian syndrome cases. The analysis of Receiver Operation Characteristic curves of serum chemerin suggested that serum chemerin levels may be of value to evaluate the polycystic ovarian syndrome cases under various methods of treatments."

Chronic inflammation is known to be one of atherosclerosis non-traditional risk factor and has a role on every phase of atherogenesis. Periodontitis is the most common cause of chronic inflammation in diabetic patient. Both periodontitis and diabetes have detrimental effect on each other in terms of alveolar bone destruction and poor metabolic control, by continuous inflammatory mediator activation. Defect of bacteria elimination ability and monocyte hyper-responsiveness in diabetic patients leads to persistent elevation of systemic inflammatory mediators. This process give rise to prolonged and augmented exposure to inflammatory cytokines.

Diabetes mellitus is a commonly encountered diagnosis in hospitalised patients that is associated with prolonged admissions and mortality. One in six hospital beds in the UK are occupied by diabetes patients. Therefore, healthcare providers need to have a sound knowledge in managing in-patients with diabetes. Thus the aim of this clinical survey was to assess the diabetes-related knowledge of healthcare professionals in a district general hospital.
Methods
A 24-item questionnaire, based on the ‘Think Check Act (TCA)’ diabetes modules implemented by the Healthcare Improvement Scotland was issued to the medical and nursing staff. Simple statistics were used for data collation and analysis.
Results
30 questionnaires were completed by 10 doctors at varying stages of training, 17 nurses, 1 physician associate and 2 healthcare assistants. The mean percentage score of the participants were 57.4%. 22 (73.3%) correctly defined hypoglycaemia and 27 (90%) knew the location of hypo box and 7 (23.3%) were aware of TCA. Responses to other management related to diabetes emergencies were average. The responses between doctors and nurses were insignificant except for hypo box location (p = 0.0413).
Conclusion
Knowledge about managing inpatient diabetes problems amongst healthcare professional at a district general hospital appears mediocre. Significant gaps have been identified which would be targeted for future educational events."

abstract = "Background
Conventional therapies to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complications are only partially effective. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches leading to additional risk reduction are required. While many anti-diabetic medications have been prescribed world-wide for controlling T2DM over the past half-century, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are relatively new. In addition to their plasma glucose lowering effect, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce considerably cardiovascular mortality rate in patients with T2DM.
Aim
Since, a risk and benefit analysis of co-administration of SGLT2 inhibitors and other anti-diabetic agents in patients who suffer from hypertension, heart failure or renal deficiency is currently lacking, the main objective of this article is to review the recent literature and provide the health care professionals with evidence-based opinions on the subject.
Conclusion
SGLT2 inhibitors have relatively safe profiles and can efficiently decrease HbA1c as well as fasting and postprandial glucose levels. Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors administrations are not associated with significant hypoglycemic episodes or weight gain. Thus, combination of SGLT2 inhibitors and other less harmful anti-diabetic medicines could be considered if there is no any contraindication."

abstract = "Diabetes is a common metabolic disorder associated to elevated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that is not explained by hyperglycemia or traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking or hypercholesterolemia. Intensive glycemic control with insulin that achieves near-normal glycemia does not reduce significantly macrovascular complications compared with conventional glycemic control. Cardiovascular disease continues to develop in patients with diabetes despite adequate glycemic control. In contrast, intensive control with metformin (leading to insulin resistance improvement) reduces diabetes complications, including cardiovascular events, suggesting that enhancement of insulin sensitivity rather than plasma glucose level has a major role improving diabetes outcomes. Accordingly, insulin resistance estimated by glucose tolerance tests is better predictor of future cardiovascular events than fasting glucose level in nondiabetic individuals. Insulin resistance precedes for decades the clinical onset of type 2 diabetes and deteriorates metabolic control of type 1 diabetes. Numerous investigations including cross-sectional and prospective studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews provide compelling evidence that insulin resistance by itself is a cardiovascular risk factor in a variety of population groups, including the general population and patients with diabetes. Several estimations of insulin resistance have been consistently associated with elevated rate of cardiovascular events independently of other cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes status. The clinical expression of insulin resistance (the metabolic syndrome or any of its components including obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, and dyslipemia) has been related to cardiovascular disease as well. An estimation conducted by the Archimedes model confirms that insulin resistance is the most important single cause of coronary artery disease."

Results
Serum 25-(OH)D levels were found as significantly lower in all patients compared to the control group (p < 0.05). 25-(OH)D in patients with DM + retinopathy (p < 0.006), DM + nephropathy (p < 0.001) and DM + neuropathy (p < 0.001) was significantly lower than that of the control group. 25-(OH)D in patients with DM + nephropathy (p < 0.001), DM + neuropathy (p < 0.01) and DM + retinopathy (p < 0.001) was significantly lower than in the DM + uncomplicated group. 25-(OH)D levels were found as significantly lower in DM + CAD compared to the CAD group (p < 0.01). Serum 25-(OH)D and HbA1c and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were found to be negatively correlated with each other in DM + all complications.
Conclusions
Low serum 25-OHD levels were found to be associated with the development of diabetes and complications. Low serum 25-OHD levels may be a consequence of even worse metabolic control of diabetes."

A 2% absolute increase in energy intake from trans-fat has been associated with a 23% increase in cardiovascular risk. They increase the levels of low-density lipoprotein which is bad for health. Moreover, several epidemiological studies have been demonstrated that a high intake of TFAs increases the incidence of cancer and diabetes. On the other hand, total elimination of TFAs is not possible in a balanced diet due to their natural presence in dairy and meat products.

abstract = "Aim
The two-way relationship between diabetes mellitus and periodontitis has been extensively studied with various interconnected biomarkers sharing a link. Soluble Tumour Necrosis Factor-like Weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) is gaining attention as an important mediator in chronic inflammatory diseases. Thus, the aim of this study was to detect, estimate and compare the levels of sTWEAK in the serum of health, chronic periodontitis (CP), and CP with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Materials and methods
Forty-five participants between 18 and 65 years were divided into groups of 15 each as Group 1: healthy, Group 2: CP, and Group 3: CP + T2DM. Clinical periodontal parameters and glycemic status were assessed. sTWEAK in serum was estimated using a commercially available ELISA kit. The data was statistically analyzed.
Results
sTWEAK was detected in all participants. Significant differences were observed between the groups for sTWEAK; highest in health, lower in CP and lowest in CP + T2DM. In the diseased groups, the clinical and glycemic parameters correlated positively with each other, whereas sTWEAK correlated negatively with each of the parameters.
Conclusion
The literature reports lower concentrations of systemic sTWEAK in T2DM which may be comparable to our observations in CP + T2DM when compared to health and its negative correlation with all the parameters suggesting an association with both clinical periodontal parameters and glycemic levels. However, serum sTWEAK levels may not be necessarily elevated in periodontitis as previously reported, and hence has the potential to be studied extensively for clarification with its association with T2DM."

Therefore, the study aims to identify the microbiological profile and the potential risk factors among diabetic and non-diabetic foot ulcer patients. A prospective cross sectional study was carried out among 183 ulcer patients from diabetic foot clinic and wound dressing clinic at the public health hospital, Guyana. A total of 254 bacteria were isolated from the study with an average of 1.4 organism per lesion. Gram negative bacteria (63.0%) were prevalent than gram positive bacteria (37.0%) in this study. Among DF patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.8%) was the most common isolate followed by Escherichia coli (13.9%) among gram negative group. Were as MRSA (12.1%) followed by MSSA (7.9%) dominated among gram positive group in diabetic foot patients. Almost 42.1% (95% CI 34.8–49.6) of the infections were caused by poly-microbial. Interestingly, a stepwise logistic regression model determined increasing age and lack of health education as independent risk factor identified for acquiring an MDR wound infection (OR = 1.1; p ≥ 0.05; 95% CI 1.0–1.1). Mild, moderate and severe infection among MDR and NMDR patients were recorded as 45.3% (95% CI 32.8–58.3), 26.5% (95% CI 16.3–39.1), 28.1% (95% CI 17.6–40.8) and 51.3% (95% CI 41.9–60.5), 32.8% (95% CI 24.4–42.0), 16.0% (95% CI 9.9–23.8).

Current monitoring practices fail to diagnose patients with post-transplant hyperglycaemia and tend to delay initiation of treatment, which potentially results in adverse graft and morbidity outcomes. This real-world study set out to assess the impact on insulin resistance indices of a new clinical pathway for diagnosis and treatment of hyperglycaemia following renal transplantation.
Methods
A hundred and forty-seven adult renal transplant recipients, without pre-existing diabetes, from a single centre were included. Patients transplanted between January 2008 to September 2015 formed the historical cohort. Patients transplanted between October 2015 and February 2018 were subject to a new clinical pathway - if they had fasting blood sugar levels more than 7 mmol/L or random blood glucose levels more than 11.1 mmol/L, they had early introduction of oral therapy, using the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin.
Results
In the historical cohort, 19.8% were diagnosed with PTDM, compared to 46.3% in the protocol cohort. Amongst patients with PTDM, there was a significant difference in HOMA-IR (p = 0.02) between the historical cohort (median HOMA-IR 3.33) and the protocol cohort (median HOMA-IR 2.21). There was a significant difference at each time point (0,1,2-h measurements) of blood glucose levels form oral glucose tolerance testing between patients with and without PTDM in the historical cohort (p < 0.001), but no difference between patients in the protocol cohort.
Conclusion
Detection of PTDM was higher with the new clinical pathway. Early treatment of hyperglycaemia resulted in better insulin resistance scores. Larger prospective controlled studies focussing on early detection and management of PTDM with linagliptin are warranted."

Diet has an important role in the management of chronic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association of adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was performed on 396 Iranian adults, aged ≥18 years. A 147-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess dietary intakes of participants. Fasting blood sample was obtained to quantify glycemic indicators and lipid profile. Metabolic syndrome was defined based on the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III).
Results
Mean age of study participants was 38.22 ± 9.58 years. A significant inverse association was observed between adherence to DASH diet and odds of MetS (OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.54); such that after adjusting for energy intake, socioeconomic status and body mass index (BMI), participants in the highest tertile of DASH diet scores were 49% less likely to have MetS (OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.14–0.54). Furthermore, adherence to DASH diet was inversely associated with elevated blood pressure (OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.05–0.29), high serum triglyceride (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.28–1.00) and low serum HDL-C (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.25–1.01). However, this association was marginally significant for triglyceride and HDL-C. No significant association was found between adherence to DASH diet and abdominal obesity.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death among people with diabetes, however, despite the increasing incidence of CVD, there are few tools for evaluating Cardiovascular Risk (CVR) in the population of patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), with the existing ones diverging in the stratification of risk and in the suggestions for therapeutic conduct.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was carried out with 104 participants diagnosed with T1D, aged 18–40, attending specialized services. The Steno Type 1 Risk Engine and the Cardiovascular Risk Stratification Calculator (CRSC) were used to assess the risk of a cardiovascular event over a 10-year period.
Findings
Of the total sample selected, 62% were female, with a median age of 32 years (IQ 24; 43). There was a large difference between the stratification of CVR between the calculators, and 65.82% of the patients classified as low risk for CVD according to the Steno were identified as intermediate (30, 38.00%) and high risk (35.44%) by the CRSC. The analysis also highlighted a great difference in eligibility for statin use according to the risk stratification of the tools.
Conclusion
The CRSC and Steno tools evaluated and stratified the CVR of the same population with T1D, with there being divergence of the results. It was found that the CRSC tool classified the majority of the sample as high risk. Due to this result, the eligibility to use statins, which is one of the applications of these tools, showed great differences, with the Steno tool presenting less aggressive provisions regarding the prescription of statins in patients with type 1 DM."

The present study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics of patients with fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes (FCPD) and those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to identify the characteristics distinctive of FCPD.
Methods
A total of 133 patients with FCPD were compared with 665 patients with T2DM matched for duration of diabetes. Biochemical parameters and microvascular and macrovascular complications were assessed in all patients. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to study the determinants of microvascular and macrovascular complications in both groups.
Results
The mean duration of diabetes was 4.42 ± 5.65 years in the FCPD group and 4.51 ± 3.88 years in the T2DM group. FCPD participants were significantly younger at diagnosis and leaner than patients with T2DM. The FCPD group had higher fasting and postprandial glucose and HbA1c levels than the T2DM group. The FCPD group had significantly lower triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum total calcium, hemoglobin, and serum creatinine values than the T2DM group. The prevalence of coronary artery disease, stroke, and retinopathy was significantly higher in the T2DM patients while the prevalence of distal symmetric polyneuropathy was significantly lower. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, duration of diabetes and HbA1c (OR = 1.17, P = 0 0.04) in FCPD patients and age (OR = 1.04, P < 0 0.001), duration of diabetes (OR = 1.17, P < 0 0.001) and HbA1c (OR = 1.28, P < 0.001) in T2DM patients were associated with microvascular complications.

abstract = "Aims.
Several epidemiological studies have indicated that elevated blood pressure (BP) is associated with the surfeit of body weight. Body fat accumulation is considered as be a significant factor contributing to the nexus between obesity and hypertension. Two of the most common indicators used to characterize the associations of BP are body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). This study was aimed to describe the differences in some characteristics among people aged 20 and above in three communes of a district in Vietnam and analyze the correlation between BMI and WC, and BP.
Materials and methods
We conducted a survey with a cross-sectional design of 734 subjects in three communes in Chiem Hoa district of the Vietnam northern mountainous region.
Results
It was found that except for BMI, there were significant differences in some physical characteristics between genders (p < 0.05). Particularly, the effects on Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) or Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) of WC were more significant than that of BMI in genders. The impacts of WC on SBP as well as DBP were also stronger than that of BMI in age groups with the cut-off point 60 than BMI.
Conclusions
This study provides the science evidence in support of public and preventive health interventions to the locals residing in studied area. We recommend the existing correlations in subjects belonging to different ethnicities and continents."

Diabetes and periodontitis are non-transmissible chronic disorders that exhibit a mutual relationship. A study was made to evaluate the risk of prediabetes and periodontal disease, and to explore the association between them.
Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional study was made of 186 individuals over 18 years of age, without prediabetes or diabetes, or cognitive impairment. Subjects undergoing dental treatment and pregnant women were excluded. Prediabetes risk was assessed based on the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC), and the individual risk of development and/or progression of periodontal disease was explored with a periodontal disease risk questionnaire.
Results
A total of 135 gingival risk questionnaires and 142 FINDRISC questionnaires were correctly completed. The proportion of subjects with a low, moderate and high risk of periodontal disease was 60.36%, 38.74% and 0.9%, respectively. With regard to the FINDRISC, the proportion of individuals with low, slightly increased, moderately increased and high risk of prediabetes was 54.4%, 32.8%, 8%, and 4.8%, respectively. A significant linear correlation between the two scores was observed (r = 0.3659, p < 0.0005). The variables associated with a slightly increased risk of prediabetes were age, overweight and smoking, while the variables associated with a moderately increased or high risk were age 40–65 years, tooth loss, overweight and smoking.
Conclusions
These questionnaires may be of benefit to patients and can contribute to develop a chronic care model characterized by collaboration among different healthcare professionals."

The present study aimed to determine the status of diabetes distress and its clinical determinants in type II diabetes patients.
Methods
This descriptive-analytical study was performed on 220 patients with t diabetes referred to Diabetes Clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ardabil, Iran. The samples were selected using convenience sampling method. Data collection tools included demographic and disease form and Diabetes Mellitus Scale (DDS). Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 22 via descriptive (frequency, mean, standard deviation) and inferential statistics (compare means, Pearson correlation coefficient and stepwise multiple regression).
Results
The average duration of diabetes was 7.64 (SD = 4.68) years. 63.7% of the patients had moderate to severe diabetes-related distress. Emotional burden dimension had the highest score among the subscales of diabetes distress. In addition, there was a correlation between positive family history (p = 0.017), duration of diabetes (p = 0.028) and type of treatment (p = 0.47) and diabetes distress. HemoglobinA1C levels, body mass index and triglyceride were the major predictors of diabetes distress.
Conclusions
Considering the high prevalence of diabetes distress in patients with type II diabetes, it seems that paying attention to clinical predictors of distress and screening of patients with diabetes is a reasonable and accessible method for health care providers and patients to improve their disease management."

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory skin disease with unknown etiology. Current findings demonstrate that psoriatic patients are at higher risk of other systemic disorders such as diabetes mellitus. The present study was conducted to evaluate the association between psoriasis and diabetes mellitus.
Method
The current study was conducted based on preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Using MeSH keywords we searched online databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EBSCO and Google scholar search engine and the reference list of the retrieved articles until June 2018. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test and I2 index and the random effects model was used to estimate Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 2.
Results
Analysis of 38 eligible studies involving 922870 cases and 12808071 controls suggested the estimated OR to be 1.69 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.51–1.89; P < 0.001).

abstract = "Background
Diabetes is rising at an alarming rate in India and the national capital forms a significant part of the nation's diabetic population. The metabolic disorder is no more a disease specific to the rich countries but has also markedly spread its roots in middle-income countries.
Objective
To ascertain the prevalence of associated co-morbidities in the diabetic population of Delhi, a metropolitan city in India. Moreover, this study was conducted to help with adding information to the limited shreds of evidence of diabetes prevalence in Delhi along with the usually preferred therapies.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional, observational, survey-based study was conducted on people (n = 798) of different age groups (18 years and above) belonging to different regions of Delhi. All subjects were enrolled after obtaining oral consent. Detailed information about clinical, demographic and metabolic profiles was obtained with the help of a pre-structured, open-ended questionnaire. The data were analyzed, and the correlation between diabetes and several other fields was drawn.
Results
Out of the 798 diabetic patients 458 (57.39%) were males and 340 (42.60%) were females. The presence of diabetes was higher in the age group of 50–60 years irrespective of the gender.
Co-morbidities
54.13% of patients suffered with additional co-morbidities which is significantly high. The associated co-morbidities found in the survey included Hypertension, Hypothyroidism, Dyslipidemia, Obesity, Coronary Artery Diseases etc. About 30.57% of patients suffered from hypertension making it the most commonly associated co-morbidity. The other diseases included hypothyroidism (11.52%), Dyslipidemia (10.27%), Obesity (9.27%) etc.
Medication
Majority of patients i.e about 60.65% received oral hypoglycemic agents (including patients receiving both insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents). About 19.92% of patients were prescribed with insulin. 14.16% of patients were found to be following diet control and yoga with about 3.13% more females the males. A small percentage of patients (5.25%) were also following alternative systems (Ayurvedic/Unani/Homeopathic) of treatment. Overall, amongst oral hypoglycemic agents, the combination of metformin and DPP4 inhibitors (Vildagliptin, Sitagliptin) was being prescribed majorly i.e 16.41%.
Conclusion
The number of diabetic population is high in Delhi. It was evident that a significant percentage of diabetic patients suffered from additional diseases that may lead to worsening of the health conditions. Thus, there is an urgent need to educate and spread awareness amongst the masses about the potential benefits of lifestyle modifications like the incorporation of a healthy diet and physical activities. Additionally, continuous and regular tests should be taken to avoid further complications."

Design
and Setting: Case control study including 82 participants (41 cases and 41 controls) from Family Medicine Clinic, Cairo University Hospitals.
Method
Participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria were allocated into two groups, diabetes and control groups. History was taken, examination was done, and blood sample was withdrawn for analysis of Vitamin D levels and HBA1C. From the diabetic group only, serum creatinine was assessed and urine sample was collected for microalbuminuria. The results were analyzed using SPSS program version 21.
Results
Vitamin D level was lower in the diabetic group compared to control (65.5% and 56.1%). Vitamin D level was inversely proportionate to HbA1c levels in the diabetic patients (p value 0.000 & r −0.482), as well as to the A/C ratio (p value 0.01 & r −0.396).

Dyslipidemia is linked to chronic inflammation, which in return leads to a set of chronic disorders. Omega-3 fatty acids have been reported to reduce inflammation. Furthermore, Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids co-supplementations may be more effective than the single supplementation in control dyslipidemia. Therefore, we designed and conducted the current systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of co-supplementation of vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids on the lipid profile.
Methods
A comprehensive search for studies published between January 1990 and July 2018 was performed. The initial search extracted 3015 potentially relevant articles. After studying these publications, 9 RCTs were potentially eligible and retrieved in full text.
Results
The meta-analysis indicate that on total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglyceride individually did not show any significant difference between intervention and control groups, but vitamin E an omega-3 fatty acids co-supplementations significantly reduce VLDL levels.
Conclusions
Based on the available evidence, omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin E co-supplementation can reduce VLDL, although its effect on other lipid profile parameters requires more well-designed studies."

Fasting lipid profile does not necessarily illustrate the exact lipid dynamic in 24 h as human spends most of their time in postprandial state. Postprandial triglyceride (TG) has been reported to have advantages compared to fasting TG in terms of practicality and ability to predict cardiovascular events. This study aims to assess the determinant of postprandial TG in healthy young adults.
Methods
This is a quasy-experimental study that involved 200 healthy young adults. This study compared fasting with postprandial TG and analyzed the relationship between postprandial TG with various demographic and metabolic parameters after ingestion of standardized high fat liquid meal.
Result
There was an upward trend from fasting TG to 2 h postprandial TG and 4 h postprandial TG. There was strong correlation between fasting TG and 2 h postprandial TG with 4 h postprandial TG (r = 0.731; p < 0.0001 dan r = 0.669; p < 0.0001, respectively). Whereas body mass index (BMI) and age showed weak correlation with 4 h postprandial TG (r = 0.141; p < 0.0001 dan r = 0.0747; p < 0.0001), fasting TG was the strongest predictor of 4 h postprandial TG (r = 0.669, B = 1.722 (95% CI 1.552 to 1.892), p < 0.0001).
Conclusion
Fasting TG was the strongest determinant of 4 h postprandial TG in healthy young adults. We also observed strong correlation between 4 h postprandial TG and fasting TG. Hence, 4 h postprandial TG might potentially replaced fasting TG when measurement of fasting TG is not feasible."

The aim was to estimate the burden of macro- and micro-vascular complications on hospitalisation and healthcare cost among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Bangladesh.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was carried out in 2017. A total of 1253 patients were recruited from six hospitals. Information related to cost and complications of type 2 diabetes were collected. Multiple logistic and non-parametric regression analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of complications on hospitalisation and average annual cost.
Results
Overall, 63.4% of the participants had complications of which 14.8% and 20.7% had macro- and micro-vascular complications respectively and 27.9% had both. Use of insulin, presence of both hypertension and dyslipidaemia, coronary artery diseases, stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy were significantly associated with hospitalisation. Further, use of oral hypoglycaemic agent with a combination of insulin, presence of coronary artery diseases, stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy increased the average annual cost.
Conclusion
The prevalence of macro- and micro-vascular complications were very high in Bangladesh and majority of them are key drivers for hospitalisation and increased healthcare cost. An improvement of primary prevention strategy for complications is urgently needed which in turn will reduce the long-term healthcare cost for type 2 diabetes in Bangladesh."

The objective of this scoping review was to identify peer-reviewed medical literature on the use of telemedicine in patients with Types I or II DM in the United States, assess its impact on self-management processes and clinical outcomes of care, and to delineate research gaps.
Methods
We utilized a structured scoping review protocol to conduct this research. We searched the published medical literature utilizing two databases, PubMed and CINHAL, and we included all original research articles published prior to July 20th, 2018. Using a 4-step systematic approach, we identified, reviewed, extracted and summarized data from all relevant studies.
Results
We identified 47 articles overall. Telemedicine impact was reported as positive in articles addressing the following components of patient self-management: adherence to blood glucose monitoring, day-to-day decision-making related to self-care, and adherence with medications. The most commonly reported clinical outcome was HbA1c level. Few or no studies evaluated impact on long term clinical outcomes such as blindness, amputation, cardiovascular events, development of chronic kidney disease, or mortality.
Discussion
This scoping review provides important information about studies conducted in the United States evaluating the impact of telemedicine on patient self-management and on clinical outcomes in patients with DM.
Conclusions
Results suggest that telemedicine has a positive impact on self-management processes and on HbA1c levels. However, future evaluative reviews are necessary to confirm and quantitate the impact of telemedicine on self-management processes and primary studies are necessary to evaluate its impact on long term clinical outcomes."

This study has been conducted with the aim of determining the relationship between health literacy, knowledge and self-care behaviors to take care of the diabetic foot in low-income individuals, based on the extended parallel process model (EPPM).
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 400 patients with type II diabetes referred to the Diabetes Clinic, using a random sampling method and using standard questionnaires. In this study, the constructs of knowledge, EPPM (perceived sensitivity, perceived severity, response efficacy, self-efficacy), and health literacy were significantly related to self-care behaviors (p < 0.05).
Results
Based on the linear regression results, the constructs of knowledge, health literacy, and constructs of EPPM were able to account for 43% of the variance to perform diabetic foot self-care behaviors. The maximum impact was related to the constructs of health literacy and self-efficacy (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
Based on these results, levels of knowledge and health literacy of patients were very poor overall, and the self-care behaviors were not appropriate. On the other hand, considering the great impact of health literacy in performing self-care behaviors, it is suggested that educational courses be held in this regard and proper strategies are employed to enhance the health literacy of diabetic patients."

Adipokines are associated with several oxidative stress-related diseases and pathologic conditions. We aimed to assess the association between antioxidants and adipokines in obese adults.
Methods and Materials
In this cross-sectional study, a total of 160 obese women were included. Body composition and anthropometric characteristics were measured. Dietary intakes were assessed by 3-day, 24-h dietary recall. Blood samples were obtained following an overnight fasting. Serum concentrations of adipokines including progranulin, retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) and Angiopoietin-related growth factor 6 (ANGPTL6) was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ANCOVA and the linear regression model analysis was performed to assess the relationship between Progranulin, RBP4, AnGPTL6, and antioxidants.
Results
Mean age of included women was 39.31 ± 12.10. Mean and standard deviation for BMI was 35.05 ± 4.26 in this obese population. There was a positive significant association between ANGPTL6 and vitamin D intake (p < 0.001). Also, there was a marginal association between RBP4 and vitamin A (p = 0.063) intake, but after adjustment age, and fat mass, we found a significant association (p = 0.008). However, the associations between dietary antioxidants, progranulin, and ANGPTL6 were not statistically significant.
Conclusions
ANGPTL6 and RBP4 levels directly associated with dietary vitamins D and A intake, respectively. But, according to the results, the association between ANGPTL6 and vitamin D was bidirectional. The suggested associations probably can be useful in the development of interventional studies for management of chronic diseases."

Alteration in the metabolism of magnesium have an influence on different metabolic and signaling pathways involved in development of diabetes and its progression. Reduced magnesium level was associated with diabetes related complications. The aim of this study is to determine the serum levels of magnesium in diabetic patients having different complications and the association of magnesium with status of glycemic control.
Materials and methods
This study was conducted among 88 type 2 diabetic patients, subdivided into two groups according to diabetic complications (with complications n = 55; without complications n = 33) and biochemical variables were measured.
Results
The serum magnesium level was decreased in diabetic patients having any complications (P = 0.039) or independent complication (nephropathy, P = 0.437; retinopathy, P = 0.038; neuropathy, P = 0.012 and macrovascular complication, P = 0.039), also decrease with increase in number of diabetic complications.

To assess the ability of leptin, adiponectin and leptin: adiponectin ratio (LAR) to discriminate apparently healthy subjects with metabolic syndrome in Southwest Nigeria.
Methods
One hundred and twenty three subjects with metabolic syndrome (cases) were age matched with 123 subjects without metabolic syndrome. The serum adiponectin and leptin levels were measured using standard procedures. The ability of serum adiponectin, leptin and LAR to discriminate metabolic syndrome and its components were determined using the receiver operating curve and linear regression.
Results
The median age of the cases (49 IQR 42, 56 years) was not significantly different from the controls (48 IQR 39, 56 years) p = 0.252. The adiponectin levels was reduced with increasing number of the components of metabolic syndrome from 11.6 (IQR 9.6, 13.5) among subjects without any component of metabolic syndrome to 6.5 (IQR 5.7, 7.7) in subjects with more than three components of metabolic syndrome. For leptin and LAR, the values increased with increasing components (p < 0.001). LAR (AUC 0.960) discriminated metabolic syndrome better than adiponectin (AUC 0.865) and leptin (AUC = 0.918) in males and females (LAR AUC = 0.966, adiponectin AUC = 0.888, leptin AUC = 0.929).

To identify the demographic and clinical characteristics of Dominican adults admitted to a diabetic foot clinic and compare these characteristics by sex to better characterize and understand the severity of diabetes in the Dominican Republic.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective medical chart review of Dominican adults admitted to the National Institute of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Nutrition's (INDEN) diabetic foot clinic between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2015. We generated descriptive statistics and compared results by sex.
Results
We assessed 447 medical charts of patients admitted in 2015. More men visited the clinic than women (65% vs. 35%). The average duration of diabetes was 14.4 ± 8.9 years. Abscess was the most common foot problem (74% in men, 68% in women, p = 0.164). A slightly smaller proportion of men received amputations than women (46% vs. 51%, p = 0.390). Women were older (p < 0.001), less educated (p = 0.004), and less likely to be married (p < 0.001).

Conclusion
Implementation of diabetes education programs, introduction of proper foot care, and improved resources for lifestyle management are needed to increase awareness and subsequently decrease diabetes and its negative impact on the health and economy of the Dominican Republic. Our findings suggest that various risk factors and comorbidities important to the development of diabetes may be disproportionately affecting women.

S100A8 and S100A9 are myeloid-related damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) primarily involved in the modulation of innate immune response to cellular injury. This study evaluated the correlation between circulating concentrations of S100A8 and S100A9 proteins with the severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
Methods
T2DM patients with HbA1c levels >7%, fasting blood glucose >126 mg/dl and history of diabetes were included in this study. DR severity was graded based on ETDRS and Gloucestershire classifications. Plasma samples were evaluated for S100A8 and S100A9 levels using ELISA.
Results
In this comparative study, DR patients (n = 89) had increased plasma S100A8 and S100A9 proteins compared to age-matched T2DM controls (n = 28), which was directly related to the severity of DR. Female DR subjects had increased S100A8 expression compared to their male counterparts. Substantial retention of S100A8 and S100A9 production was seen in DR patients above 50 years of age. Duration of T2DM was not found to affect protein levels, however T2DM onset at >50 years old significantly increased S100A8 and S100A9 concentrations.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that systemic circulation levels of S100A8 and S100A9 are correlated with the progression of DR in T2DM patients, indicating their potential role in DR pathogenesis."

Several methods/medicines namely diet control, energy balance, environmental changes, genetic and stem cell therapies, new drugs/chemicals have been extensively studied to enhance the ability to control bodyweight and prevent obesity. Of all the aforementioned methods, green tea, used as a daily beverage, has shown beneficial impacts for the health, especially its anti-obesity effects. Available evidence shows that green tea can interrupt lipid emulsification, reduce adipocyte differentiation, increase thermogenesis, and reduce food intake, thus green tea improves the systemic metabolism and decreases fat mass.

In addition, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 27.47 (95% CI: 25.46–29.48) and the mean waist circumference was 87.94 (95% CI: 84.28–91.60). According the meta-regression results, there were no significant associations between the prevalence of MetS and sample size, year of publication, waist circumference, BMI, and age. One-fourth of Iranian women with PCOS have MetS. Given the overlap between anthropometric and metabolic abnormalities in PCOS and the features of MetS, accurate identification of patients with MetS is important to ensure early diagnosis and subsequent interventions to effectively manage the condition."

abstract = "Aims
This study aims to determine the association between depression with glycemic control (HbA1c) and its complications.
Materials and methods
This was a cross-sectional study that included 514 diabetic patients. The patients were randomly selected from among all type 2 diabetes patients referred to health and medical centers in Khorramabad town (Iran). Two questionnaires used for data collection. The first questionnaire included demographic information, diabetes and its complications and the second questionnaire was Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) which was used to assess depression. The stata software version 14 was used for data analysis. Then, for evaluate the association between depression with glycemic contol and its complications, Univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis were employed.
Results
The prevalence of depression in diabetic patients under study was 46.3% and for female and male was 49.6 and 36.8%; respectively. The results showed that 48.6% of diabetic patients did not have appropriate glycemic control status (HbA1c > 8). There was no significant association between glycemic control expressed as HbA1c levels and depression (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.87–1.57). By contrast, sex (OR: 2.03, CI 95%: 1.03–3.99), residence (OR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.28–2.91) and sexual complications (OR: 5.54, 95% CI: 1.07–27.87) have a significant statistical association with depression.
Conclusion
The study highlights the high prevalence of depression in diabetic patients. However, there was no significant association between depression and glycemic control. The implementation of mental health screening for rapid diagnosis and timely treatment of depression seems essential in diabetic patients."

Depression, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia are highly prevalent chronic conditions associated with social, medical, and economic burdens. Although there are several epidemiological studies that have reported the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment or depressive syndrome in elderly diabetic population little is known about the comorbidity of these conditions. We aimed to study the prevalence of comorbid mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and depression in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and its relation to glycemic control.
Materials and methods
the present work was carried on 400 patients with T2DM. History taking, physical examination, laboratory investigations (with special emphasis on glycemic profile and lipid profile parameters) were done for every patient. Assessment of anxiety and depression using the HADS score and assessment of mild cognitive impairment using MoCA score were done.
Results
76% of studied patients had depression of varying degrees while 56.8% of studied patients had MCI. Decreased level of HDL-cholesterol and increased HADS anxiety score were significant predictors of depression. On the other hand, increased level of total cholesterol, decreased level of HDL-cholesterol, increased HADS depression score and decreased MoCA score were significant predictors of anxiety. HDL-cholesterol HADS anxiety score, FBG, and duration of DM were the significant predictors of MCI.
Conclusion

To assess serum leptin in diabetic nephropathy male patients from Gaza Strip.
Materials and methods
This case-control study comprised 132 type 2 diabetic patients and 44 non-diabetic controls. The diabetic patients were classified into three groups; 44 normoalbuminurics, 44 microalbuminurics and 44 macroalbuminurics. Data were obtained from questionnaire interview, and biochemical analysis of blood and urine samples. Patients and controls were matched for age and body mass index (BMI).
Results
Serum leptin was significantly higher in micro- and macro-albuminuric patients (14.6 ± 11.7 and 15.6 ± 13.5 ng/ml) than controls and normoalbuminurics (5.9 ± 4.0 and 8.1 ± 7.6 ng/ml) with P < 0.05. In general, serum glucose, urea, createnine, cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), urinary albumin and albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) were increased in diabetic groups compared to non-diabetics, and reaching their maximum increase in macroalbuminurics whereas high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), urinary creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were decreased reaching its maximum decrease in macroalbuminurics. Serum leptin showed significant positive correlations with diabetes duration (r = 0.188, P = 0.020), glucose (r = 0.298, P < 0.001), cholesterol (r = 0.323, P < 0.001), triglycerides (r = 0.361, P < 0.001), LDL-C (r = 0.248, P = 0.001) and urinary albumin (r = 0.256, P = 0.001) whereas negative significant correlations were found with HDL-C (r = −0.313, P < 0.001) and urinary creatinine (r = −0.202, P = 0.007).
Conclusion
The comitant raise of serum leptin with urinary albumin combined with decrease in GFR makes leptin eligible candidate as a biomarker for progression towards diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes."

Recently, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics have been emphasized in dealing with chronic diseases of which Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one. This present study was conducted to correlate the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of out-patient type 2 diabetic adults with their body mass index (BMI).
Methodology
This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Out-patients Diabetic clinic of University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Ituku-Ozalla, Enugu Nigeria. A total of 370 subjects were purposively selected from the 2888 annual average attendances and examined with questionnaire and anthropometry. Information on their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics was correlated with their body mass index.
Result
The results indicated that there were more (59%) urban diabetics than rural (25.7%) diabetics, many (65.7%) were within the age range of 41–60years, more (64.9%) females than males (35.1%), mainly (86.2%) married and of Christian religion (94.1%) and Igbo ethnicity (95.9%). The majority (91.1%) were of a monogamous family type with 55.4% from average sized (4-6persons) families. More than 1/3 (34.1%) had tertiary education, mainly (43%) civil servants, and 45.1% earning above 137.21 US Dollar per month. Most (69%) of the diabetics were over-weight, a trend of both under-nutrition (1.1%), and over-nutrition (68.7%) with mean BMI value of 27.19 kg/m2 was also observed. BMI had slight negative association with age, sex, and occupation and positive association with religion, ethnicity, marital status and level of education.

Prolactin plays a significant role in lactation and prolactin levels are increasing physiologically in pregnancy and breastfeeding period. There might be different mechanisms during breastfeeding between prolactin and insülin levels. In order to highlighten this mechanisms we compared the plasma levels of glucose, insülin, prolactin, C-peptid in basal situations and after taking 75 gr carbonhydrate, 20 gr protein, 23 gr fat in breastfeeding and in non lactating women.
Material and methods
Participiants and measurements: The study population included 12 breastfeeding women and 11 healthy non lactating women as a control group. We collected information on age, history of gestational diabetes mellitus, family history of diabetes mellitus, natality, the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Weight, height and waist circumference were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2).
Results
Prolactin was inversely correlated with HbA1c and 2. hour C peptide (p=0.005, r=−0.564; p=0.008, r=−0.539). Prolactin was not significantly correlated with HOMA-IR, HOMA-IS, AUC-I or AUC-G. Prolactin levels were higher in breastfeeding women (median:34.98 μg/L) than in non lactating women (median:12.21 μg/L, p<0.001). There was a significant association between age and fasting glucose (p=0.018, r=−0.665), 2. hour glucose (p=0.049, r=0.578) in breastfeeding women.
Discussion
In our study, we displayed prolactin was inversely correlated with HbA1c and 2. hour C peptide. Some studies in the past demonstrated that higher prolactin levels had importantly lower prevelance of type 2 diabetes. Our findings supported this situation."

Albuminuria is an established marker for endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk in diabetes and prediabetes. So we aimed to explore the prevalence of albuminuria (microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria) in patients with type2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in the Palestinian community and to determine the association between albuminuria and other health care and biochemical indicators.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study was carried out at private health care center. A total of 550 diabetic patients aged 35 years and above with type 2 diabetes mellitus who attended the clinic from May 2017 through February 2018 were included. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained from the medical records of patients. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, version 23).
Results
Out of the 550 patients recruited, the mean age and duration of diabetes were 57.8 years and 9.5 years, respectively. Approximately 62% were being managed by oral hypoglycemic agents alone, 4.3% by insulin alone, 31.7% were on a combination of oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin and slightly less than 2% were on dietary measures alone. The mean value for HbA1c was 7.71%. The overall prevalence of albuminuria among participants was found to be 34.6%; microalbuminuria (29.3%) and macroalbuminuria (5.3%).
Conclusion
Albuminuria is highly prevalent among Palestinian population with type 2 diabetes. This calls for early and universal screening of urinary albumin. There is also an urgent need for measures that target tight glycemic and optimal blood pressure control and the use of renin-angiotensin system blockade."

abstract = "Background and objectives
Obesity is associated with metabolic dysfunction and over nutrition. Increased body mass index and obesity are strongly amalgamated with changes in the physiological function of adipose tissue, leading to altered secretion of adipocytokines, inflammatory mediators release as well as chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. The purposes of this study were to review the evidence of how obesity and inflammation may lead to insulin resistance and cancer.
Summary
Recent findings suggested that increased level of inflammatory mediators in obesity, plays an introductory and cabalistic role in the development of different types of inflammatory disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus. Link between elevated body mass index and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several of the factors−such as increased levels of leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, decreased levels of adiponectin, insulin resistance, chronic inflammation etc. consequently result in carcinogenesis and carcinogenic progression too.
Conclusion
This review summarizes how cytokine production in adipose tissue of obese subject creates a chronic inflammatory environment that favors tumor cell motility and invasion to enhance the metastatic potential of tumor cells. High levels of cytokine in the circulation of affected individuals have been associated with a significantly worse outcome. This article also reconnoiters the mechanisms that link obesity to numerous disorders such as inflammation, diabetes, cancers and most specifically combine these processes in a single image. Understanding these mechanisms may assist to understand the consequences of obesity."

Ang-2 and VEGF concentrations were significantly higher in patients with microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria compared to healthy. Ang-2 and VEGF levels increase with the progression of albuminuria. There were significant positive correlation between CRP and Ang-2 in addition to VEGF. Significant negative correlation between eGFR, Ang-2 and VEGF.
Conclusion
VEGF and Ang-2 were significantly elevated in diabetic nephropathy patients without albuminuria, their levels steadily increase with the progress of albuminuria, So can use them as markers for diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy onset and progression specially in patients without an increase in albumin excretion."

The impact of T2DM on CV mortality and morbidity is embedded through a nature evolution of the disease and is modulated by numerous risk factors, such as hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia. There is large body of evidence regarding use of the cardiac biomarkers to risk stratification at higher CV risk individuals who belongs to general population and cohort with established CV disease. Although T2DM patients have higher incidence of cardiac and vascular complications than the general population, whether cardiac biomarkers would be effective to risk stratification of the T2DM is not fully understood. The aim of the review is to summarize our knowledge regarding clinical implementation of cardiac biomarkers in risk assessment for T2DM patients. The role of natriuretic peptides, soluble ST2, galectin-3, growth differentiation factor-15, and cardiac troponins are widely discussed."

Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25OHD) has a key role in the pathogenesis of several chronic disorders. Vitamin D deficiency is a common global public health problem. We aimed to evaluate the risk factors associated with vitamin D deficiency using a decision tree algorithm.
Methods
A total of 988 adolescent girls, aged 12–18 years old, were recruited to the study. Demographic characteristics, serum biochemical factors, all blood count parameters and trace elements such as Zinc, Copper, Calcium and SOD were measured. Serum levels of vitamin D below 20 ng/ml were considered to be deficiency. 70% of these girls (618 cases) were randomly allocated to a training dataset for the constructing of the decision-tree. The remaining 30% (285 cases) were used as the testing dataset to evaluate the performance of decision-tree. In this model, 14 input variables were included: age, academic attainment of their father, waist circumference, waist to hip ratio, zinc, copper, calcium, SOD, FBG, HDL-C, RBC, MCV, MCHC, HCT. The validation of the model was assessed by constructing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
Results
The results showed that serum Zn concentration was the most important associated risk factor for vitamin D deficiency. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values were 79.3%, 64%, 77.8% and 0.72 respectively using the testing dataset.
Conclusions
The results suggest that the serum levels of Zn is an important associated risk factor for identifying subjects with vitamin D deficiency among Iranian adolescent girls."

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has been related mainly to type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). However, it is not solely related to T1DM. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of DKA among type 1 and type 2 patients with diabetes mellitus, who were hospitalized in our Clinic due to DKA, as well as to determine the etiology beyond DKA.
Patients and methods
A cohort of 109 patients with DKA, 17–86 years of age, who were hospitalized in the Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism of our hospital between 2015 and 2017, were included in the study.
Results
Among the 109 patients, 50 (45.9%) had mild DKA, 48 (44.1%) had moderate DKA, whereas 11 patients (10%) had severe DKA. Sixty-five patients (60%) developed DKA as the first manifestation of T1DM, 30 patients (27%) developed DKA in the context of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), mainly due to the co-existence of serious infections, 11 patients (10%) had T1DM, but had omitted their insulin dosages, and 3 patients (3%) developed DKA due to unknown reasons.
Conclusions
Most patients with DKA presented with mild and moderate DKA and only a minority presented with the severe form of the disease. The etiology of DKA was mainly T1DM and less frequent uncontrolled T2DM, usually due to the co-existence of severe infections, while only in a tiny minority, the causes remained unidentifiable."

Anthropometric indices and biochemical parameters were measured using standard procedures. The adapted MetS for pediatrics, including the IDF, NCEP, and two modified-NCEPs (Cook's and DeFerranti's) were used to establish a diagnosis of MetS. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and MedCalc softwares. Except for body frame size (r), the values for anthropometric indices were significantly lower in an individual without MetS. Waist to height (WHtR), BMI and hip circumference (HiC) showed the strongest association with the different MetS definitions. For the IDF definition, the highest sensitivity and specificity were observed for HiC (100.0, 85.2) and WHtR (100.0, 84.7); while for the NCEP definition, the r index showed the highest sensitivity (85.0); but low specificity made it inapplicable. For the Cook's definition of MetS, wrist circumference (WrC), HiC, WHtR, BMI and SR had similar sensitivity values with WC (92.9%), and HiC (85.3%) have the highest specificity. WHtR (86.05, 80.5), SR (86.05, 82.7) and HiC (76.7, 87.0) sensitivity and specificity were the best indexes for DeFerranti's criteria. Based on this date, we concluded that HiC and WHtR might be helpful as auxiliary indexes for pediatric MetS definition; however, further studies are required in both genders."

The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, obesity and polycystic ovaries syndrome (PCOS).
Methods
In a cross-sectional study, 333 patients who had one of the certain diagnosis of DM, hyperlipidemia, obesity or PCOS were enrolled. Information about demographics, anthropometric, nutritional habitude, smoking history, medical history and physical activity were recorded. Liver ultrasound examination and routine biochemistry analysis were performed.
Results
Among 333 patients with one of the four above-mentioned diseases. 199 patients (59.8%) had NAFLD. Male were more likely to have NAFLD than female (72.8% vs. 50.8% respectively, P < 0.001). About, 80.7% of patients through 41–50 years age had NAFLD. The frequency of abnormal fasting blood glucose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglyceride, and total cholesterol were significantly higher in patients with NAFLD (P < 0.05). Subjects with NAFLD had a higher body mass index than non-NAFLD (33.6 ± 7.9 kg/m2 vs. 31.1 ± 5.0 kg/m2 respectively, P = 0.002). Patients with DM, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and hypothyroidism were more likely to have NAFLD (P < 0.05). Patients with consumption of supper, high-fat diet, enjoy of eating and smoking were more likely to have NAFLD and patients with fruit and vegetable uptake and physical activity were less likely to have NAFLD (P < 0.05).
Conclusions
As most patients with NAFLD are asymptomatic, employed individuals with higher education levels, with a history of smoking and unhealthy diet along with DM, hyperlipidemia, PCOS and obesity seriously have to be followed and educated for lifestyle modification."

The hepatic ABCA1 is involved in regulation of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) production by affecting the apolipoprotein B trafficking and lipidation of VLDL particles. This protein is involved in protecting the function of pancreatic β-cells and insulin secretion by cholesterol homeostasis. Adipose tissue lipolysis is associated with ABCA1 activity. This transporter is involved in controlling obesity and insulin sensitivity by regulating triglyceride (TG) lipolysis and influencing on adiponectin, visfatin, leptin, and GLUT4 genes expression. The ABCA1 of skeletal muscle cells play a role in increasing the glucose uptake by enhancing the Akt phosphorylation and transferring GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Abnormal status of ABCA1-regulated phenotypes is observed in metabolic syndrome. This syndrome is associated with the occurrence of many diseases.

Many cases of Poly-Cystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) are overweight and presenting with insulin resistance.
Main objective
was to evaluate the effects of ovarian drilling on the serum levels of Irisin in women with polycystic ovaries.
Study design and setting
Serum Irisin levels were investigated in 100 cases with PCOS before ovarian drilling and 3 months after drilling, and in 80 control cases. Serum Irisin, hormonal profile and HOMA-IR were estimated in PCOS cases before and after ovarian drilling. Statistical analysis was performed by using Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS).
Results
The serum irisin levels in overweight and in normal weight PCOS cases before ovarian drilling were significantly higher as compared with the corresponding control cases. Fasting serum Irisin levels were found to be significantly elevated in PCOS patients before ovarian drilling as compared to the levels after drilling. The serum irisin levels in overweight and in normal weight PCOS cases before ovarian drilling were found to be significantly positively correlated with BMI, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR.
Conclusion
Elevated serum Irisin levels in PCOS may contribute to the development of insulin resistance. Ovarian drilling for polycystic ovaries results in a significant decrease in the serum Irisin levels. The analysis of ROC curves may suggest that serum Irisin may be a valuable biomarker for diagnosis and for monitoring cases with PCOS during treatment."

Diabetes prevalence in HIV is not well characterized for India, despite the high burden of both individual diseases. Epidemiology of insulin resistance (IR): a precursor to diabetes, and its associated risk factors are also poorly understood in Asian Indian people living with HIV (PLHIV). We assessed the prevalence of diabetes and IR in Pune, India and the associated risk factors for IR.
Methods
Cross-sectional analysis of adult (≥18 years) PLHIV receiving care at Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Government Medical College and Sassoon General Hospitals, Pune, India (BJGMC- SGH). Proportions and medians of PLHIV characteristics by diabetes status and IR were described. Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) index value ≥2 was used to define IR. Line of least squares assessed the relationship between IR and hyperinsulinemia. Association between sociodemographic, clinical factors with IR was determined using logistic regression.
Results
Of 485 enrollees, 47% were men, median age was 40 years (IQR: 35–46), median CD4 counts were 389 cells/mm3 (246–609). Thirty-five percent were centrally obese, 75% were adherent to WHO recommended physical activity guidelines. Prevalence of diabetes, prediabetes, IR were 9%, 16% and 38%, respectively. Twenty-nine percent non-diabetics had IR and it occurred much prior to the threshold for hyperinsulinemia. IR was associated with the use of ART drugs (OR: 6.6, 95% CI: 2.9–15.2 and 5.4, 95% CI: 2.2–13.6 for first- and second line ART respectively) and central obesity (OR:1.9, 95% CI: 1.1–3.4).
Conclusions
One fourth of the study population was diabetic or prediabetic and more than a third had IR. Better understanding of diabetes disease progression in relation to IR and the effect of physical activity on central obesity among Asian Indian PLHIV is mandated."

The current study included 110 Egyptian subjects. They divided into 4 groups: Group 1: 30 diabetic patients with NAFLD Group 2: 30 diabetic patients without NAFLD Group 3: 30 NAFLD patients without diabetes Group 4: 20 healthy controls. Vitamin D level assessment, AST, ALT, GGT, total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, fasting and 2 h post prandial plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, albumin and creatinine calculation of FLI were assessed.
Result
There was a statistical significant decrease in total vitamin D level in T2DM patients with NAFLD than either T2DM or NAFLD only patients.(15.5 ± 7.46 vs 24.4 ± 8.19 and 22.86 ± 9.58 ng/ml respectively) also Total vitamin D level is negatively correlated with age, weight, BMI, WC, total cholesterol, LDL, TG, FPG, HbA1c and FLI.
Conclusion
There is a decrease in total vitamin D in T2DM patients with NAFLD."

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of VDD in Saudi Arabia, revealing the lifestyle and nutritional habits; and assesses the association between VDD, Diabetes Mellitus, and obesity.
Methods
A descriptive, cross-sectional, and correlational design was used in this study. A convenience sampling method of 350 participants participated in the study.
Results
The results revealed that the probability of having vitamin D Deficiency was higher among females (OR = 2.06, p > .05); younger age-whereby with each one year decrease in age there was about 0.03 probability of having Vitamin D Deficiency (B = −0.03; p > .05); individuals with higher incomes (OR = 1.44, p > .05); smokers (OR = 0.08, p > .05); and a lack of exposure to the sun (OR = 8.50; p > .05). In addition, exercise is also a predictor of Vitamin D deficiency (OR = 3.8; p > .05). Moreover, less Vitamin D intake (OR 9.7; p > .05), less intake of Calcium (OR = 12.2, p > .05); In addition increase one unit in the BMI, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and FBS increased the log odd of having liability of Vitamin D deficiency by 3.2; 1.9, 1.8, 1.0, and 2.4 (p > .05).
Conclusion
Vitamin D Deficiency was prevalent in both males and females across different age groups in the citizens of Saudi. Because of the connection between Vitamin D Deficiency and main chronic disease, it is necessary to emphasize the need to recognize Vitamin D Deficiency screening for risk factors. It may be reasonable for the nutritionists, nurses, and physicians, to encourage the community on approaches to enhance dietary Vitamin D or suggest supplementation."

Besides the traditional risk factors, hematological changes may be involved in the development of arterial hypertension and in its pathogenesis.
Methods
The study, conducted on a sample of 545 subjects, 215 with hypertension and 330 witnesses, were evaluated for peripheral blood parameters in western Algeria; Logistic regression analysis was used to predict hypertension with hematological parameters.
Results
The characters studied related significantly; lower red blood cell levels have a three-and-a-half-fold risk of developing hypertension compared to those who have normal red blood cell counts (OR = 3.64, 95% CI = 1.37–9.65, p < 0.05). Subjects who have mean corpuscular volume rate below 80 fl are more exposed to hypertension (OR = 13.58, 95% CI = 4.68–39.41, p = 0.000). The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration reveals that subjects who have a lower than normal (<27 pg) are once less exposed to hypertension (OR = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.01–0.13, p = 0.000). Subjects who have lower platelet count than normal are twelve times more exposed to hypertension (OR = 12.13, 95% CI = 1.45–101.18, P = 0.021). Finally, the increase in sedimentation rate at one hour increases the risk of hypertension by 56.63 times compared to subjects with normal sedimentation rate (OR = 56.63, 95% CI = 3.37–597.33, P = 0.001).
Conclusions
Hematological profile associated with essential hypertension retained Red blood cells ratio, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, platelet ratio, and sedimentation rate at one hour."

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is related to the increased risk of major cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The link between high serum total bilirubin (TBL) is cross-sectionally related to MetS and its components. However, whether serum TBL predicts incidence of MetS and its components remains inconclusive.
Methods
The present study included 893 women aged 70 ± 9 years from a rural village. We examined the relationship between serum TBL and MetS based on the modified criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP) III report in a cross-sectional (N = 893) and cohort (N = 288) data.
Results
In the cross-sectional study, serum TBL (β = 0.536, p < 0.001) as well as age, alcohol consumption, exercise habits, history of CVD, SUA, GGT, and ALT was significantly and dependently associated with number of MetS components, but in the cohort study serum TBL was not associated with number of MetS components. Compared with the 1st tertile of serum TBL (0.20–0.55 mg/dL), multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the 2nd -3rd tertiles of serum TBL (0.54–2.00 mg/dL) was 0.70 (0.51–0.95) in the cross-sectional study and 0.41 (0.21–0.81) in the cohort study.
Conclusions
Our data demonstrated an independently negative association between serum TBL and MetS in Japanese community-dwelling women."

According to American Heart Association, PAD is defined as, “a narrowing of peripheral arteries to the legs, stomach, arms and the head-most commonly the arteries of leg.” The global prevalence for PAD with age adjusted prevalence is approximately 12%, and it affects relatively 8 to 12 million British people. The prevalence of PAD is 2–3 times higher in person with v/s without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Various subjective and objective methods are available to diagnose PAD, which includes questionnaires for pain and quality of life as subjective and Ankle Brachial Index (ABI), toe brachial index (TBI), arterial doppler for objective. ABI is one of the most reliable and easy to carry out method in clinical setups to diagnose PAD. The normal range for ABI is 0.9–1.29, 0.91 to 0.99 are considered as borderline, 0.41 to 0.91 are considered as mild to moderate diseased and below 0.4 is severe PAD. The objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease with type 2 diabetes mellitus in coastal Karnataka.
Methodology
A total of 317 participants were recruited for the study based on inclusion criteria. Ethical clearance was taken from the Institutional Ethics Committee. Participants were explained about the study and informed consent was obtained from the participants. Inclusion criteria was any individual with T2DM on medication. A subjective questionnaire specific to PAD was administered to the participants. Along with this the objective measure, ABI was done on the individuals.
Result
The mean age of all the participants was 57.36 ± 10.43 in years. The average Body Mass Index (BMI) was 24.62 ± 11.80 in Kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was found to be 9.13 ± 6.56 in years. The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease was found to be 8.52% in the study population.

Self-care support provided by healthcare providers (HCPs) is critical to diabetes self-care. However, a number of barriers prevent HCPs from providing self-care support to people with diabetes. We explored attitudes towards, barriers and facilitators of the provision of diabetes self-care support among Ghanaian HCPs.
Methods
Fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted among HCPs recruited from three diabetes clinics in Tamale, Ghana. All interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded and analysed thematically.
Results
HCPs reported a sense of responsibility and urgency to provide self-care education to diabetes patients; while believing it was the patients' responsibility to self-care for their diabetes condition. Accordingly, HCPs perceived their role to be limited to information sharing rather than behaviour change interventions. Facilitators to the provision of self-care support included patients’ motivation, and team work among healthcare professionals. Barriers that hindered self-care support included language barriers and poor inter-professional collaboration. Furthermore, HCPs discussed that they felt inadequately trained to provide self-care support. Healthcare-system-related barriers were inadequate office space, lack of professional development programmes, high patient numbers, inadequate staff numbers, inadequate health insurance and a lack of sufficient supplies and equipment in the hospital.
Conclusion
HCPs attitudes were generally favourable towards supporting self-care, albeit with a focus on information provision rather than behaviour change. Training in effective strategies for providing self-care support are needed, and better use of the resources that are available."

The previous studies have revealed that there is a link between dietary glycemic index and lipid profile in overweight and obesity. The aim of study was to investigate whether the glycemic index is associated with liver enzymes.
Method
Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured in 265 participants. Dietary glycemic index (GI) was assessed by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. With adjusting confounder variable, Binary logistic regression was also used to predict the relationship between liver enzymes and quartile of intake.
Results
There was a significant difference between low and high GI diet for BMR (P = 0.01), FFM (P = 0.03), TG (P = 0.02), HDL (P = 0.002). The association between HDL and glycemic index remained significant after adjustment of sex and age (P = 0.03). Using the regression model following adjustment revealed that for each 1% increase in the degree of the GI, there was 11% elevation in liver enzyme abnormalities. In both groups of men and women, enzyme abnormalities positively correlated with GI, while only men showed remarkable correlation in all models (crude model: β = 0.07, OR = 1.07, CI = 0.98to 1.16). Additionally, an increase in the degree of GI caused an elevation in enzyme abnormalities by 7%. With adjusting sex, age, BMI, and Physical activity, a significance correlation was found between GI and Enzyme abnormalities (p-value = 0.03, OR = 1.115).
Conclusion
Our study indicated that high glycemic index diet led to the elevated levels of the liver enzymes, while being significant only in men."
