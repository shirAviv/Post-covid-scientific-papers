abstract = "Novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) originating from China has rapidly crossed borders, infecting people throughout the whole world. This phenomenon has led to a massive public reaction; the media has been reporting continuously across borders to keep all informed about the pandemic situation. All these things are creating a lot of concern for people leading to heightened levels of anxiety. Pandemics can lead to heightened levels of stress; Anxiety is a common response to any stressful situation. This study attempted to assess the knowledge, attitude, anxiety experience, and perceived mental healthcare need among adult Indian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire using a non-probability snowball sampling technique. A total of 662 responses were received. The responders had a moderate level of knowledge about the COVID-19 infection and adequate knowledge about its preventive aspects. The attitude towards COVID-19 showed peoples' willingness to follow government guidelines on quarantine and social distancing. The anxiety levels identified in the study were high. More than 80 % of the people were preoccupied with the thoughts of COVID-19 and 72 % reported the need to use gloves, and sanitizers. In this study, sleep difficulties, paranoia about acquiring COVID-19 infection and distress related social media were reported in 12.5 %, 37.8 %, and 36.4 % participants respectively. The perceived mental healthcare need was seen in more than 80 % of participants. There is a need to intensify the awareness and address the mental health issues of people during this COVID-19 pandemic."

All the Governments across the globe have been preparing to deal with this medical emergency, which is known to be associated with mortality in about 5% of the sufferers. Gradually, it is seen that, many patients with COVID-19 infection have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. Due to the risk of infecting others, persons with COVID-19 infection are kept in isolation wards. Because of the isolation, the fear of death, and associated stigma, many patients with COVID-19 infection go through mental distress. In this report, we discuss the experience of 3 persons diagnosed with COVId-19 infection and admitted to the COVID ward."

However, these hospitals are also vulnerable to emerging infectious diseases. In early 2020, a psychiatric hospital and a psychiatric unit were reported to have nosocomial coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. A large number of patients and staff were severely impacted. This type of nosocomial infection threatens patient safety and quality of care. By learning from previous experiences of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and previous studies, psychiatric hospitals can provide safeguards to prevent nosocomial infection among patients and staff during an epidemic or biological disaster. These strategies include a series of actions such as following national guidelines for infection control, reserving adequate support for disinfection equipment, providing relevant and sufficient pro-service and in-service education and training, establishing regular surveillance of hand hygiene habits, proper communication and health education, and providing opportunities for vaccination if possible. Based on the harm reduction concept, staff division of office breaks and ward classification and shunting are recommended and should be further implemented."

However, it is important to understand that the life-threatening negative physical health consequences are going to be faced by a few, but everyone is going to face the negative mental health consequences of the pandemic. At various places COVID-19 hospitals are being established, to address the physical health consequences of the pandemic. However, mental health professionals have not been very actively involved in the management of people going through this pandemic. This viewpoint discusses the mental health consequences of the pandemic for the health care workers, people who are undergoing quarantine, people who are admitted to the COVID-19 hospitals, and those who have recovered from the infection. The article also highlights the mental health needs of people at different levels and the kind of interventions, which may be carried out."

This study is to investigate the psychological abnormality in health care workers battling the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the associations among social support, resilience and mental health. A total of 1521 health care workers, of whom 147 had public health emergency experience while 1374 showed no experience, completed the Symptom Check-List-90 (SCL-90), Chinese version of Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). χ2 test, t test and multiple regression analyses were used in statistical analysis. The results showed that people without public health emergency treatment experience showed worse performance in mental health, resilience and social support, and tended to suffer from psychological abnormality on interpersonal sensitivity and photic anxiety. This finding suggested that high levels of training and professional experience, resilience and social support were necessary to health care workers who are first taking part in public health emergence."

abstract = "COVID- 19, a biomedical disease has serious physical and tremendous mental health implications as the rapidly spreading pandemic. One of the most vulnerable, but neglected, an occupational community of internal migrant workers is prone for development of psychological ill-effects due to double whammy impact of COVID-19 crisis and concomitant adverse occupational scenario. Permutations and combinations of the factors viz susceptibility for new viral infections, potential to act as vectors of transmission of infection, high prevalence of pre-existing physical health morbidities such as occupational pneumoconiosis, tuberculosis, HIV infections, pre-existing psychological morbidities, adverse psychosocial factors like absence of family support and caretaker during the crisis, their limitations to follow the rules and regulations of personal safety during the COVID 19 crisis, social exclusion, and inability to timely access the psychiatric services; all give rise to the peri-traumatic psychological distress to internal migrant workers. Superadded, is the blow of financial constraints due to loss of work, absence or suspension of occupational safety and health-related basic laws with associated occupational hazards, which make this occupational group highly vulnerable for the development of psychological illnesses. We attempt to draw the attention of mental health professionals, general medical practitioners and occupational health policymakers to the various, interrelated and interdependent predisposing and causative factors for the development of psychological ill-effects amongst internal migrant workers with the interventions needed to address it, from an occupational health perspective angle."

abstract = "The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16–28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations."

For a small minority, such mental health factors can contribute to suicide. Here we report a novel reason for suicide and seemingly COVID-19-related – negligence in getting treatment by Bangladeshi healthcare providers. It was alleged that a woman committed suicide at a hospital because she was not treated and because doctors and nurses suspected she was infected with COVID-19 and did not want to get infected themselves. To help allay the fears among HCPs and the patients they are treating with COVID-19, a number of initiatives are suggested."

The online questionnaire surveyed 10,754 individuals from the general population of 31 provinces of Iran who completed the questionnaire on social networks from March 1 to March 9, 2020. The inferential statistics suggests that the level of anxiety was higher among women (95 % CI [0.1, 81.36], p < 0.001), people who more followed corona-related news (p < 0.001) and the age group of 21–40 years (p < 0.001). Ultimately, the level of anxiety was significantly higher among people who had at least one family member, relative, or friend who contracted COVID-19 disease (95 % CI [1.2, 35.03], p < 0.001). The health care system should adopt a package of psychosocial interventions to reduce the anxiety of high risk groups."

Little attention has been devoted so far to this topic from policymakers, stakeholders and researchers, resulting in a lack of replicable, scalable and applicable frameworks to help plan, develop and deliver MH care during pandemics. As a response, we have attempted to develop a conceptual framework (CF) that could guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of MH interventions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This CF was developed by early career psychiatrists from 16 countries that cover all the WHO regions. Their opinions were elicited via a semi-structured questionnaire. They were asked to provide their views about the current MH situation in their countries and to elaborate on existing 'myths' and misinformation. They were also asked to name the resources available and to propose solutions and approaches to provide accessible and affordable care. The CF was prepared based on the extant literature and the views discussed in this group; it illustrates the epidemiology of MH problems, preparedness plans, stage-specific plans or innovative solutions, opportunities to integrate those plans and possible outcomes at policy level. This CF can serve as a technical guide for future research regarding pandemics. It can be used to monitor trends and to optimize efforts, and to develop evidence based MH interventions. Still, further research focusing on the individual components of this framework is needed."

Mode of service delivery was changed predominantly to tele-medicine, amongst others.

abstract = "Introduction
The spread of novel corona virus (COVID-19) across the globe and the associated morbidity and mortality challenged the nations by several means. One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic.
Materials and methods
This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review.
Results
Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW.
Conclusion
Regular screening of medical personnel involved in treating, diagnosing patients with COVID-19 should be done for evaluating stress, depression and anxiety by using multidisciplinary Psychiatry teams."

Fever and cough are common symptoms only in infected individuals but headache and sleep disturbances are common even in uninfected general public.

Two countries, China first and later Italy, have gone to full lock down due to rapid spread of this virus. Till to date, no epidemiological data on mental health problems due to outbreak of the COVID-19 and mass isolation were not available. To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province. Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures. Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio. Results also revealed that young people aged 21–40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use. To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.)."
