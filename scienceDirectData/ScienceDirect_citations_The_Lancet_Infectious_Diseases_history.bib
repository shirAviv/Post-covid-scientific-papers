abstract = "Summary
Background
As the epidemic of Zika virus expands in the Americas, countries across Africa and the Asia-Pacific region are becoming increasingly susceptible to the importation and possible local spread of the virus. To support public health readiness, we aim to identify regions and times where the potential health, economic, and social effects from Zika virus are greatest, focusing on resource-limited countries in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.
Methods
Our model combined transportation network analysis, ecological modelling of mosquito occurrences, and vector competence for flavivirus transmission, using data from the International Air Transport Association, entomological observations from Zika's primary vector species, and climate conditions using WorldClim. We overlaid monthly flows of airline travellers arriving to Africa and the Asia-Pacific region from areas of the Americas suitable for year-round transmission of Zika virus with monthly maps of climatic suitability for mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus within Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.
Findings
An estimated 2·6 billion people live in areas of Africa and the Asia-Pacific region where the presence of competent mosquito vectors and suitable climatic conditions could support local transmission of Zika virus. Countries with large volumes of travellers arriving from Zika virus-affected areas of the Americas and large populations at risk of mosquito-borne Zika virus infection include India (67 422 travellers arriving per year; 1·2 billion residents in potential Zika transmission areas), China (238 415 travellers; 242 million residents), Indonesia (13 865 travellers; 197 million residents), Philippines (35 635 travellers; 70 million residents), and Thailand (29 241 travellers; 59 million residents).
Interpretation
Many countries across Africa and the Asia-Pacific region are vulnerable to Zika virus. Strategic use of available health and human resources is essential to prevent or mitigate the health, economic, and social consequences of Zika virus, especially in resource-limited countries.

abstract = "Summary
Background
At global level, there are 37 million people infected with HIV and 115 million people with antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV). Little is known about the extent of HIV–HCV co-infection. We sought to characterise the epidemiology and burden of HCV co-infection in people living with HIV.
Methods
In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL+, POPLINE, Africa-wide Information, Global Health, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library and WHO databases for studies measuring prevalence of HCV and HIV, published between Jan 1, 2002, and Jan 28, 2015. We included studies in HIV population samples of more than 50 individuals and recruited patients based on HIV infection status or other behavioural characteristics. We excluded editorials or reviews containing no primary data, samples of HCV or HIV–HCV co-infected individuals, or samples relying on self-reported infection status. We also excluded samples drawn from populations with other comorbidities or undergoing interventions that put them at increased risk of co-infection. Populations were categorised according to HIV exposure, with the regional burden of co-infection being derived by applying co-infection prevalence estimates to published numbers of HIV-infected individuals. We did a meta-analysis to estimate the odds of HCV in HIV-infected individuals compared with their HIV-negative counterparts.
Findings
From 31 767 citations identified, 783 studies met the inclusion criteria, resulting in 902 estimates of the prevalence of HIV–HCV co-infection. In HIV-infected individuals, HIV–HCV co-infection was 2·4% (IQR 0·8–5·8) within general population samples, 4·0% (1·2–8·4) within pregnant or heterosexually exposed samples, 6·4% (3·2–10·0) in men who have sex with men (MSM), and 82·4% (55·2–88·5) in people who inject drugs (PWID). Odds of HCV infection were six times higher in people living with HIV (5·8, 95% CI 4·5–7·4) than their HIV-negative counterparts. Worldwide, there are approximately 2 278 400 HIV–HCV co-infections (IQR 1 271 300—4 417 000) of which 1 362 700 (847 700–1 381 800) are in PWID, equalling an overall co-infection prevalence in HIV-infected individuals of 6·2% (3·4–11·9).
Interpretation
We noted a consistently higher HCV prevalence in HIV-infected individuals than HIV-negative individuals  across all risk groups and regions, but especially in PWID. This study highlights the importance of routine HCV testing in all HIV-infected individuals, but especially in PWID. There is also a need to improve country-level surveillance of HCV prevalence across different population groups in all regions.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Uncertainty in the risk of reproductive complications (pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and tubal factor infertility) following chlamydia infection and repeat infection hampers the design of evidence-based chlamydia control programmes. We estimate the association between diagnosed chlamydia and episodes of hospital health care (inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department) for a reproductive complication.
Methods
We constructed and analysed a retrospective population-based cohort of women aged 15–44 years from administrative records in Denmark (1995–2012). We used a subset of the national Danish Chlamydia Study. The master dataset contains all residents of Denmark (including Greenland) who had a positive chlamydia test recorded by a public health microbiology laboratory from Jan 1, 1992, to Nov 2, 2011. Individuals were randomly matched (by age and sex) to four individuals drawn from the population register (Danish Civil Registration System) who did not have a positive chlamydia test during this interval. The outcomes in the study were hospital episodes of health-care (inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department) with a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, or tubal factor infertility.
Findings
The 516 720 women (103 344 positive, 182 879 negative, 230 497 never-tested) had a mean follow-up of 7·96 years. Compared with women with only negative tests, the risk of each complication was 30% higher in women with one or more positive tests (pelvic inflammatory disease, adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1·50 [95% CI 1·43–1·57]; ectopic pregnancy, AHR 1·31 [1·25–1·38]; tubal factor infertility, AHR 1·37 [1·24–1·52]) and 60% lower in women who were never-tested (pelvic inflammatory disease, AHR 0·33 [0·31–0·35]; ectopic pregnancy, AHR 0·42 [0·39–0·44]; tubal factor infertility AHR 0·29 [0·25–0·33]). A positive test had a minor absolute impact on health as the difference in the lifetime incidence of complications was small between women who tested positive and those who tested negative (pelvic inflammatory disease, 0·6%; ectopic pregnancy, 0·2%; tubal factor infertility, 0·1%). Repeat infections increased the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease by a further 20% (AHR 1·20, 95% CI 1·11–1·31).
Interpretation
A single diagnosed chlamydia infection increased the risk of all complications and a repeat diagnosed infection further increased the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. Therefore, control programmes must prevent first and repeat infections to improve women's reproductive health.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Cryptococcus is the most common cause of adult meningitis in Africa. We assessed the safety and microbiological efficacy of adjunctive sertraline, previously shown to have in-vitro and in-vivo activity against cryptococcus.
Methods
In this open-label dose-finding study, we recruited HIV-infected individuals with cryptococcal meningitis who presented to Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda between Aug 14, 2013, and Aug 30, 2014. To assess safety and tolerability, the first 60 participants were given sertraline at escalating doses of 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day, 300 mg/day, or 400 mg/day as induction therapy for 2 weeks, followed by consolidation therapy with 200 mg/day for an additional 8 weeks. From Nov 29, 2013, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive open-label sertraline at predetermined doses of 200 mg/day, 300 mg/day, or 400 mg/day as induction therapy for 2 weeks, followed by consolidation therapy with 200 mg/day for 8 weeks. Dose assignment was made via computer-generated, permuted block randomisation stratified by antiretroviral therapy (ART) status for people with a first episode of meningitis. The primary outcome was 2-week cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clearance rate of cryptococcus, termed early fungicidal activity, measured in patients with a first episode of culture-positive meningitis and two or more CSF cultures. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01802385.
Findings
Of the 330 individuals assessed, 172 HIV-infected adults with cryptococcal meningitis were enrolled. We gave 100 mg/day sertraline to 17 patients, 200 mg/day to 12 patients, 300 mg/day to 14 patients, and 400 mg/day to 17 patients. 112 participants were randomly assigned to receive sertraline at 200 mg (n=48), 300 mg (n=36), or 400 mg (n=28) daily for the first 2 weeks, and 200 mg/day thereafter. The final population consisted of 17 participants in the 100 mg group, 60 in the 200 mg group, 50 in the 300 mg group, and 45 in the 400 mg in group. Participants receiving any sertraline dose averaged a CSF clearance rate of −0·37 colony forming units per mL per day (95% CI −0·41 to −0·33). Incidence of paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was 5% (two of 43 newly starting ART) and no cases of relapse occurred over the 12-week study period. 38 (22%) of 172 participants had died at 2 weeks, and 69 (40%) had died at 12 weeks. Six grade 4 adverse events occurred in 17 participants receiving 100 mg, 14 events in 60 participants receiving 200 mg, 19 events in 50 participants receiving 300 mg, and eight events in 45 participants receiving 400 mg. Grade 4 or 5 adverse event risk did not differ between current US Food and Drug Administration-approved dosing of 100–200 mg/day and higher doses of 300–400 mg/day (hazard ratio 1·27, 95% CI 0·69–2·32; p=0·45).
Interpretation
Participants receiving sertraline had faster cryptococcal CSF clearance and a lower incidence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and relapse than that reported in the past. This inexpensive and off-patent oral medication is a promising adjunctive antifungal therapy.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Identification of mechanisms that limit poliovirus replication is crucial for informing decisions aimed at global polio eradication. Studies of mucosal immunity induced by oral poliovirus (OPV) or inactivated poliovirus (IPV) vaccines and mixed schedules thereof will determine the effectiveness of different vaccine strategies to block virus shedding. We used samples from a clinical trial of different vaccination schedules to measure intestinal immunity as judged by neutralisation of virus and virus-specific IgA in stools.
Methods
In the FIDEC trial, Latin American infants were randomly assigned to nine groups to assess the efficacy of two schedules of bivalent OPV (bOPV) and IPV and challenge with monovalent type 2 OPV, and stools samples were collected. We selected three groups of particular interest—the bOPV control group (serotypes 1 and 3 at 6, 10, and 14 weeks), the trivalent attenuated OPV (tOPV) control group (tOPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks), and the bOPV–IPV group (bOPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks plus IPV at 14 weeks). Neutralising activity and poliovirus type-specific IgA were measured in stool after a monovalent OPV type 2 challenge at 18 weeks of age. Mucosal immunity was measured by in-vitro neutralisation of a type 2 polio pseudovirus (PV2). Neutralisation titres and total and poliovirus-type-specific IgG and IgA concentrations in stools were assessed in samples collected before challenge and 2 weeks after challenge from all participants.
Findings
210 infants from Guatemala and Dominican Republic were included in this analysis. Of 38 infants tested for mucosal antibody in the tOPV group, two were shedding virus 1 week after challenge, compared with 59 of 85 infants receiving bOPV (p<0·0001) and 53 of 87 infants receiving bOPV–IPV (p<0·0001). Mucosal type 2 neutralisation and type-specific IgA were noted primarily in response to tOPV. An inverse correlation was noted between virus shedding and both serum type 2 neutralisation at challenge (p<0·0001) and mucosal type 2 neutralisation at challenge (p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Mucosal type-2-specific antibodies can be measured in stool and develop in response to receipt of OPV type 2 either in the primary vaccine series or at challenge. These mucosal antibodies influence the amount of virus that is shed in an established infection.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir and emtricitabine prevents HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM). PrEP can be given on a daily or intermittent basis. Unfortunately, PrEP is not reimbursed in most European countries. Cost-effectiveness analyses of PrEP among MSM in Europe are absent but are key for decision makers to decide upon PrEP implementation.
Methods
We developed a deterministic mathematical model, calibrated to the well defined Dutch HIV epidemic among MSM, to predict the effect and cost-effectiveness of PrEP. PrEP was targeted to 10% of highly sexually active Dutch MSM over the coming 40 years. Cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to predict the cost-effectiveness of daily and on-demand PrEP. Cost-effectiveness ratios below €20 000 were considered to be cost-effective in this analysis.
Findings
Within the context of a stable HIV epidemic, at 80% effectiveness and current PrEP pricing, PrEP can cost as much as €11 000 (IQR 9400–14 100) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained when used daily, or as little as €2000 (IQR 1300–3000) per QALY gained when used on demand. At 80% effectiveness, daily PrEP can be considered cost-saving if the price of PrEP is reduced by 70%, and on-demand PrEP can be considered cost-saving if the price is reduced by 30–40%.
Interpretation
PrEP for HIV prevention among MSM in the Netherlands is cost-effective. The use of PrEP is most cost-effective when the price of PrEP is reduced through on-demand use or through availability of generic PrEP, and can quickly be considered cost-saving.

Background
The available data on antimicrobial stewardship programmes in Africa are scarce. The aims of this study were to assess the implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship programme in a setting with limited infectious disease resources.
Methods
We implemented a pharmacist-driven, prospective audit and feedback strategy for antimicrobial stewardship on the basis of a range of improvement science and behavioural principles across a diverse group of urban and rural private hospitals in South Africa. The study had a pre-implementation phase, during which a survey of baseline stewardship activities was done. Thereafter, a stepwise implementation phase was initiated directed towards auditing process measures to reduce consumption of antibiotics (prolonged duration, multiple antibiotics, and redundant antibiotic coverage), followed by a post-implementation phase once the model was embedded in each hospital. The effect on consumption was assessed with the WHO index of defined daily doses per 100 patient–days, and the primary outcome (change in antibiotic consumption between phases) was assessed with a linear mixed-effects regression model.
Findings
We implemented and assessed the antimicrobial stewardship programme between Oct 1, 2009, and Sept 30, 2014. 116 662 patients receiving antibiotics at 47 hospitals during 104 weeks of standardised measurement and feedback, were reviewed, with 7934 interventions by pharmacists recorded for the five targeted measures, suggesting that almost one in 15 prescriptions required intervention. 3116 (39%) of 7934 pharmacist interventions were of an excessive duration. The antimicrobial stewardship programme led to a reduction in mean antibiotic defined daily doses per 100 patient–days from 101·38 (95% CI 93·05–109·72) in the pre-implementation phase to 83·04 (74·87–91·22) in the post-implementation phase (p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Health-care facilities with limited infectious diseases expertise can achieve substantial returns through pharmacist-led antimicrobial stewardship programmes and by focusing on basic interventions.

SSI prevention is complex and requires the integration of a range of measures before, during, and after surgery. No international guidelines are available and inconsistencies in the interpretation of evidence and recommendations of national guidelines have been identified. Given the burden of SSIs worldwide, the numerous gaps in evidence-based guidance, and the need for standardisation and a global approach, WHO decided to prioritise the development of evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of SSIs. The guidelines take into account the balance between benefits and harms, the evidence quality, cost and resource use implications, and patient values and preferences.

abstract = "Summary
Background
New approaches are urgently required to address increasing rates of gonorrhoea and the emergence and global spread of antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We used whole-genome sequencing to study transmission and track resistance in N gonorrhoeae isolates.
Methods
We did whole-genome sequencing of isolates obtained from samples collected from patients attending sexual health services in Brighton, UK, between Jan 1, 2011, and March 9, 2015. We also included isolates from other UK locations, historical isolates from Brighton, and previous data from a US study. Samples from symptomatic patients and asymptomatic sexual health screening underwent nucleic acid amplification testing; positive samples and all samples from symptomatic patients were cultured for N gonorrhoeae, and resulting isolates were whole-genome sequenced. Cefixime susceptibility testing was done in selected isolates by agar incorporation, and we used sequence data to determine multi-antigen sequence types and penA genotypes. We derived a transmission nomogram to determine the plausibility of direct or indirect transmission between any two cases depending on the time between samples: estimated mutation rates, plus diversity noted within patients across anatomical sites and probable transmission pairs, were used to fit a coalescent model to determine the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms expected.
Findings
1407 (98%) of 1437 Brighton isolates between Jan 1, 2011, and March 9, 2015 were successfully sequenced. We identified 1061 infections from 907 patients. 281 (26%) of these infections were indistinguishable (ie, differed by zero single nucleotide polymorphisms) from one or more previous cases, and 786 (74%) had evidence of a sampled direct or indirect Brighton source. We observed multiple related samples across geographical locations. Of 1273 infections in Brighton (including historical data), 225 (18%) were linked to another case elsewhere in the UK, and 115 (9%) to a case in the USA. Four lineages initially identified in Brighton could be linked to 70 USA sequences, including 61 from a lineage carrying the mosaic penA XXXIV allele, which is associated with reduced cefixime susceptibility.
Interpretation
We present a whole-genome-sequencing-based tool for genomic contact tracing of N gonorrhoeae and demonstrate local, national, and international transmission. Whole-genome sequencing can be applied across geographical boundaries to investigate gonorrhoea transmission and to track antimicrobial resistance.

abstract = "Summary
Since its discovery in California in 1962, reports of enterovirus D68 have been infrequent. Before 2014, infections were confirmed in only 699 people worldwide. In August, 2014, two paediatric hospitals in the USA reported increases in the number of patients with severe respiratory illness, with an over-representation in children with asthma. Shortly after, the authorities recognised a nationwide outbreak, which then spread to Canada, Europe, and Asia. In 2014, more than 2000 cases of enterovirus D68 were reported in 20 countries. Concurrently, clusters of children with acute flaccid paralysis of unknown cause were reported in several US states and in Europe. Enterovirus D68 infection was confirmed in some of the paralysed children, but not all. Complications in patients who were severely neurologically affected resemble those caused by poliomyelitis. In this paper we systematically review reports on enterovirus D68 to estimate its global epidemiology and its ability to cause respiratory infections and neurological damage in children. We extracted data from 70 papers to report on prevalence, symptoms, hospitalisation and mortality, and complications of enterovirus D68, both before and during the large outbreak of 2014. The magnitude and severity of the enterovirus D68 outbreak underscores a need for improved diagnostic work-up of paediatric respiratory illness, not only to prevent unnecessary use of antibiotics, but also to ensure better surveillance of diseases. Existing surveillance systems should be assessed in terms of capacity and ability to detect and report any upsurge of respiratory viruses such as enterovirus D68 in a timely manner, and focus should be paid to development of preventive measures against these emerging enteroviruses that have potential for severe disease."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Malaria remains a major global public health concern, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The RTS,S/AS01 malaria candidate vaccine was reviewed by the European Medicines Agency and received a positive scientific opinion; WHO subsequently recommended pilot implementation in sub-Saharan African countries. Because malaria and HIV overlap geographically, HIV-infected children should be considered for RTS,S/AS01 vaccination. We therefore aimed to assess the safety of RTS,S/AS01 in HIV-infected children at two sites in western Kenya.
Methods
We did a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial at the clinical trial sites of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)–Walter Reed Army Institute of research in Kisumu and the KEMRI/US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Siaya. Eligible participants were infants and children aged from 6 weeks to 17 months with WHO stage 1 or 2 HIV disease (documented positive by DNA PCR), whether or not they were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive three doses of either RTS,S/AS01 or rabies vaccine (both 0·5 mL per dose by intramuscular injection), given once per month at 0, 1, and 2 months. We did the treatment allocation using a web-based central randomisation system stratified by age (6 weeks–4 months, 5–17 months), and by baseline CD4% (<10, 10–14, 15–19, and ≥20). Data were obtained in an observer-blind manner, and the vaccine recipient, their parent or carer, the funder, and investigators responsible for the assessment of endpoints were all masked to treatment allocation (only staff responsible for the preparation and administration of the vaccines were aware of the assignment and these individuals played no other role in the study). We provided ART, even if the participants were not receiving ART before the study, and daily co-trimoxazole for prevention of opportunistic infections. The primary outcome was the occurrence of serious adverse events until 14 months after dose 1 of the vaccine, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01148459.
Findings
Between July 30, 2010, and May 24, 2013, we enrolled 200 children to our study and randomly assigned 99 to receive RTS,S/AS01 and 101 to receive rabies vaccine. 177 (89%) of the 200 children enrolled completed 14 months of follow-up. Serious adverse events were noted in 41 (41·4%, 95% CI 31·6–51·8) of 99 RTS,S/AS01 recipients and 37 (36·6%, 27·3–46·8) of 101 rabies-vaccine recipients (relative risk 1·1, 95% CI 0·8–1·6). 20 (20·2%, 95% CI 12·8–29·5) of 99 RTS,S/AS01 recipients and 12 (11·9%, 6·3–19·8) of 101 rabies-vaccine recipients had at least one serious adverse event within 30 days after vaccination, mainly pneumonia, febrile convulsions, and salmonella sepsis. Five (5·1%, 95% CI 1·7–11·4) of 99 RTS,S/AS01 recipients and four (4·0%, 1·1–9·8) of 101 rabies-vaccine recipients died, but no deaths were deemed related to vaccination. Mortality was associated with five cases of pneumonia (1% RTS,S/AS01 recipients vs 3% rabies-vaccine recipients), five cases of gastroenteritis (3% RTS,S/AS01 recipients vs 2% rabies-vaccine recipients), five cases of malnutrition (2% RTS,S/AS01 recipients vs 3% rabies-vaccine recipients), one case of sepsis (1% rabies-vaccine recipients), one case of Haemophilus influenza meningitis (1% rabies-vaccine recipients), and one case of tuberculosis (1% RTS,S/AS01 recipients).
Interpretation
RTS, S/AS01 was well tolerated when given to children with WHO clinical stage 1 or 2 HIV disease along with high antiretroviral and co-trimoxazole use. Children with HIV disease could be included in future RTS,S/AS01 vaccination programmes.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pyrazinamide and fluoroquinolones are essential antituberculosis drugs in new rifampicin-sparing regimens. However, little information about the extent of resistance to these drugs at the population level is available.
Methods
In a molecular epidemiology analysis, we used population-based surveys from Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Pakistan, and South Africa to investigate resistance to pyrazinamide and fluoroquinolones among patients with tuberculosis. Resistance to pyrazinamide was assessed by gene sequencing with the detection of resistance-conferring mutations in the pncA gene, and susceptibility testing to fluoroquinolones was conducted using the MGIT system.
Findings
Pyrazinamide resistance was assessed in 4972 patients. Levels of resistance varied substantially in the surveyed settings (3·0–42·1%). In all settings, pyrazinamide resistance was significantly associated with rifampicin resistance. Among 5015 patients who underwent susceptibility testing to fluoroquinolones, proportions of resistance ranged from 1·0–16·6% for ofloxacin, to 0·5–12·4% for levofloxacin, and 0·9–14·6% for moxifloxacin when tested at 0·5 μg/mL. High levels of ofloxacin resistance were detected in Pakistan. Resistance to moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin when tested at 2 μg/mL was low in all countries.
Interpretation
Although pyrazinamide resistance was significantly associated with rifampicin resistance, this drug may still be effective in 19–63% of patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. Even though the high level of resistance to ofloxacin found in Pakistan is worrisome because it might be the expression of extensive and unregulated use of fluoroquinolones in some parts of Asia, the negligible levels of resistance to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones documented in all survey sites is an encouraging finding. Rational use of this class of antibiotics should therefore be ensured to preserve its effectiveness.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Treatment of the liver fluke infection Opisthorchis viverrini relies exclusively on praziquantel. Tribendimidine could be an alternative treatment option. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ascending single, oral doses of tribendimidine in patients with O viverrini infection.
Methods
We did two randomised, parallel-group, single-blind, dose-ranging, phase 2 trials in children (aged 8–14 years) and adults and adolescents (≥15 years) in three O viverrini endemic villages in Champasack province, southern Laos. Patients with O viverrini infection were randomly assigned, via a computer-generated central block-randomisation procedure, with block sizes of three (study 1) and four, eight, and 12 (study 2), to receive oral tribendimidine at doses of 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg in a 1:1:1 ratio (adults and adolescents in study 1); 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg (four 50 mg tablets) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (adults and adolescents in study 2); or 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg in a 1:1:1 ratio (children in study 1). One non-randomised group of children received tribendimidine 50 mg (study 2). Participants, investigators, and laboratory technicians doing the diagnostic assessments were masked to group assignment, but the investigator administering treatment could have recognised the treatment group based on the number of tablets. The primary objective was to estimate the dose–response relation in terms of cure rate and egg reduction rate. We did available-case analysis of all patients with primary endpoint data. We predicted dose–response associations with Emax models. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN96948551.
Findings
Between Oct 25, 2012, and Nov 5, 2013, 318 adolescents and adults were randomly assigned to seven tribendimidine dose groups: 200 mg (n=51), 400 mg (n=49), or 600 mg (n=47) in study 1, and 25 mg (n=39), 50 mg (n=47), 100 mg (n=44), or 200 mg (four 50 mg tablets; n=41) in study 2. 128 children were randomly assigned to receive tribendimidine 100 mg (n=44), 200 mg (n=40), or 400 mg (n=44) in study 1; 39 children were enrolled and received tribendimidine 50 mg in study 2. In adolescents and adults, the number of patients cured increased with increasing tribendimidine doses up to 100 mg: ten of 39 patients (25·6%, 95% CI 13·0–42·1) were cured in the 25 mg group, 20 of 47 patients (42·6%, 28·3–57·8) were cured in the 50 mg group, and 34 of 44 patients (77·3%, 62·2–88·5) were cured in the 100 mg group; geometric mean egg reduction rates were 86·9% (95% CI 74·8–93·4), 95·9% (92·7–97·7), and 99·1% (98·2–99·7), respectively. The 200 mg dose resulted in cure in 40 of 47 (83·0%, 69·2–92·5) adolescents and adults given the 200 mg tablet and 25 of 41 (61·0%, 95% CI 44·5–75·8) of those given four 50 mg tablets; the 400 mg dose resulted in cure in 43 of 47 patients (91·5%, 79·6–97·6) and the 600 mg dose resulted in cure in 36 of 45 patients (80·0%, 65·4–90·4). Corresponding egg reduction rates were 99·8% (95% CI 99·7–100·0) with one 200 mg tablet, 97·9% (95·9–99·2) with four 50 mg tablets, 99·9% (99·8–100·0) with 400 mg, and 99·8% (99·6–99·9) with 600 mg. The Emax model predicted an egg reduction rate of 99·0% (95% CI 95·7–99·8) at 111 mg in adolescents and adults. 50 mg tribendimidine had moderate efficacy in children, with cure recorded in 16 of 39 patients (41·0%, 95% CI 25·6–57·9). The 100 mg dose resulted in cure in 40 of 44 children (98·9%, 95% CI 78·3–97·5) and an egg reduction rate of 99·7% (95% CI 99·0–100·0), with no increased efficacy at higher doses. The Emax model predicted an egg reduction rate of 99·0% (95% CI 92·2–99·9) at 215 mg. Few adverse events were reported and were mostly mild, with few moderate and no serious events. The most common adverse events 3 h after treatment in adolescents and adults were vertigo (n=35 [11%]), headache (n=9 [3%]), nausea (n=6 [2%]), and fatigue (n=4 [1%]), and in children were headache (n=3 [2%]), vertigo (n=2 [1%]), and fatigue (n=2 [1%]).
Interpretation
Tribendimidine has excellent efficacy and tolerability at doses of 100 mg and above. Our study included mainly adults and children with low-intensity O viverrini infection; future studies should assess the efficacy of tribendimidine in patients with infections of moderate and high intensity.

abstract = "Summary
Background
India's total antibiotic use is the highest of any country. Patients often receive prescription-only drugs directly from pharmacies. Here we aimed to assess the medical advice and drug dispensing practices of pharmacies for standardised patients with presumed and confirmed tuberculosis in India.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study in the three Indian cities Delhi, Mumbai, and Patna, we developed two standardised patient cases: first, a patient presenting with 2–3 weeks of pulmonary tuberculosis symptoms (Case 1); and second, a patient with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (Case 2). Standardised patients were scheduled to present each case once to sampled pharmacies. We defined ideal management for both cases a priori as referral to a health-care provider without dispensing antibiotics or steroids or both.
Findings
Between April 1, 2014, and Nov 29, 2015, we sampled 622 pharmacies in Delhi, Mumbai, and Patna. Standardised patients completed 1200 (96%) of 1244 interactions. We recorded ideal management (defined as referrals without the use of antibiotics or steroids) in 80 (13%) of 599 Case 1 interactions (95% CI 11–16) and 372 (62%) of 601 Case 2 interactions (95% CI 58–66). Antibiotic use was significantly lower in Case 2 interactions (98 [16%] of 601, 95% CI 13–19) than in Case 1 (221 [37%] of 599, 95% CI 33–41). First-line anti-tuberculosis drugs were not dispensed in any city. The differences in antibiotic or steroid use and number of medicines dispensed between Case 1 and Case 2 were almost entirely attributable to the difference in referral behaviour.
Interpretation
Only some urban Indian pharmacies correctly managed patients with presumed tuberculosis, but most correctly managed a case of confirmed tuberculosis. No pharmacy dispensed anti-tuberculosis drugs for either case. Absence of a confirmed diagnosis is a key driver of antibiotic misuse and could inform antimicrobial stewardship interventions.

Background
Antibiotic resistance is a major global health problem and pathogens such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have become of particular concern in the management of lower respiratory tract infections. However, few data are available on the worldwide prevalence and risk factors for MRSA pneumonia. We aimed to determine the point prevalence of MRSA pneumonia and identify specific MRSA risk factors in community-dwelling patients hospitalised with pneumonia.
Methods
We did an international, multicentre study of community-dwelling, adult patients admitted to hospital with pneumonia who had microbiological tests taken within 24 h of presentation. We recruited investigators from 222 hospitals in 54 countries to gather point-prevalence data for all patients admitted with these characteristics during 4 days randomly selected during the months of March, April, May, and June in 2015. We assessed prevalence of MRSA pneumonia and associated risk factors through logistic regression analysis.
Findings
3702 patients hospitalised with pneumonia were enrolled, with 3193 patients receiving microbiological tests within 24 h of admission, forming the patient population. 1173 (37%) had at least one pathogen isolated (culture-positive population). The overall prevalence of confirmed MRSA pneumonia was 3·0% (n=95), with differing prevalence between continents and countries. Three risk factors were independently associated with MRSA pneumonia: previous MRSA infection or colonisation (odds ratio 6·21, 95% CI 3·25–11·85), recurrent skin infections (2·87, 1·10–7·45), and severe pneumonia disease (2·39, 1·55–3·68).
Interpretation
This multicountry study shows low prevalence of MRSA pneumonia and specific MRSA risk factors among community-dwelling patients hospitalised with pneumonia.

Increased provision of antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa has led to a growing number of patients with therapy failure and acquired drug-resistant HIV, driving the demand for more costly further lines of antiretroviral therapy. In conjunction with accelerated access to viral load monitoring, feasible and affordable technologies to detect drug-resistant HIV could help maximise the durability and rational use of available drug regimens. Potential low-cost technologies include in-house Sanger and next-generation sequencing in centralised laboratories, and point mutation assays and genotype-free systems that predict response to antiretroviral therapy at point-of-care. Strengthening of centralised high-throughput laboratories, including efficient systems for sample referral and results delivery, will increase economies-of-scale while reducing costs. Access barriers can be mitigated by standardisation of in-house assays into commercial kits, use of polyvalent instruments, and adopting price-reducing strategies. A stepwise rollout approach should improve feasibility, prioritising WHO-recommended population-based surveillance and management of complex patient categories, such as patients failing protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy. Implementation research, adaptations of existing WHO guidance, and political commitment, will be key to support the appropriate investments and policy changes. In this Personal View, we discuss the potential role of HIV drug resistance testing for population-based surveillance and individual patient management in sub-Saharan Africa. We review the strengths and challenges of promising low-cost technologies and how they can be implemented."

Mycoplasma hominis is a commensal organism in the genitourinary tract that can cause life-threatening CNS infections in neonates after intrauterine infection or through vertical transmission during birth. We present a case of an 11-day-old neonate presenting with fever and supporting laboratory evidence of a CNS infection. No systemic maternal infection or maternal genitourinary tract infection occurred at the time of delivery. Empirical treatment was initiated, consisting of amoxicillin, cefotaxime, and aciclovir. After clinical deterioration, 16S ribosomal DNA PCR in cerebrospinal fluid detected M hominis, antibiotic treatment was switched to moxifloxacin, and pharmacokinetic data were obtained. This Grand Round illustrates the challenges that exist in the diagnosis and treatment of M hominis meningoencephalitis: bacterial cultures are often negative and recommended empirical antimicrobials do not provide adequate antimicrobial coverage. Optimal antimicrobial treatment regimens for M hominis meningoencephalitis are unknown. Although we describe successful treatment of a neonate with a complicated M hominis meningoencephalitis with moxifloxacin, caution with fluoroquinolone monotherapy (including moxifloxacin) has to be taken into account because resistance to fluoroquinolones has previously been described."

abstract = "Summary
Few studies are available to inform duration of intravenous antibiotics for children and when it is safe and appropriate to switch to oral antibiotics. We have systematically reviewed antibiotic duration and timing of intravenous to oral switch for 36 paediatric infectious diseases and developed evidence-graded recommendations on the basis of the review, guidelines, and expert consensus. We searched databases and obtained information from references identified and relevant guidelines. All eligible studies were assessed for quality. 4090 articles were identified and 170 studies were included. Evidence relating antibiotic duration to outcomes in children for some infections was supported by meta-analyses or randomised controlled trials; in other infections data were from retrospective series only. Criteria for intravenous to oral switch commonly included defervescence and clinical improvement with or without improvement in laboratory markers. Evidence suggests that intravenous to oral switch can occur earlier than previously recommended for some infections. We have synthesised recommendations for antibiotic duration and intravenous to oral switch to support clinical decision making and prospective research."

There is no global consensus on the conduct of clinical trials in children and neonates with complicated clinical infection syndromes. No comprehensive regulatory guidance exists for the design of antibiotic clinical trials in neonates and children. We did a systematic review of antibiotic clinical trials in complicated clinical infection syndromes (including bloodstream infections and community-acquired pneumonia) in children and neonates (0–18 years) to assess whether standardised European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for adults was used in paediatrics, and whether paediatric clinical trials applied consistent definitions for eligibility and outcomes. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov between Jan 1, 2000, and Nov 18, 2015. 82 individual studies met our inclusion criteria. The published studies reported on an average of 66% of CONSORT items. Study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and endpoints varied substantially across included studies. The comparison between paediatric clinical trials and adult EMA and FDA guidance highlighted that regulatory definitions are only variably applicable and used at present. Absence of consensus for paediatric antibiotic clinical trials is a major barrier to harmonisation in research and translation into clinical practice. To improve comparison of therapies and strategies, international collaboration among all relevant stakeholders leading to harmonised case definitions and outcome measures is needed."

Involuntary migration is a crucially important global challenge from an economic, social, and public health perspective. The number of displaced people reached an unprecedented level in 2015, at a total of 60 million worldwide, with more than 1 million crossing into Europe in the past year alone. Migrants and refugees are often perceived to carry a higher load of infectious diseases, despite no systematic association. We propose three important contributions that the global health community can make to help address infectious disease risks and global health inequalities worldwide, with a particular focus on the refugee crisis in Europe. First, policy decisions should be based on a sound evidence base regarding health risks and burdens to health systems, rather than prejudice or unfounded fears. Second, for incoming refugees, we must focus on building inclusive, cost-effective health services to promote collective health security. Finally, alongside protracted conflicts, widening of health and socioeconomic inequalities between high-income and lower-income countries should be acknowledged as major drivers for the global refugee crisis, and fully considered in planning long-term solutions."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and treatment recommendations, each with specific limitations, vary globally. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of solithromycin, a novel macrolide, with moxifloxacin for treatment of CABP.
Methods
We did this global, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, active-controlled, non-inferiority trial at 114 centres in North America, Latin America, Europe, and South Africa. Patients (aged ≥18 years) with clinically and radiographically confirmed pneumonia of Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class II, III, or IV were randomly assigned (1:1), via an internet-based central block randomisation procedure (block size of four), to receive either oral solithromycin (800 mg on day 1, 400 mg on days 2–5, placebo on days 6–7) or oral moxifloxacin (400 mg on days 1–7). Randomisation was stratified by geographical region, PORT risk class (II vs III or IV), and medical history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study sponsor, investigators, staff, and patients were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was early clinical response, defined as an improvement in at least two of four symptoms (cough, chest pain, sputum production, dyspnoea) with no worsening in any symptom at 72 h after the first dose of study drug, with a 10% non-inferiority margin. The primary analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT-01756339.
Findings
Between Jan 3, 2013, and Sept 24, 2014, we randomly assigned 860 patients to receive solithromycin (n=426) or moxifloxacin (n=434). Patients were followed up to days 28–35 after first dose. Solithromycin was non-inferior to moxifloxacin in achievement of early clinical response: 333 (78·2%) patients had an early clinical response in the solithromycin group versus 338 (77·9%) patients in the moxifloxacin group (difference 0·29, 95% CI −5·5 to 6·1). Both drugs had a similar safety profile. 43 (10%) of 155 treatment-emergent adverse events in the solithromycin group and 54 (13%) of 154 such events in the moxifloxacin group were deemed to be related to study drug. The most common adverse events, mostly of mild severity, were gastrointestinal disorders, including diarrhoea (18 [4%] patients in the solithromycin group vs 28 [6%] patients in the moxifloxacin group), nausea (15 [4%] vs 17 [4%] patients) and vomiting (ten [2%] patients in each group); and nervous system disorders, including headache (19 [4%] vs 11 [3%] patients) and dizziness (nine [2%] vs seven [2%] patients).
Interpretation
Oral solithromycin was non-inferior to oral moxifloxacin for treatment of patients with CABP, showing the potential to restore macrolide monotherapy for this indication.

Neonatal infections are estimated to account for a quarter of the 2·8 million annual neonatal deaths, as well as approximately 3% of all disability-adjusted life-years. Despite this burden, few data are available on incidence, aetiology, and outcomes, particularly regarding impairment. We aimed to develop guidelines for improved scientific reporting of observational neonatal infection studies, to increase comparability and to strengthen research in this area. This checklist, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology for Newborn Infection (STROBE- NI), is an extension of the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement. STROBE-NI was developed following systematic reviews of published literature (1996–2015), compilation of more than 130 potential reporting recommendations, and circulation of a survey to relevant professionals worldwide, eliciting responses from 147 professionals from 37 countries. An international consensus meeting of 18 participants (with expertise in infectious diseases, neonatology, microbiology, epidemiology, and statistics) identified priority recommendations for reporting, additional to the STROBE statement. Implementation of these STROBE-NI recommendations, and linked checklist, aims to improve scientific reporting of neonatal infection studies, increasing data utility and allowing meta-analyses and pathogen-specific burden estimates to inform global policy and new interventions, including maternal vaccines."

Avian influenza A H5N1 viruses have caused many, typically severe, human infections since the first human case was reported in 1997. However, no comprehensive epidemiological analysis of global human cases of H5N1 from 1997 to 2015 exists. Moreover, few studies have examined in detail the changing epidemiology of human H5N1 cases in Egypt, especially given the outbreaks since November, 2014, which have the highest number of cases ever reported worldwide in a similar period. Data on individual patients were collated from different sources using a systematic approach to describe the global epidemiology of 907 human H5N1 cases between May, 1997, and April, 2015. The number of affected countries rose between 2003 and 2008, with expansion from east and southeast Asia, then to west Asia and Africa. Most cases (67·2%) occurred from December to March, and the overall case-fatality risk was 483 (53·5%) of 903 cases which varied across geographical regions. Although the incidence in Egypt has increased dramatically since November, 2014, compared with the cases beforehand, there were no significant differences in the fatality risk, history of exposure to poultry, history of patient contact, and time from onset to hospital admission in the recent cases."

Present research priorities include the identification of effective strategies for tuberculosis infection control, improved understanding of where transmission occurs and the transmissibility of drug-resistant strains, and estimates of the effect of HIV and antiretroviral therapy on transmission dynamics.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Despite the heightened risk of serious influenza during infancy, vaccination is not recommended in infants younger than 6 months. We aimed to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of maternal immunisation with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine for protection of infants against a first episode of laboratory-confirmed influenza.
Methods
We did this prospective, active-controlled, observer-blind, randomised phase 4 trial at six referral centres and community health centres in Bamako, Mali. Third-trimester pregnant women (≥28 weeks' gestation) were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated, centre-specific list with alternate block sizes of six or 12, to receive either trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine or quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine. Study personnel administering vaccines were not masked to treatment allocation, but allocation was concealed from clinicians, laboratory personnel, and participants. Infants were visited weekly until age 6 months to detect influenza-like illness; laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosed with RT-PCR. We assessed two coprimary objectives: vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza in infants born to women immunised any time prepartum (intention-to-treat population), and vaccine efficacy in infants born to women immunised at least 14 days prepartum (per-protocol population). The primary outcome was the occurrence of a first case of laboratory-confirmed influenza by age 6 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01430689.
Findings
We did this trial from Sept 12, 2011, to Jan 28, 2014. Between Sept 12, 2011, and April 18, 2013, we randomly assigned 4193 women to receive trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (n=2108) or quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (n=2085). There were 4105 livebirths; 1797 (87%) of 2064 infants in the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine group and 1793 (88%) of 2041 infants in the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine group were followed up until age 6 months. We recorded 5279 influenza-like illness episodes in 2789 (68%) infants, of which 131 (2%) episodes were laboratory-confirmed influenza. 129 (98%) cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza were first episodes (n=77 in the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine group vs n=52 in the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine group). In the intention-to-treat population, overall infant vaccine efficacy was 33·1% (95% CI 3·7–53·9); in the per-protocol population, vaccine efficacy was 37·3% (7·6–57·8). Vaccine efficacy remained robust during the first 4 months of follow-up (67·9% [95% CI 35·1–85·3] by intention to treat and 70·2% [35·7–87·6] by per protocol), before diminishing during the fifth month (57·3% [30·6–74·4] and 60·7 [33·8–77·5], respectively). Adverse event rates in women and infants were similar among groups. Pain at the injection site was more common in women given quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine than in those given trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (n=253 vs n=132; p<0·0001), although 354 [92%] reactions were mild. Obstetrical and non-obstetrical serious adverse events were reported in 60 (3%) women in the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine group and 61 (3%) women in the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine group. Presumed neonatal infection was more common in infants in the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine group than in those in the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine group (n=60 vs n=37; p=0·02). No serious adverse events were related to vaccination.
Interpretation
Vaccination of pregnant women with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in Mali—a poorly resourced country with high infant mortality—was technically and logistically feasible and protected infants from laboratory-confirmed influenza for 4 months. With adequate financing to procure the vaccine, implementation will parallel the access to antenatal care and immunisation coverage of pregnant women with tetanus toxoid.

In geographical areas of high tuberculosis prevalence and in susceptible patients (CD4 counts less than 200 cells per μL) detection of choroidal granulomas should be accepted as evidence of disseminated tuberculosis. With training and proper support, eye screening can be done by HIV/AIDS clinicians, allowing early tuberculosis treatment. In regions with a high burden of tuberculosis, we recommend that eye screening be a standard part of the initial assessment of susceptible patients, including at a minimum all patients with HIV/AIDS with CD4 less than 100 cells per μL with or without eye symptoms, and with or without suspicion of disseminated tuberculosis."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Vaccination programmes to prevent outbreaks after introductions of infectious people aim to maintain the average number of secondary infections per infectious person at one or less. We aimed to assess heterogeneity in vaccine uptake and other characteristics that, together with non-random mixing, could increase this number and to evaluate strategies that could mitigate their impact.
Methods
Because most US children attend elementary school in their own neighbourhoods, surveys of children entering elementary school (age 5 years before Sept 1) allow assessment of spatial heterogeneity in the proportion of children immune to vaccine-preventable diseases. We used data from a 2008 school-entry survey by the Immunization Division of the California Department of Public Health to obtain school addresses; numbers of students enrolled; proportions of enrolled students who had received one or two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine; and proportions with medical or personal-belief exemptions. Using a mixing model suitable for spatially-stratified populations, we projected the expected numbers of secondary infections per infectious person for measles, mumps, and rubella. We also mapped contributions to this number for measles in San Diego County's 638 elementary schools and its largest district, comprising 200 schools (31%). We then modelled the effect on measles' realised reproduction number (RV) of the following plausible interventions: vaccinating all children with personal-belief exemptions, increasing uptake by 10% to 50% in all low-immunity schools (<90% of students immune) or in only influential (effective daily contact rates >3 or contacts inter-school >30%) low-immunity schools, and increasing private school uptake to the public school average.
Findings
In 2008, 39 132 children began elementary school in San Diego County, CA, USA. At entry to school, 97% had received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine, with 2·5% having personal-belief exemptions. We note substantial heterogeneity in immunity throughout the county. Although the average population immunities for measles, mumps, and rubella (92%, 87%, 92%) were similar to the population-immunity thresholds in homogeneous, randomly-mixing populations (91%, 88%, 76%), after accounting for heterogeneity and non-random mixing, the basic reproduction numbers increased by 70%, meaning that introduced pathogens could cause outbreaks. The impact of our modelled interventions ranged from negligible to a nearly complete reduction in the outbreak potential of measles. The most effective intervention to lower the realised reproduction number (RV 3·39) was raising immunity by 50% in 114 schools with low immunity (RV 1·02), but raising immunity by this level in only influential, low-immunity schools also was effective (RV 2·02). The effectiveness of vaccinating the 972 children with personal-belief exemptions was similar to that of targeting all low-immunity schools (RV 1·11). Targeting only private schools had little effect.
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that increasing vaccine uptake could prevent outbreaks such as that of measles in San Diego in 2008. Vaccinating children with personal-belief exemptions was one of the most effective interventions that we modelled, but further research on mixing in heterogeneous populations is needed.

Background
An increasing number of countries with low incidence of tuberculosis have pre-entry screening programmes for migrants. We present the first estimates of the prevalence of and risk factors for tuberculosis in migrants from 15 high-incidence countries screened before entry to the UK.
Methods
We did a population-based cross-sectional study of applicants for long-term visas who were screened for tuberculosis before entry to the UK in a pilot programme between Oct 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2013. The primary outcome was prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis. We used Poisson regression to estimate crude prevalence and created a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors for the primary outcome.
Findings
476 455 visa applicants were screened, and the crude prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis was 92 (95% CI 84–101) per 100 000 individuals. After adjustment for age and sex, factors that were strongly associated with an increased risk of bacteriologically confirmed disease at pre-entry screening were self-report of close or household contact with an individual with tuberculosis (odds ratio 11·6, 95% CI 7·0–19·3; p<0·0001) and being an applicant for settlement and dependant visas (1·3, 1·0–1·6; p=0·0203).
Interpretation
Migrants reporting contact with an individual with tuberculosis had the highest risk of tuberculosis at pre-entry screening. To tackle this disease burden in migrants, a comprehensive and collaborative approach is needed between countries with pre-entry screening programmes, health services in the countries of origin and migration, national tuberculosis control programmes, and international public health bodies.

Despite modest gains, there are many challenges for malaria elimination in India, including: varied patterns of malaria transmission in different parts of the country demanding area-specific control measures; intense malaria transmission fuelled by favourable climatic and environment factors; varying degrees of insecticide resistance of vectors; antimalarial drug resistance; a weak surveillance system; and poor national coordination of state programmes. Prevention and protection against malaria are low as a result of a weak health-care system, as well as financial and socioeconomic constraints. Additionally, the open borders of India provide a potential route of entry for artesunate-resistant parasites from southeast Asia. This situation calls for urgent dialogue around tackling malaria across borders—between India's states and neighbouring countries—through sharing of information and coordinated control and preventive measures, if we are to achieve the aim of malaria elimination in the region."

Background
Previous estimates of the burden of HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) among people who inject drugs have not included estimates of the burden attributable to the consequences of past injecting. We aimed to provide these estimates as part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2013.
Methods
We modelled the burden of HBV and HCV (including cirrhosis and liver cancer burden) and HIV at the country, regional, and global level. We extracted United Nations data on the proportion of notified HIV cases by transmission route, and estimated the contribution of injecting drug use (IDU) to HBV and HCV disease burden by use of a cohort method that recalibrated individuals' history of IDU, and accumulated risk of HBV and HCV due to IDU. We estimated data on current IDU from a meta-analysis of HBV and HCV incidence among injecting drug users and country-level data on the incidence of HBV and HCV between 1990 and 2013. We calculated estimates of burden of disease through years of life lost (YLL), years of life lived with disability (YLD), deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) calculated for each metric.
Findings
In 2013, an estimated 10·08 million DALYs were attributable to previous exposure to HIV, HBV, and HCV via IDU, a four-times increase since 1990. In total in 2013, IDU was estimated to cause 4·0% (2·82 million DALYs, 95% UI 2·4 million to 3·8 million) of DALYs due to HIV, 1·1% (216 000, 101 000–338 000) of DALYs due to HBV, and 39·1% (7·05 million, 5·88 million to 8·15 million) of DALYs due to HCV. IDU-attributable HIV burden was highest in low-to-middle-income countries, and IDU-attributable HCV burden was highest in high-income countries.
Interpretation
IDU is a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Effective interventions to prevent and treat these important causes of health burden need to be scaled up.

There has been increased interest in the potential of maternal immunisation to protect maternal, fetal, and infant health. Maternal tetanus vaccination is part of routine antenatal care and immunisation campaigns in many countries, and it has played an important part in the reduction of maternal and neonatal tetanus. Additional vaccines that have been recommended for routine maternal immunisation include those for influenza and pertussis, and other vaccines are being developed. Maternal immunisation is controversial since regulators, professionals, and the public are often reluctant to accept pharmaceutical interventions during pregnancy. So far, little attention has been given to the ethics of vaccination during pregnancy. In this Personal View we argue that maternal immunisation should be offered in response to concrete, severe risks of disease for mother and child, and we explain how this requirement of serious risk can be used to guide ethical decision-making about maternal immunisation."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum threatens to reduce the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), thus compromising global efforts to eliminate malaria. Recent treatment failures with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, the current first-line ACT in Cambodia, suggest that piperaquine resistance may be emerging in this country. We explored the relation between artemisinin resistance and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures, and sought to confirm the presence of piperaquine-resistant P falciparum infections in Cambodia.
Methods
In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled patients aged 2–65 years with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in three Cambodian provinces: Pursat, Preah Vihear, and Ratanakiri. Participants were given standard 3-day courses of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. Peripheral blood parasite densities were measured until parasites cleared and then weekly to 63 days. The primary outcome was recrudescent P falciparum parasitaemia within 63 days. We measured piperaquine plasma concentrations at baseline, 7 days, and day of recrudescence. We assessed phenotypic and genotypic markers of drug resistance in parasite isolates. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01736319.
Findings
Between Sept 4, 2012, and Dec 31, 2013, we enrolled 241 participants. In Pursat, where artemisinin resistance is entrenched, 37 (46%) of 81 patients had parasite recrudescence. In Preah Vihear, where artemisinin resistance is emerging, ten (16%) of 63 patients had recrudescence and in Ratanakiri, where artemisinin resistance is rare, one (2%) of 60 patients did. Patients with recrudescent P falciparum infections were more likely to have detectable piperaquine plasma concentrations at baseline compared with non-recrudescent patients, but did not differ significantly in age, initial parasite density, or piperaquine plasma concentrations at 7 days. Recrudescent parasites had a higher prevalence of kelch13 mutations, higher piperaquine 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, and lower mefloquine IC50 values; none had multiple pfmdr1 copies, a genetic marker of mefloquine resistance.
Interpretation
Dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures are caused by both artemisinin and piperaquine resistance, and commonly occur in places where dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine has been used in the private sector. In Cambodia, artesunate plus mefloquine may be a viable option to treat dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures, and a more effective first-line ACT in areas where dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures are common. The use of single low-dose primaquine to eliminate circulating gametocytes is needed in areas where artemisinin and ACT resistance is prevalent.

The digitisation of historical disease images and their widespread availability on the internet have been a boon to education and research, but with unintended consequences, including the misrepresentation of infectious diseases in the past and the viral spread of misinformation. Many medieval images containing scenes of infectious disease come from non-medical sources and are not meant to convey any medical meaning. Erroneous modern captions have led to the publication of several historical images labelled as depictions of the plague, although artistic and textual evidence shows that they are not. Mislabelled images lose their intended historical narrative, and their use creates a distorted view of the past and of the disease in question. Scholars should give the same careful consideration to an image's evidentiary context that they would insist on giving to all other forms of evidence."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hand hygiene compliance of health-care workers remains suboptimal despite standard multimodal promotion, and evidence for the effectiveness of novel interventions is urgently needed. We aimed to assess the effect of enhanced performance feedback and patient participation on hand hygiene compliance in the setting of multimodal promotion.
Methods
We did a single-centre, cluster randomised controlled trial at University of Geneva Hospitals (Geneva, Switzerland). All wards hosting adult, lucid patients, and all health-care workers and patients in these wards, were eligible. After a 15-month baseline period, eligible wards were assigned by computer-generated block randomisation (1:1:1), stratified by the type of ward, to one of three groups: control, enhanced performance feedback, or enhanced performance feedback plus patient participation. Standard multimodal hand hygiene promotion was done hospital-wide throughout the study. The primary outcome was hand hygiene compliance of health-care workers (according to the WHO Five Moments of Hand Hygiene) at the opportunity level, measured by direct observation (20-min sessions) by 12 validated infection control nurses, with each ward audited at least once every 3 months. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN43599478.
Findings
We randomly assigned 67 wards to the control group (n=21), enhanced performance feedback (n=24), or enhanced performance feedback plus patient participation (n=22) on May 19, 2010. One ward in the control group became a high-dependency unit and was excluded from analysis. During 1367 observation sessions, 12 579 hand hygiene opportunities were recorded. Between the baseline period (April 1, 2009, to June 30, 2010) and the intervention period (July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2012), mean hand hygiene compliance increased from 66% (95% CI 62–70) to 73% (70–77) in the control group (odds ratio [OR] 1·41, 95% CI 1·21–1·63), from 65% (62–69) to 75% (72–77) in the enhanced performance feedback group (1·61, 1·41–1·84), and from 66% (62–70) to 77% (74–80) in the enhanced performance feedback plus patient participation group (1·73, 1·51–1·98). The absolute difference in compliance attributable to interventions was 3 percentage points (95% CI 0–7; p=0·19) for the enhanced performance feedback group and 4 percentage points (1–8; p=0·048) for the enhanced performance feedback plus patient participation group. Hand hygiene compliance remained significantly higher than baseline in all three groups (OR 1·21 [1·00–1·47] vs 1·38 [1·19–1·60] vs 1·36 [1·18–1·57]) during the post-intervention follow-up (Jan 1, 2013, to Dec 31, 2014).
Interpretation
Hand hygiene compliance improved in all study groups, and neither intervention had a clinically significant effect compared with control. Improvement in control wards might reflect cross-contamination, highlighting challenges with randomised trials of behaviour change.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Despite the existence of effective prevention and treatment interventions, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection continues to cause nearly 1 million deaths each year. WHO aspires to global control and elimination of HBV infection. We aimed to evaluate the potential impact of public health interventions against HBV, propose targets for reducing incidence and mortality, and identify the key developments required to achieve them.
Methods
We developed a simulation model of the global HBV epidemic, incorporating data on the natural history of HBV, prevalence, mortality, vaccine coverage, treatment dynamics, and demographics. We estimate the impact of current interventions and scaling up of existing interventions for prevention of infection and introducing wide-scale population screening and treatment interventions on the worldwide epidemic.
Findings
Vaccination of infants and neonates is already driving a large decrease in new infections; vaccination has already prevented 210 million new chronic infections by 2015 and will have averted 1·1 million deaths by 2030. However, without scale-up of existing interventions, our model showed that there will be a cumulative 63 million new cases of chronic infection and 17 million HBV-related deaths between 2015 and 2030 because of ongoing transmission in some regions and poor access to treatment for people already infected. A target of a 90% reduction in new chronic infections and 65% reduction in mortality could be achieved by scaling up the coverage of infant vaccination (to 90% of infants), birth-dose vaccination (to 80% of neonates), use of peripartum antivirals (to 80% of hepatitis B e antigen-positive mothers), and population-wide testing and treatment (to 80% of eligible people). These interventions would avert 7·3 million deaths between 2015 and 2030, including 1·5 million cases of cancer deaths. An elimination threshold for incidence of new chronic infections would be reached by 2090 worldwide. The annual cost would peak at US$7·5 billion worldwide ($3·4 billion in low-income and lower-middle-income countries), but decrease rapidly and this would be accelerated if a cure is developed.
Interpretation
Scale-up of vaccination coverage, innovations in scalable options for prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and ambitious population-wide testing and treatment are needed to eliminate HBV as a major public health threat. Achievement of these targets could make a major contribution to one of the Sustainable Development Goals of combating hepatitis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The timing of the initial spread of hepatitis C virus genotype 1a in North America is controversial. In particular, how and when hepatitis C virus reached extraordinary prevalence in specific demographic groups remains unclear. We quantified, using all available hepatitis C virus sequence data and phylodynamic methods, the timing of the spread of hepatitis C virus genotype 1a in North America.
Methods
We screened 45 316 publicly available sequences of hepatitis C virus genotype 1a for location and genotype, and then did phylogenetic analyses of available North American sequences from five hepatitis C virus genes (E1, E2, NS2, NS4B, NS5B), with an emphasis on including as many sequences with early collection dates as possible. We inferred the historical population dynamics of this epidemic for all five gene regions using Bayesian skyline plots.
Findings
Most of the spread of genotype 1a in North America occurred before 1965, and the hepatitis C virus epidemic has undergone relatively little expansion since then. The effective population size of the North American epidemic stabilised around 1960. These results were robust across all five gene regions analysed, although analyses of each gene separately show substantial variation in estimates of the timing of the early exponential growth, ranging roughly from 1940 for NS2, to 1965 for NS4B.
Interpretation
The expansion of genotype 1a before 1965 suggests that nosocomial or iatrogenic factors rather than past sporadic behavioural risk (ie, experimentation with injection drug use, unsafe tattooing, high risk sex, travel to high endemic areas) were key contributors to the hepatitis C virus epidemic in North America. Our results might reduce stigmatisation around screening and diagnosis, potentially increasing rates of screening and treatment for hepatitis C virus.

Aquaculture uses hundreds of tonnes of antimicrobials annually to prevent and treat bacterial infection. The passage of these antimicrobials into the aquatic environment selects for resistant bacteria and resistance genes and stimulates bacterial mutation, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. The potential bridging of aquatic and human pathogen resistomes leads to emergence of new antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and global dissemination of them and their antimicrobial resistance genes into animal and human populations. Efforts to prevent antimicrobial overuse in aquaculture must include education of all stakeholders about its detrimental effects on the health of fish, human beings, and the aquatic ecosystem (the notion of One Health), and encouragement of environmentally friendly measures of disease prevention, including vaccines, probiotics, and bacteriophages. Adoption of these measures is a crucial supplement to efforts dealing with antimicrobial resistance by developing new therapeutic agents, if headway is to be made against the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance in human and veterinary medicine."

The number of infants infected with HIV is declining with the rise in interventions for the elimination of paediatric HIV infection, but the number of uninfected infants exposed to HIV through their HIV-infected mothers is increasing. Interest in the health outcomes of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants has grown in the past decade, with several studies suggesting that these infants have increased mortality rates, increased infectious morbidity, and impaired growth compared with HIV-unexposed infants. However, heterogeneous results might reflect the inherent challenges in studies of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants, which need large populations with appropriate, contemporaneous comparison groups and repeated HIV testing throughout the period of breastfeeding. We review the effects of HIV exposure on mortality, morbidity, and growth, discuss the immunological abnormalities identified so far, and provide an overview of interventions that could be effective in this susceptible population. As the number of infants infected with HIV declines, the health needs of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants should be prioritised further, to ensure that post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals are achieved."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Maternal group B streptococcus (GBS) serotype-specific capsular antibody concentrations are correlated with susceptibility to neonatal GBS invasive disease. Maternal immunisation against GBS during pregnancy might protect infants across the period of susceptibility to invasive disease, but no licensed vaccine exists. This study assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a CRM197-conjugated trivalent GBS vaccine in non-pregnant and pregnant women, and antibody transfer to their infants.
Methods
We did a phase 1b/2, randomised, observer-blind single-centre study of an investigational trivalent GBS vaccine in healthy non-pregnant women (cohort 1), and a dose-ranging study in healthy pregnant women (cohort 2). The study was done at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, South Africa. Participants were healthy non-pregnant or pregnant (28–35 weeks' gestation) women aged 18–40 years. In cohort 1, non-pregnant women were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive the investigational vaccine (two injections, 1 month apart, of a 20 μg dose [of each serotype] of aluminium hydroxide-adjuvanted investigational vaccine) or placebo. In cohort 2, pregnant women were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive one injection at 28–35 weeks' gestation of 0·5 μg, 2·5 μg, or 5·0 μg of the non-adjuvanted investigational vaccine (for each serotype), or placebo. All study participants and study staff not involved with vaccine preparation were masked to the randomisation group. The vaccine contained an equal dose (0·5 μg, 2·5 μg, 5·0 μg, or 20 μg) of each of three glycoconjugates (serotypes Ia, Ib and III). Reactogenicity was monitored to day 7 and unsolicited adverse events (adverse events) and infant safety were recorded throughout the study. The primary outcomes were tolerability and GBS-specific antibody response (measured as geometric mean concentrations [GMCs] in μg/mL) following the two injections for cohort 1, and selection of one vaccine dose based on analysis of serotype-specific antibody responses at delivery (+72 h) for use in subsequent studies. These outcomes were assessed in participants or infants of participants who correctly received the study vaccine with no major protocol deviations, and provided evaluable serum samples at day 1 and the scheduled timepoints throughout the study. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01193920.
Findings
Between Oct 5, 2010, and Sept 21, 2011, we screened 75 non-pregnant and 417 pregnant healthy South African women. Of these, 60 non-pregnant women were enrolled in cohort 1 (40 randomly assigned to the GBS 20 μg group and 40 randomly assigned to the placebo group) and 320 pregnant women were enrolled in cohort 2 (80 in each of the four groups). Among the randomised groups of pregnant women, 33–40% experienced at least one local and 54–71% one systemic solicited adverse event, less than 4% of which were severe, and the rate did not differ by study group. Also, 2% of the pregnancies resulted in stillbirth and 3·5% of the liveborn babies died by 12 months age, none of these deaths were attributed to vaccination. There was one death in a GBS-vaccine recipient, which too was unrelated to vaccination. For cohort 1, serotype-specific antibody concentrations were significantly higher, as evident by no overlap of the 95% CIs of GMCs against all three serotypes in the vaccinated group than the placebo group. For cohort 2, pregnant women in all vaccine groups had significantly higher GMCs than did those in the placebo group at delivery (eg, GMCs against serotype Ia were 11 μg/mL [95% CI 7·0–18] for the GBS vaccine 0·5 μg group, 18 μg/mL [11–29] for the GBS vaccine 2·5 μg group, 22 μg/mL [13–35] for the GBS vaccine 5·0 μg group, and 0·64 μg/mL [0·42–0·98] for the placebo group) and at all measured timepoints. GMCs did not differ significantly between the vaccine doses at any of the measured timepoints (p>0·05).
Interpretation
The vaccine was well tolerated and induced capsular-specific antibody responses, in non-pregnant and pregnant women. Maternal vaccination led to higher GBS serotype-specific antibody concentrations in infants than did placebo, with both interventions resulting in similar safety profiles.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Mucormycosis is an uncommon invasive fungal disease with high mortality and few treatment options. Isavuconazole is a triazole active in vitro and in animal models against moulds of the order Mucorales. We assessed the efficacy and safety of isavuconazole for treatment of mucormycosis and compared its efficacy with amphotericin B in a matched case-control analysis.
Methods
In a single-arm open-label trial (VITAL study), adult patients (≥18 years) with invasive fungal disease caused by rare fungi, including mucormycosis, were recruited from 34 centres worldwide. Patients were given isavuconazole 200 mg (as its intravenous or oral water-soluble prodrug, isavuconazonium sulfate) three times daily for six doses, followed by 200 mg/day until invasive fungal disease resolution, failure, or for 180 days or more. The primary endpoint was independent data review committee-determined overall response—ie, complete or partial response (treatment success) or stable or progressive disease (treatment failure)—according to prespecified criteria. Mucormycosis cases treated with isavuconazole as primary treatment were matched with controls from the FungiScope Registry, recruited from 17 centres worldwide, who received primary amphotericin B-based treatment, and were analysed for day-42 all-cause mortality. VITAL is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00634049. FungiScope is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01731353.
Findings
Within the VITAL study, from April 22, 2008, to June 21, 2013, 37 patients with mucormycosis received isavuconazole for a median of 84 days (IQR 19–179, range 2–882). By day 42, four patients (11%) had a partial response, 16 (43%) had stable invasive fungal disease, one (3%) had invasive fungal disease progression, three (8%) had missing assessments, and 13 (35%) had died. 35 patients (95%) had adverse events (28 [76%] serious). Day-42 crude all-cause mortality in seven (33%) of 21 primary-treatment isavuconazole cases was similar to 13 (39%) of 33 amphotericin B-treated matched controls (weighted all-cause mortality: 33% vs 41%; p=0·595).
Interpretation
Isavuconazole showed activity against mucormycosis with efficacy similar to amphotericin B. Isavuconazole can be used for treatment of mucormycosis and is well tolerated.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The incidence of microcephaly in Brazil in 2015 was 20 times higher than in previous years. Congenital microcephaly is associated with genetic factors and several causative agents. Epidemiological data suggest that microcephaly cases in Brazil might be associated with the introduction of Zika virus. We aimed to detect and sequence the Zika virus genome in amniotic fluid samples of two pregnant women in Brazil whose fetuses were diagnosed with microcephaly.
Methods
In this case study, amniotic fluid samples from two pregnant women from the state of Paraíba in Brazil whose fetuses had been diagnosed with microcephaly were obtained, on the recommendation of the Brazilian health authorities, by ultrasound-guided transabdominal amniocentesis at 28 weeks' gestation. The women had presented at 18 weeks' and 10 weeks' gestation, respectively, with clinical manifestations that could have been symptoms of Zika virus infection, including fever, myalgia, and rash. After the amniotic fluid samples were centrifuged, DNA and RNA were extracted from the purified virus particles before the viral genome was identified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic reconstruction and investigation of recombination events were done by comparing the Brazilian Zika virus genome with sequences from other Zika strains and from flaviviruses that occur in similar regions in Brazil.
Findings
We detected the Zika virus genome in the amniotic fluid of both pregnant women. The virus was not detected in their urine or serum. Tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, HIV, Treponema pallidum, and parvovirus B19 were all negative. After sequencing of the complete genome of the Brazilian Zika virus isolated from patient 1, phylogenetic analyses showed that the virus shares 97–100% of its genomic identity with lineages isolated during an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013, and that in both envelope and NS5 genomic regions, it clustered with sequences from North and South America, southeast Asia, and the Pacific. After assessing the possibility of recombination events between the Zika virus and other flaviviruses, we ruled out the hypothesis that the Brazilian Zika virus genome is a recombinant strain with other mosquito-borne flaviviruses.
Interpretation
These findings strengthen the putative association between Zika virus and cases of microcephaly in neonates in Brazil. Moreover, our results suggest that the virus can cross the placental barrier. As a result, Zika virus should be considered as a potential infectious agent for human fetuses. Pathogenesis studies that confirm the tropism of Zika virus for neuronal cells are warranted.

abstract = "Summary
Background
WHO estimates that a third of the world's population has latent tuberculosis infection and that less than 5% of those infected are diagnosed and treated to prevent tuberculosis. We aimed to systematically review studies that report the steps from initial tuberculosis screening through to treatment for latent tuberculosis infection, which we call the latent tuberculosis cascade of care. We specifically aimed to assess the number of people lost at each stage of the cascade.
Methods
We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of study-level observational data. We searched MEDLINE (via OVID), Embase, and Health Star for observational studies, published between 1946 and April 12, 2015, that reported primary data for diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection. We did meta-analyses using random and fixed effects analyses to identify percentages of patients with latent tuberculosis infection completing each step in the cascade. We also estimated pooled proportions in subgroups stratified by different characteristics of interest to assess risk factors for losses.
Results
We identified 58 studies, describing 70 distinct cohorts and 748 572 people. Steps in the cascade associated with greater losses included completion of testing (71·9% [95% CI 71·8–72·0] of people intended for screening), completion of medical evaluation (43·7% [42·5–44·9]), recommendation for treatment (35·0% [33·8–36·4]), and completion of treatment if started (18·8% [16·3–19·7]). Steps with fewer losses included receiving test results, referral for evaluation if test positive, and accepting to start therapy if recommended. Factors associated with fewer losses were immune-compromising medical indications, being part of contact investigations, and use of rifamycin-based regimens.
Interpretation
We identify major losses at several steps in the cascade of care for latent tuberculosis infection. Improvements in management of latent tuberculosis will need programmatic approaches to address the losses at each step in the cascade.

In 1915, a British medical officer on the Western Front reported on a soldier with relapsing fever, headache, dizziness, lumbago, and shin pain. Within months, additional cases were described, mostly in frontline troops, and the new disease was called trench fever. More than 1 million troops were infected with trench fever during World War 1, with each affected soldier unfit for duty for more than 60 days. Diagnosis was challenging, because there were no pathognomonic signs and symptoms and the causative organism could not be cultured. For 3 years, the transmission and cause of trench fever were hotly debated. In 1918, two commissions identified that the disease was louse-borne. The bacterium Rickettsia quintana was consistently found in the gut and faeces of lice that had fed on patients with trench fever and its causative role was accepted in the 1920s. The organism was cultured in the 1960s and reclassified as Bartonella quintana; it was also found to cause endocarditis, peliosis hepatis, and bacillary angiomatosis. Subsequently, B quintana infection has been identified in new populations in the Andes, in homeless people in urban areas, and in individuals with HIV. The story of trench fever shows how war can lead to the recrudescence of an infectious disease and how medicine approached an emerging infection a century ago."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Although effective topical repellents provide personal protection against malaria, whether mass use of topical repellents in addition to long-lasting insecticidal nets can contribute to a further decline of malaria is not known, particularly in areas where outdoor transmission occurs. We aimed to assess the epidemiological efficacy of a highly effective topical repellent in addition to long-lasting insecticidal nets in reducing malaria prevalence in this setting.
Methods
A cluster randomised controlled trial was done in the 117 most endemic villages in Ratanakiri province, Cambodia, to assess the efficacy of topical repellents in addition to long-lasting insecticidal nets in controlling malaria in a low-endemic setting. We did a pre-trial assessment of village accessibility and excluded four villages because of their inaccessibility during the rainy season. Another 25 villages were grouped because of their proximity to each other, resulting in 98 study clusters (comprising either a single village or multiple neighbouring villages). Clusters were randomly assigned (1:1) to either a control (long-lasting insecticidal nets) or intervention (long-lasting insecticidal nets plus topical repellent) study group after a restricted randomisation. All clusters received one long-lasting insecticidal net per individual, whereas those in the intervention group also received safe and effective topical repellents (picaridin KBR3023, SC Johnson, Racine, WI, USA), along with instruction and promotion of its daily use. Cross-sectional surveys of 65 randomly selected individuals per cluster were done at the beginning and end of the malaria transmission season in 2012 and 2013. The primary outcome was Plasmodium species-specific prevalence in participants obtained by real-time PCR, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Complete safety analysis data will be published seperately; any ad-hoc adverse events are reported here. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01663831.
Findings
Of the 98 clusters that villages were split into, 49 were assigned to the control group and 49 were assigned to the intervention group. Despite having a successful distribution system, the daily use of repellents was suboptimum. No post-intervention differences in PCR plasmodium prevalence were observed between study groups in 2012 (4·91% in the control group vs 4·86% in the intervention group; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·01 [95% CI 0·60–1·70]; p=0·975) or in 2013 (2·96% in the control group vs 3·85% in the intervention group; aOR 1·31 [0·81–2·11]; p=0·266). Similar results were obtained according to Plasmodium species (1·33% of participants in the intervention group vs 1·10% in the intervention group were infected with Plasmodium falciparum; aOR 0·83 [0·44–1·56]; p=0·561; and 1·85% in the control group vs 2·67% in the intervention group were infected with Plasmodium vivax; aOR 1·51 [0·88–2·57]; p=0·133). 41 adverse event notifications from nine villages were received, of which 33 were classified as adverse reactions (11 of these 33 were cases of repellent abuse through oral ingestion, either accidental or not). All participants with adverse reactions fully recovered and 17 were advised to permanently stop using the repellent.
Interpretation
Mass distribution of highly effective topical repellents in resource-sufficient conditions did not contribute to a further decline in malaria endemicity in a pre-elimination setting in the Greater Mekong subregion. Daily compliance and appropriate use of the repellents remains the main obstacle.

Visceral leishmaniasis is a serious public health problem on the Indian subcontinent, causing high morbidity and mortality. The governments in the region launched a visceral leishmaniasis elimination initiative in 2005. We review knowledge gaps and research priorities. Key challenges include low coverage of health services for those most at risk, drug resistance, the absence of a vaccine, and the complex biology of the sandfly–human host transmission cycle. Vector control is an essential component, but innovation in this field is insufficient. Substantial progress has been made in the area of diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine development, but there are still many hurdles to overcome. For visceral leishmaniasis elimination to become a reality, effective deployment of these existing and new tools is essential. A strong commitment at community level is imperative, and appropriate diagnostic and treatment services as well as effective epidemiological surveillance need to be ensured."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Community-wide screening for tuberculosis with Xpert MTB/RIF as a primary screening tool overcomes some of the limitations of conventional screening. However, concerns exist about the low positive predictive value of this test in screening settings. We did a cross-sectional assessment of this diagnostic test to directly estimate the actual positive predictive value of Xpert MTB/RIF when used in the setting of community-wide screening for tuberculosis, and to draw an inference about the specificity of the test for tuberculosis detection.
Methods
Field staff visited households in 60 randomly selected villages in Ca Mau province, Vietnam. We included people aged 15 years or older who provided written informed consent and were able to produce 0·5 mL or more of sputum, irrespective of reported symptoms. Participants were tested with Xpert MTB/RIF, then those with positive results had two further sputum samples tested for smear microscopy and culture, and underwent chest radiography at the provincial TB Health Center. The positive predictive value of Xpert MTB/RIF was compared against two reference standards for tuberculosis diagnosis—a positive sputum culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and a positive sputum culture or a chest radiograph consistent with active pulmonary tuberculosis. We then calculated the specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF for tuberculosis detection on the basis of these positive predictive values and disease prevalence in this setting.
Findings
43 435 adults consented to screening with Xpert MTB/RIF. Sputum samples of 0·5 mL or greater were collected from 23 202 participants, producing 22 673 valid results. 169 participants had positive Xpert MTB/RIF results (0·39% of those screened and 0·75% of those with valid sputum results). The positive predictive value of Xpert MTB/RIF was 61·0% (95% CI 52·8–68·7) when compared against a positive sputum culture and 83·9% (76·8–89·2) when compared against a positive sputum culture or chest radiograph consistent with active tuberculosis. On the basis of these positive predictive values, the specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF was determined to be between 99·78% (95% CI 99·71–99·84) and 99·93% (99·88–99·96).
Interpretation
The positive predictive value and specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF in the context of community-wide screening for tuberculosis is substantially higher than that predicted in previous studies. Our findings support the potential role of Xpert MTB/RIF as a primary screening tool to detect prevalent cases of tuberculosis in the community.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Lyme borreliosis is the most common tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere. It is a multisystem disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies and characterised by tissue localisation and low spirochaetaemia. In this study we aimed to describe a novel Borrelia species causing Lyme borreliosis in the USA.
Methods
At the Mayo clinic, from 2003 to 2014, we tested routine clinical diagnostic specimens from patients in the USA with PCR targeting the oppA1 gene of B burgdorferi sensu lato. We identified positive specimens with an atypical PCR result (melting temperature outside of the expected range) by sequencing, microscopy, or culture. We collected Ixodes scapularis ticks from regions of suspected patient tick exposure and tested them by oppA1 PCR.
Findings
100 545 specimens were submitted by physicians for routine PCR from Jan 1, 2003 to Sept 30, 2014. From these samples, six clinical specimens (five blood, one synovial fluid) yielded an atypical oppA1 PCR product, but no atypical results were detected before 2012. Five of the six patients with atypical PCR results had presented with fever, four had diffuse or focal rash, three had symptoms suggestive of neurological inclusion, and two were admitted to hospital. The sixth patient presented with knee pain and swelling. Motile spirochaetes were seen in blood samples from one patient and cultured from blood samples from two patients. Among the five blood specimens, the median oppA1 copy number was 180 times higher than that in 13 specimens that tested positive for B burgdorferi sensu stricto during the same time period. Multigene sequencing identified the spirochaete as a novel B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies. This same genospecies was detected in ticks collected at a probable patient exposure site.
Interpretation
We describe a new pathogenic Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies (candidatus Borrelia mayonii) in the upper midwestern USA, which causes Lyme borreliosis with unusually high spirochaetaemia. Clinicians should be aware of this new B burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies, its distinct clinical features, and the usefulness of oppA1 PCR for diagnosis.

Background
Data about the response of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 5 to approved and experimental treatment regimens are scarce. We assessed the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir and the NS5B polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir in patients with HCV genotype 5.
Methods
We did this open-label, multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial at five hospitals in France. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old and had chronic infection with HCV genotype 5, with plasma HCV RNA of at least 10 000 IU/mL. We used BLAST analyses of NS5B partial sequences to establish the genotype and subtype at screening. Patients were given a fixed-dose combination tablet of 90 mg ledipasvir and 400 mg sofosbuvir orally once per day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a sustained viral response, defined as HCV RNA concentration less than 15 IU/mL at 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). We analysed efficacy and safety in all patients who received at least one dose of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2013-003978-27, and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02081079.
Findings
From March 7 to June 10, 2014, we recruited 41 patients, including 21 who were treatment naive and 20 who were treatment experienced. All patients were of white ethnic origins. All 41 patients who started treatment completed the full 12 weeks of treatment and had undetectable HCV RNA at their final treatment visit. In the overall study population, 39 (95%, 95% CI 83–99) of 41 patients achieved SVR12. SVR12 was achieved by 20 (95%, 76–100) of the 21 patients who were treatment naive and 19 (95%, 75–100) of the 20 patients who were treatment experienced. Eight (89%) of nine patients with cirrhosis achieved SVR12, whereas 31 (97%) of the 32 patients without cirrhosis achieved SVR12. The two patients who did not reach SVR12 both had IL28B TT genotype and had viral relapse within 4 weeks of the end of treatment. The most common adverse events were asthenia (16 [39%] patients), headache (11 [27%] patients), and fatigue (four [10%] patients). One patient had a serious adverse event, worsening depression, which we judged to be unrelated to study treatment.
Interpretation
The oral regimen of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with HCV genotype 5 infection who are treatment naive or treatment experienced.

Background
Antibiotics are used frequently in the neonatal intensive care unit. We aimed to inform antibiotic stewardship strategies in a level 3 neonatal intensive care unit by surveillance and assessment of all antibiotic use during a 14-month period, identifying scenarios where antibiotic use can be reduced, and implementing interventions while monitoring safety.
Methods
The SCOUT study is an observational study in the level 3 neonatal intensive care unit at Parkland Hospital, Dallas, TX, USA. All antibiotic use in infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit between March 1, 2012, and Nov 30, 2012 (9 months), was monitored and analysed. After the baseline period (Oct 3, 2011, to Nov 30, 2012), continuation of empirical antibiotic therapy for ruled-out sepsis courses beyond 48 h, pneumonia, and “culture-negative” sepsis were selected as targets for antibiotic stewardship interventions. During the intervention period (Oct 1, 2013, to June 30, 2014), empirical antibiotic therapy was set to discontinue after 48 h in the electronic medical record and the duration of therapy for pneumonia and culture-negative sepsis was limited to 5 days. Antibiotic use, defined as days of therapy per 1000 patient-days, was compared between the baseline and intervention periods. The primary outcome was the change in total antibiotic days of therapy per 1000 patient-days between the baseline and intervention periods. Safety outcomes measured were instances in which infants received 5 or more days of therapy and subsequently had antibiotic therapy reinstituted within 14 days for any indication; a composite of late-onset sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis (modified Bell stage ≥2), or death in infants 32 weeks' gestation or younger; prevalence of multidrug-resistant organism colonisation; and length of hospital stay.
Findings
2502 infants were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit during the two study periods (1607 in the baseline period and 895 in the intervention period). Antibiotic use declined from 343·2 days of therapy per 1000 patient-days during the baseline period to 252·2 days of therapy per 1000 patient-days in the intervention period (p<0·0001), representing an overall decrease of 27%. No difference in safety outcomes was observed between the intervention and baseline periods.
Interpretation
Thorough assessment of antibiotic consumption in a neonatal intensive care unit can inform high-yield stewardship targets tailored to the individual centre. Effective interventions to reduce antibiotic use can then be designed and implemented in a collaborative manner.

Background
Reduced gestational age and low birthweight are associated with an increased risk of neonatal infections. However, the long-term risk of infection, especially in late preterm infants or those at near-normal birthweight, is unknown. We estimated whether rates of infection-related admissions to hospital for children in Western Australia were associated with age, gestational age, birthweight, and birth length.
Methods
We did a population-based, data-linkage study using total-linked, registry data from the Western Australia Birth Register of all liveborn, non-Indigenous Australian singleton births recorded from Jan 1, 1980, to Dec 31, 2010. We followed up individuals from birth-related hospital discharge to age 18 years, death, or end of 2010, and linked to data about subsequent admissions to hospital or death registrations. Gestational age was assessed from both the last menstrual period and from estimates based on ultrasonography. We categorised birthweight by 500 g bands and birth length by 5 cm bands, and approximated the reference ranges for both to the 50th percentile. Because size at birth and gestational age are strongly associated, we calculated Z scores for gestational-specific and sex-specific birthweight, birth length, and ponderal index. Our primary outcomes were the number and type of infection-related admissions to hospital. We used multilevel negative binomial regression to generate rate ratios (RR) for such admissions, identified by codes from the International Classification of Diseases, versions 9 and 10-AM. We adjusted the RRs for maternal age at delivery, birth year, birth season, parity, sex, 5-min Apgar score, delivery method, socioeconomic status, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
Findings
Of 719 311 liveborn singletons included in the analysis and followed up for 8 824 093 person-years, 365 867 infection-related admissions to hospital occurred for 213 683 (30%) children. Of the 719 311 children included in the analysis, 137 124 (19%) had one infection-related admission to hospital, 43 796 (6%) had two, 16 679 (2%) had three, and 16 084 (2%) had four or more. The 365 867 admissions to hospital included a diagnosis of infection of the upper respiratory tract for 174 653 (48%), the lower respiratory tract for 74 297 (20%), the gastrointestinal tract for 44 755 (12%), and a viral infection for 37 213 (10%). Infection-related rates of admissions to hospital increased by 12% for each week reduction in gestational age less than 39–40 weeks (RR 1·12, 95% CI 1·12–1·13), by 19% for each 500 g reduction in birthweight less than 3000–3500 g (1·19, 1·18–1·21), and by 41% for each 5 cm reduction in birth length less than 45–50 cm (1·41, 1·38–1·45). Gestational age-specific and sex-specific birthweight Z scores lower than the 25th to 50th percentile and birth length Z scores lower than the 10th to 25th percentile were associated with increased rates of infection-related admissions to hospital (eg, 1st–5th percentile RR 1·15, 95% CI 1·12–1·19, and 1·11, 1·07–1·14, respectively). Ponderal index Z scores lower than the 25th to 50th percentile were also associated with increased rates of infection-related admissions (eg, 1st–5th percentile RR 1·08, 95% CI 1·04–1·12). A gestational age of 41 weeks or later, a birthweight or birth length Z score above the 50th percentile, or a ponderal index Z score between the 75th and 95th percentile, were associated with modestly reduced rates of infection-related admissions to hospital.
Interpretation
Children who were born with reduced gestational age, birthweight, and birth length have persistently increased rates of infection-related admissions to hospital until age 18 years. Pregnancy outcomes should be optimised to prevent infection occurring in this population, especially in resource-limited settings where suboptimum intrauterine growth and moderate prematurity are common.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The most important risk factor for early-onset (babies younger than 7 days) invasive group B streptococcal disease is rectovaginal colonisation of the mother at delivery. We aimed to assess whether differences in colonisation drive regional differences in the incidence of early-onset invasive disease.
Methods
We did a systematic review of maternal group B streptococcus colonisation studies by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Pascal Biomed, WHOLIS, and African Index Medicus databases for studies published between January, 1997, and March 31, 2015, that reported the prevalence of group B streptococcus colonisation in pregnant women. We also reviewed reference lists of selected studies and contacted experts to identify additional studies. Prospective studies in which swabs were collected from pregnant women according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that used selective culture methods were included in the analyses. We calculated mean prevalence estimates (with 95% CIs) of maternal colonisation across studies, by WHO region. We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic and the Cochran Q test.
Findings
221 full-text articles were assessed, of which 78 studies that included 73 791 pregnant women across 37 countries met prespecified inclusion criteria. The estimated mean prevalence of rectovaginal group B streptococcus colonisation was 17·9% (95% CI 16·2–19·7) overall and was highest in Africa (22·4, 18·1–26·7) followed by the Americas (19·7, 16·7–22·7) and Europe (19·0, 16·1–22·0). Studies from southeast Asia had the lowest estimated mean prevalence (11·1%, 95% CI 6·8–15·3). Significant heterogeneity was noted across and within regions (all p≤0·005). Differences in the timing of specimen collection in pregnancy, selective culture methods, and study sample size did not explain the heterogeneity.
Interpretation
The country and regional heterogeneity in maternal group B streptococcus colonisation is unlikely to completely explain geographical variation in early-onset invasive disease incidence. The contribution of sociodemographic, clinical risk factor, and population differences in natural immunity need further investigation to understand these regional differences in group B streptococcus maternal colonisation and early-onset disease.

abstract = "Summary
Tuberculosis is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide, with 9·6 million cases and 1·5 million deaths reported in 2014. WHO estimates 480 000 cases of these were multidrug resistant (MDR). Less than half of patients who entered into treatment for MDR tuberculosis successfully completed that treatment, mainly due to high mortality and loss to follow-up. These in turn illustrate weaknesses in current treatment regimens and national tuberculosis programmes, coupled with operational treatment challenges. In this Review we provide an update on recent developments in the tuberculosis drug-development pipeline (including new and repurposed antimicrobials and host-directed drugs) as they are applied to new regimens to shorten and improve outcomes of tuberculosis treatment. Several new or repurposed antimicrobial drugs are in advanced trial stages for MDR tuberculosis, and two new antimicrobial drug candidates are in early-stage trials. Several trials to reduce the duration of therapy in MDR and drug-susceptible tuberculosis are ongoing. A wide range of candidate host-directed therapies are being developed to accelerate eradication of infection, prevent new drug resistance, and prevent permanent lung injury. As these drugs have been approved for other clinical indications, they are now ready for repurposing for tuberculosis in phase 2 clinical trials. We assess risks associated with evaluation of new treatment regimens, and highlight opportunities to advance tuberculosis research generally through regulatory innovation in MDR tuberculosis. Progress in tuberculosis-specific biomarkers (including culture conversion, PET and CT imaging, and gene expression profiles) can support this innovation. Several global initiatives now provide unique opportunities to tackle the tuberculosis epidemic through collaborative partnerships between high-income countries and middle-income and low-income countries for clinical trials training and research, allowing funders to coordinate several national and regional programmes for greatest overall effect."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Schistosomiasis is a snail-borne parasitic disease endemic in several tropical and subtropical countries. However, in the summer of 2013, an unexpected outbreak of urogenital schistosomiasis occurred in Corsica, with more than 120 local people or tourists infected. We used a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the epidemiology of urogenital schistosomiasis in Corsica, aiming to elucidate the origin of the outbreak.
Methods
We did parasitological and malacological surveys at nine potential sites of infection. With the snails found, we carried out snail–parasite compatibility experiments by exposing snails to schistosome larvae recovered from the urine of a locally infected Corsican patient. Genetic analysis of both mitochondrial (cox1) and nuclear (internal transcribed spacer) DNA data from the Schistosoma eggs or miracidia recovered from the infected patients was conducted to elucidate the epidemiology of this outbreak.
Findings
We identified two main infection foci along the Cavu River, with many Bulinus truncatus snails found in both locations. Of the 3544 snails recovered across all sites, none were naturally infected, but laboratory-based experimental infections confirmed their compatibility with the schistosomes isolated from patients. Molecular characterisation of 73 eggs or miracidia isolated from 12 patients showed infection with Schistosoma haematobium, S haematobium–Schistosoma bovis hybrids, and S bovis. Further sequence data analysis also showed that the Corsican schistosomes were closely related to those from Senegal in west Africa.
Interpretation
The freshwater swimming pools of the Cavu River harbour many B truncatus snails, which are capable of transmitting S haematobium-group schistosomes. Our molecular data suggest that the parasites were imported into Corsica by individuals infected in west Africa, specifically Senegal. Hybridisation between S haematobium and the cattle schistosome S bovis had a putative role in this outbreak, showing how easily and rapidly urogenital schistosomiasis can be introduced and spread into novel areas where Bulinus snails are endemic, and how hybridisation could increase the colonisation potential of schistosomes. Furthermore our results show the potential risk of schistosomiasis outbreaks in other European areas, warranting close monitoring and surveillance of all potential transmission foci.

abstract = "Summary
Despite extensive global efforts in the fight against killer infectious diseases, they still cause one in four deaths worldwide and are important causes of long-term functional disability arising from tissue damage. The continuing epidemics of tuberculosis, HIV, malaria, and influenza, and the emergence of novel zoonotic pathogens represent major clinical management challenges worldwide. Newer approaches to improving treatment outcomes are needed to reduce the high morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases. Recent insights into pathogen–host interactions, pathogenesis, inflammatory pathways, and the host's innate and acquired immune responses are leading to identification and development of a wide range of host-directed therapies with different mechanisms of action. Host-directed therapeutic strategies are now becoming viable adjuncts to standard antimicrobial treatment. Host-directed therapies include commonly used drugs for non-communicable diseases with good safety profiles, immunomodulatory agents, biologics (eg monoclonal antibodies), nutritional products, and cellular therapy using the patient's own immune or bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells. We discuss clinically relevant examples of progress in identifying host-directed therapies as adjunct treatment options for bacterial, viral, and parasitic infectious diseases."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Dengue is the most common arbovirus infection globally, but its burden is poorly quantified. We estimated dengue mortality, incidence, and burden for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.
Methods
We modelled mortality from vital registration, verbal autopsy, and surveillance data using the Cause of Death Ensemble Modelling tool. We modelled incidence from officially reported cases, and adjusted our raw estimates for under-reporting based on published estimates of expansion factors. In total, we had 1780 country-years of mortality data from 130 countries, 1636 country-years of dengue case reports from 76 countries, and expansion factor estimates for 14 countries.
Findings
We estimated an average of 9221 dengue deaths per year between 1990 and 2013, increasing from a low of 8277 (95% uncertainty estimate 5353–10 649) in 1992, to a peak of 11 302 (6790–13 722) in 2010. This yielded a total of 576 900 (330 000–701 200) years of life lost to premature mortality attributable to dengue in 2013. The incidence of dengue increased greatly between 1990 and 2013, with the number of cases more than doubling every decade, from 8·3 million (3·3 million–17·2 million) apparent cases in 1990, to 58·4 million (23·6 million–121·9 million) apparent cases in 2013. When accounting for disability from moderate and severe acute dengue, and post-dengue chronic fatigue, 566 000 (186 000–1 415 000) years lived with disability were attributable to dengue in 2013. Considering fatal and non-fatal outcomes together, dengue was responsible for 1·14 million (0·73 million–1·98 million) disability-adjusted life-years in 2013.
Interpretation
Although lower than other estimates, our results offer more evidence that the true symptomatic incidence of dengue probably falls within the commonly cited range of 50 million to 100 million cases per year. Our mortality estimates are lower than those presented elsewhere and should be considered in light of the totality of evidence suggesting that dengue mortality might, in fact, be substantially higher.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In survivors of Ebola virus disease, clinical sequelae including uveitis, arthralgia, and fatigue are common and necessitate systematic follow-up. However, the infection risk to health-care providers is poorly defined. Here we report Ebola virus RT-PCR data for body site and fluid samples from a large cohort of Ebola virus survivors at clinic follow-up.
Methods
In this cross-sectional cohort study, consecutive survivors of Ebola virus disease attending Kerry Town survivor clinic (Freetown, Sierra Leone), who had been discharged from the Kerry Town Ebola treatment unit, were invited to participate. We collected and tested axillary, blood, conjunctival, forehead, mouth, rectal, semen, urine, and vaginal specimens for presence of Ebola virus using RT-PCR. We regarded samples to be positive for Ebola virus disease if the cycle threshold was 40 or lower. We collected demographic data from survivors of their age, sex, time since discharge from the treatment unit, and length of acute admission in the Ebola treatment unit using anonymised standard forms.
Findings
Between April 2, and June 16, 2015, of 151 survivors of Ebola virus disease invited to participate, 112 (74%) provided consent. The median age of participants was 21·5 years (IQR 14–31·5) with 34 (30%) participants younger than 16 years. 50 (45%) of 112 participants were male. We tested a total of 555 specimens: 103 from the axilla, 93 from blood, 92 from conjunctiva, 54 from forehead, 105 from mouth, 17 from the rectum, one from semen, 69 from urine, and 21 from the vagina. The median time from Ebola treatment unit discharge to specimen collection was 142 days (IQR 127–159). 15 participants had a total of 74 swabs taken less than 100 days from discharge. The semen sample from one participant tested positive for Ebola virus at 114 days after discharge from the treatment unit; specimens taken from the axilla, blood, conjunctiva, forehead, mouth, rectum, and urine of the same participant tested negative. All specimens from the other 111 participants tested negative.
Interpretation
Patients recovering from Ebola virus disease who do not meet the case definition for acute disease pose a low infection risk to health-care providers 6 weeks after clearance of viraemia. Personal protective equipment after this time might be limited to standard barrier precautions, unless contact with fluids from sanctuary sites is envisaged.

Background
Carbapenems are frequently the last line of defence in serious infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, but their use is threatened by the growing prevalence of carbapenemase-producing pathogens. Ceftazidime-avibactam is a potential new agent for use in such infections. We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ceftazidime-avibactam compared with best available therapy in patients with complicated urinary tract infection or complicated intra-abdominal infection due to ceftazidime-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.
Methods
REPRISE was a pathogen-directed, international, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial that recruited patients from hospitals across 16 countries worldwide. Eligible patients were aged 18–90 years with complicated urinary tract infection or complicated intra-abdominal infection caused by ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients were randomised (1:1) to 5–21 days of treatment with either ceftazidime-avibactam (a combination of 2000 mg ceftazidime plus 500 mg avibactam, administered via a 2-h intravenous infusion every 8 h) or best available therapy. The primary endpoint was clinical response at the test-of-cure visit, 7–10 days after last infusion of study therapy, analysed in all patients who had at least one ceftazidime-resistant Gram-negative pathogen, as confirmed by the central laboratory, and who received at least one dose of study drug. Safety endpoints were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01644643.
Findings
Between Jan 7, 2013, and Aug 29, 2014, 333 patients were randomly assigned, 165 to ceftazidime-avibactam and 168 to best available therapy. Of these, 154 assigned to ceftazidime-avibactam (144 with complicated urinary tract infection and ten with complicated intra-abdominal infection) and 148 assigned to best available therapy (137 with complicated urinary tract infection and 11 with complicated intra-abdominal infection) were analysed for the primary outcome. 163 (97%) of 168 patients in the best available therapy group received a carbapenem, 161 (96%) as monotherapy. The overall proportions of patients with a clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit were similar with ceftazidime-avibactam (140 [91%; 95% CI 85·6–94·7] of 154 patients) and best available therapy (135 [91%; 85·9–95·0] of 148 patients). 51 (31%) of 164 patients in the ceftazidime-avibactam group and 66 (39%) of 168 in the best available therapy group had an adverse event, most of which were mild or moderate in intensity. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events with both ceftazidime-avibactam (21 [13%] of 164 patients) and best available therapy (30 [18%] of 168 patients). No new safety concerns were identified for ceftazidime-avibactam.
Interpretation
These results provide evidence of the efficacy of ceftazidime-avibactam as a potential alternative to carbapenems in patients with ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and P aeruginosa.

Schistosomiasis remains an important public health issue, with a large number of cases reported across sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of Asia and Latin America. China was once highly endemic, but has made substantial progress and is moving towards elimination of schistosomiasis. Meanwhile, despite long-term, repeated, school-based chemotherapy in many African countries, more than 90% of all schistosomiasis cases are concentrated in Africa, and hence, this continent constitutes the key challenge for schistosomiasis control. Opportunities and issues for international collaboration in the fight against schistosomiasis are outlined with a focus on China's experiences, including the role of public health authorities and intersectoral collaboration, use of new and effective snail control approaches and diagnostic tools adapted to the specific stage of control, as well as the strengthening of risk mapping and surveillance-response mechanisms. Training courses targeting African governmental officials and professionals, coupled with field visits of African scientists and control programme managers to China, and vice versa, are considered important for improved schistosomiasis control and elimination. The crucial question remains whether the Chinese experience can be translated and applied in African countries to improve the effectiveness of health interventions and scale-up."

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral cause of pneumonia in early childhood (ie, younger than 2 years), responsible for high infant morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is widely accepted that an effective vaccine against RSV would have a major impact on child health globally. Despite the setbacks of the clinical trials in the 1960s, there has been a recent and significant revival of interest in vaccines against RSV, with several promising candidates undergoing evaluation. In this Review, we describe the epidemiological and immunological background to RSV infection and subsequently focus on the promising pipeline of RSV vaccine development. We discuss the potential for implementation of a safe and immunogenic RSV vaccine within the context of global health and with regards to a range of strategies, including vaccination of women during pregnancy, which is likely to emerge as a beneficial and feasible public health tool. This approach would provide interim protection to vulnerable, RSV-naive infants and other high risk groups, in which the burden of admission to hospital and death is greatest. Extending research and implementation from resource-rich to resource-poor settings is required to enhance our understanding of RSV immunity and inform vaccine development and delivery strategies for all settings. We summarise key outstanding issues for researchers and policy makers to understand the interplay of biological and non-biological factors affecting design and distribution of a successful RSV vaccine globally."

abstract = "Summary
Background
WHO recommends combinations of an artemisinin derivative plus an antimalarial drug of longer half-life as treatment options for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infection. In Africa, artemether–lumefantrine is the most widely used artemisinin-based combination therapy, whereas artesunate–mefloquine is used infrequently because of a perceived poor tolerance to mefloquine. WHO recommends reconsideration of the use of artesunate–mefloquine in Africa. We compared the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose artesunate–mefloquine with that of artemether–lumefantrine for treatment of children younger than 5 years with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria.
Methods
We did this multicentre, phase 4, open-label, non-inferiority trial in Burkina Faso, Kenya, and Tanzania. Children aged 6–59 months with uncomplicated malaria were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation list, to receive 3 days' treatment with either one or two artesunate–mefloquine tablets (25 mg artesunate and 55 mg mefloquine) once a day or one or two artemether–lumefantrine tablets (20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine) twice a day.

The primary outcome was the PCR-corrected rate of adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at day 63 in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority was shown if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference between groups was greater than −5%. Early vomiting was monitored and neuropsychiatric status assessed regularly during follow-up. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN17472707, and the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, number PACTR201202000278282.
Findings
945 children were enrolled and randomised, 473 to artesunate–mefloquine and 472 to artemether–lumefantrine. The per-protocol population consisted of 407 children in each group. The PCR-corrected ACPR rate at day 63 was 90·9% (370 patients) in the artesunate–mefloquine group and 89·7% (365 patients) in the artemether–lumefantrine group (treatment difference 1·23%, 95% CI −2·84% to 5·29%). At 72 h after the start of treatment, no child had detectable parasitaemia and less than 6% had fever, with a similar number in each group (21 in the artesunate–mefloquine group vs 24 in the artemether–lumefantrine group). The safety profiles of artesunate–mefloquine and artemether–lumefantrine were similar, with low rates of early vomiting (71 [15·3%] of 463 patients in the artesunate–mefloquine group vs 79 [16·8%] of 471 patients in the artemether–lumefantrine group in any of the three dosing days), few neurological adverse events (ten [2·1%] of 468 vs five [1·1%] of 465), and no detectable psychiatric adverse events.
Interpretation
Artesunate–mefloquine is effective and safe, and an important treatment option, for children younger than 5 years with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in Africa.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Little information is available about the effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in low-income countries. We measured the effect of these vaccines on invasive pneumococcal disease in The Gambia where the 7-valent vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in August, 2009, followed by the 13-valent vaccine (PCV13) in May, 2011.
Methods
We conducted population-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease in individuals aged 2 months and older who were residents of the Basse Health and Demographic Surveillance System (BHDSS) in the Upper River Region, The Gambia, using standardised criteria to identify and investigate patients. Surveillance was done between May, 2008, and December, 2014. We compared the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease between baseline (May 12, 2008–May 11, 2010) and after the introduction of PCV13 (Jan 1, 2013–Dec 31, 2014), adjusting for changes in case ascertainment over time.
Findings
We investigated 14 650 patients, in whom we identified 320 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease. Compared with baseline, after the introduction of the PCV programme, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease decreased by 55% (95% CI 30–71) in the 2–23 months age group, from 253 to 113 per 100 000 population. This decrease was due to an 82% (95% CI 64–91) reduction in serotypes covered by the PCV13 vaccine. In the 2–4 years age group, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease decreased by 56% (95% CI 25–75), from 113 to 49 cases per 100 000, with a 68% (95% CI 39–83) reduction in PCV13 serotypes. The incidence of non-PCV13 serotypes in children aged 2–59 months increased by 47% (−21 to 275) from 28 to 41 per 100 000, with a broad range of serotypes. The incidence of non-pneumococcal bacteraemia varied little over time.
Interpretation
The Gambian PCV programme reduced the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in children aged 2–59 months by around 55%. Further surveillance is needed to ascertain the maximum effect of the vaccine in the 2–4 years and older age groups, and to monitor serotype replacement. Low-income and middle-income countries that introduce PCV13 can expect substantial reductions in invasive pneumococcal disease.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The licensed live, attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine prevents herpes zoster in adults older than 50 years. We aimed to determine whether intradermal administration of zoster vaccine could enhance vaccine immunogenicity compared with conventional needle subcutaneous administration.
Methods
In this randomised, dose-ranging study, adults aged 50 years or older who had a history of varicella or who had resided in a country with endemic varicella-zoster virus infection for 30 years or more were eligible. Participants received the approved full or a 1/3 dose of zoster vaccine given subcutaneously or one of four intradermal doses (full, 1/3, 1/10, or 1/27 dose) using the MicronJet600 device. The two subcutaneous doses and the four intradermal doses were randomised (1·5:1:1:1:1:1) by computer generated sequence with randomisation stratified by age (50–59 years or 60 years or older). The primary immunogenicity endpoint was the change from baseline in IgG antibody to varicella-zoster virus-specific glycoproteins (gpELISA) measured at 6 weeks. All patients were included in the primary and safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01385566.
Findings
Between Sept 2, 2011, and Jan 13, 2012, 224 participants were enrolled from three clinics in the USA and 223 were randomly assigned: 52 to receive the full dose subcutaneous zoster vaccine, 34 to receive the 1/3 dose subcutaneous zoster vaccine, 34 to receive the full dose intradermal zoster vaccine, 35 to receive the 1/3 dose intradermal zoster vaccine, 34 to receive the 1/10 dose intradermal zoster vaccine, and 34 to receive the 1/27 dose intradermal zoster vaccine. Full dose zoster vaccine given subcutaneously resulted in a gpELISA geometric mean fold-rise (GMFR) of 1·74 (90% CI 1·48–2·04) at 6 weeks post-vaccination compared with intradermal administration which resulted in a significantly higher gpELISA GMFR of 3·25 (2·68–3·94; p<0·0001), which also remained high at 18 months. An apparent dose–response relation was observed with intradermal administration (1/3 dose subcutaneous GMFR 1·64 [90% CI 1·36–1·99], 1/3 dose intradermal 2·58 (2·13–3·13), 1/10 dose intradermal 2·22 [1·83–2·69], and 1/27 dose intradermal 1·64 [1·35–2·00]). Each partial dose of zoster vaccine given intradermaly had a gpELISA GMFR comparable to that of full dose zoster vaccine given subcutaneously. Transient erythema and induration were more common after intradermal administration (31% erythema for full subcutaneous dose and 77% for intradermal dose).
Interpretation
Intradermal zoster vaccine showed a greater increase in varicella-zoster virus gpELISA antibody compared with subcutaneous zoster vaccine at comparable doses. Larger and longer studies of intradermal administration of live, attenuated zoster vaccine are needed to provide convincing evidence of improved cell mediated immunity.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Dengue is a serious global burden. Unreported and unrecognised apparent dengue virus infections make it difficult to estimate the true extent of dengue and current estimates of the incidence and costs of dengue have substantial uncertainty. Objective, systematic, comparable measures of dengue burden are needed to track health progress, assess the application and financing of emerging preventive and control strategies, and inform health policy. We estimated the global economic burden of dengue by country and super-region (groups of epidemiologically similar countries).
Methods
We used the latest dengue incidence estimates from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 and several other data sources to assess the economic burden of symptomatic dengue cases in the 141 countries and territories with active dengue transmission. From the scientific literature and regressions, we estimated cases and costs by setting, including the non-medical setting, for all countries and territories.
Findings
Our global estimates suggest that in 2013 there were a total of 58·40 million symptomatic dengue virus infections (95% uncertainty interval [95% UI] 24 million–122 million), including 13 586 fatal cases (95% UI 4200–34 700), and that the total annual global cost of dengue illness was US$8·9 billion (95% UI 3·7 billion–19·7 billion). The global distribution of dengue cases is 18% admitted to hospital, 48% ambulatory, and 34% non-medical.
Interpretation
The global cost of dengue is substantial and, if control strategies could reduce dengue appreciably, billions of dollars could be saved globally. In estimating dengue costs by country and setting, this study contributes to the needs of policy makers, donors, developers, and researchers for economic assessments of dengue interventions, particularly with the licensure of the first dengue vaccine and promising developments in other technologies.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antimicrobial stewardship is advocated to improve the quality of antimicrobial use. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether antimicrobial stewardship objectives had any effects in hospitals and long-term care facilities on four predefined patients' outcomes: clinical outcomes, adverse events, costs, and bacterial resistance rates.
Methods
We identified 14 stewardship objectives and did a separate systematic search for articles relating to each one in Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, and PubMed. Studies were included if they reported data on any of the four predefined outcomes in patients in whom the specific antimicrobial stewardship objective was assessed and compared the findings in patients in whom the objective was or was not met. We used a random-effects model to calculate relative risk reductions with relative risks and 95% CIs.
Findings
We identified 145 unique studies with data on nine stewardship objectives. Overall, the quality of evidence was generally low and heterogeneity between studies was mostly moderate to high. For the objectives empirical therapy according to guidelines, de-escalation of therapy, switch from intravenous to oral treatment, therapeutic drug monitoring, use of a list of restricted antibiotics, and bedside consultation the overall evidence showed significant benefits for one or more of the four outcomes. Guideline-adherent empirical therapy was associated with a relative risk reduction for mortality of 35% (relative risk 0·65, 95% CI 0·54–0·80, p<0·0001) and for de-escalation of 56% (0·44, 0·30–0·66, p<0·0001). Evidence of effects was less clear for adjusting therapy according to renal function, discontinuing therapy based on lack of clinical or microbiological evidence of infection, and having a local antibiotic guide. We found no reports for the remaining five stewardship objectives or for long-term care facilities.
Interpretation
Our findings of beneficial effects on outcomes with nine antimicrobial stewardship objectives suggest they can guide stewardship teams in their efforts to improve the quality of antibiotic use in hospitals.

Antibiotics have saved countless lives and enabled the development of modern medicine over the past 70 years. However, it is clear that the success of antibiotics might only have been temporary and we now expect a long-term and perhaps never-ending challenge to find new therapies to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A broader approach to address bacterial infection is needed. In this Review, we discuss alternatives to antibiotics, which we defined as non-compound approaches (products other than classic antibacterial agents) that target bacteria or any approaches that target the host. The most advanced approaches are antibodies, probiotics, and vaccines in phase 2 and phase 3 trials. This first wave of alternatives to antibiotics will probably best serve as adjunctive or preventive therapies, which suggests that conventional antibiotics are still needed. Funding of more than £1·5 billion is needed over 10 years to test and develop these alternatives to antibiotics. Investment needs to be partnered with translational expertise and targeted to support the validation of these approaches in phase 2 trials, which would be a catalyst for active engagement and investment by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. Only a sustained, concerted, and coordinated international effort will provide the solutions needed for the future."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Understanding the amount of tuberculosis managed by the private sector in India is crucial to understanding the true burden of the disease in the country, and thus globally. In the absence of quality surveillance data on privately treated patients, commercial drug sales data offer an empirical foundation for disease burden estimation.
Methods
We used a large, nationally representative commercial dataset on sales of 189 anti-tuberculosis products available in India to calculate the amount of anti-tuberculosis treatment in the private sector in 2013–14. We corrected estimates using validation studies that audited prescriptions against tuberculosis diagnosis, and estimated uncertainty using Monte Carlo simulation. To address implications for numbers of patients with tuberculosis, we explored varying assumptions for average duration of tuberculosis treatment and accuracy of private diagnosis.
Findings
There were 17·793 million patient-months (95% credible interval 16·709 million to 19·841 million) of anti-tuberculosis treatment in the private sector in 2014, twice as many as the public sector. If 40–60% of private-sector tuberculosis diagnoses are correct, and if private-sector tuberculosis treatment lasts on average 2–6 months, this implies that 1·19–5·34 million tuberculosis cases were treated in the private sector in 2014 alone. The midpoint of these ranges yields an estimate of 2·2 million cases, two to three times higher than currently assumed.
Interpretation
India's private sector is treating an enormous number of patients for tuberculosis, appreciably higher than has been previously recognised. Accordingly, there is a re-doubled need to address this burden and to strengthen surveillance. Tuberculosis burden estimates in India and worldwide require revision.

Sound health policy puts patients first. Antiviral regimens approved in 2014 revolutionised treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Most patients can now be cured. These new regimens, however, were priced at US$83 320–150 000 for a 3-month course. Public and private payers in the USA responded by limiting coverage to patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, keeping the drugs from being used to prevent those stages. These restrictions defy medical guidelines, lack scientific justification, and undermine public health efforts to stem transmission. Instead of reducing barriers to care, the system has erected new ones. As drug makers and payers battle over billions of dollars, the needs of patients have been cast aside. Physicians and governments have a duty to make sure health policy is driven by the needs of patients and public health. In this Personal View, I call upon these groups to lead the creation of a national consensus among all stakeholders that will allow the advances in therapeutics for HCV infection to be put to work to end the epidemic."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In critically ill patients, antibiotic therapy is of great importance but long duration of treatment is associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance. Procalcitonin is a marker used to guide antibacterial therapy and reduce its duration, but data about safety of this reduction are scarce. We assessed the efficacy and safety of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment in patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in a health-care system with a comparatively low use of antibiotics.
Methods
We did a prospective, multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label intervention trial in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands. Critically ill patients aged at least 18 years, admitted to the ICU, and who received their first dose of antibiotics no longer than 24 h before inclusion in the study for an assumed or proven infection were eligible to participate. Patients who received antibiotics for presumed infection were randomly assigned (1:1), using a computer-generated list, and stratified (according to treatment centre, whether infection was acquired before or during ICU stay, and dependent on severity of infection [ie, sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock]) to receive either procalcitonin-guided or standard-of-care antibiotic discontinuation. Both patients and investigators were aware of group assignment. In the procalcitonin-guided group, a non-binding advice to discontinue antibiotics was provided if procalcitonin concentration had decreased by 80% or more of its peak value or to 0·5 μg/L or lower. In the standard-of-care group, patients were treated according to local antibiotic protocols. Primary endpoints were antibiotic daily defined doses and duration of antibiotic treatment. All analyses were done by intention to treat. Mortality analyses were completed for all patients (intention to treat) and for patients in whom antibiotics were stopped while being on the ICU (per-protocol analysis). Safety endpoints were reinstitution of antibiotics and recurrent inflammation measured by C-reactive protein concentrations and they were measured in the population adhering to the stopping rules (per-protocol analysis). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01139489, and was completed in August, 2014.
Findings
Between Sept 18, 2009, and July 1, 2013, 1575 of the 4507 patients assessed for eligibility were randomly assigned to the procalcitonin-guided group (761) or to standard-of-care (785). In 538 patients (71%) in the procalcitonin-guided group antibiotics were discontinued in the ICU. Median consumption of antibiotics was 7·5 daily defined doses (IQR 4·0–12·7) in the procalcitonin-guided group versus 9·3 daily defined doses (5·0–16·6) in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 2·69, 95% CI 1·26–4·12, p<0·0001). Median duration of treatment was 5 days (3–9) in the procalcitonin-guided group and 7 days (4–11) in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 1·22, 0·65–1·78, p<0·0001). Mortality at 28 days was 149 (20%) of 761 patients in the procalcitonin-guided group and 196 (25%) of 785 patients in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 5·4%, 95% CI 1·2–9·5, p=0·0122) according to the intention-to-treat analysis, and 107 (20%) of 538 patients in the procalcitonin-guided group versus 121 (27%) of 457 patients in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 6·6%, 1·3–11·9, p=0·0154) in the per-protocol analysis. 1-year mortality in the per-protocol analysis was 191 (36%) of 538 patients in the procalcitonin-guided and 196 (43%) of 457 patients in the standard-of-care groups (between-group absolute difference 7·4, 1·3–13·8, p=0·0188).
Interpretation
Procalcitonin guidance stimulates reduction of duration of treatment and daily defined doses in critically ill patients with a presumed bacterial infection. This reduction was associated with a significant decrease in mortality. Procalcitonin concentrations might help physicians in deciding whether or not the presumed infection is truly bacterial, leading to more adequate diagnosis and treatment, the cornerstones of antibiotic stewardship.

As the massive outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in west Africa wanes, it has become increasingly clear that thousands of survivors have many sequelae, some of which might be very severe, such as arthritis and vision-threatening uveitis. The mental health effects of EVD on survivors and other family and community members is similarly profound. Furthermore, it is increasingly being recognised that Ebola virus might persist for weeks or months in selected body compartments of survivors, most notably in the semen of men, bringing risk of renewed transmission where it has previously been eliminated. These challenges to EVD survivors constitute a new emergency in terms of addressing individual patient need and to control the disease spread. In this Review, we assess what is known regarding the sequelae of EVD, including possible delayed virus clearance.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is the most clinically relevant species of this genus, known to cause both community-acquired and nosocomial infections worldwide. In the past two decades, a distinct hypervirulent strain of K pneumoniae, characterised by its hypermucoviscous phenotype, has emerged as a clinically significant pathogen responsible for highly invasive infections. We present a case of osteomyelitis due to hypervirulent K pneumoniae reported in the USA. Genomic testing of the K pneumoniae isolate was performed due to the striking clinical presentation of the infection as well as the hypermucoid nature of the isolates, raising the suspicion for possible infection with the hypervirulent strain. Whole-genome sequencing and additional PCR testing demonstrated the isolate to be a K1 serotype, sequence type 23 strain expressing rmpA and rmpA2. Given the multiple reports of this pathogen causing invasive infections, clinicians should be aware of the possible presentation of metastatic and severe infection, including osteomyelitis, due to the hypervirulent strain of K pneumoniae not typical of classic K pneumoniae variants. In this Grand Round, we review the clinical features of hypervirulent K pneumoniae and its link to invasive infections, and discuss the need for improved awareness and identification of the pathogen."

abstract = "Summary
Background
WHO guidelines recommend annual treatment for schistosomiasis or soil-transmitted helminthiasis when prevalence in school-aged children is at or above a threshold of 50% and 20%, respectively. Separate treatment guidelines are used for these two helminthiases, and integrated community-wide treatment is not recommended. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of changing prevalence thresholds and treatment guidelines under an integrated delivery framework.
Methods
We developed a dynamic, age-structured transmission and cost-effectiveness model that simulates integrated preventive chemotherapy programmes against schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis. We assessed a 5-year treatment programme with praziquantel (40 mg/kg per treatment) against schistosomiasis and albendazole (400 mg per treatment) against soil-transmitted helminthiasis at 75% coverage. We defined strategies as highly cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was less than the World Bank classification for a low-income country (gross domestic product of US$1045 per capita). We calculated the prevalence thresholds for cost-effective preventive chemotherapy of various strategies, and estimated treatment needs for sub-Saharan Africa.
Findings
Annual preventive chemotherapy against schistosomiasis was highly cost-effective in treatment of school-aged children at a prevalence threshold of 5% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1·7–5·2; current guidelines recommend treatment at 50% prevalence) and for community-wide treatment at a prevalence of 15% (7·3–18·5; current recommendation is unclear, some community treatment recommended at 50% prevalence). Annual preventive chemotherapy against soil-transmitted helminthiasis was highly cost-effective in treatment of school-aged children at a prevalence of 20% (95% UI 5·4–30·5; current guidelines recommend treatment at 20% prevalence) and the entire community at 60% (35·3–85·1; no guidelines available). When both helminthiases were co-endemic, prevalence thresholds using integrated delivery were lower. Using this revised treatment framework, we estimated that treatment needs would be six times higher than WHO guidelines for praziquantel and two times higher for albendazole. An additional 21·3% (95% Bayesian credible interval 20·4–22·2) of the population changed from receiving non-integrated treatment under WHO guidelines to integrated treatment (both praziquantel and albendazole). Country-specific economic differences resulted in heterogeneity around these prevalence thresholds.
Interpretation
Annual preventive chemotherapy programmes against schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis are likely to be highly cost-effective at prevalences lower than WHO recommendations. These findings support substantial treatment scale-up, community-wide coverage, integrated treatment in co-endemic settings that yield substantial cost synergies, and country-specific treatment guidelines.

Viral hepatitis affects millions of people worldwide, and host immunity is the key determinant of patient outcome. Viral hepatitis can be life threatening in patients with haematological malignancy, including haemopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, because of the virus itself, or through a need to decrease the dose of chemotherapy. A past or currently infected haemopoietic stem cell donor could also transmit viral hepatitis. The burden of viral hepatitis in patients with haematological malignancies and the weak evidence on which previous guidelines are based has prompted the European Conference on Infection in Leukaemia (ECIL-5) to convene a group of experts in the fields of viral hepatitis and of haematological malignancy to specifically address previously unconsidered issues and grade the available quality of evidence according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America grading system. The group recommends that all patients should be screened for hepatotropic viruses before haematological treatment and that patients or haemopoietic stem cell donors with markers of past or current viral hepatitis should be assessed by an expert. Screening, vaccination, and treatment rules are reported in this Review."

abstract = "Summary
Aspergillus fumigatus causes a range of diseases in human beings, some of which are characterised by fungal persistence. A fumigatus can persist by adapting to the human lung environment through physiological and genomic changes. The physiological changes are based on the large biochemical versatility of the fungus, and the genomic changes are based on the capacity of the fungus to generate genetic diversity by spontaneous mutations or recombination and subsequent selection of the genotypes that are most adapted to the new environment. In this Review, we explore the adaptation strategies of A fumigatus in relation to azole resistance selection and the clinical implications thereof for management of diseases caused by Aspergillus spp. We hypothesise that the current diagnostic tools and treatment strategies do not take into account the biology of the fungus and might result in an increased likelihood of fungal persistence in patients. Stress factors, such as triazole exposure, cause mutations that render resistance. The process of reproduction—ie, sexual, parasexual, or asexual—is probably crucial for the adaptive potential of Aspergillus spp. As any change in the environment can provoke adaptation, switching between triazoles in patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis might result in a high-level pan-triazole-resistant phenotype through the accumulation of resistance mutations. Alternatively, when triazole therapy is stopped, an azole-free environment is created that could prompt selection for compensatory mutations that overcome any fitness costs that are expected to accompany resistance development. As a consequence, starting, switching, and stopping azole therapy has the risk of selecting for highly resistant strains with wildtype fitness. A similar adaptation is expected to occur in response to other stress factors, such as endogenous antimicrobial peptides; over time the fungus will become increasingly adapted to the lung environment, thereby limiting the probability of eradication. Our hypothesis challenges current management strategies, and future research should investigate the genomic dynamics during infection to understand the key factors facilitating adaptation of Aspergillus spp."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Treatment options are limited for patients infected by hepatitis C virus (HCV) with advanced liver disease. We assessed the safety and efficacy of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin in patients with HCV genotype 1 or 4 and advanced liver disease.
Methods
We did an open-label study at 34 sites in Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Cohort A included patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B (CTP-B) or CTP-C cirrhosis who had not undergone liver transplantation. Cohort B included post-transplantation patients who had either no cirrhosis; CTP-A, CTP-B, or CTP-C cirrhosis; or fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Patients in each group were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive 12 or 24 weeks of ledipasvir (90 mg) and sofosbuvir (400 mg) once daily (combination tablet), plus ribavirin (600–1200 mg daily). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a sustained virological response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12). All patients who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analysis and all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and did not undergo liver transplantation during treatment were included in the efficacy analyses. Estimates of SVR12 and relapse rates and their two-sided 90% CI (Clopper-Pearson method) were provided. This exploratory phase 2 study was not powered for formal comparisons among treatment groups; no statistical hypothesis testing was planned or conducted. The trial is registered with EudraCT (number 2013-002802-30) and ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT02010255).
Findings
Between Jan 14, 2014, and Aug 19, 2014, 398 patients were screened. Of 333 patients who received treatment, 296 had genotype 1 HCV and 37 had genotype 4 HCV. In cohort A, among patients with genotype 1 HCV, SVR12 was achieved by 20 (87%, 90% CI 70–96) of 23 CTP-B patients with 12 weeks of treatment; 22 (96%, 81–100) of 23 CTP-B patients with 24 weeks of treatment; 17 (85%, 66–96) of 20 CTP-C patients (12 weeks treatment); and 18 (78%, 60–91) of 23 CTP-C patients (24 weeks treatment). In cohort B, among patients with genotype 1 HCV, SVR12 was achieved by 42 (93%, 84–98) of 45 patients without cirrhosis (12 weeks treatment); 44 (100%, 93–100) of 44 patients without cirrhosis (24 weeks treatment); 30 (100%, 91–100) of 30 CTP-A patients (12 weeks treatment); 27 (96%, 84–100) of 28 CTP-A patients (24 weeks treatment); 19 (95%, 78–100) of 20 CTP-B patients (12 weeks treatment); 20 (100%, 86–100) of 20 CTP-B patients (24 weeks treatment); one (50%, 3–98) of two CTP-C patients (12 weeks treatment); and four (80%, 34–99) of five CTP-C patients (24 weeks treatment). All five patients with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis achieved SVR12 (100%, 90% CI 55–100). Among all patients with genotype 4 HCV, SVR12 was achieved by 14 (78%, 56–92) of 18 patients (12 weeks treatment) and 16 (94%, 75–100) of 17 patients (24 weeks treatment). Seven patients (2%) discontinued ledipasvir–sofosbuvir prematurely due to adverse events. 17 patients died, mainly from complications of hepatic decompensation.
Interpretation
Ledipasvir–sofosbuvir and ribavirin provided high rates of SVR12 for patients with advanced liver disease, including those with decompensated cirrhosis before or after liver transplantation.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Artemisinins, the most effective antimalarials available, are not recommended for falciparum malaria during the first trimester of pregnancy because of safety concerns. Therefore, quinine is used despite its poor effectiveness. Assessing artemisinin safety requires weighing the risks of malaria and its treatment. We aimed to assess the effect of first-trimester malaria and artemisinin treatment on miscarriage and major congenital malformations.
Methods
In this observational study, we assessed data from antenatal clinics on the Thai–Myanmar border between Jan 1, 1994, and Dec 31, 2013. We included women who presented to antenatal clinics during their first trimester with a viable fetus. Women were screened for malaria, and data on malaria, antimalarial treatment, and birth outcomes were collected. The relationship between artemisinin treatments (artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, or artemether) and miscarriage or malformation was assessed using Cox regression with left-truncation and time-varying exposures.
Findings
Of 55 636 pregnancies registered between 1994 and 2013, 25 485 pregnancies were analysed for first-trimester malaria and miscarriage, in which 2558 (10%) had first-trimester malaria. The hazard of miscarriage increased 1·61-fold after an initial first-trimester falciparum episode (95% CI 1·32–1·97; p<0·0001), 3·24-fold following falciparum recurrence (2·24–4·68; p<0·0001), and 2·44-fold (1·01–5·88; p=0·0473) following recurrent symptomatic vivax malaria. No difference was noted in miscarriage in first-line falciparum treatments with artemisinin (n=183) versus quinine (n=842; HR 0·78 [95% CI 0·45–1·34]; p=0·3645) or in risk of major congenital malformations (two [2%] of 109 [95% CI 0·22–6·47] versus eight (1%) of 641 [0·54–2·44], respectively).
Interpretation
First-trimester falciparum and vivax malaria both increase the risk of miscarriage. We noted no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or of major congenital malformations associated with first-line treatment with an artemisinin derivative compared with quinine. In view of the low efficacy of quinine and wide availability of highly effective artemisinin-based combination therapies, it is time to reconsider first-trimester antimalarial treatment recommendations.

Despite the life-saving ability of antibiotics and their importance as a key enabler of all of modern health care, their effectiveness is now threatened by a rising tide of resistance. Unfortunately, the antibiotic pipeline does not match health needs because of challenges in discovery and development, as well as the poor economics of antibiotics. Discovery and development are being addressed by a range of public–private partnerships; however, correcting the poor economics of antibiotics will need an overhaul of the present business model on a worldwide scale. Discussions are now converging on delinking reward from antibiotic sales through prizes, milestone payments, or insurance-like models in which innovation is rewarded with a fixed series of payments of a predictable size. Rewarding all drugs with the same payments could create perverse incentives to produce drugs that provide the least possible innovation. Thus, we propose a payment model using a graded array of benchmarked rewards designed to encourage the development of antibiotics with the greatest societal value, together with appropriate worldwide access to antibiotics to maximise human health."

1 million cases of tetanus are estimated to occur worldwide each year, with more than 200 000 deaths. Tetanus is a life-threatening but preventable disease caused by a toxin produced by Clostridium tetani—a Gram-positive bacillus found in high concentrations in soil and animal excrement. Tetanus is almost completely preventable by active immunisation, but very rarely unexpected cases can occur in individuals who have been previously vaccinated. We report a case of generalised tetanus in a 22-year-old woman that arose despite the protective antitoxin antibody in her serum. The patient received all her vaccinations in the USA; her last vaccination was 6 years ago. The case was unusual because the patient had received all standard vaccinations, had no defined port of entry at disease onset, and had symptoms lasting for 6 months. Tetanus can present with unusual clinical forms; therefore, the diagnosis and management of this rare but difficult disease should be updated. In this Grand Round, we review the clinical features, epidemiology, treatment, and prognosis of C tetani infections."

Background
Little is known about the possible adverse effects of dengue infection during pregnancy on fetal outcomes. In this systematic review and meta-analysis we aimed to estimate the increase in risk of four adverse fetal outcomes in women who had dengue infection during pregnancy.
Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Medline, Embase, Global Health Library, and Scopus for articles published before Aug 1, 2015. We included original studies that reported any fetal outcomes for pregnant women who had dengue infection during the gestational period. Case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies and unselected case series were eligible for inclusion. We excluded case reports, ecological studies, reviews, in-vitro studies, and studies without data for pregnancy outcomes. We independently screened titles and abstracts to select papers for inclusion and scored the quality of those included in meta-analyses. For each study, we recorded study design, year of publication, study location, period of study, and authors and we extracted data for population characteristics such as the number of pregnancies, dengue diagnostic information, and the frequency of outcomes. We investigated four adverse fetal outcomes: stillbirth, miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birthweight. We estimated the increase in risk of these adverse fetal outcomes by use of Mantel-Haenszel methods. We assessed heterogeneity of odds ratios (OR) with the I2 statistic.
Findings
We identified 278 non-duplicate records, of which 107 full-text articles were screened for eligibility. 16 studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review and eight were eligible for the meta-analyses, which included 6071 pregnant women, 292 of whom were exposed to dengue during pregnancy. For miscarriage, the OR was 3·51 (95% CI 1·15–10·77, I2=0·0%, p=0·765) for women with dengue infection during pregnancy compared with those without. We did not do a meta-analysis for stillbirth because this outcome was investigated in only one study with a comparison group; we calculated the crude relative risk to be 6·7 (95% CI 2·1–21·3) in women with symptomatic dengue compared with women without dengue. Preterm birth and low birthweight were the most common adverse pregnancy outcomes. The OR for the association with dengue was 1·71 (95% CI 1·06–2·76, I2=56·1%, p=0·058) for preterm birth and 1·41 (95% CI 0·90–2·21, I2=0·0%, p=0·543) for low birthweight.
Interpretation
Evidence suggests that symptomatic dengue during pregnancy might be associated with fetal adverse outcomes. If confirmed, it would be important to monitor pregnancies during which dengue is diagnosed and to consider pregnant women in dengue control policies.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Worldwide, approximately 35 million individuals are infected with HIV; about 25 million of these live in sub-Saharan Africa. WHO proposes using treatment as prevention (TasP) to eliminate HIV. Treatment suppresses viral load, decreasing the probability an individual transmits HIV. The elimination threshold is one new HIV infection per 1000 individuals. Here, we test the hypothesis that TasP can substantially reduce epidemics and eliminate HIV. We estimate the impact of TasP, between 1996 and 2013, on the Danish HIV epidemic in men who have sex with men (MSM), an epidemic UNAIDS has identified as a priority for elimination.
Methods
We use a CD4-staged Bayesian back-calculation approach to estimate incidence, and the hidden epidemic (the number of HIV-infected undiagnosed MSM). To develop the back-calculation model, we use data from an ongoing nationwide population-based study: the Danish HIV Cohort Study.
Findings
Incidence, and the hidden epidemic, decreased substantially after treatment was introduced in 1996. By 2013, incidence was close to the elimination threshold: 1·4 (median, 95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 0·4–2·1) new HIV infections per 1000 MSM and there were only 617 (264–858) undiagnosed MSM. Decreasing incidence and increasing treatment coverage were highly correlated; a treatment threshold effect was apparent.
Interpretation
Our study is the first to show that TasP can substantially reduce a country's HIV epidemic, and bring it close to elimination. However, we have shown the effectiveness of TasP under optimal conditions: very high treatment coverage, and exceptionally high (98%) viral suppression rate. Unless these extremely challenging conditions can be met in sub-Saharan Africa, the WHO's global elimination strategy is unlikely to succeed.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) infection has an especially high prevalence in Japan. Transmission has been confirmed in infancy through breastfeeding; however, little is known about the epidemiological aspects of new HTLV-1 infections later in life. We aimed to estimate the nationwide annual number of new HTLV-1 infections among adolescents and adults in Japan.
Methods
In this retrospective cohort analysis, we assessed new HTLV-1 infections of repeat blood donors aged 16–69 years between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2006, in the Japanese Red Cross Blood Centres database. We used results of antibody tests done in repeat blood samples collected until Dec 31, 2011, to assess the number who seroconverted to HTLV-1. We calculated the incidence density by dividing the number of seroconverters by the number of person-years of follow-up, and then extrapolated densities to regional populations to estimate the annual number of new HTLV-1 infections.
Findings
We included 3 375 821 HTLV-1-seronegative blood donors (2 100 915 men and 1 274 906 women). Within a median follow-up of 4·5 years (IQR 2·3–5·8), 532 people (204 men and 328 women) had seroconverted. The incidence density was significantly higher in women (6·88 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI 6·17–7·66) than in men (2·29 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI 1·99–2·62; p<0·0001). The estimated annual number of new HTLV-1 infections was 4190 (95% CI 4064–4318) with 975 (914–1038) infections in men and 3215 (3104–3328) in women.
Interpretation
New HTLV-1 infections in adolescents and adults are an important public health concern in Japan and preventive strategies are needed to reduce new transmission.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary by type and subtype. Over the past decade, the test-negative design has emerged as a valid method for estimation of VE. In this design, VE is calculated as 100% × (1 – odds ratio) for vaccine receipt in influenza cases versus test-negative controls. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate VE by type and subtype.
Methods
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed and Embase from Jan 1, 2004, to March 31, 2015. Test-negative design studies of influenza VE were eligible if they enrolled outpatients on the basis of predefined illness criteria, reported subtype-level VE by season, used PCR to confirm influenza, and adjusted for age. We excluded studies restricted to hospitalised patients or special populations, duplicate reports, interim reports superseded by a final report, studies of live-attenuated vaccine, and studies of prepandemic seasonal vaccine against H1N1pdm09. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts to identify articles for full review. Discrepancies in inclusion and exclusion criteria and VE estimates were adjudicated by consensus. Outcomes were VE against H3N2, H1N1pdm09, H1N1 (pre-2009), and type B. We calculated pooled VE using a random-effects model.
Findings
We identified 3368 unduplicated publications, selected 142 for full review, and included 56 in the meta-analysis. Pooled VE was 33% (95% CI 26–39; I2=44·4) for H3N2, 54% (46–61; I2=61·3) for type B, 61% (57–65; I2=0·0) for H1N1pdm09, and 67% (29–85; I2=57·6) for H1N1; VE was 73% (61–81; I2=31·4) for monovalent vaccine against H1N1pdm09. VE against H3N2 for antigenically matched viruses was 33% (22–43; I2=56·1) and for variant viruses was 23% (2–40; I2=55·6). Among older adults (aged >60 years), pooled VE was 24% (−6 to 45; I2=17·6) for H3N2, 63% (33–79; I2=0·0) for type B, and 62% (36–78; I2=0·0) for H1N1pdm09.
Interpretation
Influenza vaccines provided substantial protection against H1N1pdm09, H1N1 (pre-2009), and type B, and reduced protection against H3N2. Vaccine improvements are needed to generate greater protection against H3N2 than with current vaccines.

The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz is part of the WHO guidelines for preferred first-line treatment of HIV-1-infected adults, pregnant and lactating women, and children. Efavirenz is well known to cause CNS toxicity. Although good data for CNS toxicity are available for adults, the opposite is true for children. Paediatric studies on this topic frequently suffer from small sample sizes or absence of thorough neuropsychiatric assessments. In this Personal View, we focus on two knowledge gaps of CNS toxicity of efavirenz in children. First, plasma concentrations of efavirenz are difficult to predict in children because of immaturity of and genetic variation in metabolic enzymes. Second, efavirenz exerts a lysergide (LSD)-like effect on brain serotonergic pathways and affects CNS metabolic pathways, including mitochondrial function. Whether these effects interfere with normal brain development is unknown. These uncertainties underline the imminent need for better monitoring of mental health and neurocognitive development in children given and exposed to efavirenz."

Background
Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome is a superantigen-driven potentially life-threatening disease affecting mainly young and otherwise healthy individuals. Currently, no specific treatment or preventive measure is available. We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant detoxified toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 variant (rTSST-1v) vaccine in adult volunteers.
Methods
In this randomised, double-blind, adjuvant-controlled, dose-escalation first-in-human trial, healthy adults aged 18–64 years were enrolled from the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1 and 3:1) by block randomisation (block sizes of three and 12) to receive increasing doses of rTSST-1v (100 ng to 30 μg) or the adjuvant comparator aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)3) (200 μg, 600 μg, or 1 mg). Investigators and participants were masked to group allocation. The per-protocol population received a booster immunisation 42 days after the first vaccination. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability of rTSST-1v. The per-protocol population included all participants who had adhered to the study protocol without any major protocol deviations. The per-protocol population was the primary analysis population for immunogenicity. The trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2013-003716-50, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02340338.
Findings
Between Aug 19, 2014, and April 14, 2015, 46 participants were enrolled (safety population), of whom three were assigned to cohort 1 (two to receive 100 ng rTSST-1v and one to receive 200 μg Al(OH)3), three to cohort 2 (two to receive 300 ng rTSST-1v and one to receive 600 μg Al(OH)3), four to cohort 3 (three to receive 1 μg rTSST-1v and one to receive 1 mg Al(OH)3), 12 to cohort 4 (nine to receive 3 μg rTSST-1v and three to receive 1 mg Al(OH)3), 12 to cohort 5 (nine to receive 10 μg rTSST-1v and three to receive 1 mg Al(OH)3), and 12 to cohort 6 (nine to receive 300 μg rTSST-1v and three to receive 1 mg Al(OH)3). 45 participants (98%) were included in the per-protocol population. rTSST-1v had a good safety profile, and no vaccination-related severe or serious adverse events occurred. Adverse event rates were similar between participants who received rTSST-1v and those who received placebo (26 [76%] vs 10 [83%]; p=0·62) independent of pre-existing TSST-1 immunity.
Interpretation
rTSST-1v was safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic. This study represents an important step in vaccine development to prevent or treat a potentially lethal disease.

The working diagnosis was autoimmune encephalitis, although extensive investigations did not lead to a final classifying diagnosis. The patient became comatose and developed hypertension, and an emergency caesarean section was done at 31 weeks to deliver the child, who seemed healthy. The patient died about 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The patient was found to have had subacute sclerosing panencephalitis at autopsy.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Advances in therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) have ushered in a new era in chronic hepatitis treatment. To maximise the effectiveness of these medicines, individuals must be engaged and retained in care. We analysed operational interventions to enhance chronic viral hepatitis testing, linkage to care, treatment uptake, adherence, and viral suppression or cure.
Methods
We did a systematic review of operational interventions, and did meta-analyses for sufficiently comparable data. We searched PubMed, Embase, WHO library, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for randomised controlled trials and controlled non-randomised studies that examined operational interventions along the chronic viral hepatitis care continuum, published in English up to Dec 31, 2014. We included non-pharmaceutical intervention studies with primary or secondary outcomes of testing, linkage to care, treatment uptake, treatment adherence, treatment completion, treatment outcome, or viral endpoints. We excluded dissertations and studies of children only. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. Studies were assessed for bias. Data from similar interventions were pooled and quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. This study was registered in PROSPERO (42014015094).
Findings
We identified 7583 unduplicated studies, and included 56 studies that reported outcomes along the care continuum (41 for HCV and 18 for HBV). All studies except one were from high-income countries. Lay health worker HBV test promotion interventions increased HBV testing rates (relative risk [RR] 2·68, 95% CI 1·82–3·93). Clinician reminders to prompt HCV testing during clinical visits increased HCV testing rates (3·70, 1·81–7·57). Nurse-led educational interventions improved HCV treatment completion (1·14, 1·05–1·23) and cure (odds ratio [OR] 1·93, 95% CI 1·44–2·59). Coordinated mental health, substance misuse, and hepatitis treatment services increased HCV treatment uptake (OR 3·03, 1·24–7·37), adherence (RR 1·22, 1·05–1·41), and cure (RR 1·21, 1·07–1·38) compared with usual care.
Interpretation
Several simple, inexpensive operational interventions can substantially improve engagement and retention along the chronic viral hepatitis care continuum. Further operational research to inform scale-up of hepatitis services is needed in low-income and middle-income countries.

Background
Although the risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is greatest in young women, women older than 25 years remain at risk. We present data from the VIVIANE study of the HPV 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in adult women after 7 years of follow-up.
Methods
In this phase 3, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, healthy women older than 25 years were enrolled (age stratified: 26–35 years, 36–45 years, and ≥46 years). Up to 15% in each age stratum had a history of HPV infection or disease. Women were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive HPV 16/18 vaccine or aluminium hydroxide control, with an internet-based system. The primary endpoint was vaccine efficacy against 6-month persistent infection or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 or greater (CIN1+) associated with HPV 16/18. We did analyses in the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy and total vaccinated cohort. Data for the combined primary endpoint in the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy were considered significant when the lower limit of the 96·2% CI around the point estimate was greater than 30%. For all other endpoints and cohorts, data were considered significant when the lower limit of the 96·2% CI was greater than 0%. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00294047.
Findings
The first participant was enrolled on Feb 16, 2006, and the last study visit took place on Jan 29, 2014. 4407 women were in the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy (n=2209 vaccine, n=2198 control) and 5747 women in the total vaccinated cohort (n=2877 vaccine, n=2870 control). At month 84, in women seronegative for the corresponding HPV type in the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy, vaccine efficacy against 6-month persistent infection or CIN1+ associated with HPV 16/18 was significant in all age groups combined (90·5%, 96·2% CI 78·6–96·5). Vaccine efficacy against HPV 16/18-related cytological abnormalities (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) and CIN1+ was also significant. We also noted significant cross-protective efficacy against 6-month persistent infection with HPV 31 (65·8%, 96·2% CI 24·9–85·8) and HPV 45 (70·7%, 96·2% CI 34·2–88·4). In the total vaccinated cohort, vaccine efficacy against CIN1+ irrespective of HPV was significant (22·9%, 96·2% CI 4·8–37·7). Serious adverse events related to vaccination occurred in five (0·2%) of 2877 women in the vaccine group and eight (0·3%) of 2870 women in the control group.
Interpretation
In women older than 25 years, the HPV 16/18 vaccine continues to protect against infections, cytological abnormalities, and lesions associated with HPV 16/18 and CIN1+ irrespective of HPV type, and infection with non-vaccine types HPV 31 and HPV 45 over 7 years of follow-up.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Oral poliovirus vaccine is less immunogenic and effective in low-income countries than in high-income countries, similarly to other oral vaccines. The high prevalence of intestinal pathogens and associated environmental enteropathy has been proposed to explain this problem. Because administration of an antibiotic has the potential to resolve environmental enteropathy and clear bacterial pathogens, we aimed to assess whether antibiotics would improve oral poliovirus vaccine immunogenicity.
Methods
We did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of the effect of azithromycin on the immunogenicity of serotype-3 monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine given to healthy infants living in 14 blocks of Vellore district, India. Infants were eligible to participate if they were 6–11 months old, available for the study duration, and lacked serum neutralising antibodies to serotype-3 poliovirus. Infants were randomly assigned (1:1) at enrolment to receive oral 10 mg/kg azithromycin or placebo once daily for 3 days, followed by serotype-3 monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine on day 14. The primary outcome was detection of serum neutralising antibodies to serotype-3 poliovirus at a dilution of one in eight or more on day 35 and was assessed in the per-protocol population (ie, all those who received azithromycin or placebo, oral poliovirus vaccine, and provided a blood sample according to the study protocol). Safety outcomes were assessed in all infants enrolled in the study. The trial is registered with the Clinical Trials Registry India, number CTRI/2014/05/004588.
Findings
Between Aug 5, 2014, and March 21, 2015, 754 infants were randomly assigned: 376 to receive azithromycin and 378 to placebo. Of these, 348 (93%) of 376 in the azithromycin group and 357 (94%) of 378 infants in the placebo group completed the study per protocol. In the azithromycin group, 175 (50%) seroconverted to serotype-3 poliovirus compared with 192 (54%) in the placebo group (risk ratio 0·94, 95% CI 0·81–1·08; p=0·366). Azithromycin reduced faecal biomarkers of environmental enteropathy (calprotectin, myeloperoxidase, α1-antitrypsin) and the prevalence of bacterial but not viral or eukaryotic pathogens. Viral pathogens were associated with lower seroconversion. Three serious adverse events were reported (two in the azithromycin group and one in the placebo group), but none was considered related to the study interventions.
Interpretation
Azithromycin did not improve the immunogenicity of oral poliovirus vaccine despite reducing biomarkers of environmental enteropathy and the prevalence of pathogenic intestinal bacteria. Viral interference and innate antiviral immune mechanisms might be more important determinants of the immunogenicity of live-virus oral vaccines.

Zika virus was originally identified in a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947. The virus is a member of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, and is transmitted to humans by Aedes species mosquitoes. The first report of Zika virus outside Africa and Asia was in 2007 when the virus was associated with a small outbreak in Yap State, part of the Federated States of Micronesia. Since then, Zika virus infections have been reported around the world, including in southeast Asia; French Polynesia and other islands in the Pacific Ocean; and parts of South, Central, and North America. Symptomatic infection in human beings normally results in a mild and self-limiting febrile disease, although recent reports have suggested a possible association with more serious sequelae such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, and microcephaly in newborn infants of mothers infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. In this Review, we summarise the history of Zika virus from its first detection to its current worldwide distribution."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Single low doses of primaquine, when added to artemisinin-based combination therapy, might prevent transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria to mosquitoes. We aimed to establish the activity and safety of four low doses of primaquine combined with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine in male patients in Mali.
Methods
In this phase 2, single-blind, dose-ranging, adaptive randomised trial, we enrolled boys and men with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria at the Malaria Research and Training Centre (MRTC) field site in Ouelessebougou, Mali. All participants were confirmed positive carriers of gametocytes through microscopy and had normal function of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) on colorimetric quantification. In the first phase, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three primaquine doses: 0 mg/kg (control), 0·125 mg/kg, and 0·5 mg/kg. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated randomisation list (in block sizes of six) and concealed with sealed, opaque envelopes. In the second phase, different participants were sequentially assigned (1:1) to 0·25 mg/kg primaquine or 0·0625 mg/kg primaquine. Primaquine tablets were dissolved into a solution and administered orally in a single dose. Participants were also given a 3 day course of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, administered by weight (320 mg dihydroartemisinin and 40 mg piperaquine per tablet). Outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation, but participants were permitted to find out group assignment. Infectivity was assessed through membrane-feeding assays, which were optimised through the beginning part of phase one. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean within-person percentage change in mosquito infectivity 2 days after primaquine treatment in participants who completed the study after optimisation of the infectivity assay, had both a pre-treatment infectivity measurement and at least one follow-up infectivity measurement, and who were given the correct primaquine dose. The safety endpoint was the mean within-person change in haemoglobin concentration during 28 days of study follow-up in participants with at least one follow-up visit. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01743820.
Findings
Between Jan 2, 2013, and Nov 27, 2014, we enrolled 81 participants. In the primary analysis sample (n=71), participants in the 0·25 mg/kg primaquine dose group (n=15) and 0·5 mg/kg primaquine dose group (n=14) had significantly lower mean within-person reductions in infectivity at day 2—92·6% (95% CI 78·3–100; p=0·0014) for the 0·25 mg/kg group; and 75·0% (45·7–100; p=0·014) for the 0·5 mg/kg primaquine group—compared with those in the control group (n=14; 11·3% [–27·4 to 50·0]). Reductions were not significantly different from control for participants assigned to the 0·0625 mg/kg dose group (n=16; 41·9% [1·4–82·5]; p=0·16) and the 0·125 mg/kg dose group (n=12; 54·9% [13·4–96·3]; p=0·096). No clinically meaningful or statistically significant drops in haemoglobin were recorded in any individual in the haemoglobin analysis (n=70) during follow-up. No serious adverse events were reported and adverse events did not differ between treatment groups.
Interpretation
A single dose of 0·25 mg/kg primaquine, given alongside dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, was safe and efficacious for the prevention of P falciparum malaria transmission in boys and men who are not deficient in G6PD. Future studies should assess the safety of single-dose primaquine in G6PD-deficient individuals to define the therapeutic range of primaquine to enable the safe roll-out of community interventions with primaquine.

abstract = "Summary
Quantitative measurement of viral load is an important parameter in the management of filovirus disease outbreaks because viral load correlates with severity of disease, survival, and infectivity. During the ongoing Ebola virus disease outbreak in parts of Western Africa, most assays used in the detection of Ebola virus disease by more than 44 diagnostic laboratories yielded qualitative results. Regulatory hurdles involved in validating quantitative assays and the urgent need for a rapid Ebola virus disease diagnosis precluded development of validated quantitative assays during the outbreak. Because of sparse quantitative data obtained from these outbreaks, opportunities for study of correlations between patient outcome, changes in viral load during the course of an outbreak, disease course in asymptomatic individuals, and the potential for virus transmission between infected patients and contacts have been limited. We strongly urge the continued development of quantitative viral load assays to carefully evaluate these parameters in future outbreaks of filovirus disease."

Central venous catheters are essential for the treatment of patients with haematological malignancies and the recipients of stem-cell transplant. This patient population is, however, at high risk for catheter-related bloodstream infections that can result in substantial morbidity, mortality, and health-care-associated costs. Efficient prevention, early diagnosis, and effective treatment are essential to providing the best care to these patients. Although confirming the catheter as a source of infection remains challenging, the Infectious Diseases Society of America definition of catheter-related bloodstream infection remains the most precise definition to use in these patients. Gram-positive bacteria, particularly coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp, remain the leading cause of catheter-related bloodstream infection, although an increase in Gram-negative bacteria as the causative agent has been noted. Although removal of the line and appropriate intravenous antibiotics remain the mainstay of treatment in most cases, novel technologies, including exchange with antibiotic-coated catheters and treatment with lock solutions, are particularly relevant in this patient population. In this Review we present the types of central venous catheters used in this patient population and analyse the different definitions of catheter-related infections, with an overview of their prevention and management."

abstract = "Summary
Background
To combat Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A epidemics in the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa, a meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine (MACV) has been progressively rolled out since 2010. We report the first meningitis epidemic in Niger since the nationwide introduction of MACV.
Methods
We compiled and analysed nationwide case-based meningitis surveillance data in Niger. Cases were confirmed by culture or direct real-time PCR, or both, of cerebrospinal fluid specimens, and whole-genome sequencing was used to characterise isolates. Information on vaccination campaigns was collected by the Niger Ministry of Health and WHO.
Findings
From Jan 1 to June 30, 2015, 9367 suspected meningitis cases and 549 deaths were reported in Niger. Among 4301 cerebrospinal fluid specimens tested, 1603 (37·3%) were positive for a bacterial pathogen, including 1147 (71·5%) that were positive for N meningitidis serogroup C (NmC). Whole-genome sequencing of 77 NmC isolates revealed the strain to be ST-10217. Although vaccination campaigns were limited in scope because of a global vaccine shortage, 1·4 million people were vaccinated from March to June, 2015.
Interpretation
This epidemic represents the largest global NmC outbreak so far and shows the continued threat of N meningitidis in sub-Saharan Africa. The risk of further regional expansion of this novel clone highlights the need for continued strengthening of case-based surveillance. The availability of an affordable, multivalent conjugate vaccine may be important in future epidemic response.

abstract = "Summary
Background
A substantial reduction in bacterial meningitis has occurred in the UK following successful implementation of immunisation programmes. Most childhood meningitis in developed countries is now caused by viruses. Long-term trends in paediatric viral meningitis in England have not previously been reported. The objective of this study is to report on epidemiological trends over time in childhood viral meningitis in England.
Methods
In this population-based observational study, we used routinely collected hospital discharge records from English National Health Service hospitals from 1968–2011 to analyse annual age-specific admission rates for viral meningitis, including specific viral aetiologies, in children younger than 15 years.
Findings
We analysed hospital discharge records from Jan 1, 1968, to Dec 31, 2011. Hospital admission rates for viral meningitis from Jan 1, 1968, to Dec 31, 1985, varied annually, with a mean of 13·5 admissions per 100 000 children aged less than 15 years, per year (95% CI 13·0–14·0). Admission rates declined during the late 1980s, and the mean number of admissions from 1989–2011 was 5·2 per 100 000 per year (5·1–5·3). This decrease was entirely in children aged 1–14 years. Admission rates for infants aged less than 1 year increased since 2005, to 70·0 per 100 000 (63·7–76·2) in 2011, which was driven by an increase in admission of infants aged 90 days or less. In 1968–85, the majority of cases in children were in those aged 1–14 years (22 150 [89%] of 24 920 admissions). In 2007–11, 1716 (72%) of 2382 cases were in infants. Admissions for mumps-related meningitis almost disappeared following introduction of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in 1988. Admissions with a specified viral aetiology have increased since 2000.
Interpretation
Trends in viral meningitis admissions have changed substantially over the past 50 years, and probably reflect the impact of the MMR vaccine programme and the use of more sensitive diagnostic techniques.

abstract = "Summary
Background
After infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, children are at an increased risk of progression to tuberculosis disease; a condition that can be challenging to diagnose. New estimation approaches for children have highlighted the gap between incidence and notifications of M tuberculosis, and suggest there are more cases of isoniazid-resistant and multidrug-resistant (MDR) disease than are identified. No work has yet quantified the burden of drug-resistant infection, or accounted for other types of drug resistance or sampling uncertainty.
Methods
We combined a mathematical model of tuberculosis in children with an analysis of drug-resistance patterns to produce country-level, regional, and global estimates of drug-resistant infection and disease. We determined drug resistance using data from the Global Project on Antituberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance at WHO, from surveys and surveillance reported between 1988 and 2014. We combined 1000 sampled proportions for each country from a Bayesian approach with 10 000 sampled country estimates of tuberculosis disease incidence and M tuberculosis infection prevalence. We estimated the proportions of tuberculosis cases at a country level with isoniazid monoresistance, rifampicin monoresistance, multidrug resistance (MDR), fluoroquinolone-resistant multidrug resistance, second-line injectable-resistant multidrug resistance, and extensive multidrug resistance with resistance to both a fluoroquinolone and a second-line injectable (XDR).
Findings
We estimated that 850 000 children developed tuberculosis in 2014; 58 000 with isoniazid-monoresistant tuberculosis, 25 000 with MDR tuberculosis, and 1200 with XDR tuberculosis. We estimate 67 million children are infected with M tuberculosis; 5 million with isoniazid monoresistance, 2 million with MDR, and 100 000 with XDR. Africa and southeast Asia have the highest numbers of children with tuberculosis, but the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region, European region, and Western Pacific region also contribute substantially to the burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis because of their much higher proportions of resistance.
Interpretation
Far more drug-resistant tuberculosis occurs in children than is diagnosed, and there is a large pool of drug-resistant infection. This finding has implications for approaches to empirical treatment and preventive therapy in some regions of the world.

abstract = "Summary
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of end-stage liver disease that necessitates liver transplantation. The incidence of virus-induced cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma continues to increase, making liver transplantation increasingly common. Infection of the engrafted liver is universal and accelerates progression to advanced liver disease, with 20–30% of patients having cirrhosis within 5 years of transplantation. Treatments of chronic HCV infection have improved dramatically, albeit with remaining challenges of failure and access, and therapeutic options to prevent graft infection during liver transplantation are emerging. Developments in directed use of new direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) to eliminate circulating HCV before or after transplantation in the past 5 years provide renewed hope for prevention and treatment of liver graft infection. Identification of the ideal regimen and use of DAAs reveals new ways to treat this specific population of patients. Complementing DAAs, viral entry inhibitors have been shown to prevent liver graft infection in animal models and delay graft infection in clinical trials, which shows their potential for use concomitant to transplantation. We review the challenges and pathology associated with HCV liver graft infection, highlight current and future strategies of DAA treatment timing, and discuss the potential role of entry inhibitors that might be used synergistically with DAAs to prevent or treat graft infection."

The family Marseilleviridae is a new clade of giant viruses whose original member, marseillevirus, was described in 2009. These viruses were isolated using Acanthamoeba spp primarily from the environment. Subsequently, a close relative of marseillevirus was isolated from the faeces of a healthy young man, and others were detected in blood samples of blood donors and recipients and in a child with lymph node adenitis. In this Grand Round we describe the detection of marseillevirus by PCR, fluorescence in-situ hybridisation, direct immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry in the lymph node of a 30-year-old woman diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, together with IgG antibodies to marseillevirus. A link with viruses and bacteria has been reported for many lymphomas. We review the literature describing these associations, the criteria used to consider a causal association, and the underlying mechanisms of lymphomagenesis. Our observations suggest that consideration should be given to marseillevirus infections as an additional viral cause or consequence of Hodgkin's lymphoma, and that this hypothesis should be tested further."

Background
The microcephaly epidemic, which started in Brazil in 2015, was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO in 2016. We report the preliminary results of a case-control study investigating the association between microcephaly and Zika virus infection during pregnancy.
Methods
We did this case-control study in eight public hospitals in Recife, Brazil. Cases were neonates with microcephaly. Two controls (neonates without microcephaly), matched by expected date of delivery and area of residence, were selected for each case. Serum samples of cases and controls and cerebrospinal fluid samples of cases were tested for Zika virus-specific IgM and by quantitative RT-PCR. Laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection during pregnancy was defined as detection of Zika virus-specific IgM or a positive RT-PCR result in neonates. Maternal serum samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralisation assay for Zika virus and dengue virus. We estimated crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs using a median unbiased estimator for binary data in an unconditional logistic regression model. We estimated ORs separately for cases with and without radiological evidence of brain abnormalities.
Findings
Between Jan 15, 2016, and May 2, 2016, we prospectively recruited 32 cases and 62 controls. 24 (80%) of 30 mothers of cases had Zika virus infection compared with 39 (64%) of 61 mothers of controls (p=0·12). 13 (41%) of 32 cases and none of 62 controls had laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection; crude overall OR 55·5 (95% CI 8·6–∞); OR 113·3 (95% CI 14·5–∞) for seven cases with brain abnormalities; and OR 24·7 (95% CI 2·9–∞) for four cases without brain abnormalities.
Interpretation
Our data suggest that the microcephaly epidemic is a result of congenital Zika virus infection. We await further data from this ongoing study to assess other potential risk factors and to confirm the strength of association in a larger sample size.

Otitis media is a common childhood infection of the middle ear and a major cause of morbidity. This multifactorial disease manifests as a spectrum of clinical syndromes from uncomplicated acute otitis media to more complex recurrent and chronic cases (frequently polymicrobial), with the major pathogens involved being Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) target only a few serotypes that cause otitis media; however, results from studies suggest that existing PCVs can prevent early episodes of disease associated with vaccine serotypes, resulting in a reduction of subsequent complex cases caused by non-vaccine serotypes and other otopathogens, which contribute considerably to the disease burden. In this Review, we discuss the role of pneumococcus in the disease continuum and assess clinical evidence showing the effect of prevention of early episodes on the complex interplay between bacterial species implicated in otitis media."

Mycetoma can be caused by bacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma) and typically affects poor communities in remote areas. It is an infection of subcutaneous tissues resulting in mass and sinus formation and a discharge that contains grains. The lesion is usually on the foot but all parts of the body can be affected. The causative microorganisms probably enter the body by a thorn prick or other lesions of the skin. Mycetoma has a worldwide distribution but is restricted to specific climate zones. Microbiological diagnosis and characterisation of the exact organism causing mycetoma is difficult; no reliable serological test exists but molecular techniques to identify relevant antigens have shown promise. Actinomycetoma is treated with courses of antibiotics, which usually include co-trimoxazole and amikacin. Eumycetoma has no acceptable treatment at present; antifungals such as ketoconazole and itraconazole have been used but are unable to eradicate the fungus, need to be given for long periods, and are expensive. Amputations and recurrences in patients with eumycetoma are common."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antiretroviral regimens containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate have been associated with renal toxicity and reduced bone mineral density. Tenofovir alafenamide is a novel tenofovir prodrug that reduces tenofovir plasma concentrations by 90%, thereby decreasing off-target side-effects. We aimed to assess whether efficacy, safety, and tolerability were non-inferior in patients switched to a regimen containing tenofovir alafenamide versus in those remaining on one containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.
Methods
In this randomised, actively controlled, multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority trial, we recruited HIV-1-infected adults from Gilead clinical studies at 168 sites in 19 countries. Patients were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 50 mL per min or greater, and were taking one of four tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing regimens for at least 96 weeks before enrolment. With use of a third-party computer-generated sequence, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive a once-a-day single-tablet containing elvitegravir 150 mg, cobicistat 150 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg (tenofovir alafenamide group) or to carry on taking one of four previous tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing regimens (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group) for 96 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by previous treatment regimen in blocks of six. Patients and treating physicians were not masked to the assigned study regimen; outcome assessors were masked until database lock. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who received at least one dose of study drug who had undetectable viral load (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) at week 48. The non-inferiority margin was 12%. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01815736.
Findings
Between April 12, 2013 and April 3, 2014, we enrolled 1443 patients. 959 patients were randomly assigned to the tenofovir alafenamide group and 477 to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group. Viral suppression at week 48 was noted in 932 (97%) patients assigned to the tenofovir alafenamide group and in 444 (93%) assigned to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (adjusted difference 4·1%, 95% CI 1·6–6·7), with virological failure noted in ten and six patients, respectively. The number of adverse events was similar between the two groups, but study drug-related adverse events were more common in the tenofovir alafenamide group (204 patients [21%] vs 76 [16%]). Hip and spine bone mineral density and glomerular filtration were each significantly improved in patients in the tenofovir alafenamide group compared with those in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group.
Interpretation
Switching to a tenofovir alafenamide-containing regimen from one containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was non-inferior for maintenance of viral suppression and led to improved bone mineral density and renal function. Longer term follow-up is needed to better understand the clinical impact of these changes.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Commonly used drugs for preventive chemotherapy against soil-transmitted helminths (ie, albendazole and mebendazole) show low efficacy against Trichuris trichiura. Recent studies with oxantel pamoate revealed good cure rates and high egg-reduction rates against T trichiura. We aimed to assess the nature of the dose–response relation to determine the optimum dose.
Methods
We did a parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blind trial with oxantel pamoate in school-aged children (aged 6–14 years) infected with T trichiura on Pemba Island, Tanzania. Children were asked to provide two stool samples and children positive for T trichiura were eligible to participate in the trial. Children were excluded if they suffered from any systematic illness. Children were randomly assigned to six different oxantel pamoate doses (5–30 mg/kg) or a placebo. Randomisation was stratified by baseline infection intensity using random block sizes of seven and 14. The primary endpoints were cure rates and egg-reduction rates against T trichiura, both analysed by available case. Drug safety was assessed 2 h and 24 h after treatment. The trial is registered at www.isrctn.com, number ISRCTN86603231.
Findings
Between Oct 14, and Nov 28, 2014, we enrolled 480 participants and randomly assigned 350 children to the different oxantel pamoate doses or the placebo. 5 mg/kg oxantel pamoate was the minimum effective dose (10 of 46 children cured [cure rate 22%, 95% CI 11–36]; egg-reduction rate 85·0%, 64·5–92·9). An increased probability of being cured and reduced egg counts with escalating doses was recorded. At 25 mg/kg oxantel pamoate 27 of 45 children were cured (cure rate 60%, 95% CI 44–65) with an egg-reduction rate of 97·5% (94·4–98·9), and at 30 mg/kg 27 of 46 children were cured (59%, 43–73) with an egg-reduction rate of 98·8% (96·8–99·6). Oxantel pamoate was well tolerated across all treatment groups; only mild adverse events were reported by the participants 2 h (27 [10%]) and 24 h (12 [4%]) after treatment.
Interpretation
Our dose-finding study revealed an excellent tolerability profile of oxantel pamoate in children infected with T trichiura. An optimum therapeutic dose range of 15–30 mg/kg oxantel pamoate was defined. With a weight independent dose of 500 mg oxantel pamoate 95% of children aged 7–14 years in sub-Saharan Africa would receive doses of 11·7–32·0 mg/kg. Future research should include studies with oxantel pamoate in younger children and on different continents with the ultimate goal to be able to add oxantel pamoate to soil-transmitted helminth control programmes.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Because treatment with third-generation cephalosporins is associated with slow clinical improvement and high relapse burden for enteric fever, whereas the fluoroquinolone gatifloxacin is associated with rapid fever clearance and low relapse burden, we postulated that gatifloxacin would be superior to the cephalosporin ceftriaxone in treating enteric fever.
Methods
We did an open-label, randomised, controlled, superiority trial at two hospitals in the Kathmandu valley, Nepal. Eligible participants were children (aged 2–13 years) and adult (aged 14–45 years) with criteria for suspected enteric fever (body temperature ≥38·0°C for ≥4 days without a focus of infection). We randomly assigned eligible patients (1:1) without stratification to 7 days of either oral gatifloxacin (10 mg/kg per day) or intravenous ceftriaxone (60 mg/kg up to 2 g per day for patients aged 2–13 years, or 2 g per day for patients aged ≥14 years). The randomisation list was computer-generated using blocks of four and six. The primary outcome was a composite of treatment failure, defined as the occurrence of at least one of the following: fever clearance time of more than 7 days after treatment initiation; the need for rescue treatment on day 8; microbiological failure (ie, blood cultures positive for Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, or Paratyphi A, B, or C) on day 8; or relapse or disease-related complications within 28 days of treatment initiation. We did the analyses in the modified intention-to-treat population, and subpopulations with either confirmed blood-culture positivity, or blood-culture negativity. The trial was powered to detect an increase of 20% in the risk of failure. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01421693, and is now closed.
Findings
Between Sept 18, 2011, and July 14, 2014, we screened 725 patients for eligibility. On July 14, 2014, the trial was stopped early by the data safety and monitoring board because S Typhi strains with high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin and gatifloxacin had emerged. At this point, 239 were in the modified intention-to-treat population (120 assigned to gatifloxacin, 119 to ceftriaxone). 18 (15%) patients who received gatifloxacin had treatment failure, compared with 19 (16%) who received ceftriaxone (hazard ratio [HR] 1·04 [95% CI 0·55–1·98]; p=0·91). In the culture-confirmed population, 16 (26%) of 62 patients who received gatifloxacin failed treatment, compared with four (7%) of 54 who received ceftriaxone (HR 0·24 [95% CI 0·08–0·73]; p=0·01). Treatment failure was associated with the emergence of S Typhi exhibiting resistance against fluoroquinolones, requiring the trial to be stopped. By contrast, in patients with a negative blood culture, only two (3%) of 58 who received gatifloxacin failed treatment versus 15 (23%) of 65 who received ceftriaxone (HR 7·50 [95% CI 1·71–32·80]; p=0·01). A similar number of non-serious adverse events occurred in each treatment group, and no serious events were reported.
Interpretation
Our results suggest that fluoroquinolones should no longer be used for treatment of enteric fever in Nepal. Additionally, under our study conditions, ceftriaxone was suboptimum in a high proportion of patients with culture-negative enteric fever. Since antimicrobials, specifically fluoroquinolones, are one of the only routinely used control measures for enteric fever, the assessment of novel diagnostics, new treatment options, and use of existing vaccines and development of next-generation vaccines are now a high priority.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The use of injectable progestin-only contraceptives has been associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition in observational studies, but the biological mechanisms of this risk remain poorly understood. We aimed to assess the effects of progestins on HIV acquisition risk and the immune environment in the female genital tract.
Methods
In this prospective cohort, we enrolled HIV-negative South African women aged 18–23 years who were not pregnant and were living in Umlazi, South Africa from the Females Rising through Education, Support, and Health (FRESH) study. We tested for HIV-1 twice per week to monitor incident infection. Every 3 months, we collected demographic and behavioural data in addition to blood and cervical samples. The study objective was to characterise host immune determinants of HIV acquisition risk, including those associated with injectable progestin-only contraceptive use. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards methods.
Findings
Between Nov 19, 2012, and May 31, 2015, we characterised 432 HIV-uninfected South African women from the FRESH study. In this cohort, 152 women used injectable progestin-only contraceptives, 43 used other forms of contraception, and 222 women used no method of long-term contraception. Women using injectable progestin-only contraceptives were at substantially higher risk of acquiring HIV (12·06 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 6·41–20·63) than women using no long-term contraception (3·71 per 100 person-years, 1·36–8·07; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2·93, 95% CI 1·09–7·868, p=0·0326). HIV-negative injectable progestin-only contraceptive users had 3·92 times the frequency of cervical HIV target cells (CCR5+ CD4 T cells) compared with women using no long-term contraceptive (p=0·0241). Women using no long-term contraceptive in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle also had a 3·25 times higher frequency of cervical target cells compared with those in the follicular phase (p=0·0488), suggesting that a naturally high progestin state had similar immunological effects to injectable progestin-only contraceptives.
Interpretation
Injectable progestin-only contraceptive use and high endogenous progesterone are both associated with increased frequency of activated HIV targets cells at the cervix, the site of initial HIV entry in most women, providing a possible biological mechanism underlying increased HIV acquisition in women with high progestin exposure.

Novel influenza viruses continue to emerge, posing zoonotic and potentially pandemic threats, such as with avian influenza A H7N9. Although closure of live poultry markets (LPMs) in mainland China stopped H7N9 outbreaks temporarily, closures are difficult to sustain, in view of poultry production and marketing systems in China. In this Personal View, we summarise interventions taken in mainland China, and provide evidence for other more sustainable but effective interventions in the live poultry market systems that reduce risk of zoonotic influenza including rest days, and banning live poultry in markets overnight. Separation of live ducks and geese from land-based (ie, non-aquatic) poultry in LPM systems can reduce the risk of emergence of zoonotic and epizootic viruses at source. In view of evidence that H7N9 is now endemic in over half of the provinces in mainland China and will continue to cause recurrent zoonotic disease in the winter months, such interventions should receive high priority in China and other Asian countries at risk of H7N9 through cross-border poultry movements. Such generic measures are likely to reduce known and future threats of zoonotic influenza."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The coverage of mass drug administration (MDA) for neglected tropical diseases, such as the soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), needs to rapidly expand to meet WHO's 2020 targets. We aimed to compare use of a cost function to take into account economies of scale to the standard method of assuming a constant cost per treatment when investigating the cost and cost-effectiveness of scaling up a STH MDA programme targeting Ascaris lumbricoides.
Methods
We fitted a cost function describing how the costs of MDA change with scale to empirical cost data and incorporated it into a STH transmission model. Using this cost function, we investigated the consequences of taking into account economies of scale on the projected cost-effectiveness of STH control, by comparison with the standard method of assuming a constant cost per treatment. The cost function was fitted to economic cost data collected as part of a school-based deworming programme in Uganda using maximum likelihood methods. We used the model to investigate the total reduction in the overall worm burden, the total number of prevalent infection case-years averted, and the total number of heavy infection case-years averted. For each year, we calculated the effectiveness as the difference between the worm burden or number of cases and the number in absence of treatment.
Findings
When using the cost function, the cost-effectiveness of STH control markedly increased as the programme was scaled up. By contrast, the standard method (constant cost per treatment) undervalued this and generated misleading conclusions. For example, when scaling up control in the projected district from 10% to 75% coverage of at-risk school-age children, the cost-effectiveness in terms of prevention of heavy burden infections was projected to increase by over 70% when using the cost function, but decrease by 18% when assuming a constant cost per treatment.
Interpretation
The current exclusion of economies of scale in most economic analyses must be addressed if the most cost-effective policies for the control of neglected tropical diseases are to be formulated. These findings are also relevant to other large-scale disease interventions.

Topical and oral antibiotics are routinely used to treat acne. However, antibiotic resistance is increasing, with many countries reporting that more than 50% of Propionibacterium acnes strains are resistant to topical macrolides, making them less effective. We reviewed the current scientific literature to enable proposal of recommendations for antibiotic use in acne treatment. References were identified through PubMed searches for articles published from January, 1954, to March 7, 2015, using four multiword searches. Ideally, benzoyl peroxide in combination with a topical retinoid should be used instead of a topical antibiotic to minimise the impact of resistance. Oral antibiotics still have a role in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne, but only with a topical retinoid, benzoyl peroxide, or their combination, and ideally for no longer than 3 months. To limit resistance, it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide should always be added when long-term oral antibiotic use is deemed necessary. The benefit-to-risk ratio of long-term antibiotic use should be carefully considered and, in particular, use alone avoided where possible. There is a need to treat acne with effective alternatives to antibiotics to reduce the likelihood of resistance."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In December, 2010, National Health Service (NHS) England introduced national mandatory screening of all admissions for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this policy, from a regional or national health-care decision makers' perspective, compared with alternative screening strategies.
Methods
We used an individual-based dynamic transmission model parameterised with national MRSA audit data to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of admission screening of patients in English NHS hospitals compared with five alternative strategies (including no screening, checklist-activated screening, and high-risk specialty-based screening), accompanied by patient isolation and decolonisation, over a 5 year time horizon. We evaluated strategies for different NHS hospital types (acute, teaching, and specialist), MRSA prevalence, and transmission potentials using probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
Findings
Compared with no screening, mean cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of screening all admissions was £89 000–148 000 (range £68 000–222 000), and this strategy was consistently more costly and less effective than alternatives for all hospital types. At a £30 000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold and current prevalence, only the no-screening strategy was cost effective. The next best strategies were, in acute and teaching hospitals, targeting of high-risk specialty admissions (30–40% chance of cost-effectiveness; mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs] £45 200 [range £35 300–61 400] and £48 000/QALY [£34 600–74 800], respectively) and, in specialist hospitals, screening these patients plus risk-factor-based screening of low-risk specialties (a roughly 20% chance of cost-effectiveness; mean ICER £62 600/QALY [£48 000–89 400]). As prevalence and transmission increased, targeting of high-risk specialties became the optimum strategy at the NHS willingness-to-pay threshold (£30 000/QALY). Switching from screening all admissions to only high-risk specialty admissions resulted in a mean reduction in total costs per year (not considering uncertainty) of £2·7 million per acute hospital, £2·9 million per teaching, and £474 000 per specialist hospital for a minimum rise in infections (about one infection per year per hospital).
Interpretation
Our results show that screening all admissions for MRSA is unlikely to be cost effective in England at the current NHS willingness-to-pay threshold, and our findings informed modified guidance to NHS England in 2014. Screening admissions to high-risk specialties is likely to represent better resource use in terms of cost per QALY gained.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pathogenic intestinal protozoa infections are responsible for substantial mortality and morbidity, particularly in settings where people lack improved sanitation and safe drinking water. We assessed the relation between access to, and use of, sanitation facilities and water treatment and infection with intestinal protozoa.
Methods
We did a systematic review and searched PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Embase from inception to June 30, 2014, without restrictions on language. All publications were examined by two independent reviewers and were included if they presented data at the individual level about access or use of sanitation facilities or water treatment, in combination with individual-level data on human intestinal protozoa infections. Meta-analyses using random effects models were used to calculate overall estimates.
Findings
54 studies were included and odds ratios (ORs) extracted or calculated from 2 × 2 contingency tables. The availability or use of sanitation facilities was associated with significantly lower odds of infection with Entamoeba histolytica or Entamoeba dispar (OR 0·56, 95% CI 0·42–0·74) and Giardia intestinalis (0·64, 0·51–0·81), but not for Blastocystis hominis (1·03, 0·87–1·23), and Cryptosporidium spp (0·68, 0·17–2·68). Water treatment was associated with significantly lower odds of B hominis (0·52, 0·34–0·78), E histolytica or E dispar (0·61, 0·38–0·99), G intestinalis (0·63, 0·50–0·80), and Cryptosporidium spp infections (0·83, 0·70–0·98).
Interpretation
Availability and use of sanitation facilities and water treatment is associated with lower odds of intestinal protozoa infections. Interventions that focus on water and sanitation, coupled with hygiene behaviour, should be emphasised to sustain the control of intestinal protozoa infections.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The ongoing Ebola outbreak led to accelerated efforts to test vaccine candidates. On the basis of a request by WHO, we aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the monovalent, recombinant, chimpanzee adenovirus type-3 vector-based Ebola Zaire vaccine (ChAd3-EBO-Z).
Methods
We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding, phase 1/2a trial at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland. Participants (aged 18–65 years) were randomly assigned (2:2:1), via two computer-generated randomisation lists for individuals potentially deployed in endemic areas and those not deployed, to receive a single intramuscular dose of high-dose vaccine (5 × 1010 viral particles), low-dose vaccine (2·5 × 1010 viral particles), or placebo. Deployed participants were allocated to only the vaccine groups. Group allocation was concealed from non-deployed participants, investigators, and outcome assessors. The safety evaluation was not masked for potentially deployed participants, who were therefore not included in the safety analysis for comparison between the vaccine doses and placebo, but were pooled with the non-deployed group to compare immunogenicity. The main objectives were safety and immunogenicity of ChAd3-EBO-Z. We did analysis by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02289027.
Findings
Between Oct 24, 2014, and June 22, 2015, we randomly assigned 120 participants, of whom 18 (15%) were potentially deployed and 102 (85%) were non-deployed, to receive high-dose vaccine (n=49), low-dose vaccine (n=51), or placebo (n=20). Participants were followed up for 6 months. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. We recorded local adverse events in 30 (75%) of 40 participants in the high-dose group, 33 (79%) of 42 participants in the low-dose group, and five (25%) of 20 participants in the placebo group. Fatigue or malaise was the most common systemic adverse event, reported in 25 (62%) participants in the high-dose group, 25 (60%) participants in the low-dose group, and five (25%) participants in the placebo group, followed by headache, reported in 23 (57%), 25 (60%), and three (15%) participants, respectively. Fever occurred 24 h after injection in 12 (30%) participants in the high-dose group and 11 (26%) participants in the low-dose group versus one (5%) participant in the placebo group. Geometric mean concentrations of IgG antibodies against Ebola glycoprotein peaked on day 28 at 51 μg/mL (95% CI 41·1–63·3) in the high-dose group, 44·9 μg/mL (25·8–56·3) in the low-dose group, and 5·2 μg/mL (3·5–7·6) in the placebo group, with respective response rates of 96% (95% CI 85·7–99·5), 96% (86·5–99·5), and 5% (0·1–24·9). Geometric mean concentrations decreased by day 180 to 25·5 μg/mL (95% CI 20·6–31·5) in the high-dose group, 22·1 μg/mL (19·3–28·6) in the low-dose group, and 3·2 μg/mL (2·4–4·9) in the placebo group. 28 (57%) participants given high-dose vaccine and 31 (61%) participants given low-dose vaccine developed glycoprotein-specific CD4 cell responses, and 33 (67%) and 35 (69%), respectively, developed CD8 responses.
Interpretation
ChAd3-EBO-Z was safe and well tolerated, although mild to moderate systemic adverse events were common. A single dose was immunogenic in almost all vaccine recipients. Antibody responses were still significantly present at 6 months. There was no significant difference between doses for safety and immunogenicity outcomes. This acceptable safety profile provides a reliable basis to proceed with phase 2 and phase 3 efficacy trials in Africa.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pretreatment with topical imiquimod, a synthetic agonist of toll-like receptor 7, significantly improved the immunogenicity of influenza vaccination in elderly people. We aimed to clarify its effect in a younger age group.
Methods
In this double-blind, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled healthy volunteers aged 18–30 years in early 2014 to receive the 2013–14 northern-hemisphere winter trivalent influenza vaccine at the Queen Mary Hospital, (Hong Kong, China). Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to one of the four vaccination groups: the study group, topical imiquimod-cream followed by intradermal trivalent influenza vaccine (INF-Q-ID), or one of three control groups, topical aqueous-cream control followed by intradermal trivalent influenza vaccine (INF-C-ID), topical aqueous-cream control followed by intramuscular trivalent influenza vaccine (INF-C-IM), and topical imiquimod-cream followed by intradermal normal-saline injection (SAL-Q-ID). Randomisation was by computer-generated lists in blocks of four. The type of topical treatment was masked from volunteers and investigators, although not from the study nurse. Serum haemagglutination-inhibition and microneutralisation-antibody titres were assayed. The primary outcome was seroconversion at day 7 after treatment for three vaccine strains of influenza (A/California/07/2009 H1N1-like virus [A/California/H1N1], A/Victoria/361/2011 H3N2-like virus [A/Victoria/H3N2], and B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like virus [B/Yamagata lineage]) and four non-vaccine strains (A/HK/485197/14 [H3N2 Switzerland-like lineage], prototype A/WSN/1933 [H1N1], A/HK/408027/09 [prepandemic seasonal H1N1], and B/HK/418078/11 [Victoria lineage]). Analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02103023.
Findings
We enrolled 160 healthy volunteers between March 1 and May 31, 2014, and 40 participants were randomly assigned to each study group. For the A/California/H1N1 strain, seroconversion at day 7 occurred in 39 participants (98%) in the INF-Q-ID group, 25 (63%) in the INF-C-ID group, 18 (45%) in the INF-C-IM group, and none in the SAL-Q-ID group; for the A/Victoria/H3N2, this was 30 (75%) in the INF-Q-ID group, four (10%) in the INF-C-ID group, four (10%) in the INF-C-IM group, and none in the SAL-Q-ID group; and for the B/Massachusetts (Yamagata lineage) strain, this was 36 (90%) in the INF-Q-ID group, 27 (68%) in the INF-C-ID group, 17 (43%) in the INF-C-IM group, and one (3%) in the SAL-Q-ID group (p<0·0001 for all three vaccine strains). Adverse reactions were infrequent and self-limited and did not differ between the four groups. Furthermore, the seroconversion rate against the four non-vaccine strains was better in the INF-Q-ID group than in the control groups on days 7 and 21 (p<0·0001). The most common adverse events were grade 1 redness (five participants in the INF-Q-ID group, three in INF-C-ID, one in INF-C-IM, and one in SAL-Q-ID) and grade 1 swelling (seven participants in INF-Q-ID group, five in INF-C-ID, three in INF-C-IM, and two in SAL-Q-ID.
Interpretation
Topical application of imiquimod before intradermal trivalent influenza vaccine significantly improved immunogenicity against the vaccine influenza strains in young healthy individuals and increased immunogenicity against the non-vaccine strains, especially the antigenically drifted H3N2 strain of 2015, which was not included in the 2013–14 recommended vaccine. Further studies should be done to establish the efficacy and safety of this approach for other injectable vaccines to augment the onset and range of protection.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Rapid declines in malaria prevalence, cases, and deaths have been achieved globally during the past 15 years because of improved access to first-line treatment and vector control. We aimed to assess the intervention coverage needed to achieve further gains over the next 15 years.
Methods
We used a mathematical model of the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria to explore the potential effect on case incidence and malaria mortality rates from 2015 to 2030 of five different intervention scenarios: remaining at the intervention coverage levels of 2011–13 (Sustain), for which coverage comprises vector control and access to treatment; two scenarios of increased coverage to 80% (Accelerate 1) and 90% (Accelerate 2), with a switch from quinine to injectable artesunate for management of severe disease and seasonal malaria chemoprevention where recommended for both Accelerate scenarios, and rectal artesunate for pre-referral treatment at the community level added to Accelerate 2; a near-term innovation scenario (Innovate), which included longer-lasting insecticidal nets and expansion of seasonal malaria chemoprevention; and a reduction in coverage to 2006–08 levels (Reverse). We did the model simulations at the first administrative level (ie, state or province) for the 80 countries with sustained stable malaria transmission in 2010, accounting for variations in baseline endemicity, seasonality in transmission, vector species, and existing intervention coverage. To calculate the cases and deaths averted, we compared the total number of each under the five scenarios between 2015 and 2030 with the predicted number in 2015, accounting for population growth.
Findings
With an increase to 80% coverage, we predicted a reduction in case incidence of 21% (95% credible intervals [CrI] 19–29) and a reduction in mortality rates of 40% (27–61) by 2030 compared with 2015 levels. Acceleration to 90% coverage and expansion of treatment at the community level was predicted to reduce case incidence by 59% (Crl 56–64) and mortality rates by 74% (67–82); with additional near-term innovation, incidence was predicted to decline by 74% (70–77) and mortality rates by 81% (76–87). These scenarios were predicted to lead to local elimination in 13 countries under the Accelerate 1 scenario, 20 under Accelerate 2, and 22 under Innovate by 2030, reducing the proportion of the population living in at-risk areas by 36% if elimination is defined at the first administrative unit. However, failing to maintain coverage levels of 2011–13 is predicted to raise case incidence by 76% (Crl 71–80) and mortality rates by 46% (39–51) by 2020.
Interpretation
Our findings show that decreases in malaria transmission and burden can be accelerated over the next 15 years if the coverage of key interventions is increased.

abstract = "Summary
Background
H7N9 avian influenza viruses characterised by high virulence and presence of mammalian adaptation markers have pandemic potential. Specific influenza vaccines remain the main defence. We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of an H7N9 live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) candidate in healthy adult volunteers.
Methods
We did a phase 1, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Eligible participants were healthy adults aged 18–49 years. The participants were randomised 3:1 to receive live vaccine or placebo, according to a computer-generated randomisation scheme. Two doses of vaccine or placebo were administered intranasally 28 days apart, each followed by 7 day stays in hospital. Immune responses were assessed in nasal swabs, saliva, and serum specimens collected before and 28 days after each vaccine dose. The primary outcome was the safety profile. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02480101.
Findings
Between Oct 21, 2014, and Oct 31, 2014, 40 adults were randomised, of whom 39 (98%) were included in the per-protocol analysis (29 in the vaccine group and ten in the placebo group). The frequency of adverse events did not differ between the vaccine and placebo groups. Seroconversion of neutralising antibodies was seen in 14 participants after the first vaccine dose (48%, 95% CI 29·4–67·5) and 21 after the second vaccine dose (72%, 52·8–87·3). Immune responses were seen in 27 of 29 recipients (93%, 95% CI 77·2–99·2). Adverse effects were seen in 19 (63%) vaccine recipients and nine (90%) placebo recipients after the first dose and in nine (31%) and four (40%), respectively, after the second dose. These effects were mainly local and all were mild.
Interpretation
The H7N9 LAIV was well tolerated and safe and showed good immunogenicity.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In the 20th century, childhood mortality decreased rapidly, and vaccination programmes are frequently suggested as a contributing factor. However, quantification of this contribution is subject to debate or absent. We present historical data from the Netherlands that allow us to quantify the reduction in childhood mortality burden for vaccine-preventable diseases in this period as a function of vaccination coverage.
Methods
We retrieved cause-specific and age-specific historical mortality data from Statistics Netherlands from 1903 to 2012 (for Dutch birth cohorts born from 1903 to 1992), and data for vaccination coverage since the start of vaccination programmes from the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate and the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. We also obtained birth and migration data from Statistics Netherlands. We used a restricted mean life-time method to estimate cause-specific mortality burden among children and young adults for each birth cohort as the years of life lost up to age 20 years, excluding migration as a variable because this did not affect the results. To correct for long-term trends, we calculated the cause-specific contribution to the total childhood mortality burden.
Findings
In the prevaccination era, the contribution to mortality burden was fairly constant for diphtheria (1·4%), pertussis (3·8%), and tetanus (0·1%). Around the start of mass vaccinations, these contributions to the mortality burden decreased rapidly to near zero. We noted similar patterns for poliomyelitis, mumps, and rubella. The number of deaths due to measles around the start of vaccination in the Netherlands were too few to detect an accelerated rate of decrease after mass vaccinations were started. We estimate that mass vaccination programmes averted 148 000 years of life lost up to age 20 years (95% prediction interval 110 000–201 000) among children born before 1992. This corresponds to about 9000 deaths averted (6000–12 000).
Interpretation
Our historical time series analysis of mortality and vaccination coverage shows a strong association between increasing vaccination coverage and diminishing contribution of vaccine-preventable diseases to overall mortality. This analysis provides further evidence that mass vaccination programmes contributed to lowering childhood mortality burden.

Background
High-quality epidemiological studies evaluating the burden of cutaneous leishmaniasis worldwide are lacking. We compared the burden of cutaneous leishmaniasis in each country to the overall global burden and assessed the equality of cutaneous leishmaniasis burden across different countries and regions.
Methods
Data were extracted from scientific literature, hospital sources, country reports, and WHO sources on the prevalence of sequalae of both acute and chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis. Prevalence data were combined with a disability weight to yield years lived with disability. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) are a sum of the years lived with disability and years of life lost (or mortality, assumed to be zero). We compared DALYs due to cutaneous leishmaniasis for 152 countries using standard Z score analysis with Bonferroni correction (p<0·003) and generation of Lorenz curves with a Gini coefficient.
Findings
In 2013, the global mean age-standardised DALYs for cutaneous leishmaniasis was 0·58 per 100 000 people. Nine countries had significantly greater DALYs from cutaneous leishmaniasis than the mean: Afghanistan (87·0), Sudan (20·2), Syria (9·2), Yemen (6·2), Iraq (6·0), Burkina Faso (4·8), Bolivia (4·6), Haiti (4·1), and Peru (4·0). The Gini coefficient was 0·89. Andean Latin America, North Africa and Middle East, western sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia had the highest DALYs from cutaneous leishmaniasis. Among males, Palestine had the highest incidence rates (616·2 cases per 100 000 people) followed by Afghanistan (566·4), Syria (357·1), and Nicaragua (354·8). Among females, Afghanistan had the highest incidence rates (623·9) followed by Syria (406·3), Palestine (222·1), and Nicaragua (180·8). Similar proportions of males and females had cutaneous leishmaniasis in most countries with a high incidence.
Interpretation
The burden from cutaneous leishmaniasis mainly falls on countries in Africa and the Middle East. Global and national data on the burden of cutaneous leishmaniasis disease are pivotal to promote field studies and initiate behavioural change.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Until now, polymyxin resistance has involved chromosomal mutations but has never been reported via horizontal gene transfer. During a routine surveillance project on antimicrobial resistance in commensal Escherichia coli from food animals in China, a major increase of colistin resistance was observed. When an E coli strain, SHP45, possessing colistin resistance that could be transferred to another strain, was isolated from a pig, we conducted further analysis of possible plasmid-mediated polymyxin resistance. Herein, we report the emergence of the first plasmid-mediated polymyxin resistance mechanism, MCR-1, in Enterobacteriaceae.
Methods
The mcr-1 gene in E coli strain SHP45 was identified by whole plasmid sequencing and subcloning. MCR-1 mechanistic studies were done with sequence comparisons, homology modelling, and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. The prevalence of mcr-1 was investigated in E coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains collected from five provinces between April, 2011, and November, 2014. The ability of MCR-1 to confer polymyxin resistance in vivo was examined in a murine thigh model.
Findings
Polymyxin resistance was shown to be singularly due to the plasmid-mediated mcr-1 gene. The plasmid carrying mcr-1 was mobilised to an E coli recipient at a frequency of 10−1 to 10−3 cells per recipient cell by conjugation, and maintained in K pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In an in-vivo model, production of MCR-1 negated the efficacy of colistin. MCR-1 is a member of the phosphoethanolamine transferase enzyme family, with expression in E coli resulting in the addition of phosphoethanolamine to lipid A. We observed mcr-1 carriage in E coli isolates collected from 78 (15%) of 523 samples of raw meat and 166 (21%) of 804 animals during 2011–14, and 16 (1%) of 1322 samples from inpatients with infection.
Interpretation
The emergence of MCR-1 heralds the breach of the last group of antibiotics, polymyxins, by plasmid-mediated resistance. Although currently confined to China, MCR-1 is likely to emulate other global resistance mechanisms such as NDM-1. Our findings emphasise the urgent need for coordinated global action in the fight against pan-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.

Oral cholera vaccination could be deployed in a diverse range of situations from cholera-endemic areas and locations of humanitarian crises, but no clear consensus exists. The supply of licensed, WHO-prequalified cholera vaccines is not sufficient to meet endemic and epidemic needs worldwide and so prioritisation is needed. We have developed a scenario approach to systematically classify situations in which oral cholera vaccination might be useful. Our scenario approach distinguishes between five types of cholera epidemiology based on experiences from around the world and provides evidence that we hope will spur the development of detailed guidelines on how and where oral cholera vaccines could, and should, be most rationally deployed."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Little is known about how long the BCG vaccine protects against tuberculosis. We assessed the long-term vaccine effectiveness (VE) in Norwegian-born individuals.
Methods
In this retrospective population-based cohort study, we studied Norwegian-born individuals aged 12–50 years who were tuberculin skin test (TST) negative and eligible for BCG vaccination as part of the last round of Norway's mandatory mass tuberculosis screening and BCG vaccination programme between 1962 and 1975. We excluded individuals who had tuberculosis before or in the year of screening and those with unknown TST and BCG status. We obtained TST and BCG information and linked it to the National Tuberculosis Register, population and housing censuses, and the population register for emigrations and deaths. We followed individuals up to their first tuberculosis episode, emigration, death, or Dec 31, 2011. We used Cox regressions to estimate VE against all tuberculosis and just pulmonary tuberculosis by time since vaccination, adjusted for age, time, county-level tuberculosis rates, and demographic and socioeconomic indicators.
Findings
Median follow-up was 41 years (IQR 32–49) for 83 421 BCG-unvaccinated and 44 years (41–46) for 297 905 vaccinated individuals, with 260 tuberculosis episodes. Tuberculosis rates were 3·3 per 100 000 person-years in unvaccinated and 1·3 per 100 000 person-years in vaccinated individuals. The adjusted average VE during 40 year follow-up was 49% (95% CI 26–65), although after 20 years, the VE was not significant (up to 9 years VE [excluding tuberculosis episodes in the first 2 years] 61% [95% CI 24–80]; 10–19 years 58% [27–76]; 20–29 years 38% [–32 to 71]; 30–40 years 42% [–24 to 73]). VE against pulmonary tuberculosis up to 9 years (excluding tuberculosis episodes in the first 2 years) was 67% (95% CI 27–85), 10–19 years was 63% (32–80), 20–29 years was 50% (−19 to 79), and 30–40 years was 40% (−46 to 76).
Interpretation
Findings are consistent with long-lasting BCG protection, but waning of VE with time. The vaccine could be more cost effective than has been previously estimated

Tularaemia is a zoonotic disease caused by Francisella tularensis, a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium. Typically, human and animal infections are caused by F tularensis subspecies tularensis (type A) strains mainly in Canada and USA, and F tularensis subspecies holarctica (type B) strains throughout the northern hemisphere, including Europe. In the past, the epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic, and prognostic aspects of tularaemia reported in the English medical literature were mainly those that had been reported in the USA, where the disease was first described. Tularaemia has markedly changed in the past decade, and a large number of studies have provided novel data for the disease characteristics in Europe. In this Review we aim to emphasise the specific and variable aspects of tularaemia in different European countries. In particular, two natural lifecycles of F tularensis have been described in this continent, although not fully characterised, which are associated with different modes of transmission, clinical features, and public health burdens of tularaemia."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Following the proposed worldwide switch from trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) to bivalent types 1 and 3 OPV (bOPV) in 2016, inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) will be the only source of protection against poliovirus type 2. With most countries opting for one dose of IPV in routine immunisation schedules during this transition because of cost and manufacturing constraints, optimisation of protection against all poliovirus types will be a priority of the global eradication programme. We assessed the immunogenicity and safety of a novel monovalent high-dose inactivated poliovirus type 2 vaccine (mIPV2HD) in infants.
Methods
This observer-blind, comparative, randomised controlled trial was done in a single centre in Panama. We enrolled healthy infants who had not received any previous vaccination against poliovirus. Infants were randomly assigned (1:1) by computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive a single dose of either mIPV2HD or standard trivalent IPV given concurrently with a third dose of bOPV at 14 weeks of age. At 18 weeks, all infants were challenged with one dose of monovalent type 2 OPV (mOPV2). Primary endpoints were seroconversion and median antibody titres to type 2 poliovirus 4 weeks after vaccination with mIPV2HD or IPV; and safety (as determined by the proportion and nature of serious adverse events and important medical events for 8 weeks after vaccination). The primary immunogenicity analyses included all participants for whom a post-vaccination blood sample was available. All randomised participants were included in the safety analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02111135.
Findings
Between April 14 and May 9, 2014, 233 children were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive mIPV2HD (117 infants) or IPV (116 infants). 4 weeks after vaccination with mIPV2HD or IPV, seroconversion to poliovirus type 2 was recorded in 107 (93·0%, 95% CI 86·8–96·9) of 115 infants in the mIPV2HD group compared with 86 (74·8%, 65·8–82·4) of 115 infants in the IPV group (difference between groups 18·3%, 95% CI 5·0–31·1; p<0·0001), and median antibody titres against poliovirus type 2 were 181 (95% CI 72·0–362·0) in the mIPV2HD group and 36 (18·0–113·8) in the IPV group (difference between groups 98·8, 95% CI 60·7–136·9; p<0·0001). Serious adverse events were reported for six (5%) of 117 infants in the mIPV2HD group and seven (6%) of 116 infants in the IPV group during the 8-week period after vaccination; none were related to vaccination. No important medical events were reported.
Interpretation
Our findings lend support to the use of mIPV2HD as an option for stockpiling for outbreak response or primary protection in selected areas at risk for emergence of poliovirus type 2 during the next phase of the polio eradication plan.

The treatment goal for chronic hepatitis B is true eradication of the hepatitis B virus, but this is rarely achieved with first-line treatment regimens because of an inability to disrupt covalently closed circular DNA and an inadequate host immune response. Therefore, new antiviral agents are needed to target various stages of the hepatitis B virus lifecycle and modulation of the immune system. This Review provides a summary of available regimens with their strengths and limitations, and highlights future therapeutic strategies to target the virus and host immune response. These new agents can hopefully lead to a finite duration of treatment, and provide a functional and durable cure for chronic hepatitis B infection."

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly endemic (7–8% prevalence) in rural China, causing high mortality and societal burden. Data from men of reproductive age is scarce and last reported in 2006. We assessed the seroepidemiology of men in rural China, aiming to provide updated baseline data for the prevalence of HBV infection.
Methods
We established prevalence of HBV infection from data gathered through a nationwide population-based study of Chinese rural men aged 21–49 years. Data were obtained from a physical check-up programme for couples of reproductive age, the National Free Preconception Health Examination Project, that covered 31 provinces from 2010–12. We tested serological samples with ELISA and categorised participants' HBV status based on presence of HBsAg, anti-HBV core antibody (anti-HBc), and anti-HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs).
Findings
2 030 083 men were recruited into the database from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2012, and 1 966 013 men provided serum samples for analysis. 124 274 men (6%) tested positive for HBsAg, 178 559 (9%) tested positive for anti-HBc, and 583 923 (30%) tested positive for anti-HBs. Isolated anti-HBs (an indicator of vaccine-mediated immunity) were present in 527 566 men (27%). And 1 234 127 men (63%) were negative for all HBV makers (susceptible population). HBsAg prevalence was higher in men aged 25–39 years (6·35–6·47%) than in other age groups (5·54–5·78%; p<0·0001). HBV markers were all more prevalent in the eastern region of China than in the central or western regions (all p<0·0001). 32 326 (26%) of 124 274 HBsAg-positive men tested positive for HBeAg (suggesting high infectiousness); this decreased with increasing age (p<0·0001).
Interpretation
HBV prevalence in men in rural China has changed from highly endemic into intermediate endemic in the past two decades. However, the absolute number of HBV-infected men and the susceptible population is still very large.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The End TB Strategy places great emphasis on increasing social protection and poverty alleviation programmes. However, the role of social protection on controlling tuberculosis has not been examined fully. We analysed the association between social protection spending and tuberculosis prevalence, incidence, and mortality globally.
Methods
We used publicly available data from WHO's Global Tuberculosis Programme for tuberculosis burden in terms of yearly incidence, prevalence, and mortality per 100 000 people, and social protection data from the International Labour Organization (ILO), expressed as the percentage of national gross domestic product (GDP) spent on social protection programmes (excluding health). Data from ILO were from 146 countries covering the years between 2000 and 2012. We used descriptive assessments to examine levels of social protection and tuberculosis burden for each country, then used these assessments to inform our fully adjusted multivariate regression models. Our models controlled for economic output, adult HIV prevalence, health expenditure, population density, the percentage of foreign-born residents, and the strength of the national tuberculosis treatment programme, and also incorporated a country-level fixed effect to adjust for clustering of datapoints within countries.
Findings
Overall, social protection spending levels were inversely associated with tuberculosis prevalence, incidence, and mortality. For a country spending 0% of their GDP on social protection, moving to spending 1% of their GDP was associated with a change of −18·33 per 100 000 people (95% CI −32·10 to −4·60; p=0·009) in prevalence, −8·16 per 100 000 people (−16·00 to −0·27; p=0·043) in incidence, and −5·48 per 100 000 people (−9·34 to −1·62; p=0·006) in mortality. This association was mitigated at higher levels of social protection spending, and lost significance when more than 11% of GDP was spent.
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that investments in social protection could contribute to a reduced tuberculosis burden, especially in countries that are investing a small proportion of their GDP in this area. However, further research is needed to support these ecological associations.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Artefenomel (OZ439) is a novel synthetic trioxolane with improved pharmacokinetic properties compared with other antimalarial drugs with the artemisinin pharmacophore. Artefenomel has been generally well tolerated in volunteers at doses up to 1600 mg and is being developed as a partner drug in an antimalarial combination treatment. We investigated the efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of artefenomel at different doses in patients with Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria.
Methods
This phase 2a exploratory, open-label trial was done at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, and the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit in Thailand. Adult patients with acute, uncomplicated P falciparum or P vivax malaria received artefenomel in a single oral dose (200 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg, or 1200 mg). The first cohort received 800 mg. Testing of a new dose of artefenomel in a patient cohort was decided on after safety and efficacy assessment of the preceding cohort. The primary endpoint was the natural log parasite reduction per 24 h. Definitive oral treatment was given at 36 h. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01213966.
Findings
Between Oct 24, 2010, and May 25, 2012, 82 patients were enrolled (20 in each of the 200 mg, 400 mg, and 800 mg cohorts, and 21 in the 1200 mg cohort). One patient withdrew consent (before the administration of artefenomel) but there were no further dropouts. The parasite reduction rates per 24 h ranged from 0·90 to 1·88 for P falciparum, and 2·09 to 2·53 for P vivax. All doses were equally effective in both P falciparum and P vivax malaria, with median parasite clearance half-lives of 4·1 h (range 1·3–6·7) to 5·6 h (2·0–8·5) for P falciparum and 2·3 h (1·2–3·9) to 3·2 h (0·9–15·0) for P vivax. Maximum plasma concentrations, dose-proportional to 800 mg, occurred at 4 h (median). The estimated elimination half-life was 46–62 h. No serious drug-related adverse effects were reported; other adverse effects were generally mild and reversible, with the highest number in the 1200 mg cohort (17 [81%] patients with at least one adverse event). The most frequently reported adverse effect was an asymptomatic increase in plasma creatine phosphokinase concentration (200 mg, n=5; 400 mg, n=3; 800 mg, n=1; 1200 mg, n=3).
Interpretation
Artefenomel is a new synthetic antimalarial peroxide with a good safety profile that clears parasitaemia rapidly in both P falciparum and P vivax malaria. Its long half-life suggests a possible use in a single-dose treatment in combination with other drugs.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Limited data are available on the prevalence and predictors of clinical sequelae in survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD). The EVD Survivor Clinic in Port Loko, Sierra Leone, has provided clinical care for 603 of 661 survivors living in the district. We did a cross-sectional study to describe the prevalence, nature, and predictors of three key EVD sequelae (ocular, auditory, and articular) in this cohort of EVD survivors.
Methods
We reviewed available clinical and laboratory records of consecutive patients assessed in the clinic between March 7, 2015, and April 24, 2015. We used univariate and multiple logistic regression to examine clinical and laboratory features of acute EVD with the following outcomes in convalescence: new ocular symptoms, uveitis, auditory symptoms, and arthralgias.
Findings
Among 277 survivors (59% female), median age was 29 years (IQR 20–36) and median time from discharge from an EVD treatment facility to first survivor clinic visit was 121 days (82–151). Clinical sequelae were common, including arthralgias (n=210, 76%), new ocular symptoms (n=167, 60%), uveitis (n=50, 18%), and auditory symptoms (n=67, 24%). Higher Ebola viral load at acute EVD presentation (as shown by lower cycle thresholds on real-time RT-PCR testing) was independently associated with uveitis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3·33, 95% CI 1·87–5·91, for every five-point decrease in cycle threshold) and with new ocular symptoms or ocular diagnoses (aOR 3·04, 95% CI 1·87–4·94).
Interpretation
Clinical sequelae during early EVD convalescence are common and sometimes sight threatening. These findings underscore the need for early clinical follow-up of survivors of EVD and urgent provision of ocular care as part of health systems strengthening in EVD-affected west African countries.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a major problem in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. We aimed to quantify the effectiveness of central-line bundles (insertion or maintenance or both) to prevent these infections.
Methods
We searched Embase, MEDLINE OvidSP, Web-of-Science, and Cochrane Library to identify studies reporting the implementation of central-line bundles in adult ICU, paediatric ICU (PICU), or neonatal ICU (NICU) patients. We searched for studies published between Jan 1, 1990, and June 30, 2015. For the meta-analysis, crude estimates of infections were pooled by use of a DerSimonian and Laird random effect model. The primary outcome was the number of CLABSIs per 1000 catheter-days before and after implementation. Incidence risk ratios (IRRs) were obtained by use of random-effects models.
Findings
We initially identified 4337 records, and after excluding duplicates and those ineligible, 96 studies met the eligibility criteria, 79 of which contained sufficient information for a meta-analysis. Median CLABSIs incidence were 5·7 per 1000 catheter-days (range 1·2–46·3; IQR 3·1–9·5) on adult ICUs; 5·9 per 1000 catheter-days (range 2·6–31·1; 4·8–9·4) on PICUs; and 8·4 per 1000 catheter-days (range 2·6–24·1; 3·7–16·0) on NICUs. After implementation of central-line bundles the CLABSI incidence ranged from 0 to 19·5 per 1000 catheter-days (median 2·6, IQR 1·2–4·4) in all types of ICUs. In our meta-analysis the incidence of infections decreased significantly from median 6·4 per 1000 catheter-days (IQR 3·8–10·9) to 2·5 per 1000 catheter-days (1·4–4·8) after implementation of bundles (IRR 0·44, 95% CI 0·39–0·50, p<0·0001; I2=89%).
Interpretation
Implementation of central-line bundles has the potential to reduce the incidence of CLABSIs.

abstract = "Summary
Background
We studied causative pathogens, clinical characteristics, and outcome of adult community-acquired bacterial meningitis after the introduction of adjunctive dexamethasone treatment and nationwide implementation of paediatric conjugate vaccines.
Methods
In this cohort study, we prospectively assessed adults (age >16 years) with community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the Netherlands, identified through the National Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis or individual physicians between Jan 1, 2006, and July 1, 2014. We identified independent predictors of an unfavourable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 1–4) by logistic regression.
Findings
We assessed 1412 episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis. Incidence declined from 1·72 cases per 100 000 adults per year in 2007–08, to 0·94 per 100 000 per year in 2013–14. Streptococcus pneumoniae caused 1017 (72%) of 1412 episodes. Rates of adult bacterial meningitis decreased most sharply among pneumococcal serotypes included in paediatric conjugate vaccine, and in meningococcal meningitis. We found no evidence of serotype or serogroup replacement. The overall case fatality rate was 244 (17%) of 1412 episodes and unfavourable outcome occurred in 531 (38%) of 1412 episodes. Predictors of unfavourable outcome were advanced age, absence of otitis or sinusitis, alcoholism, tachycardia, lower score on the Glasgow Coma Scale, cranial nerve palsy, a cerebrospinal fluid white-cell count lower than 1000 cells per μL, a positive blood culture, and a high serum C-reactive protein concentration. Adjunctive dexamethasone was administered for 1234 (89%) of 1384 assessed episodes. The multivariable adjusted odds ratio of dexamethasone treatment for unfavourable outcome was 0·54 (95% CI 0·39–0·73).
Interpretation
The incidence of adult bacterial meningitis has decreased substantially, which is partly explained by herd protection by paediatric conjugate vaccines. Adjunctive dexamethasone treatment was associated with substantially improved outcome.

The Ebola virus epidemic has topped media and political agendas for months; several countries in west Africa have faced the worst Ebola epidemic in history. At the beginning of the disease outbreak, European Union (EU) policies were notably absent regarding how to respond to the crisis. Although the epidemic is now receding from public view, this crisis has undoubtedly changed the European public perception of Ebola virus disease, which is no longer regarded as a bizarre entity confined in some unknown corner in Africa. Policy makers and researchers in Europe now have an opportunity to consider the lessons learned. In this Personal View, we discuss the EU's response to the Ebola crisis in west Africa. Unfortunately, although ample resources and opportunities for humanitarian and medical action existed, the EU did not use them to promote a rapid and well coordinated response to the Ebola crisis. Lessons learned from this crisis should be used to improve the role of the EU in similar situations in the future, ensuring that European aid can be effectively deployed to set up an improved emergency response system, and supporting the establishment of sustainable health-care services in west Africa."

abstract = "Summary
Background
After the detection of an Ebola virus disease outbreak in west Africa in 2014, one of the elements of the response was to contact trace and isolate patients in specialised Ebola treatment units (ETUs) at onset of fever. We aimed to assess the economic feasibility of administering preventive malaria treatment to all contacts of patients with Ebola virus disease, to prevent the onset of febrile malaria and subsequent admission to ETUs.
Methods
We used a decision tree model to analyse the costs of preventive malaria treatment (artemisinin-based combination treatment [ACT]) for all contacts of patients with Ebola virus disease (in terms of administration and averted ETU-stay costs) and benefits (in terms of averted ETU admissions) in west Africa, from a health-care provider perspective. The period of analyses was 1 year, which is roughly similar to the duration of the 2014–15 west Africa Ebola outbreak response. We calculated the intervention's cost per ETU admission averted (average cost-effectiveness ratio) by season (wet and dry), country (Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea), and age of contact (<5 years, 5–14 years, and ≥15 years). We did sensitivity analyses to assess how results varied with malaria parasite prevalence (in children aged 2–10 years), daily cost of ETU stay (for Liberian malaria incidence levels), and compliance and effectiveness of preventive malaria treatment.
Findings
Administration of ACTs to contacts of patients with Ebola virus disease was cost saving for contacts of all ages in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, in both seasons, from a health-care provider perspective. In the wet season, preventive malaria treatment was estimated to reduce the probability of a contact being admitted to an ETU by a maximum of 36% (in Guinea, for contacts aged <5 years), and a minimum of 10% (in Guinea and Sierra Leone, for those aged ≥15 years). Assuming 85% compliance and taking into account the African population pyramid, the intervention is expected to be cost saving in contacts of all age groups in areas with malaria parasite prevalence in children aged 2–10 years as low as 10%. In Liberia during the wet season, malaria preventive treatment was cost saving even when average daily bed-stay costs were as low as US$5 for children younger than 5 years, $9 for those aged 5–14 years, and $22 for those aged 15 years or older.
Interpretation
Administration of preventive malaria treatment to contacts of patients with Ebola virus disease should be considered by public health officials when addressing Ebola virus disease outbreaks in countries and seasons where malaria reaches high levels of transmission.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Despite WHO recommendations to offer pregnant women treatment with praziquantel, many nations continue to withhold treatment, awaiting data from controlled trials addressing safety and efficacy. The objectives of this study were to assess whether treatment of pregnant women with schistosomiasis at 12–16 weeks gestation leads to improved maternal and newborn outcomes and to collect maternal and newborn safety data.
Methods
This phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done in 72 baranguays (villages) serviced by six municipal health centres in a schistosomiasis endemic region of northeastern Leyte, Philippines. Pregnant women (at 12–16 weeks gestation) who were otherwise healthy but infected with Schistosoma japonicum were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either over-encapsulated praziquantel (total dose 60 mg/kg given as two split doses) or placebo. Participants, investigators, midwives, and laboratory staff were all masked to treatment. The primary outcome was birthweight. Safety data were collected including immediate reactogenicity, post-dosing toxicology ascertained 24 h after study drug administration, and maternal and newborn serious adverse events. Analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle. Analyses were done using hierarchical generalised linear models to adjust for identified confounders and account for potential clustering of observations within villages and municipalities. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00486863.
Findings
Between Aug 13, 2007, and Dec 3, 2012, 370 pregnant women were enrolled and randomly assigned to each treatment group (184 to the placebo group, 186 to the praziquantel group). Most women had low-intensity infections (n=334, 90%). Treatment with praziquantel did not have a significant effect on birthweight (2·85 kg in both groups, β=−0·002 [95% CI −0·088 to 0·083]; p=0·962). Treatment was well tolerated with reactogenicity rates similar to those seen in non-pregnant participants (severe reactions occurred in five patients in the praziquantel group and two in the placebo group, and included headache, fever, and malaise). There were no significant differences in key safety outcomes including abortion, fetal death in utero, and congenital anomalies.
Interpretation
Results from this study provide important data from a controlled trial in support of the expansion of treatment policies to include pregnant women as recommended by WHO.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial for controlling HIV-1 infection through wide-scale treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Potent tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing regimens are increasingly used to treat and prevent HIV, although few data exist for frequency and risk factors of acquired drug resistance in regions hardest hit by the HIV pandemic. We aimed to do a global assessment of drug resistance after virological failure with first-line tenofovir-containing ART.
Methods
The TenoRes collaboration comprises adult HIV treatment cohorts and clinical trials of HIV drug resistance testing in Europe, Latin and North America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. We extracted and harmonised data for patients undergoing genotypic resistance testing after virological failure with a first-line regimen containing tenofovir plus a cytosine analogue (lamivudine or emtricitabine) plus a non-nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI; efavirenz or nevirapine). We used an individual participant-level meta-analysis and multiple logistic regression to identify covariates associated with drug resistance. Our primary outcome was tenofovir resistance, defined as presence of K65R/N or K70E/G/Q mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene.
Findings
We included 1926 patients from 36 countries with treatment failure between 1998 and 2015. Prevalence of tenofovir resistance was highest in sub-Saharan Africa (370/654 [57%]). Pre-ART CD4 cell count was the covariate most strongly associated with the development of tenofovir resistance (odds ratio [OR] 1·50, 95% CI 1·27–1·77 for CD4 cell count <100 cells per μL). Use of lamivudine versus emtricitabine increased the risk of tenofovir resistance across regions (OR 1·48, 95% CI 1·20–1·82). Of 700 individuals with tenofovir resistance, 578 (83%) had cytosine analogue resistance (M184V/I mutation), 543 (78%) had major NNRTI resistance, and 457 (65%) had both. The mean plasma viral load at virological failure was similar in individuals with and without tenofovir resistance (145 700 copies per mL [SE 12 480] versus 133 900 copies per mL [SE 16 650; p=0·626]).
Interpretation
We recorded drug resistance in a high proportion of patients after virological failure on a tenofovir-containing first-line regimen across low-income and middle-income regions. Effective surveillance for transmission of drug resistance is crucial.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Sparse data on the safety of pyronaridine-artesunate after repeated treatment of malaria episodes restrict its clinical use. We therefore compared the safety of pyronaridine-artesunate after treatment of the first episode of malaria versus re-treatment in a substudy analysis.
Methods
This planned substudy analysis of the randomised, open-label West African Network for Clinical Trials of Antimalarial Drugs (WANECAM) phase 3b/4 trial was done at six health facilities in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea in patients (aged ≥6 months and bodyweight ≥5 kg) with uncomplicated microscopically confirmed Plasmodium spp malaria (parasite density <200 000 per μL blood) and fever or history of fever. The primary safety endpoint was incidence of hepatotoxicity: alanine aminotransferase of greater than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or Hy's criteria (alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase greater than three times the ULN and total bilirubin more than twice the ULN) after treatment of the first episode of malaria and re-treatment (≥28 days after first treatment) with pyronaridine-artesunate. Pyronaridine-artesunate efficacy was compared with artemether-lumefantrine with the adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) in an intention-to-treat analysis. WANECAM is registered with PACTR.org, number PACTR201105000286876.
Findings
Following first treatment, 13 (1%) of 996 patients had hepatotoxicity (including one [<1%] possible Hy's law case) versus two (1%) of 311 patients on re-treatment (neither a Hy's law case). No evidence was found that pyronaridine-artesunate re-treatment increased safety risk based on laboratory values, reported adverse event frequencies, or electrocardiograph findings. For all first treatment or re-treatment episodes, pyronaridine-artesunate (n=673) day 28 crude ACPR was 92·7% (95% CI 91·0–94·3) versus 80·4% (77·8–83·0) for artemether-lumefantrine (n=671). After exclusion of patients with PCR-confirmed new infections, ACPR was similar on treatment and re-treatment and greater than 95% at day 28 and greater than 91% at day 42 in both treatment groups.
Interpretation
The findings that pyronaridine-artesunate safety and efficacy were similar on first malaria treatment versus re-treatment of subsequent episodes lend support for the wider access to pyronaridine-artesunate as an alternative artemisinin-based combination treatment for malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The zoonotic parasite Plasmodium knowlesi has become the most common cause of human malaria in Malaysia and is present throughout much of southeast Asia. No randomised controlled trials have been done to identify the optimum treatment for this emerging infection. We aimed to compare artesunate–mefloquine with chloroquine to define the optimum treatment for uncomplicated P knowlesi malaria in adults and children.
Methods
We did this open-label, randomised controlled trial at three district hospitals in Sabah, Malaysia. Patients aged 1 year or older with uncomplicated P knowlesi malaria were randomly assigned, via computer-generated block randomisation (block sizes of 20), to receive oral artesunate–mefloquine (target dose 12 mg/kg artesunate and 25 mg/kg mefloquine) or chloroquine (target dose 25 mg/kg). Research nursing staff were aware of group allocation, but allocation was concealed from the microscopists responsible for determination of the primary endpoint, and study participants were not aware of drug allocation. The primary endpoint was parasite clearance at 24 h. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01708876.
Findings
Between Oct 16, 2012, and Dec 13, 2014, we randomly assigned 252 patients to receive either artesunate–mefloquine (n=127) or chloroquine (n=125); 226 (90%) patients comprised the modified intention-to-treat population. 24 h after treatment, we recorded parasite clearance in 97 (84% [95% CI 76–91]) of 115 patients in the artesunate–mefloquine group versus 61 (55% [45–64]) of 111 patients in the chloroquine group (difference in proportion 29% [95% CI 18·0–40·8]; p<0·0001). Parasite clearance was faster in patients given artesunate–mefloquine than in those given chloroquine (18·0 h [range 6·0–48·0] vs 24·0 h [6·0–60·0]; p<0·0001), with faster clearance of ring stages in the artesunate–mefloquine group (mean time to 50% clearance of baseline parasites 8·6 h [95% CI 7·9–9·4] vs 13·8 h [12·1–15·4]; p<0·0001). Risk of anaemia within 28 days was lower in patients in the artesunate–mefloquine group (71 [62%; 95% CI 52·2–70·6]) than in those in the chloroquine group (83 [75%; 65·6–82·5]; p=0·035). Gametocytaemia as detected by PCR for pks25 was present in 44 (86%) of 51 patients in the artesunate–mefloquine group and 41 (84%) of 49 patients in the chloroquine group at baseline, and in three (6%) of 49 patients and two (4%) of 48 patients, respectively, at day 7. Fever clearance was faster in the artesunate–mefloquine group (mean 11·5 h [95% CI 8·3–14·6]) than in the chloroquine group (14·8 h [11·7–17·8]; p=0·034). Bed occupancy was 2426 days per 1000 patients in the artesunate–mefloquine group versus 2828 days per 1000 patients in the chloroquine group (incidence rate ratio 0·858 [95% CI 0·812–0·906]; p<0·0001). One (<1%) patient in the artesunate–mefloquine group had a serious neuropsychiatric event regarded as probably related to study drug.
Interpretation
Artesunate–mefloquine is highly efficacious for treatment of uncomplicated P knowlesi malaria. The rapid therapeutic response of the drug offers significant advantages compared with chloroquine monotherapy and supports a unified treatment policy for artemisinin-based combination therapy for all Plasmodium species in co-endemic areas.

Background
Antibacterial resistant infections are rising continuously, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. With no new antibiotic classes entering the market and the possibility of returning to the pre-antibiotic era, the Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance (JPIAMR) was established to address this problem. We aimed to quantify the scale and scope of publicly funded antibacterial resistance research across JPIAMR countries and at the European Union (EU) level to identify gaps and future opportunities.
Methods
We did a systematic observational analysis examining antibacterial resistance research funding. Databases of funding organisations across 19 countries and at EU level were systematically searched for publicly funded antibacterial resistance research from Jan 1, 2007, to Dec 31, 2013. We categorised studies on the basis of the JPIAMR strategic research agenda's six priority topics (therapeutics, diagnostics, surveillance, transmission, environment, and interventions) and did an observational analysis. Only research funded by public funding bodies was collected and no private organisations were contacted for their investments. Projects in basic, applied, and clinical research, including epidemiological, public health, and veterinary research and trials were identified using keyword searches by organisations, and inclusion criteria were based on the JPIAMR strategic research agenda's six priority topics, using project titles and abstracts as filters.
Findings
We identified 1243 antibacterial resistance research projects, with a total public investment of €1·3 billion across 19 countries and at EU level, including public investment in the Innovative Medicines Initiative. Of the total amount invested in antibacterial resistance research across the time period, €646·6 million (49·5%) was invested at the national level and €659·2 million (50·5%) at the EU level. When projects were classified under the six priority topics we found that 763 (63%) of 1208 projects funded at national level were within the area of therapeutics, versus 185 (15%) in transmission, 131 (11%) in diagnostics, 53 (4%) in interventions, and only 37 (3%) in environment and 39 (3%) in surveillance.
Interpretation
This was the first systematic analysis of research funding of antibacterial resistance of this scale and scope, which relied on the availability and accuracy of data from organisations included. Large variation was seen between countries both in terms of number of projects and associated investment and across the six priority topics. To determine the future direction of JPIAMR countries a clear picture of the funding landscape across Europe and Canada is needed. Countries should work together to increase the effect of research funding by strengthening national and international coordination and collaborations, harmonising research activities, and collectively pooling resources to fund multidisciplinary projects. The JPIAMR have developed a publicly available database to document the antibacterial resistance research collected and can be used as a baseline to analyse funding from 2014 onwards.

Background
Neonates born to women infected with HIV are at increased risk for invasive group B streptococcus (GBS) disease. We aimed to compare safety and immunogenicity of trivalent glycoconjugate GBS vaccine in pregnant women with and without HIV in Malawi and South Africa.
Methods
In our non-randomised phase 2, open-label, multicentre study, we recruited pregnant women attending two antenatal clinics, one in Blantyre, Malawi, and one in Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa. Participants were divided into three groups on the basis of their HIV infection status (no infection, infection and high CD4 cell count [>350 cells per μL], and infection and low CD4 cell count [>50 to ≤350 cells per μL]) and received a 5 μg dose of glycoconjugate GBS vaccine (serotypes Ia, Ib, and III, with CRM197 [Novartis Vaccines, Siena, Italy]) intramuscularly at 24–35 weeks' gestation. GBS serotype-specific antibody concentrations were measured before vaccination (day 1), day 15, day 31, and at delivery, and in infants at birth and day 42 of life. The primary outcomes were safety in mothers and infants and the amount of placental transfer of GBS serotype-specific antibodies from mothers to their infants. All immunogenicity and safety analyses were done on the full analysis set, including participants who, or whose mother, correctly received the vaccine and who provided at least one valid assessable serum sample. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01412801.
Findings
270 women and 266 infants were enrolled between Sept 26, 2011, and Dec 4, 2012 (90 women and 87 infants without HIV, 89 and 88 with HIV and high CD4 cell counts, and 91 and 91 with HIV and low CD4 cell counts, respectively). Seven women were lost to follow-up, six withdrew consent, one died, and two relocated. Eight infants died or were stillborn and two were lost to follow-up. Across serotypes, fold change in antibody concentrations were higher for the HIV-uninfected group than the HIV-infected groups. Transfer ratios were similar across all three groups (0·49–0·72; transfer ratio is infant geometric mean antibody concentration in blood collected within 72 h of birth divided by maternal geometric mean antibody concentration in blood collected at delivery); however, at birth, maternally derived serotype-specific antibody concentrations were lower for infants born to women infected with HIV (0·52–1·62 μg/mL) than for those born to women not infected with HIV (2·67–3·91 μg/mL). 151 (57%) of 265 women reported at least one solicited adverse reaction: 39 (45%) of 87 women with HIV and low CD4 cell counts, 52 (59%) of 88 women with HIV and high CD4 cell counts, and 60 (67%) of 90 women in the HIV-uninfected group. 49 (18%) of 269 women had at least one adverse event deemed possibly related to the vaccine (six [7%] in the HIV and low CD4 cell count group, 12 [13%] in the HIV and high CD4 cell count group, and 21 [23%] in the HIV-uninfected group), as did three (1%) of 266 neonates (zero, two [1%], and one [1%]); none of these events was regarded as serious.
Interpretation
The vaccine was less immunogenic in women infected with HIV than it was in those not infected, irrespective of CD4 cell count, resulting in lower levels of serotype-specific maternal antibody transferred to infants, which could reduce vaccine protection against invasive GBS disease. A validated assay and correlate of protection is needed to understand the potential protective value of this vaccine.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common health-care-associated infections. Bacteriuria commonly precedes UTI and is often treated with antibiotics, particularly in hospital intensive care units (ICUs). In 2013, a cluster-randomised trial (REDUCE MRSA Trial [Randomized Evaluation of Decolonization vs Universal Clearance to Eradicate MRSA]) showed that body surface decolonisation reduced all-pathogen bloodstream infections. We aim to further assess the effect of decolonisation on bacteriuria and candiduria in patients admitted to ICUs.
Methods
We did a secondary analysis of a three-group, cluster-randomised trial of 43 hospitals (clusters) with patients in 74 adult ICUs. The three groups included were either meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screening and isolation, targeted decolonisation (screening, isolation, and decolonisation of MRSA carriers) with chlorhexidine and mupirocin, and universal decolonisation (no screening, all patients decolonised) with chlorhexidine and mupirocin. Protocol included chlorhexidine cleansing of the perineum and proximal 6 inches (15·24 cm) of urinary catheters. ICUs within the same hospital were assigned the same strategy. Outcomes included high-level bacteriuria (≥50 000 colony forming units [CFU]/mL) with any uropathogen, high-level candiduria (≥50 000 CFU/mL), and any bacteriuria with uropathogens. Sex-specific analyses were specified a priori. Proportional hazards models assessed differences in outcome reductions across groups, comparing an 18-month intervention period to a 12-month baseline period.
Findings
122 646 patients (48 390 baseline, 74 256 intervention) were enrolled. Intervention versus baseline hazard ratios (HRs) for high-level bacteriuria were 1·02 (95% CI 0·88–1·18) for screening or isolation, 0·88 (0·76–1·02) for targeted decolonisation, and 0·87 (0·77–1·00) for universal decolonisation (no difference between groups, p=0·26), with no sex-specific reductions (HRs for men: 1·09 [95% CI 0·85–1·40] for screening or isolation, 1·01 [0·79–1·29] for targeted decolonisation, and 0·78 [0·63–0·98] for universal decolonisation, p=0·12; HRs for women: 0·97 [0·80–1·17] for screening and isolation, 0·83 [0·70–1·00] for targeted decolonisation, and 0·93 [0·79–1·09] for universal decolonisation, p=0·49). HRs for high-level candiduria were 1·14 (0·95–1·37) for screening and isolation, 0·99 (0·83–1·18) for targeted decolonisation, and 0·83 (0·70–0·99) for universal decolonisation (p=0·05). Differences between sexes were due to reductions in men in the universal decolonisation group (HRs: 1·21 [95% CI 0·88–1·68] for screening or isolation, 1·01 [0·73–1·39] for targeted decolonisation, and 0·63 [0·45–0·89] for universal decolonisation, p=0·02). Bacteriuria with any CFU/mL was also reduced in men in the universal decolonisation group (HRs 1·01 [0·81–1·25] for screening or isolation, 1·04 [0·83–1·30] for targeted decolonisation, and 0·74 [0·61–0·90] for universal decolonisation, p=0·04).
Interpretation
Universal decolonisation of patients in the ICU with once a day chlorhexidine baths and short-course nasal mupirocin could be a potential preventive strategy in male patients because it significantly decreases candiduria and any bacteriuria, but not for women.

abstract = "Summary
Background
WHO 2013 guidelines recommend universal treatment for HIV-infected children younger than 5 years. No paediatric trials have compared nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Africa, where most HIV-infected children live. We aimed to compare stavudine, zidovudine, or abacavir as dual or triple fixed-dose-combination paediatric tablets with lamivudine and nevirapine or efavirenz.
Methods
In this open-label, parallel-group, randomised trial (CHAPAS-3), we enrolled children from one centre in Zambia and three in Uganda who were previously untreated (ART naive) or on stavudine for more than 2 years with viral load less than 50 copies per mL (ART experienced). Computer-generated randomisation tables were incorporated securely within the database. The primary endpoint was grade 2–4 clinical or grade 3/4 laboratory adverse events. Analysis was intention to treat. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry number, 69078957.
Findings
Between Nov 8, 2010, and Dec 28, 2011, 480 children were randomised: 156 to stavudine, 159 to zidovudine, and 165 to abacavir. After two were excluded due to randomisation error, 156 children were analysed in the stavudine group, 158 in the zidovudine group, and 164 in the abacavir group, and followed for median 2·3 years (5% lost to follow-up). 365 (76%) were ART naive (median age 2·6 years vs 6·2 years in ART experienced). 917 grade 2–4 clinical or grade 3/4 laboratory adverse events (835 clinical [634 grade 2]; 40 laboratory) occurred in 104 (67%) children on stavudine, 103 (65%) on zidovudine, and 105 (64%), on abacavir (p=0·63; zidovudine vs stavudine: hazard ratio [HR] 0·99 [95% CI 0·75–1·29]; abacavir vs stavudine: HR 0·88 [0·67–1·15]). At 48 weeks, 98 (85%), 81 (80%) and 95 (81%) ART-naive children in the stavudine, zidovudine, and abacavir groups, respectively, had viral load less than 400 copies per mL (p=0·58); most ART-experienced children maintained suppression (p=1·00).
Interpretation
All NRTIs had low toxicity and good clinical, immunological, and virological responses. Clinical and subclinical lipodystrophy was not noted in those younger than 5 years and anaemia was no more frequent with zidovudine than with the other drugs. Absence of hypersensitivity reactions, superior resistance profile and once-daily dosing favours abacavir for African children, supporting WHO 2013 guidelines.

In support of accelerated development of Ebola vaccines from preclinical research to clinical trials, in November, 2014, the Wellcome Trust and the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota established the Wellcome Trust-CIDRAP Ebola Vaccine Team B initiative. This ongoing initiative includes experts with global experience in various phases of bringing new vaccines to market, such as funding, research and development, manufacturing, determination of safety and efficacy, regulatory approval, and vaccination delivery. It also includes experts in community engagement strategies and ethical issues germane to vaccination policies, including eight African scientists with direct experience in developing and implementing vaccination policies in Africa. Ebola Vaccine Team B members have worked on a range of vaccination programmes, such as polio eradication (Africa and globally), development of meningococcal A disease vaccination campaigns in Africa, and malaria and HIV/AIDS vaccine research. We also provide perspective on how this experience can inform future situations where urgent development of vaccines is needed, and we comment on the role that an independent, expert group such as Team B can have in support of national and international public health authorities toward addressing a public health crisis."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The 2014 west African Zaire Ebola virus epidemic prompted worldwide partners to accelerate clinical development of replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus 3 vector vaccine expressing Zaire Ebola virus glycoprotein (ChAd3-EBO-Z). We aimed to investigate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ChAd3-EBO-Z in Malian and US adults, and assess the effect of boosting of Malians with modified vaccinia Ankara expressing Zaire Ebola virus glycoprotein and other filovirus antigens (MVA-BN-Filo).
Methods
In the phase 1, single-blind, randomised trial of ChAd3-EBO-Z in the USA, we recruited adults aged 18–65 years from the University of Maryland medical community and the Baltimore community. In the phase 1b, open-label and double-blind, dose-escalation trial of ChAd3-EBO-Z in Mali, we recruited adults 18–50 years of age from six hospitals and health centres in Bamako (Mali), some of whom were also eligible for a nested, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of MVA-BN-Filo. For randomised segments of the Malian trial and for the US trial, we randomly allocated participants (1:1; block size of six [Malian] or four [US]; ARB produced computer-generated randomisation lists; clinical staff did randomisation) to different single doses of intramuscular immunisation with ChAd3-EBO-Z: Malians received 1 × 1010 viral particle units (pu), 2·5 × 1010 pu, 5 × 1010 pu, or 1 × 1011 pu; US participants received 1 × 1010 pu or 1 × 1011 pu. We randomly allocated Malians in the nested trial (1:1) to receive a single dose of 2 × 108 plaque-forming units of MVA-BN-Filo or saline placebo. In the double-blind segments of the Malian trial, investigators, clinical staff, participants, and immunology laboratory staff were masked, but the study pharmacist (MK), vaccine administrator, and study statistician (ARB) were unmasked. In the US trial, investigators were not masked, but participants were. Analyses were per protocol. The primary outcome was safety, measured with occurrence of adverse events for 7 days after vaccination. Both trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02231866 (US) and NCT02267109 (Malian).
Findings
Between Oct 8, 2014, and Feb 16, 2015, we randomly allocated 91 participants in Mali (ten [11%] to 1 × 1010 pu, 35 [38%] to 2·5 × 1010 pu, 35 [38%] to 5 × 1010 pu, and 11 [12%] to 1 × 1011 pu) and 20 in the USA (ten [50%] to 1 × 1010 pu and ten [50%] to 1 × 1011 pu), and boosted 52 Malians with MVA-BN-Filo (27 [52%]) or saline (25 [48%]). We identified no safety concerns with either vaccine: seven (8%) of 91 participants in Mali (five [5%] received 5 × 1010 and two [2%] received 1 × 1011 pu) and four (20%) of 20 in the USA (all received 1 × 1011 pu) given ChAd3-EBO-Z had fever lasting for less than 24 h, and 15 (56%) of 27 Malians boosted with MVA-BN-Filo had injection-site pain or tenderness.
Interpretation
1 × 1011 pu single-dose ChAd3-EBO-Z could suffice for phase 3 efficacy trials of ring-vaccination containment needing short-term, high-level protection to interrupt transmission. MVA-BN-Filo boosting, although a complex regimen, could confer long-lived protection if needed (eg, for health-care workers).

abstract = "Summary
Background
The UK introduced 4CMenB—a multicomponent vaccine against serogroup B meningococcal disease—into the national infant immunisation programme in September, 2015. The Meningococcal Antigen Typing System (MATS) was used to estimate coverage by 4CMenB of invasive meningococcal group B isolates obtained during 2007–08 in England and Wales (MATS coverage). We aimed to repeat the MATS survey for invasive meningococcal group B isolates obtained during 2014–15, before 4CMenB introduction; compare strain coverage between 2007–08 and 2014–15; and investigate associations between MATS coverage, age, region, and disease outcomes.
Methods
Invasive serogroup B meningococcal isolates from cases in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland during 2014–15 were assayed using MATS and compared with 2007–08 data. MATS coverage was assessed by geographical region and age group. Clinical characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes were assessed according to MATS coverage for 2014–15 English cases.
Findings
In 2014–15, 165 of 251 (66%; 95% CI 52–80) meningococcal group B isolates were estimated by MATS to be covered by 4CMenB, compared with 391 of 535 (73%; 95% CI 57–87) in 2007–08. The proportion of MATS-positive isolates with one vaccine antigen increased from 23% (122 of 535) in 2007–08 to 31% (78 of 251) in 2014–15, whereas the proportion with more than one antigen fell from 50% (269 of 535) to 35% (87 of 251). This effect reflected changes in circulating strains, particularly ST-269 clonal complex strains. MATS coverage increased with age, varied by geographical region, and was associated with more severe disease.
Interpretation
In 2014–15, two-thirds of meningococcal group B isolates were predicted to be covered by 4CMenB. Temporal changes in MATS coverage underscore the need for continued monitoring of antigen expression and diversity, particularly in countries with 4CMenB programmes.

abstract = "Summary
Shortages of vaccines for epidemic diseases, such as cholera, meningitis, and yellow fever, have become common over the past decade, hampering efforts to control outbreaks through mass reactive vaccination campaigns. Additionally, various epidemiological, political, and logistical challenges, which are poorly documented in the literature, often lead to delays in reactive campaigns, ultimately reducing the effect of vaccination. In June 2015, a cholera outbreak occurred in Juba, South Sudan, and because of the global shortage of oral cholera vaccine, authorities were unable to secure sufficient doses to vaccinate the entire at-risk population—approximately 1 million people. In this Personal View, we document the first public health use of a reduced, single-dose regimen of oral cholera vaccine, and show the details of the decision-making process and timeline. We also make recommendations to help improve reactive vaccination campaigns against cholera, and discuss the importance of new and flexible context-specific dose regimens and vaccination strategies."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Since late 2015, an epidemic of yellow fever has caused more than 7334 suspected cases in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including 393 deaths. We sought to understand the spatial spread of this outbreak to optimise the use of the limited available vaccine stock.
Methods
We jointly analysed datasets describing the epidemic of yellow fever, vector suitability, human demography, and mobility in central Africa to understand and predict the spread of yellow fever virus. We used a standard logistic model to infer the district-specific yellow fever virus infection risk during the course of the epidemic in the region.
Findings
The early spread of yellow fever virus was characterised by fast exponential growth (doubling time of 5–7 days) and fast spatial expansion (49 districts reported cases after only 3 months) from Luanda, the capital of Angola. Early invasion was positively correlated with high population density (Pearson's r 0·52, 95% CI 0·34–0·66). The further away locations were from Luanda, the later the date of invasion (Pearson's r 0·60, 95% CI 0·52–0·66). In a Cox model, we noted that districts with higher population densities also had higher risks of sustained transmission (the hazard ratio for cases ceasing was 0·74, 95% CI 0·13–0·92 per log-unit increase in the population size of a district). A model that captured human mobility and vector suitability successfully discriminated districts with high risk of invasion from others with a lower risk (area under the curve 0·94, 95% CI 0·92–0·97). If at the start of the epidemic, sufficient vaccines had been available to target 50 out of 313 districts in the area, our model would have correctly identified 27 (84%) of the 32 districts that were eventually affected.
Interpretation
Our findings show the contributions of ecological and demographic factors to the ongoing spread of the yellow fever outbreak and provide estimates of the areas that could be prioritised for vaccination, although other constraints such as vaccine supply and delivery need to be accounted for before such insights can be translated into policy.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease in human beings, and vector control has not halted its spread worldwide. A dengue vaccine for individuals aged 9 years and older has been licensed, but there remains urgent medical need for a vaccine that is safe and effective against all four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1–4) in recipients of all ages. Here, we present the preplanned interim analyses at 6 months of a tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate (TDV), which is comprised of an attenuated DENV-2 virus strain (TDV-2) and three chimeric viruses containing the premembrane and envelope protein genes of DENV-1, DENV-3, and DENV-4 genetically engineered into the attenuated TDV-2 genome backbone (TDV-1, TDV-3, and TDV-4).
Methods
An ongoing phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a TDV is being done at three sites in dengue-endemic countries (Dominican Republic, Panama, and the Philippines) to determine its safety and immunogenicity over 48 months in healthy participants aged 2–17 years who were randomly assigned (1:2:5:1) using an interactive web response system (stratified by age) to subcutaneous TDV injection (one 0·5 mL dose containing 2·5 × 104 plaque-forming units [PFU] of TDV-1; 6·3 × 103 PFU of TDV-2; 3·2 × 104 PFU of TDV-3; and 4·0 × 105 PFU of TDV-4) in different dose schedules (two-dose regimen at 0 and 3 months, one dose at 0 months, or one dose at 0 months and a booster at 12 months) or placebo. The primary endpoint of this 6 month interim analysis was geometric mean titres (GMTs) of neutralising antibodies against DENV-1–4 in the per-protocol immunogenicity subset at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the first injection. Safety was assessed as a secondary outcome as percentage of participants with serious adverse events in all participants who were injected (safety set), and solicited and unsolicited adverse events (immunogenicity subset). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02302066.
Findings
1800 participants were enrolled between Dec 5, 2014, and Feb 13, 2015. 1794 participants were given study injection as follows: 200 participants were given two-dose regimen at 0 and 3 months (group 1), 398 were given one dose at 0 months (group 2), 998 were given one dose at 0 months and will be given (trial ongoing) a booster at 12 months (group 3), and 198 were given placebo (group 4). These 1794 participants were included in the safety set; 562 participants were randomly assigned to the immunogenicity subset, of which 503 were included in the per-protocol set. TDV elicited neutralising antibodies against all DENV serotypes, which peaked at 1 month and remained elevated above baseline at 6 months. At 6 months, GMTs of neutralising antibodies against DENV-1 were 489 (95% CI 321–746) for group 1, 434 (306–615) for group 2, 532 (384–738) for group 3, and 62 (32–120) for group 4; GMTs of neutralising antibodies against DENV-2 were 1565 (1145–2140) for group 1, 1639 (1286–2088) for group 2, 1288 (1031–1610) for group 3, and 86 (44–169) for group 4; GMTs of neutralising antibodies against DENV-3 were 160 (104–248) for group 1, 151 (106–214) for group 2, 173 (124–240) for group 3, and 40 (23–71) for group 4; and GMTs of neutralising antibodies against DENV-4 were 117 (79–175) for group 1, 110 (80–149) for group 2, 93 (69–125) for group 3, and 24 (15–38) for group 4. No vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred; 15 (3%) of 562 participants in the immunogenicity subset reported vaccine-related unsolicited adverse events. The reactogenicity profile of TDV was acceptable, and similar to previous findings with TDV.
Interpretation
TDV is safe and immunogenic in individuals aged 2–17 years, irrespective of previous dengue exposure. A second TDV dose induced enhanced immunogenicity against DENV-3 and DENV-4 in children who were seronegative before vaccination. These data supported the initiation of phase 3 evaluation of the efficacy and safety of TDV given in a two-dose schedule 3 months apart, with analyses that take into account baseline age and dengue serostatus.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Encephalitis is a serious neurological disorder, yet data on admission rates for all-cause childhood encephalitis in England are scarce. We aimed to estimate admission rates for childhood encephalitis in England over 33 years (1979–2011), to describe trends in admission rates, and to observe how these rates have varied with the introduction of vaccines and improved diagnostics.
Methods
We did a retrospective analysis of hospital admission statistics for encephalitis for individuals aged 0–19 years using national data from the Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE, 1979–85) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES, 1990–2011). We analysed annual age-specific and age-standardised admission rates in single calendar years and admission rate trends for specified aetiologies in relation to introduction of PCR testing and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination. We compared admission rates between the two International Classification of Diseases (ICD) periods, ICD9 (1979–94) and ICD10 (1995–2011).
Findings
We found 16 571 encephalitis hospital admissions in the period 1979–2011, with a mean hospital admission rate of 5·97 per 100 000 per year (95% CI 5·52–6·41). Hospital admission rates declined from 1979 to 1994 (ICD9; annual percentage change [APC] −3·30%; 95% CI −2·88 to −3·66; p<0·0001) and increased between 1995 and 2011 (ICD10; APC 3·30%; 2·75–3·85; p<0·0001). Admissions for measles decreased by 97% (from 0·32 to 0·009) and admissions for mumps encephalitis decreased by 98% (from 0·60 to 0·01) after the introduction of the two-dose MMR vaccine. Hospital admission rates for encephalitis of unknown aetiology have increased by 37% since the introduction of PCR testing.
Interpretation
Hospital admission rates for all-cause childhood encephalitis in England are increasing. Admissions for measles and mumps encephalitis have decreased substantially. The numbers of encephalitis admissions without a specific diagnosis are increasing despite availability of PCR testing, indicating the need for strategies to improve aetiological diagnosis in children with encephalitis.

Background
Zika virus has spread through the Americas and the Caribbean since early 2015 and was rapidly declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO because of the potential association with fetal anomalies. We analysed fetal and maternal fluids and tissues in fetuses with confirmed Zika virus infection prospectively monitored in Martinique, a French Caribbean island.
Methods
Since the beginning of the Zika virus outbreak in Martinique, all pregnant women undergo monthly fetal ultrasound examination surveillance. In this study, we prospectively studied all patients with fetal anomalies and a positive amniotic fluid for Zika virus by RT-PCR. Maternal and fetal blood, urine, amniotic fluid, placenta, and fetal tissues were tested for Zika virus by RT-PCR. Fetal blood was analysed to identify haematological and biological anomalies.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2016, and Nov 10, 2016, we recruited eight cases of Zika virus infection. All but two cases were symptomatic during the first trimester. Fetal anomalies were only detected after 20 weeks' gestation. After an initial positive result, amniocentesis became negative in two cases and fetal blood was transiently Zika virus-positive in six cases. Fetal blood analyses showed a cholestatic pattern, anaemia, and infectious response.
Interpretation
Normalisation of amniotic fluid and fetal blood for Zika virus, as well as maternal blood and urine, shows the limitations of the performance of these investigations, due to the possibility of false negative results. Abnormal fetal blood needs to be investigated further to establish prognostic factors of severe Zika virus infections.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The management of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is a new priority action for the WHO End Tuberculosis (TB) Strategy. However, national guidelines on latent tuberculosis infection testing and treatment have not yet been developed in China. Here, we present the results from the 2-year follow-up of a study that aimed to track the development of active disease in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection, identify priority populations for latent infection management, and explore the most suitable latent infection diagnostic approach.
Methods
A population-based multicentre prospective study was done in four sites in rural China, between 2013 and 2015. The baseline survey in 2013 measured the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection using QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) and tuberculin skin test (TST) in eligible participants. During the follow-up phase between 2014–15, we assessed individuals who had tuberculosis infection at baseline (QFT-positivity or TST tuberculin reaction size [induration] of ≥10 mm) for the development of active disease through active case finding. Eligible participants included in follow-up survey had a birth date before June 1, 2008 (5 years or older in 2013), and continuous residence at the study site for 6 months or longer in the past year. Participants with current active tuberculosis at baseline survey were excluded.
Findings
Between Sept 1, 2013, and Aug 31, 2015, 7505 eligible participants (aged 5 years or older) were included in tuberculosis infection test positive cohorts (4455 were QFT positive, 6404 had TST induration ≥10 mm, and 3354 were positive for both tests) after baseline examination. During the 2-year follow-up period, 84 incident cases of active tuberculosis were diagnosed. Of participants who developed active tuberculosis, 75 were diagnosed with latent infection by QFT, 62 were diagnosed by TST, and 53 were diagnosed by both tests. An incidence rate of 0·87 (95% CI 0·68–1·07) per 100 person-years was observed for individuals who tested positive with QFT, 0·50 (0·38–0·63) per 100 person-years for those who tested positive with TST (p<0·0001), and 0·82 (0·60–1·04) per 100 person-years for those who tested positive with both tests. Male sex and a history of tuberculosis were significantly associated with increased risk of disease development with adjusted hazard ratios of 2·36 (95% CI 1·30–4·30) for male sex and 5·40 (3·34–8·71) for a history of tuberculosis.
Interpretation
Our results suggest that high-risk populations in communities in rural China, such as individuals at a high risk of disease reactivation from previous tuberculosis, should be targeted for latent infection screening and treatment with an interferon-γ releasing assay rather than a TST.

abstract = "Summary
All serious fungal infections need appropriate antifungal therapy for successful patient outcome. Only a few classes of antifungal drugs are available, so the emergence of resistance to single drug classes and now multidrug resistance greatly hampers patient management. Azole resistance among Candida and Aspergillus species is one of the greatest challenges to clinical success, followed by echinocandin and multidrug resistance among some Candida species, especially Candida glabrata. The spread of agriculturally derived azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus and emerging threats such as multidrug resistant Candida auris are also alarming. The molecular mechanisms that cause drug resistance are naturally occurring in less susceptible species and are acquired in strains of susceptible organisms. Drug resistance mechanisms include altered drug-target interactions, reduced cellular drug concentrations mediated by drug efflux transporters, and permeability barriers associated with biofilms. Although C auris is inherently multidrug resistant, other strains typically develop resistance through stepwise selection of multiple drug-resistance mechanisms. Cellular stress induced by drug treatment promotes adaptation, which contributes to breakthrough resistance. Drug exposure also drives the emergence of resistance. An effective antifungal stewardship programme is essential to control drug resistance, and should incorporate rapid fungal diagnostics, therapeutic drug monitoring, and clinical intervention teams. The development of better diagnostic tools and strategies that allow targeted use of antifungals is essential to preserve drug effectiveness."

Background
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) provides an up-to-date analysis of the burden of diarrhoeal diseases. This study assesses cases, deaths, and aetiologies spanning the past 25 years and informs the changing picture of diarrhoeal disease worldwide.
Methods
We estimated diarrhoeal mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm), a modelling platform shared across most causes of death in the GBD 2015 study. We modelled diarrhoeal morbidity, including incidence and prevalence, using a meta-regression platform called DisMod-MR. We estimated aetiologies for diarrhoeal diseases using a counterfactual approach that incorporates the aetiology-specific risk of diarrhoeal disease and the prevalence of the aetiology in diarrhoea episodes. We used the Socio-demographic Index, a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility, to assess trends in diarrhoeal mortality. The two leading risk factors for diarrhoea—childhood malnutrition and unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene—were used in a decomposition analysis to establish the relative contribution of changes in diarrhoea disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
Findings
Globally, in 2015, we estimate that diarrhoea was a leading cause of death among all ages (1·31 million deaths, 95% uncertainty interval [95% UI] 1·23 million to 1·39 million), as well as a leading cause of DALYs because of its disproportionate impact on young children (71·59 million DALYs, 66·44 million to 77·21 million). Diarrhoea was a common cause of death among children under 5 years old (499 000 deaths, 95% UI 447 000–558 000). The number of deaths due to diarrhoea decreased by an estimated 20·8% (95% UI 15·4–26·1) from 2005 to 2015. Rotavirus was the leading cause of diarrhoea deaths (199 000, 95% UI 165 000–241 000), followed by Shigella spp (164 300, 85 000–278 700) and Salmonella spp (90 300, 95% UI 34 100–183 100). Among children under 5 years old, the three aetiologies responsible for the most deaths were rotavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, and Shigella spp. Improvements in safe water and sanitation have decreased diarrhoeal DALYs by 13·4%, and reductions in childhood undernutrition have decreased diarrhoeal DALYs by 10·0% between 2005 and 2015.
Interpretation
At the global level, deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases have decreased substantially in the past 25 years, although progress has been faster in some countries than others. Diarrhoea remains a largely preventable disease and cause of death, and continued efforts to improve access to safe water, sanitation, and childhood nutrition will be important in reducing the global burden of diarrhoea.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) are used in many low-income countries but their impact on the incidence of pneumonia is unclear. The Gambia introduced PCV7 in August, 2009, and PCV13 in May, 2011. We aimed to measure the impact of the introduction of these vaccines on pneumonia incidence.
Methods
We did population-based surveillance and case-control studies. The primary endpoint was WHO-defined radiological pneumonia with pulmonary consolidation. Population-based surveillance was for suspected pneumonia in children aged 2–59 months (minimum age 3 months in the case-control study) between May 12, 2008, and Dec 31, 2015. Surveillance for the impact study was limited to the Basse Health and Demographic Surveillance System (BHDSS), whereas surveillance for the case-control study included both the BHDSS and Fuladu West Health and Demographic Surveillance System. Nurses screened all outpatients and inpatients at all health facilities in the surveillance area using standardised criteria for referral to clinicians in Basse and Bansang. These clinicians recorded clinical findings and applied standardised criteria to identify patients with suspected pneumonia. We compared the incidence of pneumonia during the baseline period (May 12, 2008, to May 11, 2010) and the PCV13 period (Jan 1, 2014, to Dec 31, 2015). We also investigated the effectiveness of PCV13 using case-control methods between Sept 12, 2011, and Sept 31, 2014. Controls were aged 90 days or older, and were eligible to have received at least one dose of PCV13; cases had the same eligibility criteria with the addition of having WHO-defined radiological pneumonia.
Findings
We investigated 18 833 children with clinical pneumonia and identified 2156 cases of radiological pneumonia. Among children aged 2–11 months, the incidence of radiological pneumonia fell from 21·0 cases per 1000 person-years in the baseline period to 16·2 cases per 1000 person-years (23% decline, 95% CI 7–36) in 2014–15. In the 12–23 month age group, radiological pneumonia decreased from 15·3 to 10·9 cases per 1000 person-years (29% decline, 12–42). In children aged 2–4 years, incidence fell from 5·2 to 4·1 cases per 1000 person-years (22% decline, 1–39). Incidence of all clinical pneumonia increased by 4% (–1 to 8), but hospitalised cases declined by 8% (3–13). Pneumococcal pneumonia declined from 2·9 to 1·2 cases per 1000 person-years (58% decline, 22–77) in children aged 2–11 months and from 2·6 to 0·7 cases per 1000 person-years (75% decline, 47–88) in children aged 12–23 months. Hypoxic pneumonia fell from 13·1 to 5·7 cases per 1000 person-years (57% decline, 42–67) in children aged 2–11 months and from 6·8 to 1·9 cases per 1000 person-years (72% decline, 58–82) in children aged 12–23 months. In the case-control study, the best estimate of the effectiveness of three doses of PCV13 against radiological pneumonia was an adjusted odds ratio of 0·57 (0·30–1·08) in children aged 3–11 months and vaccine effectiveness increased with greater numbers of doses (p=0·026). The analysis in children aged 12 months and older was underpowered because there were few unvaccinated cases and controls.
Interpretation
The introduction of PCV in The Gambia was associated with a moderate impact on the incidence of radiological pneumonia, a small reduction in cases of hospitalised pneumonia, and substantial reductions of pneumococcal and hypoxic pneumonia in young children. Low-income countries that introduce PCV13 with reasonable coverage can expect modest reductions in hospitalised cases of pneumonia and a marked impact on the incidence of severe childhood pneumonia.

Since 1989, the USA has been pursuing the goal of tuberculosis elimination. After substantial progress during the past two decades, the rate of tuberculosis cases in the USA each year has now levelled off and remains well above the elimination threshold. Both epidemiological data and modelling underline the necessity of addressing latent tuberculosis infection if further progress is to be made in eliminating the disease. In this Personal View we explore next steps towards elimination. Given the estimated prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection, compared with the limited testing and treatment that currently occur, a major new effort is required. This effort should consist of a surveillance system or registry to monitor progress, scale-up of targeted testing for latent tuberculosis infection in at-risk populations, scale-up of short-course treatment regimens, engagement of affected communities and medical providers who serve those communities, and increased public health staffing for implementation and oversight. Such an effort would benefit greatly from the development of new tools, such as tests that better indicate reactivation risk, and even shorter latent tuberculosis infection treatment regimens than currently exist."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Eradication of poliovirus from endemic countries relies on vaccination of children with oral polio vaccine (OPV) many times a year until the age of 5 years. We aimed to determine caregivers' commitment to OPV in districts of Afghanistan at high risk for polio transmission and to examine what knowledge, attitudes, or experiences could threaten commitment.
Methods
We designed and analysed a poll using face-to-face interviews among caregivers of children under 5 years of age. The sample was drawn via a stratified multistage cluster design with random route household selection. We calculated the percentage of committed and uncommitted caregivers. All percentages were weighted. We then compared percentages of uncommitted caregivers among those with varying knowledge, attitudes, and experiences, using logistic regression to control for possible demographic confounders.
Findings
Between Dec 19, 2014, and Jan 5, 2015, we interviewed 1980 caregivers, 21% of whom were “uncommitted” to accepting OPV. Multiple measures of knowledge, attitudes, and experiences are associated with lack of commitment. For example, compared with their relevant counterparts, caregivers are more likely to be uncommitted if they did not trust vaccinators “a great deal” (54% vs 9%), if they do not know that polio spreads through contaminated water (41% vs 14%), or if they believe rumours that OPV is not halal (50% vs 21%).
Interpretation
To enhance OPV commitment, it might be useful to consider a multifactorial approach that highlights building trust in vaccinators, providing facts about transmission, sharing positive messages to overcome key rumours, and strengthening community support for vaccination.

Fungal infections cause morbidity worldwide and are associated with an unacceptably high mortality despite the availability of antifungal drugs. The incidence of mycoses is rising because of the HIV pandemic and because immunomodulatory drugs are increasingly used to treat autoimmune diseases and cancer. New classes of antifungal drugs have only been partly successful in improving the prognosis for patients with fungal infection. Adjunctive host-directed therapy is therefore believed to be the only option to further improve patient outcomes. Recent advances in the understanding of complex interactions between fungi and host have led to the design and exploration of novel therapeutic strategies in cytokine therapy, vaccines, and cellular immunotherapy, each of which might become viable adjuncts to existing antifungal regimens. In this report, we discuss immunotherapeutic approaches—the rationale behind their design, the challenges in their use, and the progress that is so urgently needed to overcome the devastating effect of fungal diseases."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses has raised concerns about their pandemic potential. Vaccination is the most effective way of preventing influenza. In this study, we investigated the safety and immunogenicity of an avian H5N2 live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV H5N2) in healthy Thai adults and its priming immune responses with an H5N1 inactivated vaccine boost.
Methods
This study was done at the Vaccine Trial Centre at Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand and was divided into two parts. Part 1 consisted of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done over 18 months. We randomly assigned (2:1) healthy Thai adults aged 18–49 years with a computer generated randomisation sequence (blocks of six) to receive either two intranasal doses (0·25 mL per nostril) of LAIV H5N2 (101 participants) or placebo (51 participants) 21 days apart. For part 2, an open-label trial was done in which previously vaccinated participants (40 from LAIV H5N2 group and 20 placebo) were given one intramuscular dose (0·5 mL) of H5N1 booster vaccine. Participants, investigators, and site-study workers were blinded from randomisation. Immune responses after subsequent immunisation were evaluated using haemagglutination-inhibition and microneutralisation assays and circulating follicular T-helper cells and plasmablast cells were measured in serum and whole blood. The trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01841918 and NCT02229357.
Findings
Between Feb 4, 2013, and Feb 28, 2013, 256 individuals were screened, of whom 152 participants were enrolled in part 1 of this study. LAIV H5N2 vaccine was well tolerated. Viral shedding was detected in only six (6%) of 101 participants in the vaccine group 1 day after the first vaccination and in and two (2%) of 98 participants in the group after the second vaccination. There was no serious adverse event in both groups. 51 (50%) of 101 participants in the vaccine group and 28 (55%) of 51 in the placebo group reported at least one adverse event. 80 (84%) of 95 events in the vaccine group and 32 (78%) of 43 events in the placebo groups were reportedly suspected adverse events, probably related to the vaccine; however, most were mild in nature. After two doses of vaccine, 13 (13%) of 100 participants in the vaccine group had an increase in haemagglutination-inhibition titre of more than four-fold and four (4%) of 100 vaccinees developed a rise in neutralisng antibody titre of more than four-fold. 1 year later, after a booster with an inactivated H5N1 vaccine (part 2), 39 (98%) of 40 participants who had previously been vaccinated with LAIV H5N2 had an increase in haemagglutination-inhibition titre of greater than four-fold as early as day 7 compared with three (15%) of 20 participants in the placebo group. Peak geometric mean titre (GMT) for haemagglutination-inhibition antibodies in the previously LAIV H5N2 vaccinated group (566·89 [95% CI 436·97–735·44]) were significantly higher than among those who previously received placebo (25·49 [11·82–54·96]; p<0·0001). The peak GMT by neutralising antibody assay in the H5N2 vaccinated group (1395·85 [1040·79–1872·03]) was also significantly higher than that observed in the placebo group (17·41 [9·05–33·48]; p<0·0001). Importantly, higher cross-reactive haemagglutination-inhibition antibody titres against H5N1 (clades 1, 2.1.3.2, and 2.3.4) were detected in the LAIV H5N2 experienced group than the naive group (p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Our data suggest that LAIV vaccination induces long-lasting memory immune responses. The limitation of this study was that part 2 was designed as a proof-of-concept study by contrast with part 1.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Influenza immunisation during pregnancy is recommended but not widely implemented in some low-income regions. We assessed the safety and efficacy in mothers and infants of year-round maternal influenza immunisation in Nepal, where influenza viruses circulate throughout the year.
Methods
In this phase 4, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled two consecutive sequential annual cohorts of pregnant women from the Sarlahi district in southern Nepal. We randomised mothers 1:1 to receive seasonally recommended trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine or saline placebo in blocks of eight, stratified by gestational age at enrolment (17–25 weeks vs 26–34 weeks). Women were eligible if they were married, 15–40 years of age, 17–34 weeks' gestation at enrolment, and had not previously received any influenza vaccine that season. We collected serum samples before and after immunisation, and cord blood from a subset of women and infants. Staff masked to allocation made home visits every week from enrolment to 6 months after delivery. Midnasal swabs for respiratory virus PCR testing were collected during maternal acute febrile respiratory infections, and from infants with any respiratory symptom. We assessed vaccine immunogenicity, safety, and three primary outcomes: the incidence of maternal influenza-like illness in pregnancy and 0–180 days postpartum, the incidence of low birthweight (<2500 g), and the incidence of laboratory-confirmed infant influenza disease from 0 to 180 days. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01034254.
Findings
From April 25, 2011, to Sept 9, 2013, we enrolled 3693 women in two cohorts of 2090 (1041 assigned to placebo and 1049 to vaccine) and 1603 (805 assigned to placebo and 798 to vaccine), with 3646 liveborn infants (cohort 1, 999 in placebo group and 1010 in vaccine group; cohort 2, 805 in placebo group and 798 in vaccine group). Immunisation reduced maternal febrile influenza-like illness with an overall efficacy of 19% (95% CI 1 to 34) in the combined cohorts; 9% efficacy (−16 to 29) in the first cohort, and 36% efficacy (9 to 55) in the second cohort. For laboratory-confirmed influenza infections in infants aged 0–6 months, immunisation had an overall efficacy for the combined cohorts of 30% (95% CI 5 to 48); in the first cohort, the efficacy was 16% (−19 to 41), and in the second cohort it was 60% (26 to 88). Maternal immunisation reduced the rates of low birthweight by 15% (95% CI 3–25) in both cohorts combined. The rate of small for gestational age infants was not modified by immunisation. The number of adverse events was similar regardless of immunisation status. Miscarriage occurred in three (0·2%) participants in the placebo group versus five (0·3%) in the vaccine group, stillbirth occurred in 31 (1·7%) versus 33 (1·8%), and congenital defects occurred in 18 (1·0%) versus 20 (1·1%). Five women died in the placebo group and three died in the vaccine group. The number of infant deaths at age 0–6 months was similar in each group (50 in the placebo group and 61 in the vaccine group). No serious adverse events were associated with receipt of immunisation.
Interpretation
Year-round maternal influenza immunisation significantly reduced maternal influenza-like illness, influenza in infants, and low birthweight over the entire course of the study, indicating the strategy could be useful in subtropical regions.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Cost and supply constraints are key challenges in the use of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Dose reduction through adsorption to aluminium hydroxide (Al) is a promising option, and establishing its effectiveness in the target population is a crucial milestone in developing IPV-Al. The aim of this clinical trial was to show the non-inferiority of three IPV-Al vaccines to standard IPV.
Methods
In this phase 2, non-inferiority, observer-blinded, randomised, controlled, single-centre trial in the Dominican Republic, healthy infants aged 6 weeks, not previously polio vaccinated, were allocated after computer-generated randomisation by block-size of four, to receive one of four IPV formulations (three-times reduced dose [1/3 IPV-Al], five-times reduced dose [1/5 IPV-Al], ten-times reduced dose [1/10 IPV-Al], or IPV) intramuscularly in the thigh at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. The primary outcome was seroconversion for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 with titres more than or equal to four-fold higher than the estimated maternal antibody titre and more than or equal to 8 after three vaccinations. Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower two-sided 90% CI of the seroconversion rate difference between IPV-Al and IPV was greater than −10%. The safety analyses were based on the safety analysis set (randomly assigned participants who received at least one trial vaccination) and the immunogenicity analyses were based on the per-protocol population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov registration, number NCT02347423.
Findings
Between Feb 2, 2015, and Sept 26, 2015, we recruited 824 infants. The per-protocol population included 820 infants; 205 were randomly assigned to receive 1/3 IPV-Al, 205 to receive 1/5 IPV-Al, 204 to receive 1/10 IPV-Al, and 206 to receive IPV. The proportion of individuals meeting the primary endpoint of seroconversion for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 was already high for the three IPV-Al vaccines after two vaccinations, but was higher after three vaccinations (ie, after completion of the expanded programme of immunisation schedule): 1/3 IPV-Al 98·5% (n=202, type 1), 97·6% (n=200; type 2), and 99·5% (n=204, type 3); 1/5 IPV-Al: 99·5% (n=204, type 1), 96·1% (n=197, type 2), and 98·5% (n=202, type 3); and 1/10 IPV-Al: 98·5% (n=201, type 1), 94·6% (n=193, type 2), and 99·5% (n=203, type 3). All three IPV-Al were non-inferior to IPV, with absolute differences in percentage seroconversion for each poliovirus type being greater than −10% (1/3 IPV-Al type 1, −1·46 [–3·60 to 0·10], type 2, −0·98 [–3·62 to 1·49], and type 3, −0·49 [–2·16 to 0·86]; 1/5 IPV-Al type 1, −0·49 [–2·16 to 0·86], type 2, −2·45 [–5·47 to 0·27], and type 3, −1·46 [–3·60 to 0·10]; and 1/10 IPV-Al type 1, −1·47 [–3·62 to 0·10], type 2, −3·94 [–7·28 to −0·97], and type 3, −0·49 [–2·17 to 0·86]). Three serious adverse events occurred that were unrelated to the vaccine.
Interpretation
The lowest dose (1/10 IPV-Al) of the vaccine performed well both after two and three doses. Based on these results, this new vaccine is under investigation in phase 3 trials.

abstract = "Summary
Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that can cause mainly hepatic and genitourinary damage, depending on the species. Involvement of the lungs has been commonly described in acute infection (Katayama syndrome) and chronic infection (pulmonary hypertension). Although rarely reported in the scientific literature, cases of lung nodules due to chronic schistosome infection are also possible and are probably more frequent than commonly thought. Here we report seven cases of African migrants who were diagnosed with chronic schistosomiasis and pulmonary nodules due to deposition of schistosome eggs, and we compare our findings to the case reports found in the scientific literature. We discuss the management of these patients in a non-endemic setting, beginning with a first fundamental step that is to include parasitic infections, namely schistosomiasis, in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in African immigrants. All patients responded to antiparasitic treatment with praziquantel after a relatively short time. We therefore conclude that lung biopsies and other invasive procedures (performed in the first cases to rule out other potential causes, such as tuberculosis or malignant nodules) can be avoided or postponed."

abstract = "Summary
Fungi often infect mammalian hosts via the respiratory route, but traumatic transcutaneous implantation is also an important source of infections. Environmental exposure to spores of pathogenic fungi can result in subclinical and unrecognised syndromes, allergic manifestations, and even overt disease. After traumatic cutaneous inoculation, several fungi can cause neglected mycoses such as sporotrichosis, chromoblastomycosis, mycetoma, entomophthoramycosis, and lacaziosis. Most of these diseases have a subacute to chronic course and they can become recalcitrant to therapy and lead to physical disabilities, including inability to work, physical deformities, and amputations. For many years, paracoccidioidomycosis was considered the most prevalent endemic systemic mycosis in the Americas, but this situation might be changing with recognition of the worldwide presence of Histoplasma capsulatum. Both paracoccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis can mimic several infectious and non-infectious medical conditions and lead to death if not recognised early and treated. Cutaneous implantation and systemic mycoses are neglected diseases that affect millions of individuals worldwide, especially in low-income countries where their management is suboptimum because challenges in diagnosis and therapeutic options are substantial issues."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) was replaced worldwide from April, 2016, by bivalent types 1 and 3 oral polio vaccine (bOPV) and one dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) where available. The risk of transmission of type 2 poliovirus or Sabin 2 virus on re-introduction or resurgence of type 2 poliovirus after this switch is not understood completely. We aimed to assess the risk of Sabin 2 transmission after a polio vaccination campaign with a monovalent type 2 oral polio vaccine (mOPV2).
Methods
We did an open-label cluster-randomised trial in villages in the Matlab region of Bangladesh. We randomly allocated villages (clusters) to either: tOPV at age 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks; or bOPV at age 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks and either one dose of IPV at age 14 weeks or two doses of IPV at age 14 weeks and 18 weeks. After completion of enrolment, we implemented an mOPV2 vaccination campaign that targeted 40% of children younger than 5 years, regardless of enrolment status. The primary outcome was Sabin 2 incidence in the 10 weeks after the campaign in per-protocol infants who did not receive mOPV2, as assessed by faecal shedding of Sabin 2 by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The effect of previous immunity on incidence was also investigated with a dynamical model of poliovirus transmission to observe prevalence and incidence of Sabin 2 virus. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02477046.
Findings
Between April 30, 2015, and Jan 14, 2016, individuals from 67 villages were enrolled to the study. 22 villages (300 infants) were randomly assigned tOPV, 23 villages (310 infants) were allocated bOPV and one dose of IPV, and 22 villages (329 infants) were assigned bOPV and two doses of IPV. Faecal shedding of Sabin 2 in infants who did not receive the mOPV2 challenge did not differ between children immunised with bOPV and one or two doses of IPV and those who received tOPV (15 of 252 [6%] vs six of 122 [4%]; odds ratio [OR] 1·29, 95% CI 0·45–3·72; p=0·310). However, faecal shedding of Sabin 2 in household contacts was increased significantly with bOPV and one or two doses of IPV compared with tOPV (17 of 751 [2%] vs three of 353 [1%]; OR 3·60, 95% CI 0·82–15·9; p=0·045). Dynamical modelling of within-household incidence showed that immunity in household contacts limited transmission.
Interpretation
In this study, simulating 1 year of tOPV cessation, Sabin 2 transmission was higher in household contacts of mOPV2 recipients in villages receiving bOPV and either one or two doses of IPV, but transmission was not increased in the community as a whole as shown by the non-significant difference in incidence among infants. Dynamical modelling indicates that transmission risk will be higher with more time since cessation.

Background
The sepsis burden on acute care services in middle-income countries is a cause for concern. We estimated incidence, prevalence, and mortality of sepsis in adult Brazilian intensive care units (ICUs) and association of ICU organisational factors with outcome.
Methods
We did a 1-day point prevalence study with follow-up of patients in ICU with sepsis in a nationally representative pseudo-random sample. We produced a sampling frame initially stratified by geographical region. Each stratum was then stratified by hospitals' main source of income (serving general public vs privately insured individuals) and ICU size (ten or fewer beds vs more than ten beds), finally generating 40 strata. In each stratum we selected a random sample of ICUs so as to enrol the total required beds in 1690 Brazilian adult ICUs. We followed up patients until hospital discharge censored at 60 days, estimated incidence from prevalence and length of stay, and generated national estimates. We assessed mortality prognostic factors using random-effects logistic regression models.
Findings
On Feb 27, 2014, 227 (72%) of 317 ICUs that were randomly selected provided data on 2632 patients, of whom 794 had sepsis (30·2 septic patients per 100 ICU beds, 95% CI 28·4–31·9). The ICU sepsis incidence was 36·3 per 1000 patient-days (95% CI 29·8–44·0) and mortality was observed in 439 (55·7%) of 788 patients (95% CI 52·2–59·2). Low availability of resources (odds ratio [OR] 1·67, 95% CI 1·02–2·75, p=0·045) and adequacy of treatment (OR 0·56, 0·37–0·84, p=0·006) were independently associated with mortality. The projected incidence rate is 290 per 100 000 population (95% CI 237·9–351·2) of adult cases of ICU-treated sepsis per year, which yields about 420 000 cases annually, of whom 230 000 die in hospital.
Interpretation
The incidence, prevalence, and mortality of ICU-treated sepsis is high in Brazil. Outcome varies considerably, and is associated with access to adequate resources and treatment. Our results show the burden of sepsis in resource-limited settings, highlighting the need to establish programmes aiming for sepsis prevention, early diagnosis, and adequate treatment.

abstract = "Summary
Background
An outbreak of Zika virus infection was detected in Singapore in August, 2016. We report the first comprehensive analysis of a national response to an outbreak of Zika virus infection in Asia.
Methods
In the first phase of the outbreak, patients with suspected Zika virus infection were isolated in two national referral hospitals until their serum tested negative for the virus. Enhanced vector control and community engagement measures were deployed in disease clusters, including stepped-up mosquito larvicide and adulticide use, community participation in source reduction (destruction of mosquito breeding sites), and work with the local media to promote awareness of the outbreak. Clinical and epidemiological data were collected from patients with confirmed Zika virus infection during the first phase. In the second phase, admission into hospitals for isolation was stopped but vector control efforts continued. Mosquitoes were captured from areas with Zika disease clusters to assess which species were present, their breeding numbers, and to test for Zika virus. Mosquito virus strains were compared with human strains through phylogenetic analysis after full genome sequencing. Reproductive numbers and inferred dates of strain diversification were estimated through Bayesian analyses.
Findings
From Aug 27 to Nov 30, 2016, 455 cases of Zika virus infection were confirmed in Singapore. Of 163 patients with confirmed Zika virus infection who presented to national referral hospitals during the first phase of the outbreak, Zika virus was detected in the blood samples of 97 (60%) patients and the urine samples of 157 (96%) patients. There were 15 disease clusters, 12 of which had high Aedes aegypti breeding percentages. Captured mosquitoes were pooled into 517 pools for Zika virus screening; nine abdomen pools (2%) were positive for Zika virus, of which seven head and thorax pools were Zika-virus positive. In the phylogenetic analysis, all mosquito sequences clustered within the outbreak lineage. The lineage showed little diversity and was distinct from other Asian lineages. The estimated most recent common ancestor of the outbreak lineage was from May, 2016. With the deployment of vector control and community engagement measures, the estimated reproductive number fell from 3·62 (95% CI 3·48–3·77) for July 31 to Sept 1, 2016, to 1·22 (95% CI 1·19–1·24) 4 weeks later (Sept 1 to Nov 24, 2016).
Interpretation
The outbreak shows the ease with which Zika virus can be introduced and spread despite good baseline vector control. Disease surveillance, enhanced vector control, and community awareness and engagement helped to quickly curb further spread of the virus. These intensive measures might be useful for other countries facing the same threat.

abstract = "Summary
Several high-profile outbreaks have drawn attention to invasive fungal infections (IFIs) as an increasingly important public health problem. IFI outbreaks are caused by many different fungal pathogens and are associated with numerous settings and sources. In the community, IFI outbreaks often occur among people without predisposing medical conditions and are frequently precipitated by environmental disruption. Health-care-associated IFI outbreaks have been linked to suboptimal hospital environmental conditions, transmission via health-care workers' hands, contaminated medical products, and transplantation of infected organs. Outbreak investigations provide important insights into the epidemiology of IFIs, uncover risk factors for infection, and identify opportunities for preventing similar events in the future. Well recognised challenges with IFI outbreak recognition, response, and prevention include the need for improved rapid diagnostic methods, the absence of routine surveillance for most IFIs, adherence to infection control practices, and health-care provider awareness. Additionally, IFI outbreak investigations have revealed several emerging issues, including new populations at risk because of travel or relocation, occupation, or immunosuppression; fungal pathogens appearing in geographical areas in which they have not been previously recognised; and contaminated compounded medications. This report highlights notable IFI outbreaks in the past decade, with an emphasis on these emerging challenges in the USA."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Since the publication in 2003 of a model to estimate the disease burden of pertussis, new evidence of the protective effect of incomplete pertussis vaccination against severe pertussis has been reported. We revised the model to provide new estimates of regional and global pertussis cases and deaths for children younger than 5 years.
Methods
We developed a revised model with data from 2014 to estimate pertussis cases and deaths. Pertussis cases were defined according to the WHO clinical case definition, as a coughing illness lasting at least 2 weeks with paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory whooping, or post-tussive vomiting. We used UN population estimates and WHO and UNICEF data on national pertussis immunisation coverage. Estimates were made for vaccine effectiveness against pertussis cases and deaths for one, two, and three doses of vaccination, probability of infection in low and high coverage countries, and case fatality ratios in low and high mortality countries in two age groups: infants younger than 1 year and children aged 1–4 years. We did sensitivity analyses with a range of input parameters to assess the effect of uncertainty of the input parameters on the model outputs.
Findings
We estimated that there were 24·1 million pertussis cases and 160 700 deaths from pertussis in children younger than 5 years in 2014, with the African region contributing the largest proportions (7·8 million [33%] cases and 92 500 [58%] deaths). 5·1 million (21%) estimated pertussis cases and 85 900 (53%) estimated deaths were in infants younger than 1 year. In the sensitivity analyses, the estimated number of cases ranged from 7 million to 40 million and deaths from 38 000 to 670 000.
Interpretation
Our estimates suggest that, compared with the 1999 estimates published in 2003 (30·6 million pertussis cases and 390 000 deaths from pertussis in children younger than 5 years), the numbers of cases and deaths of pertussis have fallen substantially. Model sensitivity emphasised the importance of better surveillance to improve country-level decision making and pertussis control.

Newly proposed candidate Zika virus vaccines might or might not succeed in raising safe, effective, and durable protection against human Zika virus infections or syndromes. Analyses of a clinically tested and licensed dengue vaccine that failed to protect seronegative individuals from breakthrough or enhanced dengue infections suggest that poor T-cell immunity might have contributed to protection failure. Because of the similarity of Zika and dengue viruses, an analogous unwanted outcome might occur with some Zika virus vaccine designs. A successful Zika virus vaccine requires challenge experiments that are done at long intervals after immunisation and that identify protection as the absence of viraemia and the absence of an anamnestic antibody response. T-cell immunity might be an essential component of safe, efficacious, and durable Zika virus vaccines."

abstract = "Summary
WHO estimated that nearly 1 million people become infected every day with any of four curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs): chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis. Despite their high global incidence, STIs remain a neglected area of research. In this Commission, we have prioritised five areas that represent particular challenges in STI treatment and control. Chlamydia remains the most commonly diagnosed bacterial STI in high-income countries despite widespread testing recommendations, sensitive and specific non-invasive testing techniques, and cheap effective therapy. We discuss the challenges for chlamydia control and evidence to support a shift from the current focus on infection-based screening to improved management of diagnosed cases and of chlamydial morbidity, such as pelvic inflammatory disease. The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is globally recognised. We review current and potential future control and treatment strategies, with a focus on novel antimicrobials. Bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal disorder in women, but current treatments are associated with frequent recurrence. Recurrence after treatment might relate to evidence that suggests sexual transmission is integral to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis, which has substantial implications for the development of effective management approaches. STIs disproportionately affect low-income and middle-income countries. We review strategies for case management, focusing on point-of-care tests that hold considerable potential for improving STI control. Lastly, STIs in men who have sex with men have increased since the late 1990s. We discuss the contribution of new biomedical HIV prevention strategies and risk compensation. Overall, this Commission aims to enhance the understanding of some of the key challenges facing the field of STIs, and outlines new approaches to improve the clinical management of STIs and public health."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Numerous population-based studies have documented high prevalence of scabies in overcrowded settings, particularly among children and in tropical regions. We provide an estimate of the global burden of scabies using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2015.
Methods
We identified scabies epidemiological data sources from an extensive literature search and hospital insurance data and analysed data sources with a Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2·1, to yield prevalence estimates. We combined prevalence estimates with a disability weight, measuring disfigurement, itch, and pain caused by scabies, to produce years lived with disability (YLDs). With an assumed zero mortality from scabies, YLDs were equivalent to disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We estimated DALYs for 195 countries divided into 21 world regions, in both sexes and 20 age groups, between 1990 and 2015.
Findings
Scabies was responsible for 0·21% of DALYs from all conditions studied by GBD 2015 worldwide. The world regions of east Asia (age-standardised DALYs 136·32), southeast Asia (134·57), Oceania (120·34), tropical Latin America (99·94), and south Asia (69·41) had the greatest burden of DALYs from scabies. Mean percent change of DALY rate from 1990 to 2015 was less than 8% in all world regions, except North America, which had a 23·9% increase. The five individual countries with greatest scabies burden were Indonesia (age-standardised DALYs 153·86), China (138·25), Timor-Leste (136·67), Vanuatu (131·59), and Fiji (130·91). The largest standard deviations of age-standardised DALYs between the 20 age groups were observed in southeast Asia (60·1), Oceania (58·3), and east Asia (56·5), with the greatest DALY burdens in children, adolescents, and the elderly.
Interpretation
The burden of scabies is greater in tropical regions, especially in children, adolescents, and elderly people. As a worldwide epidemiological assessment, GBD 2015 provides broad and frequently updated measures of scabies burden in terms of skin effects. These global data might help guide research protocols and prioritisation efforts and focus scabies treatment and control measures.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Based on observational studies, administration of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP) for the prevention of surgical site infection (SSI) is recommended within 60 min before incision. However, the precise optimum timing is unknown. This trial compared early versus late administration of SAP before surgery.
Methods
In this phase 3 randomised controlled superiority trial, we included general surgery adult inpatients (age ≥18 years) at two Swiss hospitals in Basel and Aarau. Patients were randomised centrally and stratified by hospital according to a pre-existing computer-generated list in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAP early in the anaesthesia room or late in the operating room. Patients and the outcome assessment team were blinded to group assignment. SAP consisted of single-shot, intravenous infusion of 1·5 g of cefuroxime, a commonly used cephalosporin with a short half-life, over 2–5 min (combined with 500 mg metronidazole in colorectal surgery). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of SSI within 30 days of surgery. The main analyses were by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01790529.
Findings
Between Feb 21, 2013, and Aug 3, 2015, 5580 patients were randomly assigned to receive SAP early (2798 patients) or late (2782 patients). 5175 patients (2589 in the early group and 2586 in the late group) were analysed. Median administration time was 42 min before incision in the early group (IQR 30–55) and 16 min before incision in the late group (IQR 10–25). Inpatient follow-up rate was 100% (5175 of 5175 patients); outpatient 30-day follow-up rate was 88·8% (4596 of 5175), with an overall SSI rate of 5·1% (234 of 4596). Early administration of SAP did not significantly reduce the risk of SSI compared with late administration (odds ratio 0·93, 95% CI 0·72–1·21, p=0·601).
Interpretation
Our findings do not support any narrowing of the 60-min window for the administration of a cephalosporin with a short half-life, thereby obviating the need for increasingly challenging SAP timing recommendations.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The control of Clostridium difficile infections is an international clinical challenge. The incidence of C difficile in England declined by roughly 80% after 2006, following the implementation of national control policies; we tested two hypotheses to investigate their role in this decline. First, if C difficile infection declines in England were driven by reductions in use of particular antibiotics, then incidence of C difficile infections caused by resistant isolates should decline faster than that caused by susceptible isolates across multiple genotypes. Second, if C difficile infection declines were driven by improvements in hospital infection control, then transmitted (secondary) cases should decline regardless of susceptibility.
Methods
Regional (Oxfordshire and Leeds, UK) and national data for the incidence of C difficile infections and antimicrobial prescribing data (1998–2014) were combined with whole genome sequences from 4045 national and international C difficile isolates. Genotype (multilocus sequence type) and fluoroquinolone susceptibility were determined from whole genome sequences. The incidence of C difficile infections caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible isolates was estimated with negative-binomial regression, overall and per genotype. Selection and transmission were investigated with phylogenetic analyses.
Findings
National fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin prescribing correlated highly with incidence of C difficile infections (cross-correlations >0·88), by contrast with total antibiotic prescribing (cross-correlations <0·59). Regionally, C difficile decline was driven by elimination of fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates (approximately 67% of Oxfordshire infections in September, 2006, falling to approximately 3% in February, 2013; annual incidence rate ratio 0·52, 95% CI 0·48–0·56 vs fluoroquinolone-susceptible isolates: 1·02, 0·97–1·08). C difficile infections caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates declined in four distinct genotypes (p<0·01). The regions of phylogenies containing fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were short-branched and geographically structured, consistent with selection and rapid transmission. The importance of fluoroquinolone restriction over infection control was shown by significant declines in inferred secondary (transmitted) cases caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates with or without hospital contact (p<0·0001) versus no change in either group of cases caused by fluoroquinolone-susceptible isolates (p>0·2).
Interpretation
Restricting fluoroquinolone prescribing appears to explain the decline in incidence of C difficile infections, above other measures, in Oxfordshire and Leeds, England. Antimicrobial stewardship should be a central component of C difficile infection control programmes.

Background
On Sept 1, 2008, Scotland launched routine vaccination for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18, targeted at 12–13-year-old girls, of whom 92·4% were fully vaccinated in 2008–09. In this study, we report on vaccine effectiveness of the bivalent vaccine in these vaccinated women who attended for routine cervical screening at age 20–21 years.
Methods
In this 7-year cross-sectional study (covering birth cohorts 1988–1995), we sampled approximately 1000 samples per year from those attending cervical screening at age 20–21 years and tested each for HPV. By linkage to vaccination records we ascertained prevalence by birth cohort and vaccination status. Estimates of vaccine effectiveness for HPV types 16 and 18, HPV types 31, 33, and 45, other high-risk types, and any HPV were calculated using logistic regression.
Findings
In total, 8584 samples were HPV genotyped. Prevalence of HPV types 16 and 18 reduced substantially from 30·0% (95% CI 26·9–33·1) in the 1988 cohort to 4·5% (3·5–5·7) in the 1995 cohort, giving a vaccine effectiveness of 89·1% (85·1–92·3) for those vaccinated at age 12–13 years. All cross-protective types showed significant vaccine effectiveness (HPV type 31, 93·8% [95% CI 83·8–98·5]; HPV type 33, 79·1% [64·2–89·0]; HPV type 45, 82·6% [61·5–93·9]). Unvaccinated individuals born in 1995 had a reduced odds of HPV types 16 and 18 infection compared with those born in 1988 (adjusted odds ratio 0·13 [95% CI 0·06–0·28]) and reduced odds of HPV types 31, 33, and 45 (odds ratio 0·45 [0·23–0·89]).
Interpretation
Bivalent vaccination has led to a startling reduction in vaccine and cross-protective HPV types 7 years after vaccination. There is also evidence of herd protection against the vaccine-specific and cross-protective types in unvaccinated individuals born in 1995. These findings should be considered in cost-effectiveness models informing vaccine choice and models to shape the future of cervical screening programmes.

Background
The 2014–15 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic strained health systems in west Africa already overburdened with other diseases, including malaria. Because EVD and malaria can be difficult to distinguish clinically, and rapid testing was not available in many Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs), guidelines recommended empirical malaria treatment. Little is known, however, about the prevalence and characteristics of patients entering an ETU who were infected with malaria parasites, either alone or concurrently with Ebola virus.
Methods
Data for sociodemographics, disease characteristics, and mortality were analysed for patients with suspected EVD admitted to three ETUs in Sierra Leone using a retrospective cohort design. Testing for Ebola virus was done by real-time PCR and for malaria by a rapid diagnostic test. Characteristics of patients were compared and survival analyses were done to evaluate the effect of infection status on mortality.
Findings
Between Dec 1, 2014, and Oct 15, 2015, 1524 cases were treated at the three ETUs for suspected EVD, of whom 1368 (90%) had diagnostic data for malaria and EVD. Median age of patients was 29 years (IQR 20–44) and 715 (52%) were men. 1114 patients were EVD negative, of whom 365 (33%) tested positive for malaria. Of 254 EVD positive patients, 53 (21%) also tested positive for malaria. Mortality risk was highest in patients diagnosed with both EVD and malaria (35 [66%] of 53 died) and patients diagnosed with EVD alone (105 [52%] of 201 died). Compared with patients presenting to ETUs without malaria or EVD, mortality was increased in the malaria positive and EVD positive group (adjusted hazard ratio 9·36, 95% CI 6·18–14·18, p<0·0001), and the malaria negative and EVD positive group (5·97, 4·44–8·02, p<0·0001), but reduced in the malaria positive and EVD negative group (0·37, 0·20–1·23, p=0·0010).
Interpretation
Malaria parasite co-infection was common in patients presenting to ETUs and conferred an increased mortality risk in patients infected with Ebola virus, supporting empirical malaria treatment in ETUs. The high mortality among patients without EVD or malaria suggests expanded testing and treatment might improve care in future EVD epidemics.

abstract = "Summary
Together with influenza, the non-influenza RNA respiratory viruses (NIRVs), which include respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus, represent a considerable global health burden, as recognised by WHO's Battle against Respiratory Viruses initiative. By contrast with influenza viruses, little is known about the contemporaneous global diversity of these viruses, and the relevance of such for development of pharmaceutical interventions. Although far less advanced than for influenza, antiviral drugs and vaccines are in different stages of development for several of these viruses, but no interventions have been licensed. This scarcity of global genetic data represents a substantial knowledge gap and impediment to the eventual licensing of new antiviral drugs and vaccines for NIRVs. Enhanced genetic surveillance will assist and boost research and development into new antiviral drugs and vaccines for these viruses. Additionally, understanding the global diversity of respiratory viruses is also part of emerging disease preparedness, because non-human coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses have been listed as priority concerns in a recent WHO research and development blueprint initiative for emerging infectious diseases. In this Personal View, we explain further the rationale for expanding the genetic database of NIRVs and emphasise the need for greater investment in this area of research."

abstract = "Summary
The basic reproduction number, R nought (R0), is defined as the average number of secondary cases of an infectious disease arising from a typical case in a totally susceptible population, and can be estimated in populations if pre-existing immunity can be accounted for in the calculation. R0 determines the herd immunity threshold and therefore the immunisation coverage required to achieve elimination of an infectious disease. As R0 increases, higher immunisation coverage is required to achieve herd immunity. In July, 2010, a panel of experts convened by WHO concluded that measles can and should be eradicated. Despite the existence of an effective vaccine, regions have had varying success in measles control, in part because measles is one of the most contagious infections. For measles, R0 is often cited to be 12–18, which means that each person with measles would, on average, infect 12–18 other people in a totally susceptible population. We did a systematic review to find studies reporting rigorous estimates and determinants of measles R0. Studies were included if they were a primary source of R0, addressed pre-existing immunity, and accounted for pre-existing immunity in their calculation of R0. A search of key databases was done in January, 2015, and repeated in November, 2016, and yielded 10 883 unique citations. After screening for relevancy and quality, 18 studies met inclusion criteria, providing 58 R0 estimates. We calculated median measles R0 values stratified by key covariates. We found that R0 estimates vary more than the often cited range of 12–18. Our results highlight the importance of countries calculating R0 using locally derived data or, if this is not possible, using parameter estimates from similar settings. Additional data and agreed review methods are needed to strengthen the evidence base for measles elimination modelling."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Killed whole-cell oral cholera vaccines (kOCVs) are becoming a standard cholera control and prevention tool. However, vaccine efficacy and direct effectiveness estimates have varied, with differences in study design, location, follow-up duration, and vaccine composition posing challenges for public health decision making. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to generate average estimates of kOCV efficacy and direct effectiveness from the available literature.
Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Review Library on July 9, 2016, and ISI Web of Science on July 11, 2016, for randomised controlled trials and observational studies that reported estimates of direct protection against medically attended confirmed cholera conferred by kOCVs. We included studies published on any date in English, Spanish, French, or Chinese. We extracted from the published reports the primary efficacy and effectiveness estimates from each study and also estimates according to number of vaccine doses, duration, and age group. The main study outcome was average efficacy and direct effectiveness of two kOCV doses, which we estimated with random-effect models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016048232.
Findings
Seven trials (with 695 patients with cholera) and six observational studies (217 patients with cholera) met the inclusion criteria, with an average two-dose efficacy of 58% (95% CI 42–69, I2=58%) and effectiveness of 76% (62–85, I2=0). Average two-dose efficacy in children younger than 5 years (30% [95% CI 15–42], I2=0%) was lower than in those 5 years or older (64% [58–70], I2=0%; p<0·0001). Two-dose efficacy estimates of kOCV were similar during the first 2 years after vaccination, with estimates of 56% (95% CI 42–66, I2=45%) in the first year and 59% (49–67, I2=0) in the second year. The efficacy reduced to 39% (13 to 57, I2=48%) in the third year, and 26% (−46 to 63, I2=74%) in the fourth year.
Interpretation
Two kOCV doses provide protection against cholera for at least 3 years. One kOCV dose provides at least short-term protection, which has important implications for outbreak management. kOCVs are effective tools for cholera control.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The mcr-1 gene confers transferable colistin resistance. mcr-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae (MCRPE) have attracted substantial medical, media, and political attention; however, so far studies have not addressed their clinical impact. Herein, we report the prevalence of MCRPE in human infections and carriage, clinical associations of mcr-1-positive Escherichia coli (MCRPEC) infection, and risk factors for MCRPEC carriage.
Methods
We undertook this study at two hospitals in Zhejiang and Guangdong, China. We did a retrospective cross-sectional assessment of prevalence of MCRPE infection from isolates of Gram-negative bacteria collected at the hospitals from 2007 to 2015 (prevalence study). We did a retrospective case-control study of risk factors for infection and mortality after infection, using all MCRPEC from infection isolates and a random sample of mcr-1-negative E coli infections from the retrospective collection between 2012 and 2015 (infection study). We also did a prospective case-control study to assess risk factors for carriage of MCRPEC in rectal swabs from inpatients with MCRPEC and mcr-1 negative at the hospitals and collected between May and December, 2015, compared with mcr-1-negative isolates from rectal swabs of inpatients (colonisation study). Strains were analysed for antibiotic resistance, plasmid typing, and transfer analysis, and strain relatedness.
Findings
We identified 21 621 non-duplicate isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 18 698 inpatients and 2923 healthy volunteers. Of 17 498 isolates associated with infection, mcr-1 was detected in 76 (1%) of 5332 E coli isolates, 13 (<1%) of 348 Klebsiella pneumoniae, one (<1%) of 890 Enterobacter cloacae, and one (1%) of 162 Enterobacter aerogenes. For the infection study, we included 76 mcr-1-positive clinical E coli isolates and 508 mcr-1-negative isolates. Overall, MCRPEC infection was associated with male sex (209 [41%] vs 47 [63%], adjusted p=0·011), immunosuppression (30 [6%] vs 11 [15%], adjusted p=0·011), and antibiotic use, particularly carbapenems (45 [9%] vs 18 [24%], adjusted p=0·002) and fluoroquinolones (95 [19%] vs 23 [30%], adjusted p=0·017), before hospital admission. For the colonisation study, we screened 2923 rectal swabs from healthy volunteers, of which 19 were MCRPEC, and 1200 rectal swabs from patients, of which 35 were MCRPEC. Antibiotic use before hospital admission (p<0·0001) was associated with MCRPEC carriage in 35 patients compared with 378 patients with mcr-1-negative E coli colonisation, whereas living next to a farm was associated with mcr-1-negative E coli colonisation (p=0·03, univariate test). mcr-1 could be transferred between bacteria at high frequencies (10−1 to 10−3), and plasmid types and MCRPEC multi-locus sequence types (MLSTs) were more variable in Guangdong than in Zhejiang and included the human pathogen ST131. MCRPEC also included 17 unreported ST clades.
Interpretation
In 2017, colistin will be formally banned from animal feeds in China and switched to human therapy. Infection with MRCPEC is associated with sex, immunosuppression, and previous antibiotic exposure, while colonisation is also associated with antibiotic exposure. MLST and plasmid analysis shows that MCRPEC are diversely spread throughout China and pervasive in Chinese communities.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The avian influenza A H7N9 virus has caused infections in human beings in China since 2013. A large epidemic in 2016–17 prompted concerns that the epidemiology of the virus might have changed, increasing the threat of a pandemic. We aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics, clinical severity, and time-to-event distributions of patients infected with A H7N9 in the 2016–17 epidemic compared with previous epidemics.
Methods
In this epidemiological study, we obtained information about all laboratory-confirmed human cases of A H7N9 virus infection reported in mainland China as of Feb 23, 2017, from an integrated electronic database managed by the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and provincial CDCs. Every identified human case of A H7N9 virus infection was required to be reported to China CDC within 24 h via a national surveillance system for notifiable infectious diseases. We described the epidemiological characteristics across epidemics, and estimated the risk of death, mechanical ventilation, and admission to the intensive care unit for patients admitted to hospital for routine clinical practice rather than for isolation purpose. We estimated the incubation periods, and time delays from illness onset to hospital admission, illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment, and hospital admission to death or discharge using survival analysis techniques.
Findings
Between Feb 19, 2013, and Feb 23, 2017, 1220 laboratory-confirmed human infections with A H7N9 virus were reported in mainland China, with 134 cases reported in the spring of 2013, 306 in 2013–14, 219 in 2014–15, 114 in 2015–16, and 447 in 2016–17. The 2016–17 A H7N9 epidemic began earlier, spread to more districts and counties in affected provinces, and had more confirmed cases than previous epidemics. The proportion of cases in middle-aged adults increased steadily from 41% (55 of 134) to 57% (254 of 447) from the first epidemic to the 2016–17 epidemic. Proportions of cases in semi-urban and rural residents in the 2015–16 and 2016–17 epidemics (63% [72 of 114] and 61% [274 of 447], respectively) were higher than those in the first three epidemics (39% [52 of 134], 55% [169 of 306], and 56% [122 of 219], respectively). The clinical severity of individuals admitted to hospital in the 2016–17 epidemic was similar to that in the previous epidemics.
Interpretation
Age distribution and case sources have changed gradually across epidemics since 2013, while clinical severity has not changed substantially. Continued vigilance and sustained intensive control efforts are needed to minimise the risk of human infection with A H7N9 virus.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Escherichia coli infections are increasing worldwide in community and hospital settings. The E coli O-antigen is a promising vaccine target. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a bioconjugate vaccine containing the O-antigens of four E coli serotypes (ExPEC4V).
Methods
In this multicentre phase 1b, first-in-human, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned (1:1) healthy adult women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) to receive a single injection of either intramuscular ExPEC4V or placebo. The primary outcome was the incidence of adverse events among vaccine and placebo recipients throughout the study. Secondary outcomes included immunogenicity and antibody functionality, and the incidence of UTIs caused by E coli vaccine serotypes in each group. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02289794.
Findings
Between Jan 20, 2014, and Aug 27, 2014, 93 women received target-dose ExPEC4V and 95 received placebo. The vaccine was well tolerated: no vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred. Overall, 56 (60%) target-dose vaccines and 47 (49%) placebo recipients experienced at least one adverse event that was possibly, probably, or certainly related to injection. Vaccination induced significant IgG responses for all serotypes: at day 30 compared with baseline, O1A titres were 4·6 times higher, O2 titres were 9·4 times higher, O6A titres were 4·9 times higher, and O25B titres were 5·9 times higher (overall p<0·0001). Immune responses persisted at 270 days but were lower than those at 30 days. Opsonophagocytic killing activity showed antibody functionality. No reduction in the incidence of UTIs with 103 or more colony-forming units per mL of vaccine-serotype E coli was noted in the vaccine compared with the placebo group (0·149 mean episodes vs 0·146 mean episodes; p=0·522). In post-hoc exploratory analyses of UTIs with higher bacterial counts (≥105 colony-forming units per mL), the number of vaccine serotype UTIs did not differ significantly between groups (0·046 mean episodes in the vaccine group vs 0·110 mean episodes in the placebo group; p=0·074). However, significantly fewer UTIs caused by E coli of any serotype were noted in the vaccine group compared with the placebo group (0·207 mean episodes vs 0·463 mean episodes; p=0·002).
Interpretation
This tetravalent E coli bioconjugate vaccine candidate was well tolerated and elicited functional antibody responses against all vaccine serotypes. Phase 2 studies have been initiated to confirm these findings.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Evidence of human sexual transmission during Zika virus emergence is a matter of concern, particularly in procreation, but to date, kinetics of seminal shedding and the effects of infection on human reproductive function have not been described. To investigate the effects of Zika virus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and body fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men.
Methods
This prospective observational study recruited men presenting with acute Zika virus infection at Pointe-à-Pitre University Hospital in Guadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred between April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were collected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset, and semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility, vitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations, such as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was processed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected by RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen cells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from different sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures.
Findings
15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years [SD 5; range 25–44) with acute Zika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or urine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median 119 × 106 spermatozoa (IQR 22–234) at day 7 to 45·2 × 106 (16·5–89·6) at day 30 and 70 × 106 (28·5–81·4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus infection. Inhibin values increased from 93·5 pg/mL (IQR 55–162) at day 7 to 150 pg/mL (78–209) at day 120 when total sperm count recovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient separation, Zika virus RNA was found in three of 14 patients at day 7, four of 15 at day 11, and four of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent virus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics seemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most frequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and three patients remained positive at day 120.
Interpretation
Semen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect fertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and epididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen, together with the presence of replicative virus in a motile spermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during sexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems to be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and follow-up.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The once-daily, ribavirin-free, pangenotypic, direct-acting antiviral regimen, glecaprevir coformulated with pibrentasvir, has shown high rates of sustained virological response in phase 2 and 3 studies. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of coformulated glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and compensated cirrhosis.
Methods
We did this single-arm, open-label, multicentre phase 3 study at 40 sites in Belgium, Canada, Germany, South Africa, Spain, and the USA. We enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection and compensated cirrhosis. Patients were either HCV treatment-naive or had not responded to treatment with interferon or pegylated interferon with or without ribavirin, or sofosbuvir plus ribavirin with or without pegylated interferon. Oral glecaprevir (300 mg) coformulated with pibrentasvir (120 mg) was administered once daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virological response at post-treatment week 12 (HCV RNA <15 IU/mL). We assessed efficacy and safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug (intention-to-treat population). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02642432.
Findings
Between Dec 7, 2015, and May 4, 2016, we enrolled 146 patients with compensated cirrhosis, of whom 48 (33%) had genotype 1a HCV infection, 39 (27%) had genotype 1b infection, 34 (23%) had genotype 2 infection, 16 (11%) had genotype 4 infection, two (1%) had genotype 5 infection, and seven (5%) had genotype 6 infection. 12 weeks after treatment, 145 patients (99%, 95% CI 98–100) achieved sustained virological response, with one (1%) relapse at post-treatment week 8. We recorded 101 (69%) adverse events, of which 65 (64%) were mild. The most common adverse events were fatigue (n=28 [19%]) and headache (n=20 [14%]). 11 (8%) patients had serious adverse events, none of which were deemed related to study drugs. No patients had elevations in alanine aminotransferase and no patients prematurely discontinued treatment because of adverse events.
Interpretation
Our results show that 99% of patients treated with once-daily glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir achieved a sustained virological response at 12 weeks. Furthermore, this drug regimen had a favourable safety profile in previously treated or untreated patients with chronic HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection and compensated cirrhosis. These findings could help simplify treatment algorithms and reduce treatment burden.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Efficacy of live oral rotavirus vaccines is reduced in low-income compared with high-income settings. Parenteral non-replicating rotavirus vaccines might offer benefits over oral vaccines. We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of the P2-VP8-P[8] subunit rotavirus vaccine at different doses in South African toddlers and infants.
Methods
This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial was done at a single research unit based at a hospital in South Africa in healthy HIV-uninfected toddlers (aged 2 to <3 years) and term infants (aged 6 to <8 weeks, without previous rotavirus vaccination). Block randomisation (computer-generated, electronic allocation) was used to assign eligible toddlers (in a 6:1 ratio) and infants (in a 3:1 ratio) in each dose cohort (10 μg, followed by 30 μg, then 60 μg if doses tolerated) to parenteral P2-VP8-P[8] subunit rotavirus or placebo injection. The two highest tolerated doses were then assessed in an expanded cohort (in a 1:1:1 ratio). Parents of participants and clinical, data, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment assignment. P2-VP8-P[8] vaccine versus placebo was assessed first in toddlers (single injection) and then in infants (three injections 4 weeks apart). The primary safety endpoints were local and systemic reactions within 7 days after each injection, adverse events within 28 days after each injection, and all serious adverse events, assessed in toddlers and infants who received at least one dose. In infants receiving all study injections, primary immunogenicity endpoints were anti-P2-VP8-P[8] IgA and IgG and neutralising antibody seroresponses and geometric mean titres 4 weeks after the third injection. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02109484.
Findings
Between March 17, 2014, and Sept 29, 2014, 42 toddlers (36 to vaccine and six to placebo) and 48 infants (36 to vaccine and 12 to placebo) were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase, in which the 30 μg and 60 μg doses where found to be the highest tolerated doses. A further 114 infants were enrolled in the expanded cohort between Nov 3, 2014, and March 20, 2015, and all 162 infants (12 assigned to 10 μg, 50 to 30 μg, 50 to 60 μg, and 50 to placebo) were included in the safety analysis. Serum IgA seroresponses were observed in 38 (81%, 95% CI 67–91) of 47 infants in the 30 μg group and 32 (68%, 53–81) of 47 in the 60 μg group, compared with nine (20%, 10–35) of 45 in the placebo group; adjusted IgG seroresponses were seen in 46 (98%, 89–100) of 47 infants in the 30 μg group and 47 (100%; 92–100) of 47 in the 60 μg group, compared with four (9%, 2·5–21) of 45 in the placebo group; and adjusted neutralising antibody seroresponses against the homologous Wa-strain were seen in 40 (85%, 72–94) of 47 infants in both the 30 μg and 60 μg groups, compared with three (7%, 1·4–18) of 45 participants in the placebo group. Solicited reactions following any injection occurred with similar frequency and severity in participants receiving vaccine and those receiving placebo. Unsolicited adverse events were mostly mild and occurred at a similar frequency between groups. Eight serious adverse events (one with placebo, two with 30 μg, and five with 60 μg) occurred in seven infants within 28 days of any study injection, none of which were deemed related to study treatment.
Interpretation
The parenteral P2-VP8-P[8] vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic in infants, providing a novel approach to vaccination against rotavirus disease. On the basis of these results, a phase 1/2 trial of a trivalent P2-VP8 (P[4], P[6], and P[8]) subunit vaccine is underway at three sites in South Africa.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In March, 2016, a flare-up of Ebola virus disease was reported in Guinea, and in response ring vaccination with the unlicensed rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was introduced under expanded access, the first time that an Ebola vaccine has been used in an outbreak setting outside a clinical trial. Here we describe the safety of rVSV-ZEBOV candidate vaccine and operational feasibility of ring vaccination as a reactive strategy in a resource-limited rural setting.
Methods
Approval for expanded access and compassionate use was rapidly sought and obtained from relevant authorities. Vaccination teams and frozen vaccine were flown to the outbreak settings. Rings of contacts and contacts of contacts were defined and eligible individuals, who had given informed consent, were vaccinated and followed up for 21 days under good clinical practice conditions.
Findings
Between March 17 and April 21, 2016, 1510 individuals were vaccinated in four rings in Guinea, including 303 individuals aged between 6 years and 17 years and 307 front-line workers. It took 10 days to vaccinate the first participant following the confirmation of the first case of Ebola virus disease. No secondary cases of Ebola virus disease occurred among the vaccinees. Adverse events following vaccination were reported in 47 (17%) 6–17 year olds (all mild) and 412 (36%) adults (individuals older than 18 years; 98% were mild). Children reported fewer arthralgia events than adults (one [<1%] of 303 children vs 81 [7%] of 1207 adults). No severe vaccine-related adverse events were reported.
Interpretation
The results show that a ring vaccination strategy can be rapidly and safely implemented at scale in response to Ebola virus disease outbreaks in rural settings.

abstract = "Summary
More than 1·6 million people are estimated to die of fungal diseases each year, and about a billion people have cutaneous fungal infections. Fungal disease diagnosis requires a high level of clinical suspicion and specialised laboratory testing, in addition to culture, histopathology, and imaging expertise. Physicians with varied specialist training might see patients with fungal disease, yet it might remain unrecognised. Antifungal treatment is more complex than treatment for bacterial or most viral infections, and drug interactions are particularly problematic. Health systems linking diagnostic facilities with therapeutic expertise are typically fragmented, with major elements missing in thousands of secondary care and hospital settings globally. In this paper, the last in a Series of eight papers, we describe these limitations and share responses involving a combined health systems and public health framework illustrated through country examples from Mozambique, Kenya, India, and South Africa. We suggest a mainstreaming approach including greater integration of fungal diseases into existing HIV infection, tuberculosis infection, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and blindness health programmes; provision of enhanced laboratory capacity to detect fungal diseases with associated surveillance systems; procurement and distribution of low-cost, high-quality antifungal medicines; and concomitant integration of fungal disease into training of the health workforce."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The standard treatment strategy of mass drug administration with ivermectin plus albendazole for lymphatic filariasis cannot be applied in central Africa, because of the risk of serious adverse events in people with high Loa loa microfilaraemia. Thus, alternative strategies are needed. We investigated one such alternative strategy for mass drug administration for elimination of lymphatic filariasis and soil-transmitted helminth infections in Republic of the Congo.
Methods
In 2012, we started a 3 year community trial of biannual mass administration of albendazole in a village in Republic of the Congo. All volunteering inhabitants aged 2 years or older were offered albendazole (400 mg) every 6 months. Infection with Wuchereria bancrofti was diagnosed with a rapid card immunochromatographic test for antigenaemia. People with antigenaemia were tested for microfilaraemia by night blood smears. Individuals were also tested for soil-transmitted helminth infections (ie, hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura) with the Kato-Katz method. Assessment surveys were done at 12, 24, and 36 months. The main outcome measure was change in infection rates from baseline to year 3.
Findings
Therapeutic coverage was more than 80% in all six rounds of mass administration of albendazole. Between 2012 and 2015, W bancrofti antigenaemia and microfilaraemia rates in the community fell significantly, from 17·3% (95% CI 14·7–20·0) to 4·7% (3·3–6·6; p<0·0001) and from 5·3% (3·9–7·1) to 0·3% (0·1–1·2; p<0·0001), respectively. The geometric mean microfilaria count in microfilaraemic people fell from 199·4 (120·4–330·5) per mL in 2012 to 39·1 (95% CIs not computed) per mL in 2015 (p=0·0095). Hookworm infection was undetectable after 1 year. Between 2012 and 2015, the number of A lumbricoides eggs expelled per g of faeces fell from 9844·6 (8209·0–11 480·0) to 724·4 (340·7–1114·2; p<0·0001), and of T trichiura eggs from 1107·4 (878·5–1336·3) to 366·0 (255·7–476·2; p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Our findings strongly support WHO's provisional strategy of biannual mass administration of albendazole to eliminate lymphatic filariasis in areas where loiasis is co-endemic and ivermectin cannot be safely mass administered.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The serotype-specific effectiveness of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) against pneumococcal pneumonia has not been established in people aged 65 years or older. We assessed the effectiveness of PPV23 in this population.
Methods
For this multicentre, prospective study, we enrolled all individuals aged 65 years or older with community-onset pneumonia who visited four study hospitals in Japan between Sept 28, 2011, and Aug 23, 2014. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from sputum and blood samples, and serotyped by the capsular Quellung method. Sputum samples were further tested by PCR assay to identify pneumococcal DNA, and positive samples were examined for 50 serotypes by a nanofluidic real-time PCR assay. Urine samples were tested by a urinary antigen test. Serotype-specific vaccine effectiveness was estimated using the test-negative design.
Findings
2621 eligible patients visited the study hospitals, of whom 585 did not have sputum samples available and were excluded from our analysis. 419 (21%) of 2036 patients were positive for pneumococcal infection (232 by sputum culture, 317 by sputum PCR, 197 by urinary antigen test, and 14 by blood culture). 522 (26%) patients were judged to be vaccinated in the analyses. Effectiveness of PPV23 was 27·4% (95% CI 3·2 to 45·6) against all pneumococcal pneumonia, 33·5% (5·6 to 53·1) against PPV23 serotypes, and 2·0% (−78·9 to 46·3) against non-PPV23 serotypes. Although no significant differences between subgroups were seen, higher protection was noted in people younger than 75 years, women, and individuals with lobar pneumonia or health-care-associated pneumonia.
Interpretation
PPV23 showed low to moderate effectiveness against vaccine serotype pneumococcal pneumonia in people aged 65 years or older. To improve the current pneumococcal vaccination programme, the variability of PPV23 effectiveness in different groups of older people must be further investigated.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The frequency of asymptomatic infection with Ebola virus is unclear: previous estimates vary and there is no standard test. Asymptomatic infection with Ebola virus could contribute to population immunity, reducing spread. If people with asymptomatic infection are infectious it could explain re-emergences of Ebola virus disease (EVD) without known contact.
Methods
We validated a new oral fluid anti-glycoprotein IgG capture assay among survivors from Kerry Town Ebola Treatment Centre and controls from communities unaffected by EVD in Sierra Leone. We then assessed the seroprevalence of antibodies to Ebola virus in a cross-sectional study of household contacts of the survivors. All household members were interviewed. Two reactive tests were required for a positive result, with a third test to resolve any discrepancies.
Findings
The assay had a specificity of 100% (95% CI 98·9–100; 339 of 339 controls tested negative) and sensitivity of 95·9% (89·8–98·9; 93 of 97 PCR-confirmed survivors tested positive). Of household contacts not diagnosed with EVD, 47·6% (229 of 481) had high level exposure (direct contact with a corpse, body fluids, or a case with diarrhoea, vomiting, or bleeding). Among the contacts, 12·0% (95% CI 6·1–20·4; 11 of 92) with symptoms at the time other household members had EVD, and 2·6% (1·2–4·7; 10 of 388) with no symptoms tested positive. Among asymptomatic contacts, seropositivity was weakly correlated with exposure level.
Interpretation
This new highly specific and sensitive assay showed asymptomatic infection with Ebola virus was uncommon despite high exposure. The low prevalence suggests asymptomatic infection contributes little to herd immunity in Ebola, and even if infectious, would account for few transmissions.

These people often face challenges in accessing quality health care. We did a systematic review of the qualitative literature to identify barriers and facilitators to the uptake of tuberculosis diagnostic and treatment services by people from hard-to-reach populations in all European Union (EU), European Economic Area, EU candidate, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The 12 studies included in this review mainly focused on migrants. Views on perceived susceptibility to and severity of tuberculosis varied widely and included many misconceptions. Stigma and challenges regarding access to health care were identified as barriers to tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment uptake, whereas support from nurses, family, and friends was a facilitator for treatment adherence. Further studies are required to identify barriers and facilitators to the improved identification and management of tuberculosis in hard-to-reach populations to inform recommendations for more effective tuberculosis control programmes."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The high number of survivors from the 2013–16 west African outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has raised several new issues: long-term clinical complications, psychosocial consequences, risks of EVD reactivation, and secondary transmission due to viral persistence in body fluids. We aimed to assess long-term clinical, psychosocial, and viral outcomes in EVD survivors in Guinea.
Methods
In this multidisciplinary observational cohort study, we recruited patients aged 1 year or more in four sites in Guinea (Donka National Hospital, Conakry; Macenta Prefectoral Hospital, Macenta; N'zérékoré Regional Hospital, N'zérékoré; and Forécariah Prefectoral Hospital, Forécariah) following discharge from any Ebola treatment centre in Guinea. Eligible patients had had laboratory-confirmed EVD and had then been declared clear of the virus in the blood. All consenting patients were included, with no exclusion criteria. Trained clinicians assessed patients at enrolment to the cohort, recording clinical symptoms and signs of depression. We did routine blood examinations and examined viral persistence in body fluids using RT-PCR. We did psychological evaluations using questionnaires developed for different age groups. Follow-up is planned to 2 years, and here we present findings at enrolment.
Findings
Between March 23, 2015, and July 11, 2016, we recruited 802 patients, of whom 360 (45%) were male, 442 (55%) were female; 158 (20%) were younger than 18 years. The median age was 28·4 years (range 1·0–79·9, IQR 19·4–39·8). The median delay after discharge was 350 days (IQR 223–491). The most frequent symptoms were general symptoms (324 [40%] patients), musculoskeletal pain (303 [38%]), headache (278 [35%]), depression (124 [17%] of 713 responses), abdominal pain (178 [22%]), and ocular disorders (142 [18%]). More adults than children had at least one clinical symptom (505 [78%] vs 101 [64%], p<0·0003), ocular complications (124 [19%] vs 18 [11%], p=0·0200), or musculoskeletal symptoms (274 [43%] vs 29 [18%], p<0·0001). A positive RT-PCR in semen was found in ten (5%) of 188 men, at a maximum of 548 days after disease onset. 204 (26%) of 793 patients reported stigmatisation. Ocular complications were more frequent at enrolment than at discharge (142 [18%] vs 61 [8%] patients).
Interpretation
Post-EVD symptoms can remain long after recovery and long-term viral persistence in semen is confirmed. The results justify calls for regular check-ups of survivors at least 18 months after recovery.

The analyses showed that tuberculosis screening by (mobile) chest radiography improved screening coverage and tuberculosis identification, reduced diagnostic delay, and was cost-effective among several hard-to-reach populations. Sputum culture for pre-migration screening and active referral to a tuberculosis clinic improved identification. Furthermore, monetary incentives improved tuberculosis identification and management among drug users and homeless people. Enhanced case management, good cooperation between services, and directly observed therapy improved treatment outcome and compliance. Strong conclusions cannot be drawn because of the heterogeneity of evidence with regard to study population, methodology, and quality."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The persistent circulation of measles in both low-income and high-income countries requires a better characterisation of present epidemiological trends and existing immunity gaps across different sociodemographic settings. Serological surveys, which provide direct measures of population protection against the infection, are underexploited and often supply fragmentary estimates of population immunity. This study aims to investigate how measles immunity has changed over time across different socioeconomic settings, as a result of demographic changes and past immunisation policies.
Methods
For this multi-country modelling analysis, we developed a transmission model to simulate measles circulation during the past 65 years in nine countries with distinct demographic and vaccination histories. The model was calibrated on historical serological data and used to estimate the reduction of disease burden as a result of vaccination and present age-specific residual susceptibility.
Findings
Our model shows that estimated residual susceptibility to measles ranges from 3% in the UK to more than 10% in Kenya and Ethiopia. In high-income countries, such as Italy, Singapore, and South Korea, where routine first-dose administration produced more than 90% of immunised individuals, only about 20% of susceptible individuals are younger than 5 years. We also observed that the reduction in fertility that has occurred during the past decades in high-income countries has contributed to almost half of the reduction in measles incidence. In low-income countries, where fertility is high, the population is younger and routine vaccination has been suboptimum. Susceptible individuals are concentrated in early childhood, with about 60% of susceptible individuals in Ethiopia younger than 10 years. In these countries, Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) were responsible for more than 25% of immunised individuals (up to 45% in Ethiopia), mitigating the consequences of suboptimum routine vaccination coverage.
Interpretation
Future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunisation rates, either by raising first-dose coverage or by making erratic SIAs more frequent and regular. Immunisation campaigns targeting adolescents and adults are required in low-fertility countries, where the susceptibility in these age groups will otherwise sustain measles circulation.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Since 2013, over 100 cases of Mycobacterium chimaera prosthetic valve endocarditis and disseminated disease were notified in Europe and the USA, linked to contaminated heater–cooler units (HCUs) used during cardiac surgery. We did a molecular epidemiological investigation to establish the source of these patients' disease.
Methods
We included 24 M chimaera isolates from 21 cardiac surgery-related patients in Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK, 218 M chimaera isolates from various types of HCUs in hospitals, from LivaNova (formerly Sorin; London, UK) and Maquet (Rastatt, Germany) brand HCU production sites, and unrelated environmental sources and patients, as well as eight Mycobacterium intracellulare isolates. Isolates were analysed by next-generation whole-genome sequencing using Illumina and Pacific Biosciences technologies, and compared with published M chimaera genomes.
Findings
Phylogenetic analysis based on whole-genome sequencing of 250 isolates revealed two major M chimaera groups. Cardiac surgery-related patient isolates were all classified into group 1, in which all, except one, formed a distinct subgroup. This subgroup also comprised isolates from 11 cardiac surgery-related patients reported from the USA, most isolates from LivaNova HCUs, and one from their production site. Isolates from other HCUs and unrelated patients were more widely distributed in the phylogenetic tree.
Interpretation
HCU contamination with M chimaera at the LivaNova factory seems a likely source for cardiothoracic surgery-related severe M chimaera infections diagnosed in Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, the USA, and Australia. Protective measures and heightened clinician awareness are essential to guarantee patient safety.

Background
Cryptococcus is the most common cause of meningitis in adults living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Global burden estimates are crucial to guide prevention strategies and to determine treatment needs, and we aimed to provide an updated estimate of global incidence of HIV-associated cryptococcal disease.
Methods
We used 2014 Joint UN Programme on HIV and AIDS estimates of adults (aged >15 years) with HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage. Estimates of CD4 less than 100 cells per μL, virological failure incidence, and loss to follow-up were from published multinational cohorts in low-income and middle-income countries. We calculated those at risk for cryptococcal infection, specifically those with CD4 less than 100 cells/μL not on ART, and those with CD4 less than 100 cells per μL on ART but lost to follow-up or with virological failure. Cryptococcal antigenaemia prevalence by country was derived from 46 studies globally. Based on cryptococcal antigenaemia prevalence in each country and region, we estimated the annual numbers of people who are developing and dying from cryptococcal meningitis.
Findings
We estimated an average global cryptococcal antigenaemia prevalence of 6·0% (95% CI 5·8–6·2) among people with a CD4 cell count of less than 100 cells per μL, with 278 000 (95% CI 195 500–340 600) people positive for cryptococcal antigen globally and 223 100 (95% CI 150 600–282 400) incident cases of cryptococcal meningitis globally in 2014. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 73% of the estimated cryptococcal meningitis cases in 2014 (162 500 cases [95% CI 113 600–193 900]). Annual global deaths from cryptococcal meningitis were estimated at 181 100 (95% CI 119 400–234 300), with 135 900 (75%; [95% CI 93 900–163 900]) deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, cryptococcal meningitis was responsible for 15% of AIDS-related deaths (95% CI 10–19).
Interpretation
Our analysis highlights the substantial ongoing burden of HIV-associated cryptococcal disease, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Cryptococcal meningitis is a metric of HIV treatment programme failure; timely HIV testing and rapid linkage to care remain an urgent priority.

abstract = "Summary
Most of the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) is considered a region of very low hepatitis A virus (HAV) endemicity; however, geographical differences exist. We did a systematic review with the aim of describing seroprevalence and susceptibility in the general population or special groups in the EU and EEA. We searched databases and public health national institutes websites for HAV seroprevalence records published between Jan 1, 1975, and June 30, 2014, with no language restrictions. An updated search was done on Aug 10, 2016. We defined seroprevalence profiles (very low, low, and intermediate) as the proportion of the population with age-specific anti-HAV antibodies at age 15 and 30 years, and susceptibility profiles (low, moderate, high, and very high) as the proportion of susceptible individuals at age 30 and 50 years. We included 228 studies from 28 of 31 EU and EEA countries. For the period 2000–14, 24 countries had a very low seroprevalence profile, compared with five in 1975–89. The susceptibility among adults ranged between low and very high and had a geographical gradient, with three countries in the low susceptibility category. Since 1975, EU and EEA countries have shown decreasing seropositivity; however, considerable regional variability exists. The main limitations of this study are that the studies retrieved for analysis might not be representative of all EU and EEA publications about HAV and might have poor national representativeness. A large proportion of EU and EEA residents are now susceptible to HAV infection. Our Review supports the need to reconsider specific prevention and control measures, to further decrease HAV circulation while providing protection against the infection in the EU and EEA, and could be used to inform susceptible travellers visiting EU and EEA countries with different HAV endemicity levels."

Immunisation during pregnancy is a relatively new strategy, and is currently limited to tetanus, pertussis, and influenza vaccines. None of these vaccines were developed specifically for use in pregnancy, but they provide an effective method of protecting mothers and young infants. In response to increases in pertussis morbidity and mortality among young infants, several countries have recommended universal tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis immunisation during pregnancy. Similarly, many countries recommend influenza immunisation during pregnancy to reduce the risk of disease for mother and infant. Although scientific evidence to support maternal immunisation against pertussis and influenza is rapidly accumulating, important knowledge gaps remain that need to be addressed by future research, which we have highlighted in this Series paper."

The human respiratory tract is exposed daily to airborne fungi, fungal enzymes, and secondary metabolites. The endemic fungi Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides spp, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and occasionally Aspergillus fumigatus, are primary pulmonary pathogens of otherwise healthy people. Such infections resolve in most people, and only a few infections lead to disease. However, many fungi are directly allergenic by colonising the respiratory tract or indirectly through contact with cell wall constituents and proteases, causing or exacerbating allergic disease. Increasing evidence implicates high indoor fungal exposures as a precipitant of asthma in children and in worsening asthma symptoms. Lung or airways infection by endemic fungi or aspergillus can be diagnosed with respiratory sample culture or serum IgG testing. Sputum, induced sputum, or bronchial specimens are all suitable specimens for detecting fungi; microscopy, fungal culture, galactomannan antigen, and aspergillus PCR are useful tests. Antifungal treatment is indicated in almost all patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary infections, chronic invasive and granulomatous rhinosinusitis, and aspergillus bronchitis. Most patients with fungal asthma benefit from antifungal therapy. Adverse reactions to oral azoles, drug interactions, and azole resistance in Aspergillus spp limit therapy. Environmental exposures, genetic factors, and structural pulmonary risk factors probably underlie disease but are poorly understood."

International air travel is increasingly affecting the epidemiology of infectious diseases. A particular public health, economic, and political concern is the role of air travel in bringing infectious passengers or vectors to previously non-endemic areas. Yet, little research has been done to investigate either the infection risks associated with air travel or the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of infection control measures on aircraft and at borders. We briefly review the interface between international and national legislation, policy, and guidelines in the context of existing infection risks and possible scenarios. We have found that public health guidance and legislation, which airlines are required to follow, are often contradictory and confusing. Infection control measures for air travel need to be underpinned by coherent and enforceable national and international legislation that is based on solid epidemiological evidence. We recommend further research investment into more effective on-board vector control, health screening, and risk communications strategies, and the development of enforceable and harmonised international legislation."

Background
Dengue is a major public health challenge in Brazil. We assessed the relationship between symptomatic dengue infection during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes in the country between 2007 and 2013.
Methods
We did a retrospective observational cohort study using information reported in the Brazilian national reportable disease information system (SINAN) and the livebirth information system (SINASC) databases. We probabilistically linked confirmed dengue-positive and dengue-negative pregnancies with live childbirths using Fine-Grained Record Integration and Linkage (FRIL) software. We also included an external reference population of randomly selected newborn babies. Pregnancy was adopted as the unit of analysis. We assessed the relationship between symptomatic dengue infection during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes, using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for relevant covariates.
Findings
3898 dengue-positive pregnant women, 3165 dengue-negative women, and 3898 newborn babies from the reference population were included in the analysis. Preterm birth occurred in 322 (8·4%) of 3821 cases in the dengue-positive group versus 324 (10·4%) of 3101 in the dengue-negative group (unadjusted analysis: relative risk [RR] 0·81, 95% CI 0·70–0·93; adjusted analysis: odds ratio [OR] 1·26, 95% CI 1·06–1·49, p=0·006) and 349 (9·1%) of 3818 in the reference population (RR 0·92, 0·80–1·07; OR 0·98, 0·83–1·16, p=0·84). The prevalence of low birthweight (<2500 g) was similar for dengue-positive women and dengue-negative women (8·3% [322 of 3897] vs 9·8% [310 of 3163]; OR 1·17, 95% CI 0·99–1·39, p=0·07), and in the reference population (8·3% vs 9·0% [350 of 3895]; OR 1·00, 0·85–1·17, p=0·97). The prevalence of malformations did not differ significantly for the dengue-positive group (27 [0·7%] of 3789) versus the dengue-negative group (27 [0·9%] of 3059, p=0·51) or versus the reference population (32 [0·9%] of 3738, p=0·56).
Interpretation
In the adjusted analysis, the risk of preterm birth seems to be increased in women with symptomatic dengue infection during pregnancy. However, symptomatic dengue infection during pregnancy does not appear to be associated with congenital malformations or low birthweight.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The best available treatment against carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of appropriate therapy and of appropriate combination therapy on mortality of patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to CPE.
Methods
In this retrospective cohort study, we included patients with clinically significant monomicrobial BSIs due to CPE from the INCREMENT cohort, recruited from 26 tertiary hospitals in ten countries. Exclusion criteria were missing key data, death sooner than 24 h after the index date, therapy with an active antibiotic for at least 2 days when blood cultures were taken, and subsequent episodes in the same patient. We compared 30 day all-cause mortality between patients receiving appropriate (including an active drug against the blood isolate and started in the first 5 days after infection) or inappropriate therapy, and for patients receiving appropriate therapy, between those receiving active monotherapy (only one active drug) or combination therapy (more than one). We used a propensity score for receiving combination therapy and a validated mortality score (INCREMENT-CPE mortality score) to control for confounders in Cox regression analyses. We stratified analyses of combination therapy according to INCREMENT-CPE mortality score (0–7 [low mortality score] vs 8–15 [high mortality score]). INCREMENT is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01764490.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2013, 480 patients with BSIs due to CPE were enrolled in the INCREMENT cohort, of whom we included 437 (91%) in this study. 343 (78%) patients received appropriate therapy compared with 94 (22%) who received inappropriate therapy. The most frequent organism was Klebsiella pneumoniae (375 [86%] of 437; 291 [85%] of 343 patients receiving appropriate therapy vs 84 [89%] of 94 receiving inappropriate therapy) and the most frequent carbapenemase was K pneumoniae carbapenemase (329 [75%]; 253 [74%] vs 76 [81%]). Appropriate therapy was associated with lower mortality than was inappropriate therapy (132 [38·5%] of 343 patients died vs 57 [60·6%] of 94; absolute difference 22·1% [95% CI 11·0–33·3]; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·45 [95% CI 0·33–0·62]; p<0·0001). Among those receiving appropriate therapy, 135 (39%) received combination therapy and 208 (61%) received monotherapy. Overall mortality was not different between those receiving combination therapy or monotherapy (47 [35%] of 135 vs 85 [41%] of 208; adjusted HR 1·63 [95% CI 0·67–3·91]; p=0·28). However, combination therapy was associated with lower mortality than was monotherapy in the high-mortality-score stratum (30 [48%] of 63 vs 64 [62%] of 103; adjusted HR 0·56 [0·34–0·91]; p=0·02), but not in the low-mortality-score stratum (17 [24%] of 72 vs 21 [20%] of 105; adjusted odds ratio 1·21 [0·56–2·56]; p=0·62).
Interpretation
Appropriate therapy was associated with a protective effect on mortality among patients with BSIs due to CPE. Combination therapy was associated with improved survival only in patients with a high mortality score. Patients with BSIs due to CPE should receive active therapy as soon as they are diagnosed, and monotherapy should be considered for those in the low-mortality-score stratum.

Background
Antibiotic stewardship programmes have been shown to reduce antibiotic use and hospital costs. We aimed to evaluate evidence of the effect of antibiotic stewardship on the incidence of infections and colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science for studies published from Jan 1, 1960, to May 31, 2016, that analysed the effect of antibiotic stewardship programmes on the incidence of infection and colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and Clostridium difficile infections in hospital inpatients. Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials and extracted data. Studies involving long-term care facilities were excluded. The main outcomes were incidence ratios (IRs) of target infections and colonisation per 1000 patient-days before and after implementation of antibiotic stewardship. Meta-analyses were done with random-effect models and heterogeneity was calculated with the I2 method.
Findings
We included 32 studies in the meta-analysis, comprising 9 056 241 patient-days and 159 estimates of IRs. Antibiotic stewardship programmes reduced the incidence of infections and colonisation with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (51% reduction; IR 0·49, 95% CI 0·35–0·68; p<0·0001), extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria (48%; 0·52, 0·27–0·98; p=0·0428), and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (37%; 0·63, 0·45–0·88; p=0·0065), as well as the incidence of C difficile infections (32%; 0·68, 0·53–0·88; p=0·0029). Antibiotic stewardship programmes were more effective when implemented with infection control measures (IR 0·69, 0·54–0·88; p=0·0030), especially hand-hygiene interventions (0·34, 0·21–0·54; p<0·0001), than when implemented alone. Antibiotic stewardship did not affect the IRs of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and quinolone-resistant and aminoglycoside-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Significant heterogeneity between studies was detected, which was partly explained by the type of interventions and co-resistance patterns of the target bacteria.
Interpretation
Antibiotic stewardship programmes significantly reduce the incidence of infections and colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and C difficile infections in hospital inpatients. These results provide stakeholders and policy makers with evidence for implementation of antibiotic stewardship interventions to reduce the burden of infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

abstract = "Summary
Leprosy is present in more than 100 countries, where it remains a major cause of peripheral neuropathy and disability. Attempts to eliminate the disease have faced various obstacles, including characteristics of the causative bacillus Mycobacterium leprae: the long incubation period, limited knowledge about its mode of transmission, and its poor growth on culture media. Fortunately, the leprosy bacillus is sensitive to several antibiotics. The first antibiotic to be widely used for leprosy treatment was dapsone in the 1950s, which had to be taken over several years and was associated with increasing bacterial resistance. Therefore, in 1981, WHO recommended that all registered patients with leprosy should receive combination therapy with three antibiotics: rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone. Global implementation of this highly effective multidrug therapy took about 15 years. In 1985, 5·3 million patients were receiving multidrug therapy; by 1991, this figure had decreased to 3·1 million (a decrease of 42%) and, by 2000, to 597 232 (a decrease of almost 90%). This reduction in the number of patients registered for treatment was due to shortening of the treatment regimen and achievement of 100% coverage with multidrug therapy. This achievement, which owed much to WHO and the donors of the multidrug therapy components, prompted WHO in 1991 to set a global target of less than one case per 10 000 population by 2000 to eliminate the disease as a public health problem. All but 15 countries achieved this target. Since 2000, about 250 000 new cases of leprosy have been detected every year. We believe an all-out campaign by a global leprosy coalition is needed to bring that figure down to zero."

Background
Listeriosis is a severe foodborne infection and a notifiable disease in France. We did a nationwide prospective study to characterise its clinical features and prognostic factors.
Methods
MONALISA was a national prospective observational cohort study. We enrolled eligible cases declared to the National Reference Center for Listeria (all microbiologically proven) between Nov 3, 2009, and July 31, 2013, in the context of mandatory reporting. The outcomes were analysis of clinical features, characterisation of Listeria isolates, and determination of predictors of 3-month mortality or persisting impairment using logistic regression. A hierarchical clustering on principal components was also done for neurological and bacteraemic cases. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01520597.
Findings
We enrolled 818 cases from 372 centres, including 107 maternal–neonatal infections, 427 cases of bacteraemia, and 252 cases of neurolisteriosis. Only five (5%) of 107 pregnant women had an uneventful outcome. 26 (24%) of 107 mothers experienced fetal loss, but never after 29 weeks of gestation or beyond 2 days of admission to hospital. Neurolisteriosis presented as meningoencephalitis in 212 (84%) of 252 patients; brainstem involvement was only reported in 42 (17%) of 252 patients. 3-month mortality was higher for bacteraemia than neurolisteriosis (hazard ratio [HR] 0·54 [95% CI 0·41–0·69], p<0·0001). For both bacteraemia and neurolisteriosis, the strongest mortality predictors were ongoing cancer (odds ratio [OR] 5·19 [95% CI 3·01–8·95], p<0·0001), multi-organ failure (OR 7·98 [4·32–14·72], p<0·0001), aggravation of any pre-existing organ dysfunction (OR 4·35 [2·79–6·81], p<0·0001), and monocytopenia (OR 3·70 [1·82–7·49], p=0·0003). Neurolisteriosis mortality was higher in blood-culture positive patients (OR 3·67 [1·60–8·40], p=0·002) or those receiving adjunctive dexamethasone (OR 4·58 [1·50–13·98], p=0·008).
Interpretation
The severity of listeriosis is higher than reported elsewhere. We found evidence of a significantly reduced survival in patients with neurolisteriosis treated with adjunctive dexamethasone, and also determined the time window for fetal losses. MONALISA provides important new data to improve management and predict outcome in listeriosis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infections cause a substantial global disease burden and are epidemiologically correlated. Two previous systematic reviews of the association between HSV-2 and HIV found evidence that HSV-2 infection increases the risk of HIV acquisition, but these reviews are now more than a decade old.
Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase (from Jan 1, 2003, to May 25, 2017) to identify studies investigating the risk of HIV acquisition after exposure to HSV-2 infection, either at baseline (prevalent HSV-2 infection) or during follow-up (incident HSV-2 infection). Studies were included if they were a cohort study, controlled trial, or case-control study (including case-control studies nested within a cohort study or clinical trial); if they assessed the effect of pre-existing HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition; and if they determined the HSV-2 infection status of study participants with a type-specific assay. We calculated pooled random-effect estimates of the association between prevalent or incident HSV-2 infection and HIV seroconversion. We also extended previous investigations through detailed meta-regression and subgroup analyses. In particular, we investigated the effect of sex and risk group (general population vs higher-risk populations) on the relative risk (RR) of HIV acquisition after prevalent or incident HSV-2 infection. Higher-risk populations included female sex workers and their clients, men who have sex with men, serodiscordant couples, and attendees of sexually transmitted infection clinics.
Findings
We identified 57 longitudinal studies exploring the association between HSV-2 and HIV. HIV acquisition was almost tripled in the presence of prevalent HSV-2 infection among general populations (adjusted RR 2·7, 95% CI 2·2–3·4; number of estimates [Ne]=22) and was roughly doubled among higher-risk populations (1·7, 1·4–2·1; Ne=25). Incident HSV-2 infection in general populations was associated with the highest risk of acquisition of HIV (4·7, 2·2–10·1; Ne=6). Adjustment for confounders at the study level was often incomplete but did not significantly affect the results. We found moderate heterogeneity across study estimates, which was explained by risk group, world region, and HSV-2 exposure type (prevalent vs incident).
Interpretation
We found evidence that HSV-2 infection increases the risk of HIV acquisition. This finding has important implications for management of individuals diagnosed with HSV-2 infection, particularly for those who are newly infected. Interventions targeting HSV-2, such as new HSV vaccines, have the potential for additional benefit against HIV, which could be particularly powerful in regions with a high incidence of co-infection.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Chloroquine was used for malaria treatment until resistant Plasmodium falciparum was identified. Because 4-aminoquinolines with modified side chains, such as AQ-13, are active against resistant parasites, we compared AQ-13 against artemether plus lumefantrine for treatment of uncomplicated P falciparum malaria.
Methods
We did a randomised, non-inferiority trial. We screened men (≥18 years) with uncomplicated malaria in Missira (northeast Mali) and Bamako (capital of Mali) for eligibility (≥2000 asexual P falciparum parasites per μL of blood). Eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the artemether plus lumefantrine group or AQ-13 group by permuting blocks of four with a random number generator. Physicians and others caring for the participants were masked, except for participants who received treatment and the research pharmacist who implemented the randomisation and provided treatment. Participants received either 80 mg of oral artemether and 480 mg of oral lumefantrine twice daily for 3 days or 638·50 mg of AQ-13 base (two oral capsules) on days 1 and 2, and 319·25 mg base (one oral capsule) on day 3. Participants were monitored for parasite clearance (50 μL blood samples twice daily at 12 h intervals until two consecutive negative samples were obtained) and interviewed for adverse events (once every day) as inpatients during week 1. During the 5-week outpatient follow-up, participants were examined for adverse events and recurrent infection twice per week. All participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and per-protocol analysis, except for those who dropped out in the per-protocol analysis. The composite primary outcome was clearance of asexual parasites and fever by day 7, and absence of recrudescent infection by parasites with the same molecular markers from days 8 to 42 (defined as cure). Non-inferiority was considered established if the proportion of patients who were cured was higher for artemether plus lumefantrine than for AQ-13 and the upper limit of the 95% CI was less than the non-inferiority margin of 15%. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01614964.
Findings
Between Aug 6 and Nov 18, 2013, and between Sept 18 and Nov 20, 2015, 66 Malian men with uncomplicated malaria were enrolled. 33 participants were randomly assigned to each group. There were no serious adverse events (grade 2–4) and asexual parasites were cleared by day 7 in both groups. 453 less-severe adverse events (≤grade 1) were reported: 214 in the combination group and 239 in the AQ-13 group. Two participants withdrew from the AQ-13 group after parasite clearance and three were lost to follow-up. In the artemether plus lumefantrine group, two participants had late treatment failures (same markers as original isolates). On the basis of the per-protocol analysis, the AQ-13 and artemether plus lumefantrine groups had similar proportions cured (28 [100%] of 28 vs 31 [93·9%] of 33; p=0·50) and AQ-13 was not inferior to artemether plus lumefantrine (difference −6·1%, 95% CI −14·7 to 2·4). Proportions cured were also similar between the groups in the intention-to-treat analysis (28 of 33, 84·8% for AQ-13 vs 31 of 33, 93·9% for artemether and lumefantrine; p=0·43) but the upper bound of the 95% CI exceeded the 15% non-inferiority margin (difference 9·1%, 95% CI −5·6 to 23·8).
Interpretation
The per-protocol analysis suggested non-inferiority of AQ-13 to artemether plus lumefantrine. By contrast, the intention-to-treat analysis, which included two participants who withdrew and three who were lost to follow-up from the AQ-13 group, did not meet the criterion for non-inferiority of AQ-13, although there were no AQ-13 treatment failures. Studies with more participants (and non-immune participants) are needed to decide whether widespread use of modified 4-aminoquinolones should be recommended.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The 2014 Zaire Ebola virus outbreak highlighted the need for a safe, effective vaccine with a rapid onset of protection. We report the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-Zaire Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein vaccine (rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP) across a 6 log10 dose range in two sequential cohorts.
Methods
In this phase 1b double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study we enrolled and randomly assigned healthy adults (aged 18–61 years) at eight study sites in the USA to receive a single injection of vaccine or placebo, administered by intramuscular injection. In cohort 1, participants were assigned to receive 3 × 103, 3 × 104, 3 × 105, or 3 × 106 PFU doses of rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP or placebo. In cohort 2, participants were assigned to receive 3 × 106, 9 × 106, 2 × 107, or 1 × 108 PFU doses of rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP or placebo. Participants were centrally allocated by the study statistician to vaccine groups or placebo through computer-generated randomisation lists. The primary safety outcome was incidence of adverse events within 14 days in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned participants who received vaccine or placebo), and the primary outcome for immunogenicity was IgG ELISA antibody titres at day 28 in the per-protocol population. Surveillance was enhanced for arthritis and dermatitis through to day 56. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02314923.
Findings
Between Dec 26, 2014, and June 8, 2015, 513 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned; one was not immunised because of unsuccessful phlebotomy. In cohort 1, 256 participants received vaccine (3 × 103 [n=64], 3 × 104 [n=64], 3 × 105 [n=64], or 3 × 106 PFU [n=64]) and 74 received placebo. In cohort 2, 162 participants received vaccine (3 × 106 [n=20], 9 × 106 [n=47], 2 × 107 [n=47], or 1 × 108 PFU [n=48]) and 20 received placebo. Most adverse events occurred in the first day after vaccination, and were mild to moderate in intensity, of a short duration, and more frequent at high vaccine doses (9 × 106 PFU and greater). At the 2 × 107 PFU dose (used in phase 3 trials), the most common local adverse events versus placebo within the first 14 days were arm pain (57·4% [27 of 47] vs 7·4% [seven of 94]) and local tenderness (59·6% [28 of 47] vs 8·5% [eight of 94]). The most common systemic adverse events at the 2 × 107 PFU dose versus placebo, occurring in the first 14 days, were headache (46·8% [22 of 47] vs 27·7% [26 of 94]), fatigue (38·3% [18 of 47] vs 19·1% [18 of 94]), myalgia (34·0% [16 of 47] vs 10·6% [10 of 94]), subjective fever (29·8% [14 of 47] vs 2·1% [two of 94]), shivering or chills (27·7% [13 of 47] vs 7·4% [seven of 94]), sweats (23·4% [11 of 47] vs 3·2% [three of 94]), joint aches and pain (19·1% [nine of 47] vs 7·4% [seven of 94]), objective fever (14·9% [seven of 47] vs 1·1% [one of 94]), and joint tenderness or swelling (14·9% [seven of 47] vs 2·1% [two of 94]). Self-limited, post-vaccination arthritis occurred in 4·5% (19 of 418) of vaccinees (median onset 12·0 days [IQR 10–14]; median duration 8·0 days [6–15]) versus 3·2% (three of 94) of controls (median onset 15·0 days [6–20]; median duration 47·0 days [37–339]), with no apparent dose relationship. Post-vaccination dermatitis occurred in 5·7% (24 of 418) of vaccinees (median onset 9·0 days [IQR 2–12]; median duration 7·0 days [4–9]) versus 3·2% (three of 94) of controls (median onset 5·0 days [3–53]; median duration 33·0 days [5–370]). A low-level, transient, dose-dependent viraemia occurred in concert with early reactogenicity. Antibody responses were observed in most participants by day 14. IgG and neutralising antibody titres were dose-related (p=0·0003 for IgG ELISA and p<0·0001 for the 60% plaque-reduction neutralisation test [PRNT60] by linear trend). On day 28 at the 2 × 107 PFU dose, the geometric mean IgG ELISA endpoint titre was 1624 (95% CI 1146–2302) and seroconversion was 95·7% (95% CI 85·5–98·8); the geometric mean neutralising antibody titre by PRNT60 was 250 (176–355) and seroconversion was 95·7% (85·5–98·8). These robust immunological responses were sustained for 1 year.
Interpretation
rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP was well tolerated and stimulated a rapid onset of binding and neutralising antibodies, which were maintained through to day 360. The immunogenicity results support selection of the 2 × 107 PFU dose.

Background
The model of infectious disease prevention and control changed significantly in China after the outbreak in 2003 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), but trends and epidemiological features of infectious diseases are rarely studied. In this study, we aimed to assess specific incidence and mortality trends of 45 notifiable infectious diseases from 2004 to 2013 in China and to investigate the overall effectiveness of current prevention and control strategies.
Methods
Incidence and mortality data for 45 notifiable infectious diseases were extracted from a WChinese public health science data centre from 2004 to 2013, which covers 31 provinces in mainland China. We estimated the annual percentage change in incidence of each infectious disease using joinpoint regression.
Findings
Between January, 2004, and December, 2013, 54 984 661 cases of 45 infectious diseases were reported (average yearly incidence 417·98 per 100 000). The infectious diseases with the highest yearly incidence were hand, foot, and mouth disease (114·48 per 100 000), hepatitis B (81·57 per 100 000), and tuberculosis (80·33 per 100 000). 132 681 deaths were reported among the 54 984 661 cases (average yearly mortality 1·01 deaths per 100 000; average case fatality 2·4 per 1000). Overall yearly incidence of infectious disease was higher among males than females and was highest among children younger than 10 years. Overall yearly mortality was higher among males than females older than 20 years and highest among individuals older than 80 years. Average yearly incidence rose from 300·54 per 100 000 in 2004 to 483·63 per 100 000 in 2013 (annual percentage change 5·9%); hydatid disease (echinococcosis), hepatitis C, and syphilis showed the fastest growth. The overall increasing trend changed after 2009, and the annual percentage change in incidence of infectious disease in 2009–13 (2·3%) was significantly lower than in 2004–08 (6·2%).
Interpretation
Although the overall incidence of infectious diseases was increasing from 2004, the rate levelled off after 2009. Effective prevention and control strategies are needed for diseases with the highest incidence—including hand, foot, and mouth disease, hepatitis B, and tuberculosis—and those with the fastest rates of increase (including hydatid disease, hepatitis C, and syphilis).

Group B streptococcus and respiratory syncytial virus are leading causes of infant morbidity and mortality worldwide. No licensed vaccines are available for either disease, but vaccines for both are under development. Severe respiratory syncytial virus disease can be prevented by passively administered antibody. The presence of maternal IgG antibody specific to respiratory syncytial virus is associated with reduced prevalence and severity of respiratory syncytial virus disease in the first few weeks of life, whereas maternal serotype-specific anticapsular antibody is associated with protection against both early-onset and late-onset group B streptococcus disease. Therefore, vaccination in pregnancy might protect infants against both diseases. This report describes what is known about immune protection against group B streptococcus and respiratory syncytial virus, identifies knowledge gaps regarding the immunobiology of both diseases, and aims to prioritise research directions in maternal immunisation."

abstract = "Summary
With transplantation becoming an increasingly routine form of treatment for diverse populations, and with international travel becoming ever more accessible and affordable, the danger of transplantation-mediated helminth infections, exacerbated by coincident immunosuppression, must be considered. In this Review, we attempt to catalogue all clinically-relevant helminthiases that have been reported to coincide with transplantation, whether by transplantation-mediated transmission, reactivation of latent infections in an immunosuppressed context, or possible de-novo infection during the immunosuppressed peritransplant period. Helminthiasis has been reported in cases of kidney, liver, bowel, pancreas, heart, lung, and stem-cell transplant, and blood transfusion. For each helminthiasis, known risk factors, symptoms, and suggested options for screening and treatment are given. We conclude that helminths are a small but important and potentially severe source of disease after transplantation, and, with options for diagnosis and treatment, these pathogens warrant greater consideration during organ implantation. The achievement of immunological tolerance using helminth-derived products is also an exciting future prospect."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Polymyxin antibiotics are used as last-resort therapies to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The plasmid-mediated colistin resistance determinant MCR-1 has been identified in Enterobacteriaceae in China. We did this study to investigate the prevalence of the mcr-1 gene in clinical isolates from patients with bloodstream infections in China.
Methods
Clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were collected from patients with bloodstream infections at 28 hospitals in China, then screened for colistin resistance by broth microdilution and for the presence of the mcr-1 gene by PCR amplification. We subjected mcr-1-positive isolates to genotyping, susceptibility testing, and clinical data analysis. We established the genetic location of mcr-1 with Southern blot hybridisation, and we analysed plasmids containing mcr-1 with filter mating, electroporation, and DNA sequencing.
Findings
2066 isolates, consisting of 1495 E coli isolates and 571 K pneumoniae isolates were collected. Of the 1495 E coli isolates, 20 (1%) were mcr-1-positive, whereas we detected only one (<1%) mcr-1-positive isolate among the 571 K pneumoniae isolates. All mcr-1-positive E coli and K pneumoniae isolates were resistant to colistin, with minimum inhibitory concentrations values in the range of 4–32 mg/L, except for one E coli isolate that had a minimum inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 0·06 mg/L. All 21 mcr-1-positive isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and 20 isolates (95%) were susceptible to the carbapenem and β-lactamase inhibitor combination piperacillin and tazobactam. One mcr-1-positive E coli isolate also produced NDM-5, which confers resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. The 21 mcr-1-positive isolates were clonally diverse and carried mcr-1 on two types of plasmids, a 33 kb IncX4 plasmid and a 61 kb Inc12 plasmid. The 30 day mortality of the patients with bloodstream infections caused by mcr-1-positive isolates was zero.
Interpretation
mcr-1-positive isolates from bloodstream infections were rare, sporadic, and remained susceptible to many antimicrobial agents. E coli, rather than K pneumoniae, was the main host of the mcr-1 gene. Further studies are needed to clarify the clinical impact of this novel resistance gene.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In preparation for the introduction of MenAfriVac, a meningococcal group A conjugate vaccine developed for the African meningitis belt, an enhanced meningitis surveillance network was established. We analysed surveillance data on suspected and confirmed cases of meningitis to quantify vaccine impact.
Methods
We compiled and analysed surveillance data for nine countries in the meningitis belt (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Togo) collected and curated by the WHO Inter-country Support Team between 2005 and 2015. The incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of suspected and confirmed cases in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations were estimated with negative binomial regression models. The relative risk of districts reaching the epidemic threshold of ten per 100 000 per week was estimated according to district vaccination status.
Findings
The incidence of suspected meningitis cases declined by 57% (95% CI 55–59) in vaccinated compared with unvaccinated populations, with some heterogeneity observed by country. We observed a similar 59% decline in the risk of a district reaching the epidemic threshold. In fully vaccinated populations, the incidence of confirmed group A disease was reduced by more than 99%. The IRR for non-A serogroups was higher after completion of MenAfriVac campaigns (IRR 2·76, 95% CI 1·21–6·30).
Interpretation
MenAfriVac introduction has led to substantial reductions in the incidence of suspected meningitis and epidemic risk, and a substantial effect on confirmed group A meningococcal meningitis. It is important to continue strengthening surveillance to monitor vaccine performance and remain vigilant against threats from other meningococcal serogroups and other pathogens.

The burden of dengue is large and growing. More than half of the global population lives in areas with risk of dengue transmission. Uncertainty in burden estimates, however, challenges policy makers' ability to set priorities, allocate resources, and plan for interventions. In this report, the first in a Series on dengue, we explore the estimations of disease and economic burdens of dengue, and the major estimation challenges, limitations, and sources of uncertainty. We also reflect on opportunities to remedy these deficiencies. Point estimates of apparent dengue infections vary widely, although the confidence intervals of these estimates overlap. Cost estimates include different items, are mostly based on a single year of data, use different monetary references, are calculated from different perspectives, and are difficult to compare. Comprehensive estimates that decompose the cost by different stakeholders (as proposed in our framework), that consider the cost of epidemic years, and that account for productivity and tourism losses, are scarce. On the basis of these estimates, we propose the most comprehensive framework for estimating the economic burden of dengue in any region, differentiated by four very different domains of cost items and by three potential stakeholders who bear the costs. This framework can inform future estimations of the economic burden of dengue and generate demand for additional routine administrative data collection, or for systematic incorporation of additional questions in nationally representative surveys in dengue-endemic countries. Furthermore, scholars could use the framework to guide scenario simulations that consider ranges of possible values for cost items for which data are not yet available. Results would be valuable to policy makers and would also raise awareness among communities, potentially improving dengue control efforts."

Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a tick-borne zoonosis caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, is among the most lethal of all infectious diseases in the Americas. In Mexico, the disease was first described during the early 1940s by scientists who carefully documented specific environmental determinants responsible for devastating outbreaks in several communities in the states of Sinaloa, Sonora, Durango, and Coahuila. These investigators also described the pivotal roles of domesticated dogs and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (brown dog ticks) as drivers of epidemic levels of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. After several decades of quiescence, the disease re-emerged in Sonora and Baja California during the early 21st century, driven by the same environmental circumstances that perpetuated outbreaks in Mexico during the 1940s. This Review explores the history of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in Mexico, current epidemiology, and the multiple clinical, economic, and social challenges that must be considered in the control and prevention of this life-threatening illness."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Evidence suggests that the PfKelch13 mutations that confer artemisinin resistance in falciparum malaria have multiple independent origins across the Greater Mekong subregion, which has motivated a regional malaria elimination agenda. We aimed to use molecular genotyping to assess antimalarial drug resistance selection and spread in the Greater Mekong subregion.
Methods
In this observational study, we tested Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Myanmar, northeastern Thailand, southern Laos, and western Cambodia for PfKelch13 mutations and for Pfplasmepsin2 gene amplification (indicating piperaquine resistance). We collected blood spots from patients with microscopy or rapid test confirmed uncomplicated falciparum malaria. We used microsatellite genotyping to assess genetic relatedness.
Findings
As part of studies on the epidemiology of artemisinin-resistant malaria between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2015, we collected 434 isolates. In 2014–15, a single long PfKelch13 C580Y haplotype (−50 to +31·5 kb) lineage, which emerged in western Cambodia in 2008, was detected in 65 of 88 isolates from northeastern Thailand, 86 of 111 isolates from southern Laos, and 14 of 14 isolates from western Cambodia, signifying a hard transnational selective sweep. Pfplasmepsin2 amplification occurred only within this lineage, and by 2015 these closely related parasites were found in ten of the 14 isolates from Cambodia and 15 of 15 isolates from northeastern Thailand. C580Y mutated parasites from Myanmar had a different genetic origin.
Interpretation
Our results suggest that the dominant artemisinin-resistant P falciparum C580Y lineage probably arose in western Cambodia and then spread to Thailand and Laos, outcompeting other parasites and acquiring piperaquine resistance. The emergence and spread of fit artemisinin-resistant P falciparum parasite lineages, which then acquire partner drug resistance across the Greater Mekong subregion, threatens regional malaria control and elimination goals. Elimination of falciparum malaria from this region should be accelerated while available antimalarial drugs still remain effective.

abstract = "Summary
Background
No high-quality trials have provided evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HIV treatment adherence intervention strategies. We therefore examined the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Adherence Improving self-Management Strategy (AIMS) compared with treatment as usual.
Methods
We did a pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial in seven HIV clinics at academic and non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands. Eligible participants were patients with HIV who were either treatment experienced (ie, with ≥9 months on combination antiretroviral therapy [ART] and at risk of viral rebound) or treatment-naive patients initiating their first combination ART regimen. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to either AIMS or treatment as usual (ie, containing a range of common adherence intervention strategies) using a computer-generated randomisation table. Randomisation was stratified by treatment experience (experienced vs naive) and included block randomisation at nurse level with randomly ordered blocks of size four, six, and eight. 21 HIV nurses from the participating clinics received three training sessions of 6 h each (18 h in total) on AIMS and a 1·5 h booster training session at the clinic (two to three nurses per session) after each nurse had seen two to three patients. AIMS was delivered by nurses during routine clinic visits. We did mixed-effects, intent-to-treat analyses to examine treatment effects on the primary outcome of log10 viral load collected at months 5, 10, and 15. The viral load results were exponentiated (with base 10) for easier interpretation. Using cohort data from 7347 Dutch patients with HIV to calculate the natural course of illness, we developed a lifetime Markov model to estimate the primary economic outcome of lifetime societal costs per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01429142).
Findings
We recruited participants between Sept 1, 2011, and April 2, 2013; the last patient completed the study on June 16, 2014. The intent-to-treat sample comprised 221 patients; 109 assigned to AIMS and 112 to treatment as usual. Across the three timepoints (months 5, 10, and 15), log viral load was 1·26 times higher (95% CI 1·04–1·52) in the treatment-as-usual group (estimated marginal mean 44·5 copies per mL [95% CI 35·5–55·9]) than in the AIMS group (estimated marginal mean 35·4 copies per mL [29·9–42·0]). Additionally, AIMS was cost-effective (ie, dominant: cheaper and more effective) since it reduced lifetime societal costs by €592 per patient and increased QALYs by 0·034 per patient.
Interpretation
Findings from preparatory studies have shown that AIMS is acceptable, feasible to deliver in routine care, and has reproducible effects on medication adherence. In this study, AIMS reduced viral load, increased QALYs, and saved resources. Implementation of AIMS in routine clinical HIV care is therefore recommended.

Maternal immunisation has the potential to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases after birth. The success of tetanus, influenza, and pertussis immunisation during pregnancy has led to consideration of additional maternal immunisation strategies to prevent group B streptococcus and respiratory syncytial virus infections, among others. However, many gaps in knowledge regarding the immunobiology of maternal immunisation prevent the optimal design and application of this successful public health intervention. Therefore, we did an innovative landscape analysis to identify research priorities. Key topics were delineated through review of the published literature, consultation with vaccine developers and regulatory agencies, and a collaborative workshop that gathered experts across several maternal immunisation initiatives—group B streptococcus, respiratory syncytial virus, pertussis, and influenza. Finally, a global online survey prioritised the identified knowledge gaps on the basis of expert opinion about their importance and relevance. Here we present the results of this worldwide landscape analysis and discuss the identified research gaps."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Contacts of tuberculosis index cases are at increased risk of developing tuberculosis. Screening, preventive therapy, and surveillance for tuberculosis are underused interventions in contacts, particularly adults. We developed a score to predict risk of tuberculosis in adult contacts of tuberculosis index cases.
Methods
In 2002–06, we recruited contacts aged 15 years or older of index cases with pulmonary tuberculosis who lived in desert shanty towns in Ventanilla, Peru. We followed up contacts for tuberculosis until February, 2016. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to identify index case, contact, and household risk factors for tuberculosis from which to derive a score and classify contacts as low, medium, or high risk. We validated the score in an urban community recruited in Callao, Peru, in 2014–15.
Findings
In the derivation cohort, we identified 2017 contacts of 715 index cases, and median follow-up was 10·7 years (IQR 9·5–11·8). 178 (9%) of 2017 contacts developed tuberculosis during 19 147 person-years of follow-up (incidence 0·93 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 0·80–1·08). Risk factors for tuberculosis were body-mass index, previous tuberculosis, age, sustained exposure to the index case, the index case being in a male patient, lower community household socioeconomic position, indoor air pollution, previous tuberculosis among household members, and living in a household with a low number of windows per room. The 10-year risks of tuberculosis in the low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk groups were, respectively, 2·8% (95% CI 1·7–4·4), 6·2% (4·8–8·1), and 20·6% (17·3–24·4). The 535 (27%) contacts classified as high risk accounted for 60% of the tuberculosis identified during follow-up. The score predicted tuberculosis independently of tuberculin skin test and index-case drug sensitivity results. In the external validation cohort, 65 (3%) of 1910 contacts developed tuberculosis during 3771 person-years of follow-up (incidence 1·7 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 1·4–2·2). The 2·5-year risks of tuberculosis in the low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk groups were, respectively, 1·4% (95% CI 0·7–2·8), 3·9% (2·5–5·9), and 8·6%· (5·9–12·6).
Interpretation
Our externally validated risk score could predict and stratify 10-year risk of developing tuberculosis in adult contacts, and could be used to prioritise tuberculosis control interventions for people most likely to benefit.

Background
Maternal infections during pregnancy can increase the risk of fetal death. Dengue infection is common, but little is known about its role in fetal mortality. We aimed to investigate the association between symptomatic dengue infection during pregnancy and fetal death.
Methods
We did a nested case-control study using obstetrician-collected data from the Brazilian livebirth information system (SINASC), the mortality information system (SIM), and the national reportable disease information system (SINAN). We identified all pregnancies ending in stillbirth and a random sample of livebirths between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2012. We did linkage to determine which mothers were diagnosed with dengue infection during pregnancy. By use of stillbirths as cases and a sample of matched livebirths as a control, we calculated matched odds ratios (mORs) using conditional logistic regression adjusted for maternal age and education.
Findings
275 (0·2%) of 162 188 women who had stillbirths and 1507 (0·1%) of 1 586 105 women who had livebirths were diagnosed with dengue infection during pregnancy. Symptomatic dengue infection during pregnancy almost doubled the odds of fetal death (mOR 1·9, 95% CI 1·6–2·2). The increase in risk was similar when analyses were restricted to laboratory-confirmed cases of dengue infection (1·8, 1·4–2·4). Severe dengue infection increased the risk of fetal death by about five times (4·9, 2·3–10·2).
Interpretation
Symptomatic dengue infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of fetal death. We recommend further epidemiological and biological studies of the association between dengue and poor birth outcomes to measure the burden of subclinical infections and elucidate pathological mechanisms.

Leprosy control has seen little innovation and only limited progress in the past decade. However, research on the disease has increased and important innovations are underway. Here, we comment on efforts to develop tools and approaches to detect leprosy and to stop the transmission of Mycobacterium leprae, the causative bacillus of the disease. The tracing and screening of contacts of known patients with leprosy promises to strengthen early diagnosis, while preventive chemotherapy will reduce the risk of contacts developing the disease by 50–60% within 2 years of administration. Until now, diagnosis has been mainly based on the presence of signs and symptoms, but efforts are underway to develop inexpensive, reliable, point-of-care tests to diagnose infection. Development of a leprosy-specific vaccine that boosts long-lasting T-cell responses is also a research objective. As for launching a programme to interrupt transmission, two interlinked tools—epidemiological modelling and the concept of an investment case—are being developed to explore the feasibility and costs of such a programme and its overall effect on individuals and society. We believe that sustained innovation is needed and that only a combination of tools and approaches holds promise to end M leprae transmission."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) present clinical criteria for the classification of patients with sepsis. We investigated incidence and long-term outcomes of patients diagnosed with these classifications, which are currently unknown.
Methods
We did a retrospective analysis using data from 30 239 participants from the USA who were aged at least 45 years and enrolled in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. Patients were enrolled between Jan 25, 2003, and Oct 30, 2007, and we identified hospital admissions from Feb 5, 2003, to Dec 31, 2012, and applied three classifications: infection and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, elevated sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score from Sepsis-3, and elevated quick SOFA (qSOFA) score from Sepsis-3. We estimated incidence during the study period, in-hospital mortality, and 1-year mortality.
Findings
Of 2593 first infection events, 1526 met SIRS criteria, 1080 met SOFA criteria, and 378 met qSOFA criteria. Incidence was 8·2 events (95% CI 7·8–8·7) per 1000 person-years for SIRS, 5·8 events (5·4–6·1) per 1000 person-years for SOFA, and 2·0 events (1·8–2·2) per 1000 person-years for qSOFA. In-hospital mortality was higher for patients with an elevated qSOFA score (67 [23%] of 295 patients died) than for those with an elevated SOFA score (125 [13%] of 960 patients died) or who met SIRS criteria (128 [9%] of 1392 patients died). Mortality at 1 year after discharge was also highest for patients with an elevated qSOFA score (29·4 deaths [95% CI 22·3–38·7] per 100 person-years) compared with those with an elevated SOFA score (22·6 deaths [19·2–26·6] per 100 person-years) or those who met SIRS criteria (14·7 deaths [12·5–17·2] per 100 person-years).
Interpretation
SIRS, SOFA, and qSOFA classifications identified different incidences and mortality. Our findings support the use of the SOFA and qSOFA classifications to identify patients with infection who are at elevated risk of poor outcomes. These classifications could be used in future epidemiological assessments and studies of patients with infection.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Preventive chemotherapy is the current strategy to control soil-transmitted helminth infections (caused by Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura). But, to improve efficacy and avoid emerging resistance, new drugs are warranted. Tribendimidine has shown good anthelmintic efficacy and is therefore a frontrunner for monotherapy and combination chemotherapy.
Methods
We did a randomised, controlled, single-blinded, non-inferiority trial on Pemba Island, Tanzania, and in Côte d'Ivoire. We recruited adolescents aged 15–18 years from four primary schools on Pemba, and school attendees and non-schoolers from two districts in Côte d'Ivoire. Only hookworm-positive participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to single, oral doses of tribendimidine 400 mg plus placebo (tribendimidine monotherapy), tribendimidine 400 mg plus ivermectin 200 μg/kg, tribendimidine 400 mg plus oxantel pamoate 25 mg/kg, or albendazole 400 mg plus oxantel pamoate 25 mg/kg. Randomisation was done via a computer-generated list in block sizes of four or eight. Participants were asked to provide two stool samples on 2 consecutive days at baseline and again 14–21 days at follow-up. The primary outcome was the difference in egg-reduction rates (ERRs; ie, the geometric mean reduction) in hookworm egg counts between treatment groups, measured by the Kato-Katz technique. Differences in coadministrated treatment groups were assessed for non-inferiority with a margin of −3% to albendazole plus oxantel pamoate based on the available-case population, analysed by intention to treat. Safety was assessed 3 h and 24 h after treatment. This study is registered with ISRCTN (number 14373201).
Findings
Between July 26, and Dec 23, 2016, we treated 636 hookworm-positive participants, and outcome data were available for 601 participants (151 assigned to tribendimidine monotherapy, 154 to tribendimidine plus ivermectin, 148 to tribendimidine plus oxantel pamoate, and 148 to albendazole plus oxantel pamoate). Tribendimidine plus ivermectin was non-inferior to albendazole plus oxantel pamoate (ERRs 99·5% [95% CI 99·2–99·7] vs 96·0% [93·9–97·4]; difference 3·52 percentage points [2·05–5·65]). Likewise, tribendimidine plus oxantel pamoate was non-inferior to albendazole plus oxantel pamoate (ERRs 96·5% [95% CI 94·9 to 97·6] vs 96·0% [93·9 to 97·4]; difference 0·48 percentage points [–1·61 to 2·88]). 3 h after treatment, headache (n=50 [8%]) and vertigo (n=37 [6%]) were the most widely reported symptoms; 24 h after treatment, 50 (8%) patients reported vertigo and 41 (7%) reported headache. Mainly mild adverse events were reported with peak numbers (n=111 [18%]) at 24 h after treatment. Three participants had moderate adverse events 3 h after treatment: two (<1%) had vertigo and one (<1%) had headache, and two had moderate adverse events 24 h after treatment: one (<1%) had vomiting and one (<1%) had vomiting plus diarrhoea.
Interpretation
Tribendimidine in combination with either ivermectin or oxantel pamoate had a similar, non-inferior efficacy profile as albendazole plus oxantel pamoate, hence tribendimidine will be a useful addition to the depleted anthelmintic drug armamentarium.

abstract = "Summary
For decades, arboviral diseases were considered to be only minor contributors to global mortality and disability. As a result, low priority was given to arbovirus research investment and related public health infrastructure. The past five decades, however, have seen an unprecedented emergence of epidemic arboviral diseases (notably dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus disease) resulting from the triad of the modern world: urbanisation, globalisation, and international mobility. The public health emergency of Zika virus, and the threat of global spread of yellow fever, combined with the resurgence of dengue and chikungunya, constitute a wake-up call for governments, academia, funders, and WHO to strengthen programmes and enhance research in aedes-transmitted diseases. The common features of these diseases should stimulate similar research themes for diagnostics, vaccines, biological targets and immune responses, environmental determinants, and vector control measures. Combining interventions known to be effective against multiple arboviral diseases will offer the most cost-effective and sustainable strategy for disease reduction. New global alliances are needed to enable the combination of efforts and resources for more effective and timely solutions."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Bacterial bloodstream infection is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, yet few facilities are able to maintain long-term surveillance. The Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme has done sentinel surveillance of bacteraemia since 1998. We report long-term trends in bloodstream infection and antimicrobial resistance from this surveillance.
Methods
In this surveillance study, we analysed blood cultures that were routinely taken from adult and paediatric patients with fever or suspicion of sepsis admitted to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi from 1998 to 2016. The hospital served an urban population of 920 000 in 2016, with 1000 beds, although occupancy often exceeds capacity. The hospital admits about 10 000 adults and 30 000 children each year. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were done by the disc diffusion method according to British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy guidelines. We used the Cochran-Armitage test for trend to examine trends in rates of antimicrobial resistance, and negative binomial regression to examine trends in icidence of bloodstream infection over time.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 1998, and Dec 31, 2016, we isolated 29 183 pathogens from 194 539 blood cultures. Pathogen detection decreased significantly from 327·1/100 000 in 1998 to 120·2/100 000 in 2016 (p<0·0001). 13 366 (51·1%) of 26 174 bacterial isolates were resistant to the Malawian first-line antibiotics amoxicillin or penicillin, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole; 68·3% of Gram-negative and 6·6% of Gram-positive pathogens. The proportions of non-Salmonella Enterobacteriaceae with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or fluoroquinolone resistance rose significantly after 2003 to 61·9% in 2016 (p<0·0001). Between 2003 and 2016, ESBL resistance rose from 0·7% to 30·3% in Escherichia coli, from 11·8% to 90·5% in Klebsiella spp and from 30·4% to 71·9% in other Enterobacteriaceae. Similarly, resistance to ciprofloxacin rose from 2·5% to 31·1% in E coli, from 1·7% to 70·2% in Klebsiella spp and from 5·9% to 68·8% in other Enterobacteriaceae. By contrast, more than 92·0% of common Gram-positive pathogens remain susceptible to either penicillin or chloramphenicol. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was first reported in 1998 at 7·7% and represented 18·4% of S aureus isolates in 2016.
Interpretation
The rapid expansion of ESBL and fluoroquinolone resistance among common Gram-negative pathogens, and the emergence of MRSA, highlight the growing challenge of bloodstream infections that are effectively impossible to treat in this resource-limited setting.

abstract = "Summary
Re-emergence of chikungunya virus, a mosquito-transmitted pathogen, is of serious public health concern. In the past 15 years, after decades of infrequent, sporadic outbreaks, the virus has caused major epidemic outbreaks in Africa, Asia, the Indian Ocean, and more recently the Caribbean and the Americas. Chikungunya virus is mainly transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions, but the potential exists for further spread because of genetic adaptation of the virus to Aedes albopictus, a species that thrives in temperate regions. Chikungunya virus represents a substantial health burden to affected populations, with symptoms that include severe joint and muscle pain, rashes, and fever, as well as prolonged periods of disability in some patients. The inflammatory response coincides with raised levels of immune mediators and infiltration of immune cells into infected joints and surrounding tissues. Animal models have provided insights into disease pathology and immune responses. Although host innate and adaptive responses have a role in viral clearance and protection, they can also contribute to virus-induced immune pathology. Understanding the mechanisms of host immune responses is essential for the development of treatments and vaccines. Inhibitory compounds targeting key inflammatory pathways, as well as attenuated virus vaccines, have shown some success in animal models, including an attenuated vaccine strain based on an isolate from La Reunion incorporating an internal ribosome entry sequence that prevents the virus from infecting mosquitoes and a vaccine based on virus-like particles expressing envelope proteins. However, immune correlates of protection, as well as the safety of prophylactic and therapeutic candidates, are important to consider for their application in chikungunya infections. In this Review, we provide an update on chikungunya virus with regard to its epidemiology, molecular virology, virus-host interactions, immunological responses, animal models, and potential antiviral therapies and vaccines."

Fungi are major contributors to the opportunistic infections that affect patients with HIV/AIDS. Systemic infections are mainly with Pneumocystis jirovecii (pneumocystosis), Cryptococcus neoformans (cryptococcosis), Histoplasma capsulatum (histoplasmosis), and Talaromyces (Penicillium) marneffei (talaromycosis). The incidence of systemic fungal infections has decreased in people with HIV in high-income countries because of the widespread availability of antiretroviral drugs and early testing for HIV. However, in many areas with high HIV prevalence, patients present to care with advanced HIV infection and with a low CD4 cell count or re-present with persistent low CD4 cell counts because of poor adherence, resistance to antiretroviral drugs, or both. Affordable, rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (as have been developed for cryptococcosis) are urgently needed for pneumocystosis, talaromycosis, and histoplasmosis. Additionally, antifungal drugs, including amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B, and flucytosine, need to be much more widely available. Such measures, together with continued international efforts in education and training in the management of fungal disease, have the potential to improve patient outcomes substantially."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Influenza continues to have a substantial socioeconomic and health impact despite a long established vaccination programme and approved antivirals. Preclinical data suggest that combining antivirals might be more effective than administering oseltamivir alone in the treatment of influenza.
Methods
We did a randomised, double-blind, multicentre phase 2 trial of a combination of oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin versus oseltamivir monotherapy with matching placebo for the treatment of influenza in 50 sites, consisting of academic medical centre clinics, emergency rooms, and private physician offices in the USA, Thailand, Mexico, Argentina, and Australia. Participants who were aged at least 18 years with influenza and were at increased risk of complications were randomly assigned (1:1) by an online computer-generated randomisation system to receive either oseltamivir (75 mg), amantadine (100 mg), and ribavirin (600 mg) combination therapy or oseltamivir monotherapy twice daily for 5 days, given orally, and participants were followed up for 28 days. Blinded treatment kits were used to achieve masking of patients and staff. The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants with virus detectable by PCR in nasopharyngeal swab at day 3, and was assessed in participants who were randomised, had influenza infection confirmed by the central laboratory on a baseline nasopharyngeal sample, and had received at least one dose of study drug. Safety assessment was done in all patients in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01227967.
Findings
Between March 1, 2011, and April 29, 2016, 633 participants were randomly assigned to receive combination antiviral therapy (n=316) or monotherapy (n=317). Seven participants were excluded from analysis: three were not properly randomised, three withdrew from the study, and one was lost to follow-up. The primary analysis included 394 participants, excluding 47 in the pilot phase, 172 without confirmed influenza, and 13 without an endpoint sample. 80 (40·0%) of 200 participants in the combination group had detectable virus at day 3 compared with 97 (50·0%) of 194 (mean difference 10·0, 95% CI 0·2–19·8, p=0·046) in the monotherapy group. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal-related disorders, primarily nausea (65 [12%] of 556 reported adverse events in the combination group vs 63 [11%] of 585 reported adverse events in the monotherapy group), diarrhoea (56 [10%] of 556 vs 64 [11%] of 585), and vomiting (39 [7%] of 556 vs 23 [4%] of 585). There was no benefit in multiple clinical secondary endpoints, such as median duration of symptoms (4·5 days in the combination group vs 4·0 days in the monotherapy group; p=0·21). One death occurred in the study in an elderly participant in the monotherapy group who died of cardiovascular failure 13 days after randomisation, judged by the site investigator as not related to study intervention.
Interpretation
Although combination treatment showed a significant decrease in viral shedding at day 3 relative to monotherapy, this difference was not associated with improved clinical benefit. More work is needed to understand why there was no clinical benefit when a difference in virological outcome was identified.

Background
Plasmodium falciparum sporozite (PfSPZ) Vaccine is a metabolically active, non-replicating, whole malaria sporozoite vaccine that has been reported to be safe and protective against P falciparum controlled human malaria infection in malaria-naive individuals. We aimed to assess the safety and protective efficacy of PfSPZ Vaccine against naturally acquired P falciparum in malaria-experienced adults in Mali.
Methods
After an open-label dose-escalation study in a pilot safety cohort, we did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial based in Donéguébougou and surrounding villages in Mali. We recruited 18–35-year-old healthy adults who were randomly assigned (1:1) in a double-blind manner, with stratification by village and block randomisation, to receive either five doses of 2·7 × 105 PfSPZ or normal saline at days 0, 28, 56, 84, and 140 during the dry season (January to July inclusive). Participants and investigators were masked to group assignments, which were unmasked at the final study visit, 6 months after receipt of the last vaccination. Participants received combined artemether and lumefantrine (four tablets, each containing 20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine, given twice per day over 3 days for a total of six doses) to eliminate P falciparum before the first and last vaccinations. We collected blood smears every 2 weeks and during any illness for 24 weeks after the fifth vaccination. The primary outcome was the safety and tolerability of the vaccine, assessed as local and systemic reactogenicity and adverse events. The sample size was calculated for the exploratory efficacy endpoint of time to first P falciparum infection beginning 28 days after the fifth vaccination. The safety analysis included all participants who received at least one dose of investigational product, whereas the efficacy analyses included only participants who received all five vaccinations. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01988636.
Findings
Between Jan 18 and Feb 24, 2014, we enrolled 93 participants into the main study cohort with 46 participants assigned PfSPZ Vaccine and 47 assigned placebo, all of whom were evaluable for safety. We detected no significant differences in local or systemic adverse events or laboratory abnormalities between the PfSPZ Vaccine and placebo groups, and only grade 1 (mild) local or systemic adverse events occurred in both groups. The most common solicited systemic adverse event in the vaccine and placebo groups was headache (three [7%] people in the vaccine group vs four [9%] in the placebo group) followed by fatigue (one [2%] person in the placebo group), fever (one [2%] person in the placebo group), and myalgia (one [2%] person in each group). The exploratory efficacy analysis included 41 participants from the vaccine group and 40 from the placebo group. Of these participants, 37 (93%) from the placebo group and 27 (66%) from the vaccine group developed P falciparum infection. The hazard ratio for vaccine efficacy was 0·517 (95% CI 0·313–0·856) by time-to-infection analysis (log-rank p=0·01), and 0·712 (0·528–0·918) by proportional analysis (p=0·006).
Interpretation
PfSPZ Vaccine was well tolerated and safe. PfSPZ Vaccine showed significant protection in African adults against P falciparum infection throughout an entire malaria season.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Substantial outbreaks of yellow fever in Angola and Brazil in the past 2 years, combined with global shortages in vaccine stockpiles, highlight a pressing need to assess present control strategies. The aims of this study were to estimate global yellow fever vaccination coverage from 1970 through to 2016 at high spatial resolution and to calculate the number of individuals still requiring vaccination to reach population coverage thresholds for outbreak prevention.
Methods
For this adjusted retrospective analysis, we compiled data from a range of sources (eg, WHO reports and health-service-provider registeries) reporting on yellow fever vaccination activities between May 1, 1939, and Oct 29, 2016. To account for uncertainty in how vaccine campaigns were targeted, we calculated three population coverage values to encompass alternative scenarios. We combined these data with demographic information and tracked vaccination coverage through time to estimate the proportion of the population who had ever received a yellow fever vaccine for each second level administrative division across countries at risk of yellow fever virus transmission from 1970 to 2016.
Findings
Overall, substantial increases in vaccine coverage have occurred since 1970, but notable gaps still exist in contemporary coverage within yellow fever risk zones. We estimate that between 393·7 million and 472·9 million people still require vaccination in areas at risk of yellow fever virus transmission to achieve the 80% population coverage threshold recommended by WHO; this represents between 43% and 52% of the population within yellow fever risk zones, compared with between 66% and 76% of the population who would have required vaccination in 1970.
Interpretation
Our results highlight important gaps in yellow fever vaccination coverage, can contribute to improved quantification of outbreak risk, and help to guide planning of future vaccination efforts and emergency stockpiling.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The role of the operating room's ventilation system in the prevention of surgical site infections (SSIs) is widely discussed, and existing guidelines do not reflect current evidence. In this context, laminar airflow ventilation was compared with conventional ventilation to assess their effectiveness in reducing the risk of SSIs.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and WHO regional medical databases from Jan 1, 1990, to Jan 31, 2014. We updated the search for MEDLINE for the period between Feb 1, 2014, and May 25, 2016. We included studies most relevant to our predefined question: is the use of laminar airflow in the operating room associated with the reduction of overall or deep SSI as outcomes in patients of any age undergoing surgical operations? We excluded studies not relevant to the study question, studies not in the selected languages, studies published before Jan 1, 1990, or after May 25, 2016, meeting or conference abstracts, and studies of which the full text was not available. Data were extracted by two independent investigators, with disagreements resolved through further discussion. Authors were contacted if the full-text article was not available, or if important data or information on the paper's content was absent. Studies were assessed for publication bias. Grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation was used to assess the quality of the identified evidence. Meta-analyses were done with RevMan (version 5.3).
Findings
We identified 1947 records of which 12 observational studies were comparing laminar airflow ventilation with conventional turbulent ventilation in orthopaedic, abdominal, and vascular surgery. The meta-analysis of eight cohort studies showed no difference in risk for deep SSIs following total hip arthroplasty (330 146 procedures, odds ratio [OR] 1·29, 95% CI 0·98–1·71; p=0·07, I2=83%). For total knee arthroplasty, the meta-analysis of six cohort studies showed no difference in risk for deep SSIs (134 368 procedures, OR 1·08, 95% CI 0·77–1·52; p=0·65, I2=71%). For abdominal and open vascular surgery, the meta-analysis of three cohort studies found no difference in risk for overall SSIs (63 472 procedures, OR 0·75, 95% CI 0·43–1·33; p=0·33, I2=95%).
Interpretation
The available evidence shows no benefit for laminar airflow compared with conventional turbulent ventilation of the operating room in reducing the risk of SSIs in total hip and knee arthroplasties, and abdominal surgery. Decision makers, medical and administrative, should not regard laminar airflow as a preventive measure to reduce the risk of SSIs. Consequently, this equipment should not be installed in new operating rooms.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pregnancy increases the risk of harmful effects from cholera for both mothers and their fetuses. A killed oral cholera vaccine, Shanchol (Shantha Biotechnics, Hydrabad, India), can protect against the disease for up to 5 years. However, cholera vaccination campaigns have often excluded pregnant women because of insufficient safety data for use during pregnancy. We did an observational cohort study to assess the safety of Shanchol during pregnancy.
Methods
This observational cohort study was done in two adjacent districts (Nsanje and Chikwawa) in Malawi. Individuals older than 1 year in Nsanje were offered oral cholera vaccine during a mass vaccination campaign between March 30 and April 30, 2015, but no vaccines were administered in Chikwawa. We enrolled women who were exposed to oral cholera vaccine during pregnancy in Nsanje district, and women who were pregnant in Chikwawa district (and thus not exposed to oral cholera vaccine) during the same period. The primary endpoint of our analysis was pregnancy loss (spontaneous miscarriage or stillbirth), and the secondary endpoints were neonatal deaths and malformations. We evaluated these endpoints using log-binomial regression, adjusting for the imbalanced baseline characteristics between the groups. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02499172.
Findings
We recruited 900 women exposed to oral cholera vaccine and 899 women not exposed to the vaccine between June 16 and Oct 10, 2015, and analysed 835 in each group. 361 women exposed to the vaccine and 327 not exposed to the vaccine were recruited after their pregnancies had ended. The incidence of pregnancy loss was 27·54 (95% CI 18·41–41·23) per 1000 pregnancies among those exposed to the vaccine and 21·56 (13·65–34·04) per 1000 among those not exposed. The adjusted relative risk for pregnancy loss among those exposed to oral cholera vaccine was 1·24 (95% CI 0·64–2·43; p=0·52) compared with those not exposed to the vaccine. The neonatal mortality rate was 11·78 (95% CI 5·92–23·46) per 1000 livebirths for infants whose mothers were exposed to oral cholera vaccine versus 8·91 (4·02–19·77) per 1000 livebirths for infants whose mothers were not exposed to the vaccine (crude relative risk 1·32, 95% CI 0·46–3·84; p=0·60). Only three newborn babies had malformations, two in the vaccine exposure group and one in the no-exposure group, yielding a relative risk of 2·00 (95% CI 0·18–22·04; p=0·57), although this estimate is unreliable because of the small number of outcomes.
Interpretation
Our study provides evidence that fetal exposure to oral cholera vaccine confers no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss, neonatal mortality, or malformation. These data, along with findings from two retrospective studies, support use of oral cholera vaccine in pregnant women in cholera-affected regions.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Symptom-based screening for tuberculosis is recommended for all people living with HIV. This recommendation results in unnecessary Xpert MTB/RIF testing in many individuals living in tuberculosis-endemic areas and thus poor implementation of intensified case finding and tuberculosis preventive therapy. Novel approaches to tuberculosis screening are needed to help achieve global targets for tuberculosis elimination. We assessed the performance of C-reactive protein (CRP) measured with a point-of-care assay as a screening tool for active pulmonary tuberculosis.
Methods
For this prospective study, we enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years) living with HIV with CD4 cell count less than or equal to 350 cells per μL who were initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) from two HIV/AIDS clinics in Uganda. CRP concentrations were measured at study entry with a point-of-care assay using whole blood obtained by fingerprick (concentration ≥10 mg/L defined as screen positive for tuberculosis). Sputum samples were collected for Xpert MTB/RIF testing and culture. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of point-of-care CRP and WHO symptom-based screening in reference to culture results. We repeated the sensitivity analysis with Xpert MTB/RIF as the reference standard.
Findings
Between July 8, 2013, and Dec 15, 2015, 1237 HIV-infected adults were enrolled and underwent point-of-care CRP testing. 60 (5%) patients with incomplete or contaminated cultures were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 1177 patients (median CD4 count 165 cells per μL [IQR 75–271]), 163 (14%) had culture-confirmed tuberculosis. Point-of-care CRP testing had 89% sensitivity (145 of 163, 95% CI 83–93) and 72% specificity (731 of 1014, 95% CI 69–75) for culture-confirmed tuberculosis. Compared with WHO symptom-based screening, point-of-care CRP testing had lower sensitivity (difference −7%, 95% CI −12 to −2; p=0·002) but substantially higher specificity (difference 58%, 95% CI 55 to 61; p<0·0001). When Xpert MTB/RIF results were used as the reference standard, sensitivity of point-of-care CRP and WHO symptom-based screening were similar (94% [79 of 84] vs 99% [83 of 84], respectively; difference −5%, 95% CI −12 to 2; p=0·10).
Interpretation
The performance characteristics of CRP support its use as a tuberculosis screening test for people living with HIV with CD4 count less than or equal to 350 cells per μL who are initiating ART. HIV/AIDS programmes should consider point-of-care CRP-based tuberculosis screening to improve the efficiency of intensified case finding and increase uptake of tuberculosis preventive therapy.

abstract = "Summary
Background
A physician is frequently unable to distinguish bacterial from viral infections. ImmunoXpert is a novel assay combining three proteins: tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), interferon gamma induced protein-10 (IP-10), and C-reactive protein (CRP). We aimed to externally validate the diagnostic accuracy of this assay in differentiating between bacterial and viral infections and to compare this test with commonly used biomarkers.
Methods
In this prospective, double-blind, international, multicentre study, we recruited children aged 2–60 months with lower respiratory tract infection or clinical presentation of fever without source at four hospitals in the Netherlands and two hospitals in Israel. A panel of three experienced paediatricians adjudicated a reference standard diagnosis for all patients (ie, bacterial or viral infection) using all available clinical and laboratory information, including a 28-day follow-up assessment. The panel was masked to the assay results. We identified majority diagnosis when two of three panel members agreed on a diagnosis and unanimous diagnosis when all three panel members agreed on the diagnosis. We calculated the diagnostic performance (ie, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value) of the index test in differentiating between bacterial (index test positive) and viral (index test negative) infection by comparing the test classification with the reference standard outcome.
Findings
Between Oct 16, 2013 and March 1, 2015, we recruited 777 children, of whom 577 (mean age 21 months, 56% male) were assessed. The majority of the panel diagnosed 71 cases as bacterial infections and 435 as viral infections. In another 71 patients there was an inconclusive panel diagnosis. The assay distinguished bacterial from viral infections with a sensitivity of 86·7% (95% CI 75·8–93·1), a specificity of 91·1% (87·9–93·6), a positive predictive value of 60·5% (49·9–70·1), and a negative predictive value of 97·8% (95·6–98·9). In the more clear cases with unanimous panel diagnosis (n=354), sensitivity was 87·8% (74·5–94·7), specificity 93·0% (89·6–95·3), positive predictive value 62·1% (49·2–73·4), and negative predictive value 98·3% (96·1–99·3).
Interpretation
This external validation study shows the diagnostic value of a three-host protein-based assay to differentiate between bacterial and viral infections in children with lower respiratory tract infection or fever without source. This diagnostic based on CRP, TRAIL, and IP-10 has the potential to reduce antibiotic misuse in young children.

abstract = "Summary
Background
DSM265 is a novel antimalarial that inhibits plasmodial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme essential for pyrimidine biosynthesis. We investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of DSM265, and tested its antimalarial activity.
Methods
Healthy participants aged 18–55 years were enrolled in a two-part study: part 1, a single ascending dose (25–1200 mg), double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study, and part 2, an open-label, randomised, active-comparator controlled study, in which participants were inoculated with Plasmodium falciparum induced blood-stage malaria (IBSM) and treated with DSM265 (150 mg) or mefloquine (10 mg/kg). Primary endpoints were DSM265 safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. Randomisation lists were created using a validated, automated system. Both parts were registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12613000522718 (part 1) and number ACTRN12613000527763 (part 2).
Findings
In part 1, 73 participants were enrolled between April 12, 2013, and July 14, 2015 (DSM265, n=55; placebo, n=18). In part 2, nine participants were enrolled between Sept 30 and Nov 25, 2013 (150 mg DSM265, n=7; 10 mg/kg mefloquine, n=2). In part 1, 117 adverse events were reported; no drug-related serious or severe events were reported. The most common drug-related adverse event was headache. The mean DSM265 peak plasma concentration (Cmax) ranged between 1310 ng/mL and 34 800 ng/mL and was reached in a median time (tmax) between 1·5 h and 4 h, with a mean elimination half-life between 86 h and 118 h. In part 2, the log10 parasite reduction ratio at 48 h in the DSM265 (150 mg) group was 1·55 (95% CI 1·42–1·67) and in the mefloquine (10 mg/kg) group was 2·34 (2·17–2·52), corresponding to a parasite clearance half-life of 9·4 h (8·7–10·2) and 6·2 h (5·7–6·7), respectively. The median minimum inhibitory concentration of DSM265 in blood was estimated as 1040 ng/mL (range 552–1500), resulting in a predicted single efficacious dose of 340 mg. Parasite clearance was significantly faster in participants who received mefloquine than in participants who received DSM265 (p<0·0001).
Interpretation
The good safety profile, long elimination half-life, and antimalarial effect of DSM265 supports its development as a partner drug in a single-dose antimalarial combination treatment.

Advances in the development of new dengue control tools, including vaccines and vector control, herald a new era of desperately needed dengue prevention and control. The burden of dengue has expanded for decades, and now affects more than 120 countries. Complex, large-scale global forces have and will continue to contribute to the expansion of dengue, including population growth, unplanned urbanisation, and suboptimal mosquito control in urban centres. Although no so-called magic bullets are available, there is new optimism following the first licensure of a dengue vaccine and other promising vaccine candidates, and the development of novel vector control interventions to help control dengue and other expanding mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika virus. Implementation of effective and sustainable immunisation programmes to complement existing methods will add complexity to the health systems of affected countries, which have varying levels of robustness and maturity. Long-term high prioritisation and adequate resources are needed. The way forward is full commitment to addressing a complex disease with a set of solutions integrating vaccination and vector control methods. A whole systems approach is thus needed to integrate these various approaches and strategies for controlling dengue within the goal of universal health coverage. The ultimate objective of these interventions will be to reduce the disease burden in a sustainable and equitable manner."

abstract = "Summary
Congenital cytomegalovirus is the most frequent, yet under-recognised, infectious cause of newborn malformation in developed countries. Despite its clinical and public health importance, questions remain regarding the best diagnostic methods for identifying maternal and neonatal infection, and regarding optimal prevention and therapeutic strategies for infected mothers and neonates. The absence of guidelines impairs global efforts to decrease the effect of congenital cytomegalovirus. Data in the literature suggest that congenital cytomegalovirus infection remains a research priority, but data are yet to be translated into clinical practice. An informal International Congenital Cytomegalovirus Recommendations Group was convened in 2015 to address these questions and to provide recommendations for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. On the basis of consensus discussions and a review of the literature, we do not support universal screening of mothers and the routine use of cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin for prophylaxis or treatment of infected mothers. However, treatment guidelines for infected neonates were recommended. Consideration must be given to universal neonatal screening for cytomegalovirus to facilitate early detection and intervention for sensorineural hearing loss and developmental delay, where appropriate. The group agreed that education and prevention strategies for mothers were beneficial, and that recommendations will need continual updating as further data become available."

Critically ill patients and patients with haematological cancer are HIV-negative populations at high risk of invasive fungal infections. In intensive-care units, candidaemia and intra-abdominal candidiasis predominate, but aspergillosis has emerged as a lethal, under-recognised cause of pneumonia. In patients with haematological malignancies or who have undergone stem-cell transplantations, pulmonary disease due to aspergillus and other mould diseases predominate. In this Series paper, we provide an update on risk assessment, new diagnostic strategies, and therapeutic approaches. New concepts have emerged for use of risk prediction rules and an evidence base now exists for inclusion of biomarkers (eg, galactomannan, 1,3-β-D-glucan, and PCR assays for Aspergillus spp) into early diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Imaging techniques remain helpful for early diagnosis of pulmonary mould diseases, with PET techniques offering potential improvements in diagnostic specificity and evaluation of clinical response. Echinocandins and triazoles have been validated extensively for prophylaxis, empirical therapy, and targeted therapy, but an increase in intrinsically resistant fungi and emergence of secondary resistance as a result of drug-induced selection pressure are of major concern. Echinocandins remain a major component of treatment of invasive candidiasis and new triazoles are the best alternative for prophylaxis and therapy of invasive aspergillosis."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis are emerging worldwide. The Green Light Committee initiative supported programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis in 90 countries. We used estimates from the Preserving Effective TB Treatment Study to predict MDR and XDR tuberculosis trends in four countries with a high burden of MDR tuberculosis: India, the Philippines, Russia, and South Africa.
Methods
We calibrated a compartmental model to data from drug resistance surveys and WHO tuberculosis reports to forecast estimates of incident MDR and XDR tuberculosis and the percentage of incident MDR and XDR tuberculosis caused by acquired drug resistance, assuming no fitness cost of resistance from 2000 to 2040 in India, the Philippines, Russia, and South Africa.
Findings
The model forecasted the percentage of MDR tuberculosis among incident cases of tuberculosis to increase, reaching 12·4% (95% prediction interval 9·4–16·2) in India, 8·9% (4·5–11·7) in the Philippines, 32·5% (27·0–35·8) in Russia, and 5·7% (3·0–7·6) in South Africa in 2040. It also predicted the percentage of XDR tuberculosis among incident MDR tuberculosis to increase, reaching 8·9% (95% prediction interval 5·1–12·9) in India, 9·0% (4·0–14·7) in the Philippines, 9·0% (4·8–14·2) in Russia, and 8·5% (2·5–14·7) in South Africa in 2040. Acquired drug resistance would cause less than 30% of incident MDR tuberculosis during 2000–40. Acquired drug resistance caused 80% of incident XDR tuberculosis in 2000, but this estimate would decrease to less than 50% by 2040.
Interpretation
MDR and XDR tuberculosis were forecast to increase in all four countries despite improvements in acquired drug resistance shown by the Green Light Committee-supported programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Additional control efforts beyond improving acquired drug resistance rates are needed to stop the spread of MDR and XDR tuberculosis in countries with a high burden of MDR tuberculosis.

abstract = "Summary
Global rollout of the new antituberculosis drug bedaquiline has been slow, in part reflecting concerns about spread of bedaquiline resistance. Acquired resistance to bedaquiline is especially likely in patients with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis. However, the very high mortality rates of patients with XDR not receiving bedaquiline, and promising cohort study results, suggest these patients also have greatest need for the drug. In this Personal View, we argue that resistance concerns should not forestall use of bedaquiline in patients with XDR tuberculosis. Our position in favour of increased access to bedaquiline for these patients is based on three arguments. First, the use of drug combinations that include bedaquiline might prevent spread of XDR disease to others in the community. Second, until new combination regimens of novel drugs for XDR tuberculosis become available, patients with XDR disease and their infected contacts will face equivalent outcomes if bedaquiline is either not provided because of policy, or not effective because of resistance. Finally, because resistance to bedaquiline and other antituberculosis drugs is caused by mutations within a single bacterial chromosome, use of bedaquiline in patients with XDR tuberculosis will not substantially increase the risk of bedaquiline resistance in patients with drug-susceptible or multidrug-resistant (non‑XDR) tuberculosis strains."

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2015 provides an up-to-date analysis of the burden of lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs) in 195 countries. This study assesses cases, deaths, and aetiologies spanning the past 25 years and shows how the burden of LRI has changed in people of all ages.
Methods
We estimated LRI mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using a modelling platform shared across most causes of death in the GBD 2015 study called the Cause of Death Ensemble model. We modelled LRI morbidity, including incidence and prevalence, using a meta-regression platform called DisMod-MR. We estimated aetiologies for LRI using two different counterfactual approaches, the first for viral pathogens, which incorporates the aetiology-specific risk of LRI and the prevalence of the aetiology in LRI episodes, and the second for bacterial pathogens, which uses a vaccine-probe approach. We used the Socio-demographic Index, which is a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility, to assess trends in LRI-related mortality. The two leading risk factors for LRI disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), childhood undernutrition and air pollution, were used in a decomposition analysis to establish the relative contribution of changes in LRI DALYs.
Findings
In 2015, we estimated that LRIs caused 2·74 million deaths (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2·50 million to 2·86 million) and 103·0 million DALYs (95% UI 96·1 million to 109·1 million). LRIs have a disproportionate effect on children younger than 5 years, responsible for 704 000 deaths (95% UI 651 000–763 000) and 60.6 million DALYs (95ÙI 56·0–65·6). Between 2005 and 2015, the number of deaths due to LRI decreased by 36·9% (95% UI 31·6 to 42·0) in children younger than 5 years, and by 3·2% (95% UI −0·4 to 6·9) in all ages. Pneumococcal pneumonia caused 55·4% of LRI deaths in all ages, totalling 1 517 388 deaths (95% UI 857 940–2 183 791). Between 2005 and 2015, improvements in air pollution exposure were responsible for a 4·3% reduction in LRI DALYs and improvements in childhood undernutrition were responsible for an 8·9% reduction.
Interpretation
LRIs are the leading infectious cause of death and the fifth-leading cause of death overall; they are the second-leading cause of DALYs. At the global level, the burden of LRIs has decreased dramatically in the last 10 years in children younger than 5 years, although the burden in people older than 70 years has increased in many regions. LRI remains a largely preventable disease and cause of death, and continued efforts to decrease indoor and ambient air pollution, improve childhood nutrition, and scale up the use of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children and adults will be essential in reducing the global burden of LRI.

abstract = "Summary
Background
A drug for causal (ie, pre-erythrocytic) prophylaxis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria with prolonged activity would substantially advance malaria control. DSM265 is an experimental antimalarial that selectively inhibits the parasite dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. DSM265 shows in vitro activity against liver and blood stages of P falciparum. We assessed the prophylactic activity of DSM265 against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI).
Methods
At the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Eberhard Karls University (Tübingen, Germany), healthy, malaria-naive adults were allocated to receive 400 mg DSM265 or placebo either 1 day (cohort 1A) or 7 days (cohort 2) before CHMI by direct venous inoculation (DVI) of 3200 aseptic, purified, cryopreserved P falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ Challenge; Sanaria Inc, Rockville, MD, USA). An additional group received daily atovaquone-proguanil (250-100 mg) for 9 days, starting 1 day before CHMI (cohort 1B). Allocation to DSM265, atovaquone-proguanil, or placebo was randomised by an interactive web response system. Allocation to cohort 1A and 1B was open-label, within cohorts 1A and 2, allocation to DSM265 and placebo was double-blinded. All treatments were given orally. Volunteers were treated with an antimalarial on day 28, or when parasitaemic, as detected by thick blood smear (TBS) microscopy. The primary efficacy endpoint was time-to-parasitaemia, assessed by TBS. All participants receiving at least one dose of chemoprophylaxis or placebo were considered for safety, those receiving PfSPZ Challenge for efficacy analyses. Log-rank test was used to compare time-to-parasitemia between interventions. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02450578.
Findings
22 participants were enrolled between Oct 23, 2015, and Jan 18, 2016. Five participants received 400 mg DSM265 and two participants received placebo 1 day before CHMI (cohort 1A), six participants received daily atovaquone-proguanil 1 day before CHMI (cohort 1B), and six participants received 400 mg DSM265 and two participants received placebo 7 days before CHMI (cohort 2). Five of five participants receiving DSM265 1 day before CHMI and six of six in the atovaquone-proguanil cohort were protected, whereas placebo recipients (two of two) developed malaria on days 11 and 14. When given 7 days before CHMI, three of six volunteers receiving DSM265 became TBS positive on days 11, 13, and 24. The remaining three DSM265-treated, TBS-negative participants of cohort 2 developed transient submicroscopic parasitaemia. Both participants receiving placebo 7 days before CHMI became TBS positive on day 11. The only possible DSM265-related adverse event was a moderate transient elevation in serum bilirubin in one participant.
Interpretation
A single dose of 400 mg DSM265 was well tolerated and had causal prophylactic activity when given 1 day before CHMI. Future trials are needed to investigate further the use of DSM265 for the prophylaxis of malaria.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Clostridium difficile infection is the most common health-care-associated infection in the USA. We assessed the safety and efficacy of ridinilazole versus vancomycin for treatment of C difficile infection.
Methods
We did a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority study. Participants with signs and symptoms of C difficile infection and a positive diagnostic test result were recruited from 33 centres in the USA and Canada and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral ridinilazole (200 mg every 12 h) or oral vancomycin (125 mg every 6 h) for 10 days. The primary endpoint was achievement of a sustained clinical response, defined as clinical cure at the end of treatment and no recurrence within 30 days, which was used to establish non-inferiority (15% margin) of ridinilazole versus vancomycin. The primary efficacy analysis was done on a modified intention-to-treat population comprising all individuals with C difficile infection confirmed by the presence of free toxin in stool who were randomly assigned to receive one or more doses of the study drug. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02092935.
Findings
Between June 26, 2014, and August 31, 2015, 100 patients were recruited; 50 were randomly assigned to receive ridinilazole and 50 to vancomycin. 16 patients did not complete the study, and 11 discontinued treatment early. The primary efficacy analysis included 69 patients (n=36 in the ridinilazole group; n=33 in the vancomycin group). 24 of 36 (66·7%) patients in the ridinilazole group versus 14 of 33 (42·4%) of those in the vancomycin group had a sustained clinical response (treatment difference 21·1%, 90% CI 3·1–39·1, p=0·0004), establishing the non-inferiority of ridinilazole and also showing statistical superiority at the 10% level. Ridinilazole was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of vancomycin: 82% (41 of 50) of participants reported adverse events in the ridinilazole group and 80% (40 of 50) in the vancomycin group. There were no adverse events related to ridinilazole that led to discontinuation.
Interpretation
Ridinilazole is a targeted-spectrum antimicrobial that shows potential in treatment of initial C difficile infection and in providing sustained benefit through reduction in disease recurrence. Further clinical development is warranted.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Post-migration follow-up of migrants considered at increased risk of developing tuberculosis based on pre-migration screening abnormalities (high-risk migrants) is implemented in several low-incidence countries. We aimed to determine the rate of tuberculosis in this population to inform cross-border tuberculosis control policies.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE and Embase (since inception to Jan 12, 2017) for studies evaluating post-migration follow-up of high-risk migrants. Outcomes evaluated were the number of tuberculosis cases occurring post-migration, expressed as the tuberculosis incidence per 100 000 person-years of follow-up, as cumulative incidence of tuberculosis per 100 000 persons, and the cumulative incidence of tuberculosis at the first post-migration follow-up visit. Random-effects models were used to summarise outcomes across studies.
Findings
We identified 20 publications (describing 23 study cohorts) reporting the pre-migration screening outcomes of 8 355 030 migrants processed between Jan 1, 1981, and May 1, 2014, with 222 375 high-risk migrants identified. The pooled cumulative incidence of tuberculosis post-migration in our study population from 22 cohorts was 2794 per 100 000 persons (95% CI 2179–3409; I2=99%). The pooled cumulative incidence of tuberculosis at the first follow-up visit from ten cohorts was 3284 per 100 000 persons (95% CI 2173–4395; I2=99%). The pooled tuberculosis incidence from 15 cohorts was 1249 per 100 000 person-years of follow-up (95% CI 924-1574; I2=98%).
Interpretation
The high rate of tuberculosis in high-risk migrants suggests that tuberculosis control measures in this population, including more sensitive pre-migration screening, preventive treatment of latent tuberculosis infection, or post-migration follow-up, are potentially effective cross-border tuberculosis control strategies in low-incidence countries.

abstract = "Summary
Antibiotics have revolutionised medicine in many aspects, and their discovery is considered a turning point in human history. However, the most serious consequence of the use of antibiotics is the concomitant development of resistance against them. The marine environment has proven to be a very rich source of diverse natural products with significant antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, antitumour, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory activities. Many marine natural products (MNPs)—for example, neoechinulin B—have been found to be promising drug candidates to alleviate the mortality and morbidity rates caused by drug-resistant infections, and several MNP-based anti-infectives have already entered phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials, with six approved for usage by the US Food and Drug Administration and one by the EU. In this Review, we discuss the diversity of marine natural products that have shown in-vivo efficacy or in-vitro potential against drug-resistant infections of fungal, viral, and parasitic origin, and describe their mechanism of action. We highlight the drug-like physicochemical properties of the reported natural products that have bioactivity against drug-resistant pathogens in order to assess their drug potential. Difficulty in isolation and purification procedures, toxicity associated with the active compound, ecological impacts on natural environment, and insufficient investments by pharmaceutical companies are some of the clear reasons behind market failures and a poor pipeline of MNPs available to date. However, the diverse abundance of natural products in the marine environment could serve as a ray of light for the therapy of drug-resistant infections. Development of resistance-resistant antibiotics could be achieved via the coordinated networking of clinicians, microbiologists, natural product chemists, and pharmacologists together with pharmaceutical venture capitalist companies."

abstract = "Summary
Background
HIV-1 drug resistance to older thymidine analogue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor drugs has been identified in sub-Saharan Africa in patients with virological failure of first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing the modern nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of thymidine analogue mutations (TAM) in patients with virological failure of first-line tenofovir-containing ART.
Methods
We retrospectively analysed patients from 20 studies within the TenoRes collaboration who had locally defined viral failure on first-line therapy with tenofovir plus a cytosine analogue (lamivudine or emtricitabine) plus a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI; nevirapine or efavirenz) in sub-Saharan Africa. Baseline visits in these studies occurred between 2005 and 2013. To assess between-study and within-study associations, we used meta-regression and meta-analyses to compare patients with and without TAMs for the presence of resistance to tenofovir, cytosine analogue, or NNRTIs.
Findings
Of 712 individuals with failure of first-line tenofovir-containing regimens, 115 (16%) had at least one TAM. In crude comparisons, patients with TAMs had lower CD4 counts at treatment initiation than did patients without TAMs (60·5 cells per μL [IQR 21·0–128·0] in patients with TAMS vs 95·0 cells per μL [37·0–177·0] in patients without TAMs; p=0·007) and were more likely to have tenofovir resistance (93 [81%] of 115 patients with TAMs vs 352 [59%] of 597 patients without TAMs; p<0·0001), NNRTI resistance (107 [93%] vs 462 [77%]; p<0·0001), and cytosine analogue resistance (100 [87%] vs 378 [63%]; p=0·0002). We detected associations between TAMs and drug resistance mutations both between and within studies; the correlation between the study-level proportion of patients with tenofovir resistance and TAMs was 0·64 (p<0·0001), and the odds ratio for tenofovir resistance comparing patients with and without TAMs was 1·29 (1·13–1·47; p<0·0001)
Interpretation
TAMs are common in patients who have failure of first-line tenofovir-containing regimens in sub-Saharan Africa, and are associated with multidrug resistant HIV-1. Effective viral load monitoring and point-of-care resistance tests could help to mitigate the emergence and spread of such strains.

Background
International travel contributes to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. We investigated the acquisition of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) during international travel, with a focus on predictive factors for acquisition, duration of colonisation, and probability of onward transmission.
Methods
Within the prospective, multicentre COMBAT study, 2001 Dutch travellers and 215 non-travelling household members were enrolled. Faecal samples and questionnaires on demographics, illnesses, and behaviour were collected before travel and immediately and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after return. Samples were screened for the presence of ESBL-E. In post-travel samples, ESBL genes were sequenced and PCR with specific primers for plasmid-encoded β-lactamase enzymes TEM, SHV, and CTX-M group 1, 2, 8, 9, and 25 was used to confirm the presence of ESBL genes in follow-up samples. Multivariable regression analyses and mathematical modelling were used to identify predictors for acquisition and sustained carriage, and to determine household transmission rates. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01676974.
Findings
633 (34·3%) of 1847 travellers who were ESBL negative before travel and had available samples after return had acquired ESBL-E during international travel (95% CI 32·1–36·5), with the highest number of acquisitions being among those who travelled to southern Asia in 136 of 181 (75·1%, 95% CI 68·4–80·9). Important predictors for acquisition of ESBL-E were antibiotic use during travel (adjusted odds ratio 2·69, 95% CI 1·79–4·05), traveller's diarrhoea that persisted after return (2·31, 1·42–3·76), and pre-existing chronic bowel disease (2·10, 1·13–3·90). The median duration of colonisation after travel was 30 days (95% CI 29–33). 65 (11·3%) of 577 remained colonised at 12 months. CTX-M enzyme group 9 ESBLs were associated with a significantly increased risk of sustained carriage (median duration 75 days, 95% CI 48–102, p=0·0001). Onward transmission was found in 13 (7·7%) of 168 household members. The probability of transmitting ESBL-E to another household member was 12% (95% CI 5–18).
Interpretation
Acquisition and spread of ESBL-E during and after international travel was substantial and worrisome. Travellers to areas with a high risk of ESBL-E acquisition should be viewed as potential carriers of ESBL-E for up to 12 months after return.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The burden of loiasis has received limited attention and loiasis is still considered a benign condition. To assess whether loiasis bears any excess mortality, we did a retrospective cohort study in Cameroon.
Methods
In 2001, 3627 individuals living in 28 villages were examined for Loa loa infection. In 2016, these villages were revisited and the vital status was determined for 3301 individuals (91%). The data were analysed at community level to assess the relation between the level of L loa infection in 2001 and standardised mortality rates (SMRs), and at individual level to assess the excess mortality relative to the 2001 microfilaraemia and to calculate the population-attributable fraction of mortality associated with L loa microfilaraemia.
Findings
915 deaths occurred during the follow-up time (mean time of 12·5 years [IQR 10·2–14·9]) between April, 2001, and March 22, 2016. Crude mortality rate was 20·3 deaths per 1000 person-years. SMRs increased by 4·1% when the proportion of participants infected with greater than 30 000 microfilariae per mL increased by 1% (p=0·030). People aged older than 25 years with greater than 30 000 microfilariae per mL in 2001 died significantly earlier than did amicrofilaraemic people (time ratio 0·67, 95% CI 0·48–0·95, p=0·024). The population-attributable fraction of mortality associated with presence of L loa microfilaraemia was 14·5% (95% CI 6·5–21·8, p=0·001).
Interpretation
High-grade L loa microfilaraemia is associated with an increased mortality risk, suggesting that loiasis is not a benign condition and merits more attention because of its effect on onchocerciasis and lymphatic control strategies. Loiasis should be considered for inclusion in the WHO's list of neglected tropical diseases.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Case fatality ratios in children with tuberculosis are poorly understood—particularly those among children with HIV and children not receiving tuberculosis treatment. We did a systematic review of published work to identify studies of population-representative samples of paediatric (ie, <15 years) tuberculosis cases.
Methods
We searched PubMed and Embase for reports published in English, French, Portuguese, or Spanish before Aug 12, 2016, that included terms related to tuberculosis, children, mortality, and population representativeness. We also reviewed our own files and reference lists of articles identified by this search. We screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, excluding studies in which outcomes were unknown for 10% or more of the children and publications detailing non-representative samples. We used random-effects meta-analysis to produce pooled estimates of case fatality ratios from the included studies, which we divided into three eras: the pre-treatment era (ie, studies before 1946), the middle era (1946–80), and the recent era (after 1980). We stratified our analyses by whether or not children received tuberculosis treatment, age (0–4 years, 5–14 years), and HIV status.
Findings
We identified 31 papers comprising 35 datasets representing 82 436 children with tuberculosis disease, of whom 9274 died. Among children with tuberculosis included in studies in the pre-treatment era, the pooled case fatality ratio was 21·9% (95% CI 18·1–26·4) overall. The pooled case fatality ratio was significantly higher in children aged 0–4 years (43·6%, 95% CI 36·8–50·6) than in those aged 5–14 years (14·9%, 11·5–19·1). In studies in the recent era, when most children had tuberculosis treatment, the pooled case fatality ratio was 0·9% (95% CI 0·5–1·6). US surveillance data suggest that the case fatality ratio is substantially higher in children with HIV receiving treatment for tuberculosis (especially without antiretroviral therapy) than in those without HIV.
Interpretation
Without adequate treatment, children with tuberculosis, especially those younger than 5 years, are at high risk of death. Children with HIV have an increased mortality risk, even when receiving tuberculosis treatment.

abstract = "Summary
Although conventional antimicrobial drugs have been viewed as miraculous cure-alls for the past 80 years, increasing antimicrobial drug resistance requires a major and rapid intervention. However, the development of novel but still conventional systemic antimicrobial agents, having only a single mode or site of action, will not alleviate the situation because it is probably only a matter of time until any such agents will also become ineffective. To continue to produce new agents based on this notion is unacceptable, and there is an increasing need for alternative approaches to the problem. By contrast, light-activated molecules called photoantimicrobials act locally via the in-situ production of highly reactive oxygen species, which simultaneously attack various biomolecular sites in the pathogenic target and therefore offer both multiple and variable sites of action. This non-specificity at the target circumvents conventional mechanisms of resistance and inhibits the development of resistance to the agents themselves. Photoantimicrobial therapy is safe and easy to implement and, unlike conventional agents, the activity spectrum of photoantimicrobials covers bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa. However, clinical trials of these new, truly broad-spectrum, and minimally toxic agents have been few, and the funding for research and development is almost non-existent. Photoantimicrobials constitute one of the few ways forward through the morass of drug-resistant infectious disease and should be fully explored. In this Personal View, we raise awareness of the novel photoantimicrobial technologies that offer a viable alternative to conventional drugs in many relevant application fields, and could thus slow the pace of resistance development."

Background
Multidrug-resistance is a substantial threat to global elimination of tuberculosis. Understanding transmission patterns is crucial for control of the disease. We used a genomic and epidemiological approach to assess recent transmission of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis and identify potential risk factors for transmission.
Methods
We did a population-based, retrospective study of patients who tested positive for tuberculosis between Jan 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2012, in Shanghai, China. We did variable-number-of-tandem-repeat genotyping and whole-genome sequencing of isolates. We measured strain diversity within and between genomically clustered isolates. Genomic and epidemiological data were combined to construct transmission networks.
Findings
367 (5%) of 7982 patients with tuberculosis had MDR tuberculosis and 324 (88%) of these had isolates available for genomic analysis. 103 (32%) of the 324 MDR strains were in 38 genomic clusters that differed by 12 or fewer single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), indicating recent transmission of MDR strains. Patients who had delayed diagnosis or were older than 45 years had high risk of recent transmission. 235 (73%) patients with MDR tuberculosis probably had transmission of MDR strains. Transmission network analysis showed that 33 (87%) of the 38 clusters accumulated additional drug-resistance mutations through emergence or fixation of mutations during transmission. 68 (66%) of 103 clustered MDR strains had compensatory mutations of rifampicin resistance.
Interpretation
Recent transmission of MDR tuberculosis strains, with increasing drug-resistance, drives the MDR tuberculosis epidemic in Shanghai, China. Whole-genome sequencing can measure of the heterogeneity of drug-resistant mutations within and between hosts and help to determine the transmission patterns of MDR tuberculosis.

Background
Australia is a high-income country with a well established and largely publicly funded health-care system. However, some populations within Australia have shorter life expectancy and worse health outcomes than others. We explored geographical variations and sociodemographic inequities in infectious disease notifications in Australia.
Methods
In this retrospective study, we analysed National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) notifications from 1991–2011 (n=2·4 million). We assessed the effect of socioeconomic disadvantage and remoteness of residence on national notification incidence. We calculated Gini coefficients, adjusted relative risks (aRRs), population attributable fractions (PAFs), and attributable notifications. We reported aRRs for Indigenous status in three jurisdictions with more than 75% completeness of Indigenous status reporting from the Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia.
Findings
Of the eight most commonly notified diseases from Jan 1, 1991, to Dec 31, 2011, gonococcal infection was the most geographically unequal and campylobacteriosis was the most evenly distributed across the country. Overall, notification incidence was higher in remote and very remote areas than in major cities (aRR 3·37), and higher in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged quintiles compared with less disadvantaged quintiles (aRR 1·15). The PAF for socioeconomic disadvantage was high for blood-borne viral hepatitis but decreased in other disease groups. In 2011, sexually transmitted infections had 11 093 notifications attributed to remoteness and 5597 notifications attributable to socioeconomic disadvantage. Notification incidence was higher in Indigenous than in non-Indigenous Australians (aRR 5·3).
Interpretation
All diseases had differing geographical concentration and sociodemographic risk. Overall, sociodemographic inequities in infectious disease notifications have decreased, but remain unacceptably high. National communicable disease control is complex, requiring both targeted and population-wide interventions.

Profound changes are occurring in the epidemiology of schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by a chronic infection with parasitic helminths of the genus Schistosoma. Schistosomiasis currently affects 240 million people worldwide, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. The advent and proliferation of mass drug administration (MDA) programmes using the drug praziquantel is resulting in substantial increases in the number of people, mainly children aged 6–14 years, being effectively treated, approaching the point where most people in endemic areas will receive one or more treatments during their lifetimes. Praziquantel treatment not only cures infection but also frees the host from the powerful immunomodulatory action of the parasites. The treatment simultaneously enhances exposure to key parasite antigens, accelerating the development of protective acquired immunity, which would take many years to develop naturally. At a population level, these changes constitute a substantial alteration to schistosome ecology in that the parasites are more likely to be exposed not only to praziquantel directly but also to hosts with altered immune phenotypes. Here, we consider the consequences of this for schistosome biology, immunoepidemiology, and public health. We anticipate that there could be substantial effects on chronic pathology, natural immunity, vaccine development strategies, immune disorders, and drug efficacy. This makes for a complex picture that will only become apparent over decades. We recommend careful monitoring and assessment to accompany the roll-out of MDA programmes to ensure that the considerable health benefits to populations are achieved and sustained."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Malaria remains a problem for many countries classified as malaria free through cases imported from endemic regions. Imported cases to non-endemic countries often result in delays in diagnosis, are expensive to treat, and can sometimes cause secondary local transmission. The movement of malaria in endemic countries has also contributed to the spread of drug resistance and threatens long-term eradication goals. Here we focused on quantifying the international movements of malaria to improve our understanding of these phenomena and facilitate the design of mitigation strategies.
Methods
In this meta-analysis, we studied the database of publicly available nationally reported statistics on imported malaria in the past 10 years, covering more than 50 000 individual cases. We obtained data from 40 non-endemic countries and recorded the geographical variations.
Findings
Infection movements were strongly skewed towards a small number of high-traffic routes between 2005 and 2015, with the west Africa region accounting for 56% (13 947/24 941) of all imported cases to non-endemic countries with a reported travel destination, and France and the UK receiving the highest number of cases, with more than 4000 reported cases per year on average. Countries strongly linked by movements of imported cases are grouped by historical, language, and travel ties. There is strong spatial clustering of plasmodium species types.
Interpretation
The architecture of the air network, historical ties, demographics of travellers, and malaria endemicity contribute to highly heterogeneous patterns of numbers, routes, and species compositions of parasites transported. With global malaria eradication on the international agenda, malaria control altering local transmission, and the threat of drug resistance, understanding these patterns and their drivers is increasing in importance.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) for malaria is used in infants, children, adults, and pregnant women. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is an effective, well tolerated artemisinin-based combination therapy. The long half-life of piperaquine makes it attractive for IPT. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to establish the efficacy and safety of repeated treatment with DP.
Methods
Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched multiple databases on Sept 1, 2016, with the terms: “human” AND “dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine” OR “DHA-PPQ”. Studies were eligible if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or prospective cohort studies involving repeat exposures to standard 3-day courses of DP for either seasonal malaria chemoprevention, mass drug administration, or treatment of clinical malaria, conducted at any time and in any geographic location. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to generate pooled incidence rate ratios and relative risks, or risk differences.
Findings
11 studies were included: two repeat treatment studies (one in children younger than 5 years and one in pregnant women), and nine IPT trials (five in children younger than 5 years, one in schoolchildren, one in adults, two in pregnant women). Comparator interventions included placebo, artemether-lumefantrine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), SP+amodiaquine, SP+piperaquine, SP+chloroquine, and co-trimoxazole. Of 14 628 participants, 3935 received multiple DP courses (2–18). Monthly IPT-DP was associated with an 84% reduction in the incidence of malaria parasitaemia measured by microscopy compared with placebo. Monthly IPT-DP was associated with fewer serious adverse events than placebo, daily co-trimoxazole, or monthly SP. Among 56 IPT-DP recipients (26 children, 30 pregnant women) with cardiac parameters, all QTc intervals were within normal limits, with no significant increase in QTc prolongation with increasing courses of DP.
Interpretation
Monthly DP appears well tolerated and effective for IPT. Additional data are needed in pregnancy and to further explore the cardiac safety with monthly dosing.

abstract = "Summary
All antimalarial drugs developed so far have eventually succumbed to resistance. There is a general belief that the more people that are exposed to an antimalarial drug, the more likely it is that resistance will emerge. Mass drug administration (MDA) is therefore considered a potent cause of antimalarial drug resistance. In this Personal View, I discuss the circumstances under which antimalarial MDA increases or decreases the risk of resistance. It is the total number of parasites exposed and their individual probabilities of survival and spread that determine the risk, not the number of people that contain them. In malaria-endemic areas, a substantial proportion of the community carries malaria parasites in their blood without being ill. Although many more people have asymptomatic than symptomatic malaria at any time, their parasite burdens are several orders of magnitude lower, and their host defence mechanisms are substantially more effective. Symptomatic infections with high parasite numbers are the most likely source of resistance emergence, so effective mass treatment that reduces the number of symptomatic cases of malaria and its transmission can reduce the threat of antimalarial resistance emerging and spreading in treated populations."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Bivalent rLP2086 is a recombinant factor H binding protein-based vaccine approved in the USA for prevention of meningococcal serogroup B disease in 10–25-year-olds. We aimed to assess the persistence of bactericidal antibodies up to 4 years after a three-dose schedule of bivalent rLP2086.
Methods
We did this randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial at 25 sites in Australia, Poland, and Spain. In stage 1 of the study (February, 2009–May, 2010), healthy adolescents (aged 11–18 years) were randomly assigned, via an interactive voice and web-response system with computer-generated sequential random numbers, to receive either ascending doses of vaccine (60 μg, 120 μg, and 200 μg) or placebo at months 0, 2, and 6. Dispensing staff were not masked to group allocation, but allocation was concealed from principal investigators, participants and their guardians, and laboratory personnel. In stage 2 of the study (reported here), we enrolled healthy adolescents who had received three doses of 120 μg bivalent rLP2086 (the optimum dose level identified in stage 1) or saline. Immunogenicity was determined in serum bactericidal antibody assay using human complement (hSBA) by use of four meningococcal serogroup B test strains expressing vaccine-heterologous factor H binding protein variants: PMB80 (A22), PMB2001 (A56), PMB2948 (B24), and PMB2707 (B44). Immunogenicity in stage 2 was assessed at months 6, 12, 24, and 48 post-vaccination. We did analysis by intention to treat. This trial is registered as ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00808028.
Findings
Between March 17, 2010, and Feb 8, 2011, 170 participants who received 120 μg of bivalent rLP2086 and 80 participants who received placebo in stage 1 of the study were entered into stage 2; 210 participants completed stage 2 up to 48 months. 1 month after the third vaccination, 93% (n=139/149) to 100% (n=48/48) of vaccine recipients achieved protective hSBA titres equal to or greater than the lower limit of quantification to each test strain, compared with 0% (n=0/25) to 35% (n=8/23) of control recipients. Despite initial declines in seroprotective hSBA titres for all four test strains, for three test strains (A22, A56, and B24), more than 50% of bivalent rLP2086 recipients continued to achieve titres equal to or greater than the lower limit of quantification at months 6 (57% [n=93/163] to 89% [n=42/47]), 12 (54% [n=84/155] to 69% [n=33/48]), 24 (53% [n=26/49] to 54% [n=82/152]), and 48 (51% [n=24/47] to 59% [n=79/134]); corresponding values in the control group were 14% (n=11/80) to 22% (n=5/23) at month 6, 13% (n=10/78) to 29% (n=22/76) at month 12, 16% (n=12/74) to 36% (n=8/22) at month 24, and 24% (n=16/68) to 35% (n=8/23) at month 48. For test strain B44, hSBA titres equal to or greater than the lower limit of quantification were shown in 37% (n=18/49) of vaccine recipients at 6 months, in 29% (n=14/48) at 12 months, in 22% (n=11/49) at 24 months, and in 20% (n=10/49) at 48 months, compared with 0% (n=0/25) of control recipients at month 6, 4% (n=1/25) at months 12 and 24, and 12% (n=3/25) at month 48. Adverse events were reported in seven (4%) of 170 participants in the bivalent rLP2086 group and two (3%) of 80 participants in the control group; no event was deemed related to vaccine.
Interpretation
After three doses of bivalent rLP2086, protective hSBA titres above the correlate of protection (≥1/4) were elicited up to 4 years in more than 50% of participants for three of four meningococcal serogroup B test strains representative of disease-causing meningococci expressing vaccine-heterologous antigens. Further studies will be needed to assess possible herd immunity effects with meningococcal serogroup B vaccines and the need for a booster dose to sustain individual protection against invasive meningococcal disease.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Gaps in the diagnostic capacity and heterogeneity of national surveillance and reporting standards in Europe make it difficult to contain carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. We report the development of a consistent sampling framework and the results of the first structured survey on the occurrence of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in European hospitals.
Methods
National expert laboratories recruited hospitals with diagnostic capacities, who collected the first ten carbapenem non-susceptible clinical isolates of K pneumoniae or E coli and ten susceptible same-species comparator isolates and pertinent patient and hospital information. Isolates and data were relayed back to national expert laboratories, which made laboratory-substantiated information available for central analysis.
Findings
Between Nov 1, 2013, and April 30, 2014, 455 sentinel hospitals in 36 countries submitted 2703 clinical isolates (2301 [85%] K pneumoniae and 402 (15%) E coli). 850 (37%) of 2301 K pneumoniae samples and 77 (19%) of 402 E coli samples were carbapenemase (KPC, NDM, OXA-48-like, or VIM) producers. The ratio of K pneumoniae to E coli was 11:1. 1·3 patients per 10 000 hospital admissions had positive clinical specimens. Prevalence differed greatly, with the highest rates in Mediterranean and Balkan countries. Carbapenemase-producing K pneumoniae isolates showed high resistance to last-line antibiotics.
Interpretation
This initiative shows an encouraging commitment by all participants, and suggests that challenges in the establishment of a continent-wide enhanced sentinel surveillance for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaeceae can be overcome. Strengthening infection control efforts in hospitals is crucial for controlling spread through local and national health care networks.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The results of some reports have suggested that treatment of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis with the recommended regimens of first-line drugs might be suboptimal. We updated a previous systematic review of treatment outcomes associated with use of first-line drugs in patients with tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid but not rifampicin.
Methods
In this systematic review, we updated the results of a previous review to include randomised trials and cohort studies published in English, French, or Spanish to March 31, 2015, containing results of standardised treatment of patients with bacteriologically confirmed isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis (but not multidrug-resistant tuberculosis—ie, not resistant to rifampicin) in whom failure and relapse were bacteriologically confirmed. Results in patients with drug-sensitive tuberculosis included in the same studies were also analysed. We pooled treatment outcomes with random-effects meta-analysis.
Findings
We identified 19 cohort studies and 33 trials with 3744 patients with isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis and 19 012 patients with drug-sensitive disease. The pooled rates of failure or relapse, or both, and acquired drug resistance with all drug regimens were 15% (95% CI 12–18) and 3·6% (2–5), respectively, in patients with isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis and 4% (3–5) and 0·6% (0·3–0·9) in those with drug-sensitive tuberculosis. Of patients with initial isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis with acquired drug resistance, 96% (93–99) had acquired multidrug-resistant disease. Treatment of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis with the WHO standard regimen for new patients resulted in treatment failure, relapse, and acquired multidrug resistance in 11% (6–17), 10% (5–15) and 8% (3–13), respectively; treatment with the standard WHO regimen for previously treated patients resulted in treatment failure in 6% (2–10), relapse in 5% (2–8), and acquisition of multidrug resistance in 3% (0–6). For patients with drug-sensitive disease treated with the standard retreatment regimen the rates were 1% (0–2), 5% (4–7), and 0·3% (0–0·6).
Interpretation
Treatment of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis with first-line drugs resulted in suboptimal outcomes, supporting the need for better regimens. Standardised empirical treatment of new cases could be contributing substantially to the multidrug-resistant epidemic, particularly in settings where the prevalence of isoniazid resistance is high.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Tuberculosis is the world's leading infectious disease killer. We aimed to identify shorter, safer drug regimens for the treatment of tuberculosis.
Methods
We did a randomised controlled, open-label trial with a multi-arm, multi-stage design. The trial was done in seven sites in South Africa and Tanzania, including hospitals, health centres, and clinical trial centres. Patients with newly diagnosed, rifampicin-sensitive, previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1:2 ratio to receive (all orally) either 35 mg/kg rifampicin per day with 15–20 mg/kg ethambutol, 20 mg/kg rifampicin per day with 400 mg moxifloxacin, 20 mg/kg rifampicin per day with 300 mg SQ109, 10 mg/kg rifampicin per day with 300 mg SQ109, or a daily standard control regimen (10 mg/kg rifampicin, 5 mg/kg isoniazid, 25 mg/kg pyrazinamide, and 15–20 mg/kg ethambutol). Experimental treatments were given with oral 5 mg/kg isoniazid and 25 mg/kg pyrazinamide per day for 12 weeks, followed by 14 weeks of 5 mg/kg isoniazid and 10 mg/kg rifampicin per day. Because of the orange discoloration of body fluids with higher doses of rifampicin it was not possible to mask patients and clinicians to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was time to culture conversion in liquid media within 12 weeks. Patients without evidence of rifampicin resistance on phenotypic test who took at least one dose of study treatment and had one positive culture on liquid or solid media before or within the first 2 weeks of treatment were included in the primary analysis (modified intention to treat). Time-to-event data were analysed using a Cox proportional-hazards regression model and adjusted for minimisation variables. The proportional hazard assumption was tested using Schoelfeld residuals, with threshold p<0·05 for non-proportionality. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01785186).
Findings
Between May 7, 2013, and March 25, 2014, we enrolled and randomly assigned 365 patients to different treatment arms (63 to rifampicin 35 mg/kg, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol; 59 to rifampicin 10 mg/kg, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, SQ109; 57 to rifampicin 20 mg/kg, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and SQ109; 63 to rifampicin 10 mg/kg, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and moxifloxacin; and 123 to the control arm). Recruitment was stopped early in the arms containing SQ109 since prespecified efficacy thresholds were not met at the planned interim analysis. Time to stable culture conversion in liquid media was faster in the 35 mg/kg rifampicin group than in the control group (median 48 days vs 62 days, adjusted hazard ratio 1·78; 95% CI 1·22–2·58, p=0·003), but not in other experimental arms. There was no difference in any of the groups in time to culture conversion on solid media. 11 patients had treatment failure or recurrent disease during post-treatment follow-up: one in the 35 mg/kg rifampicin arm and none in the moxifloxacin arm. 45 (12%) of 365 patients reported grade 3–5 adverse events, with similar proportions in each arm.
Interpretation
A dose of 35 mg/kg rifampicin was safe, reduced the time to culture conversion in liquid media, and could be a promising component of future, shorter regimens. Our adaptive trial design was successfully implemented in a multi-centre, high tuberculosis burden setting, and could speed regimen development at reduced cost.

abstract = "Summary
Sensitivity and specificity of the modified Duke criteria for native valve endocarditis are both suboptimal, at approximately 80%. Diagnostic accuracy for intracardiac prosthetic material-related infection is even lower. Non-invasive imaging modalities could potentially improve diagnosis of infective endocarditis; however, their diagnostic value is unclear. We did a systematic literature review to critically appraise the evidence for the diagnostic performance of these imaging modalities, according to PRISMA and GRADE criteria. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. 31 studies were included that presented original data on the performance of electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated multidetector CT angiography (MDCTA), ECG-gated MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT, and leucocyte scintigraphy in diagnosis of native valve endocarditis, intracardiac prosthetic material-related infection, and extracardiac foci in adults. We consistently found positive albeit weak evidence for the diagnostic benefit of 18F-FDG PET/CT and MDCTA. We conclude that additional imaging techniques should be considered if infective endocarditis is suspected. We propose an evidence-based diagnostic work-up for infective endocarditis including these non-invasive techniques."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In 2011–12, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) held the first Europe-wide point-prevalence survey of health-care-associated infections in acute care hospitals. We analysed paediatric data from this survey, aiming to calculate the prevalence and type of health-care-associated infections in children and adolescents in Europe and to determine risk factors for infection in this population.
Methods
Point-prevalence surveys took place from May, 2011, to November, 2012, in 1149 hospitals in EU Member States, Iceland, Norway, and Croatia. Patients present on the ward at 0800 h on the day of the survey and who were not discharged at the time of the survey were included. Data were collected by locally trained health-care workers according to patient-based or unit-based protocols. We extracted data from the ECDC database for all paediatric patients (age 0–18 years). We report adjusted prevalence for health-care-associated infections by clustering at the hospital and country level. We also calculated risk factors for development of health-care-associated infections with use of a generalised linear mixed-effects model.
Findings
We analysed data for 17 273 children and adolescents from 29 countries. 770 health-care-associated infections were reported in 726 children and adolescents, corresponding to a prevalence of 4·2% (95% CI 3·7–4·8). Bloodstream infections were the most common type of infection (343 [45%] infections), followed by lower respiratory tract infections (171 [22%]), gastrointestinal infections (64 [8%]), eye, ear, nose, and throat infections (55 [7%]), urinary tract infections (37 [5%]), and surgical-site infections (34 [4%]). The prevalence of infections was highest in paediatric intensive care units (15·5%, 95% CI 11·6–20·3) and neonatal intensive care units (10·7%, 9·0–12·7). Independent risk factors for infection were age younger than 12 months, fatal disease (via ultimately and rapidly fatal McCabe scores), prolonged length of stay, and the use of invasive medical devices. 392 microorganisms were reported for 342 health-care-associated infections, with Enterobacteriaceae being the most frequently found (113 [15%]).
Interpretation
Infection prevention and control strategies in children should focus on prevention of bloodstream infections, particularly among neonates and infants.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Lyme borreliosis develops in 1–5% of individuals bitten by ticks, but with a diagnostic gap affecting up to 30% of patients, a broadly applicable pharmacological prevention strategy is needed. Topical azithromycin effectively eradicated Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato from the skin in preclinical studies. We assessed its efficacy in human beings.
Methods
In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial done in 28 study sites in Germany and Austria, adults were equally assigned to receive topical 10% azithromycin or placebo twice daily for 3 consecutive days, within 72 h of a tick bite being confirmed. Randomisation numbers, which were stratified by study site, were accessed in study centres via an interactive voice-response system, by pharmacists not involved in the study. The primary outcome was the number of treatment failures, defined as erythema migrans, seroconversion, or both, in participants who were seronegative at baseline, had no further tick bites during the study, and had serology results available at 8 weeks (intention-to-treat [ITT] population). This study is registered with EudraCT, number 2011-000117-39.
Findings
Between July 7, 2011, and Dec 3, 2012, 1371 participants were randomly assigned to treatment, of whom 995 were included in the ITT population. The trial was stopped early because an improvement in the primary endpoint in the group receiving azithromycin was not reached. At 8 weeks, 11 (2%) of 505 in the azithromycin group and 11 (2%) of 490 in the placebo group had treatment failure (odds ratio 0·97, 95% CI 0·42–2·26, p=0·47). Topical azithromycin was well tolerated. Similar numbers of patients had adverse events in the two groups (175 [26%] of 505 vs 177 [26%] of 490, p=0·87), and most adverse events were mild.
Interpretation
Topical azithromycin was well tolerated and had a good safety profile. Inclusion of asymptomatic seroconversion into the primary efficacy analysis led to no prevention effect with topical azithromycin. Adequately powered studies assessing only erythema migrans should be considered. A subgroup analysis in this study suggested that topical azithromycin reduces erythema migrans after bites of infected ticks.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Health-care workers have been implicated in nosocomial outbreaks of Staphylococcus aureus, but the dearth of evidence from non-outbreak situations means that routine health-care worker screening and S aureus eradication are controversial. We aimed to determine how often S aureus is transmitted from health-care workers or the environment to patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) and a high-dependency unit (HDU) where standard infection control measures were in place.
Methods
In this longitudinal cohort study, we systematically sampled health-care workers, the environment, and patients over 14 months at the ICU and HDU of the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, England. Nasal swabs were taken from health-care workers every 4 weeks, bed spaces were sampled monthly, and screening swabs were obtained from patients at admission to the ICU or HDU, weekly thereafter, and at discharge. Isolates were cultured and their whole genome sequenced, and we used the threshold of 40 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) or fewer to define subtypes and infer recent transmission.
Findings
Between Oct 31, 2011, and Dec 23, 2012, we sampled 198 health-care workers, 40 environmental locations, and 1854 patients; 1819 isolates were sequenced. Median nasal carriage rate of S aureus in health-care workers at 4-weekly timepoints was 36·9% (IQR 35·7–37·3), and 115 (58%) health-care workers had S aureus detected at least once during the study. S aureus was identified in 8–50% of environmental samples. 605 genetically distinct subtypes were identified (median SNV difference 273, IQR 162–399) at a rate of 38 (IQR 34–42) per 4-weekly cycle. Only 25 instances of transmission to patients (seven from health-care workers, two from the environment, and 16 from other patients) were detected.
Interpretation
In the presence of standard infection control measures, health-care workers were infrequently sources of transmission to patients. S aureus epidemiology in the ICU and HDU is characterised by continuous ingress of distinct subtypes rather than transmission of genetically related strains.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antivirals (eg, oseltamivir) are important for mitigating influenza epidemics. In 2007, an oseltamivir-resistant influenza seasonal A H1N1 strain emerged and spread to global fixation within 1 year. This event showed that antiviral-resistant (AVR) strains can be intrinsically more transmissible than their contemporaneous antiviral-sensitive (AVS) counterpart. Surveillance of AVR fitness is therefore essential. Our objective was to develop a simple method for estimating AVR fitness from surveillance data.
Methods
We defined the fitness of AVR strains as their reproductive number relative to their co-circulating AVS counterparts. We developed a simple method for real-time estimation of AVR fitness from surveillance data. This method requires only information on generation time without other specific details regarding transmission dynamics. We first used simulations to validate this method by showing that it yields unbiased and robust fitness estimates in most epidemic scenarios. We then applied this method to two retrospective case studies and one hypothetical case study.
Findings
We estimated that the oseltamivir-resistant A H1N1 strain that emerged in 2007 was 4% (95% credible interval [CrI] 3–5) more transmissible than its oseltamivir-sensitive predecessor and the oseltamivir-resistant pandemic A H1N1 strain that emerged and circulated in Japan during 2013–14 was 24% (95% CrI 17–30) less transmissible than its oseltamivir-sensitive counterpart. We show that in the event of large-scale antiviral interventions during a pandemic with co-circulation of AVS and AVR strains, our method can be used to inform optimal use of antivirals by monitoring intrinsic AVR fitness and drug pressure on the AVS strain.
Interpretation
We developed a simple method that can be easily integrated into contemporary influenza surveillance systems to provide reliable estimates of AVR fitness in real time.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Early treatment of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with interferon alfa is highly effective, but can be associated with frequent side-effects. We investigated the safety and efficacy of an interferon-free regimen for treatment of acute HCV infection.
Methods
In this prospective, open-label, multicentre, single-arm pilot study, we enrolled adults (≥18 years) with acute HCV genotype 1 monoinfection from ten centres in Germany. Patients were given ledipasvir (90 mg) plus sofosbuvir (400 mg) as a fixed-dose combination tablet once daily for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with sustained virological response (defined as undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after the end of treatment; other primary outcomes were safety and tolerability of ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir. The primary analysis population consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Safety was also assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02309918.
Findings
Between Nov 19, 2014, and Nov 10, 2015, we enrolled 20 patients. Median HCV RNA viral load at baseline was 4·04 log10 IU/mL (1·71–7·20); 11 patients were infected with HCV genotype 1a and nine patients with genotype 1b. All patients achieved a sustained virological response 12 weeks after the end of treatment (20 [100%] of 20 patients). Treatment was well tolerated; there were no drug-related serious adverse events. Up to 12 weeks after treatment, 22 possible or probable drug-related adverse events were reported. There was one serious adverse event, which was judged unrelated to the study drug; one patient was admitted to hospital for surgery of a ruptured cruciate ligament.
Interpretation
Treatment for 6 weeks with ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir was well tolerated and highly effective in patients with acute HCV genotype 1 monoinfection. Short-duration treatment of acute hepatitis C might prevent the spread of HCV in high-risk populations.

abstract = "Summary
Background
As the prevalence of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria increases in the Greater Mekong subregion, emerging resistance to partner drugs in artemisinin combination therapies seriously threatens global efforts to treat and eliminate this disease. Molecular markers that predict failure of artemisinin combination therapy are urgently needed to monitor the spread of partner drug resistance, and to recommend alternative treatments in southeast Asia and beyond.
Methods
We did a genome-wide association study of 297 P falciparum isolates from Cambodia to investigate the relationship of 11 630 exonic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 43 copy number variations (CNVs) with in-vitro piperaquine 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s), and tested whether these genetic variants are markers of treatment failure with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. We then did a survival analysis of 133 patients to determine whether candidate molecular markers predicted parasite recrudescence following dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment.

Piperaquine IC50s increased significantly from 2011 to 2013 in three Cambodian provinces (2011 vs 2013 median IC50s: 20·0 nmol/L [IQR 13·7–29·0] vs 39·2 nmol/L [32·8–48·1] for Ratanakiri, 19·3 nmol/L [15·1–26·2] vs 66·2 nmol/L [49·9–83·0] for Preah Vihear, and 19·6 nmol/L [11·9–33·9] vs 81·1 nmol/L [61·3–113·1] for Pursat; all p≤10−3; Kruskal-Wallis test). Genome-wide analysis of SNPs identified a chromosome 13 region that associates with raised piperaquine IC50s. A non-synonymous SNP (encoding a Glu415Gly substitution) in this region, within a gene encoding an exonuclease, associates with parasite recrudescence following dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment. Genome-wide analysis of CNVs revealed that a single copy of the mdr1 gene on chromosome 5 and a novel amplification of the plasmepsin 2 and plasmepsin 3 genes on chromosome 14 also associate with raised piperaquine IC50s. After adjusting for covariates, both exo-E415G and plasmepsin 2–3 markers significantly associate (p=3·0 × 10−8 and p=1·7 × 10−7, respectively) with decreased treatment efficacy (survival rates 0·38 [95% CI 0·25–0·51] and 0·41 [0·28–0·53], respectively).
Interpretation
The exo-E415G SNP and plasmepsin 2–3 amplification are markers of piperaquine resistance and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures in Cambodia, and can help monitor the spread of these phenotypes into other countries of the Greater Mekong subregion, and elucidate the mechanism of piperaquine resistance. Since plasmepsins are involved in the parasite’s haemoglobin-to-haemozoin conversion pathway, targeted by related antimalarials, plasmepsin 2–3 amplification probably mediates piperaquine resistance.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Inadequate case detection results in high levels of undiagnosed tuberculosis in sub-Saharan Africa. Data for the effect of new diagnostic tools when used for community-based intensified case finding are not available, so we investigated whether the use of sputum Xpert-MTB/RIF and the Determine TB LAM urine test in two African communities could be effective.
Methods
In a pragmatic, randomised, parallel-group trial with individual randomisation stratified by country, we compared sputum Xpert-MTB/RIF, and if HIV-infected, the Determine TB LAM urine test (novel diagnostic group), with laboratory-based sputum smear microscopy (routine diagnostic group) for intensified case finding in communities with high tuberculosis and HIV prevalence in Cape Town, South Africa, and Harare, Zimbabwe. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to these groups with computer-generated allocation lists, using culture as the reference standard. In Cape Town, participants were randomised and tested at an Xpert-equipped mobile van, while in Harare, participants were driven to a local clinic where the same diagnostic tests were done. The primary endpoint was the proportion of culture-positive tuberculosis cases initiating tuberculosis treatment in each study group at 60 days. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01990274.
Findings
Between Oct 18, 2013, and March 31, 2015, 2261 individuals were screened and 875 (39%) of these met the criteria for diagnostic testing. 439 participants were randomly assigned to the novel group and 436 to the routine group. 74 (9%) of 875 participants had confirmed tuberculosis. If late culture-based treatment initiation was excluded, more patients with culture-positive tuberculosis were initiated on treatment in the novel group at 60 days (36 [86%] of 42 in the novel group vs 18 [56%] of 32 in the routine group). Thus the difference in the proportion initiating treatment between groups was 29% (95% CI 9–50, p=0·0047) and 53% more patients initiated therapy in the novel diagnostic group than in the routine diagnostic group. One culture-positive patient was treated based only on a positive LAM test.
Interpretation
Compared with traditional tools, Xpert-MTB/RIF for community-based intensified case finding in HIV and tuberculosis-endemic settings increased the proportion of patients initiating treatment. By contrast, urine LAM testing was not found to be useful for intensive case finding in this setting.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Whereas many antibiotics increase risk of Clostridium difficile infection through dysbiosis, epidemic C difficile ribotypes characterised by multidrug resistance might depend on antibiotic selection pressures arising from population use of specific drugs. We examined the effect of a national antibiotic stewardship intervention limiting the use of 4C antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, co-amoxiclav, and cephalosporins) and other infection prevention and control strategies on the clinical and molecular epidemiology of C difficile infections in northeast Scotland.
Methods
We did a non-linear time-series analysis and quasi-experimental study to explore ecological determinants of clinical burdens from C difficile infections and ribotype distributions in a health board serving 11% of the Scottish population. Study populations were adults (aged ≥16 years) registered with primary carer providers in the community (mean 455 508 inhabitants) or admitted to tertiary level, district general, or geriatric hospitals (mean 33 049 total admissions per month). A mixed persuasive-restrictive 4C antibiotic stewardship intervention was initiated in all populations on May 1, 2009. Other population-specific interventions considered included limiting indications for macrolide prescriptions, introduction of alcohol-based hand sanitiser, a national hand-hygiene campaign, national auditing and inspections of hospital environment cleanliness, and reminders to reduce inappropriate use of proton-pump inhibitors. The total effect of interventions was defined as the difference between observations and projected scenarios without intervention. Primary outcomes were prevalence density of C difficile infection per 1000 occupied bed-days in hospitals or per 100 000 inhabitant-days in the community.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 1997, and Dec 31, 2012, we identified 4885 cases of hospital-onset C difficile infection among 1 289 929 admissions to study hospitals, and a further 1625 cases of community-onset C difficile infection among 455 508 adults registered in primary care. Use of 4C antibiotics was reduced by 50% in both hospitals (mean reduction 193 defined daily doses per 1000 occupied bed-days, 95% CI 45–328, p=0·008) and the community (1·85 defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitant-days, 95% CI 0·23–3·48, p=0·025) during antibiotic stewardship. Falling 4C use predicted rapid declines in multidrug-resistant ribotypes R001 and R027. Hospital-onset C difficile infection prevalence densities were associated with fluoroquinolone, third-generation cephalosporin, macrolides, and carbapenem use, exceeding hospital population specific total use thresholds. Community-onset C difficile infection prevalence density was predicted by recent hospital C difficile infection rates, introduction of mandatory surveillance in individuals older than 65 years, and primary-case use of fluoroquinolones and clindamycin exceeding total use thresholds. Compared with predictions without intervention, C difficile infection prevalence density fell by 68% (mean reduction 1·01 per 1000 occupied bed-days, 0·27–1·76, p=0·008) in hospitals and 45% (0·083, 0·045–0·121 cases per 100 000 inhabitant-days, p<0·0001) in the community, during antibiotic stewardship. We identified no significant effects from other interventions.
Interpretation
Limiting population use of 4C antibiotics reduced selective pressures favouring multidrug-resistant epidemic ribotypes and was associated with substantial declines in total C difficile infections in northeast Scotland. Efforts to control C difficile through antibiotic stewardship should account for ribotype distributions and non-linear effects.

abstract = "Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is recognised as the primary cause of human tuberculosis worldwide. However, substantial evidence suggests that the burden of Mycobacterium bovis, the cause of bovine tuberculosis, might be underestimated in human beings as the cause of zoonotic tuberculosis. In 2013, results from a systematic review and meta-analysis of global zoonotic tuberculosis showed that the same challenges and concerns expressed 15 years ago remain valid. These challenges faced by people with zoonotic tuberculosis might not be proportional to the scientific attention and resources allocated in recent years to other diseases. The burden of zoonotic tuberculosis in people needs important reassessment, especially in areas where bovine tuberculosis is endemic and where people live in conditions that favour direct contact with infected animals or animal products. As countries move towards detecting the 3 million tuberculosis cases estimated to be missed annually, and in view of WHO's end TB strategy endorsed by the health authorities of WHO Member States in 2014 to achieve a world free of tuberculosis by 2035, we call on all tuberculosis stakeholders to act to accurately diagnose and treat tuberculosis caused by M bovis in human beings."

abstract = "Summary
In 2001, the World Health Assembly (WHA) passed the landmark WHA 54.19 resolution for global scale-up of mass administration of anthelmintic drugs for morbidity control of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis, which affect more than 1·5 billion of the world's poorest people. Since then, more than a decade of research and experience has yielded crucial knowledge on the control and elimination of these helminthiases. However, the global strategy has remained largely unchanged since the original 2001 WHA resolution and associated WHO guidelines on preventive chemotherapy. In this Personal View, we highlight recent advances that, taken together, support a call to revise the global strategy and guidelines for preventive chemotherapy and complementary interventions against schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis. These advances include the development of guidance that is specific to goals of morbidity control and elimination of transmission. We quantify the result of forgoing this opportunity by computing the yearly disease burden, mortality, and lost economic productivity associated with maintaining the status quo. Without change, we estimate that the population of sub-Saharan Africa will probably lose 2·3 million disability-adjusted life-years and US$3·5 billion of economic productivity every year, which is comparable to recent acute epidemics, including the 2014 Ebola and 2015 Zika epidemics. We propose that the time is now to strengthen the global strategy to address the substantial disease burden of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis."

abstract = "Summary
Scaling up access to HIV viral load testing for individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy in low-resource settings is a global health priority, as emphasised by research showing the benefits of suppressed viral load for the individual and the whole population. Historically, large-scale diagnostic test implementation has been slow and incomplete because of service delivery and other challenges. Building on lessons from the past, in this Personal View we propose a new framework to accelerate viral load scale-up and ensure equitable access to this essential test. The framework includes the following steps: (1) ensuring adequate financial investment in scaling up this test; (2) achieving pricing agreements and consolidating procurement to lower prices of the test; (3) strengthening functional tiered laboratory networks and systems to expand access to reliable, high-quality testing across countries; (4) strengthening national leadership, with prioritisation of laboratory services; and (5) demand creation and uptake of test results by clinicians, nurses, and patients, which will be vital in ensuring viral load tests are appropriately used to improve the quality of care. The use of dried blood spots to stabilise and ship samples from clinics to laboratories, and the use of point-of-care diagnostic tests, will also be important for ensuring access, especially in settings with reduced laboratory capacity. For countries that have just started to scale up viral load testing, lessons can be learnt from countries such as Botswana, Brazil, South Africa, and Thailand, which have already established viral load programmes. This framework might be useful for guiding the implementation of viral load with the aim of achieving the new global HIV 90-90-90 goals by 2020."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a pervasive problem in surgery. Sutures coated or impregnated with triclosan might reduce the occurrence of SSIs, but evidence of their efficacy is limited, especially in children.
Methods
We designed a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial in patients who underwent elective or daytime emergency surgery at Oulu University Hospital (Oulu, Finland). We included children younger than 18 years staying in the paediatric surgery and orthopaedics ward for any elective or emergency surgery during the daytime and with anticipated use of absorbing sutures. Children were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either triclosan-containing sutures or ordinary absorbing sutures. The primary outcome was the occurrence of superficial or deep surgical site infections according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria within 30 days after surgery. The primary analysis was with modified intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01220700.
Findings
Between September, 2010, and December, 2014, 1633 children were recruited. In the modified intention-to-treat group, SSIs occurred in 20 (3%) of 778 patients allocated to receive triclosan-containing sutures and in 42 (5%) of 779 patients allocated to receive control sutures (risk ratio 0·48, 95% CI 0·28–0·80). To prevent one SSI, triclosan-containing sutures had to be used in 36 children (95% CI 21–111). One patient died from suspected mitochondrial disease; no other expected or unexpected adverse events were reported in either of the groups.
Interpretation
Use of triclosan-containing sutures effectively reduced the occurrence of all SSIs compared with normal sutures. The results accord with the results of meta-analyses of previous studies in adults. Use of triclosan-containing sutures is a simple way to reduce SSIs in children.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Invasive pneumococcal disease continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children younger than 5 years of age in India. We aimed to provide nationally representative data for the pattern of disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, trends in the serotype of invasive pneumococci, and invasive pneumococci antimicrobial resistance patterns, in India.
Methods
In this prospective hospital-based and retrospective laboratory-based surveillance study, we prospectively enrolled children aged younger than 5 years with suspected or proven invasive pneumococcal disease from 18 hospitals or institutional centres and retrospectively included laboratory-confirmed pneumococcal isolates from ten sentinel laboratories, together representing 11 states in India. Eligibility criteria were fever higher than 38°C without localising symptoms, clinical presentation of suspected meningitis or pneumonia, and evidence of radiographic pneumonia. We cultured blood and other normally sterile body fluids, reconfirmed and serotyped pneumococcal isolates, and established antimicrobial susceptibility using standard study protocols.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2011, and June 30, 2015, we enrolled 4377 patients. Among 361 (8%) patients with culture-proven pneumococcal disease, all clinical data were known for 226 (63%); among these patients, 132 (58%) presented with pneumonia, 78 (35%) presented with meningitis, and 16 (7%) had other clinical conditions. 131 (3%) died overall and 29 (8%) patients with invasive pneumococcal disease died. Serotypes 14 (52 [14%] of 361), 1 (49 [14%]), 5 (37 [10%]), and 19F (33 [9%]) were the most common. Penicillin non-susceptibility occurred in isolates from 29 (8%) patients, co-trimoxazole resistance occurred in 239 (66%), erythromycin resistance occurred in 132 (37%), and chloramphenicol resistance occurred in 33 (9%). We found multidrug resistance in 33 (9%) of 361 patients.
Interpretation
The proportion of positive blood cultures, number of isolates, geographical representation, and data generated over the 4·5 years of the study are representative of data for most of India. Continued surveillance is warranted as the decision to introduce protein conjugated vaccine in India is made.

abstract = "Summary
In February, 2016, WHO released a report for the development of national action plans to address the threat of antibiotic resistance, the catastrophic consequences of inaction, and the need for antibiotic stewardship. Antibiotic stewardship combined with infection prevention comprises a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to optimise use of antibiotics. Efforts to mitigate overuse will be unsustainable without learning and coordinating activities globally. In this Personal View, we provide examples of international collaborations to address optimal prescribing, focusing on five countries that have developed different approaches to antibiotic stewardship—the USA, South Africa, Colombia, Australia, and the UK. Although each country's approach differed, when nurtured, individual efforts can positively affect local and national antimicrobial stewardship programmes. Government advocacy, national guidelines, collaborative research, online training programmes, mentoring programmes, and social media in stewardship all played a role. Personal relationships and willingness to learn from each other's successes and failures continues to foster collaboration. We recommend that antibiotic stewardship models need to evolve from infection specialist-based teams to develop and use cadres of health-care professionals, including pharmacists, nurses, and community health workers, to meet the needs of the global population. We also recommend that all health-care providers who prescribe antibiotics take ownership and understand the societal burden of suboptimal antibiotic use, providing examples of how countries can learn, act globally, and share best antibiotic stewardship practices."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Australia introduced a national quadrivalent human papillomavirus (4vHPV) vaccination programme for girls and young women in April, 2007. The HPV genotypes targeted by the female vaccine could also affect the protection afforded to heterosexual men. We examined the prevalence of 4vHPV targeted vaccine genotypes and the nine-valent HPV (9vHPV)-targeted vaccines genotypes among sexually active, predominantly unvaccinated heterosexual men from 2004 to 2015.
Methods
We did a retrospective, observational study of urine and urethral swab specimens from heterosexual men aged 25 years or younger attending the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre between July 1, 2004, and June 30, 2015, who tested positive for Chlamydia trachomatis. We extracted HPV DNA and used the PapType HPV assay to detect 14 high-risk HPV genotypes (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68) and two low-risk genotypes (6 and 11). We calculated the prevalence of any HPV genotype, genotypes 6 or 11, genotypes 16 or 18, genotypes in the 4vHPV group (6, 11, 16, or 18), five additional genotypes in the 9vHPV group (31, 33, 45, 52, or 58), and non-vaccine-targeted genotypes (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 56, 58, 59, 66, or 68).
Findings
We obtained data between July 1, 2004, and June 30, 2015, and did the data analysis in December, 2015. Of 1764 specimens obtained, we included 1466 in our final analysis (the others were excluded because they had indeterminate results or were duplicates). The prevalence of any HPV genotype and genotypes 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 did not change from 2004–05 to 2014–15, but we noted reductions in genotypes 6 and 11 (from 12% [95% CI 6–21%], to 3% [1–7%], ptrend=0·008), 16 and 18 (from 13% [95% CI 7–22%] to 3% [1–6%], ptrend<0·0001), and 4vHPV-targeted genotypes (from 22% [95% CI 14–33%] to 6% [3–10%], ptrend<0·0001). Prevalence of non-vaccine-targeted genotypes increased from 16% [95% CI 9–26%] to 22% [17–29%], ptrend<0·0001). In Australian-born men, 4vHPV-targeted genotype prevalence decreased from 11 of 55 [20%, 95% CI 10–33%] to two of 74 [3%, 0–11%], ptrend<0·0001); an even greater decline occurred in Australian-born men aged 21 years or younger (from four of 13 [31%, 95% CI 9–61%] to none of 25; ptrend<0·0001). Genotypes 16 and 18 decreased (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR] 0·32, 95% CI 0·14–0·74; p=0·008) but not genotypes 6 and 11 (adjusted PR 0·50, 0·16–1·56; p=0·234) in the postvaccination period among men who had arrived in Australia within 2 years from countries with a bivalent vaccine (2vHPV) programme (England, Scotland, Wales, Cook Islands, Northern Ireland, or the Netherlands), compared with the prevaccination period. No change was noted in 4vHPV genotypes in men born overseas in other countries.
Interpretation
The marked reduction in prevalence of 4vHPV genotypes among mainly unvaccinated Australian-born men suggests herd protection has occurred from the female vaccination programme. Additionally, the decline in genotypes 16 and 18, but not genotypes 6 and 11, among overseas-born men predominantly from countries with a 2vHPV vaccine programme suggests that these men received benefits from herd protection for genotypes 16 and 18 from their vaccinated female partners in their own countries. These reductions could translate to reductions in HPV-related malignant conditions in men, even in countries with female-only vaccination programmes.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Lymphatic filariasis is targeted for elimination as a public health problem by 2020. The principal approach used by current programmes is annual mass drug administration with two pairs of drugs with a good safety profile. However, one dose of a triple-drug regimen (ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole) has been shown to clear the transmissible stage of the helminth completely in treated individuals. The aim of this study was to use modelling to assess the potential value of mass drug administration with the triple-drug regimen for accelerating elimination of lymphatic filariasis in different epidemiological settings.
Methods
We used three different transmission models to compare the number of rounds of mass drug administration needed to achieve a prevalence of microfilaraemia less than 1% with the triple-drug regimen and with current two-drug regimens.
Findings
In settings with a low baseline prevalence of lymphatic filariasis (5%), the triple-drug regimen reduced the number of rounds of mass drug administration needed to reach the target prevalence by one or two rounds, compared with the two-drug regimen. For areas with higher baseline prevalence (10–40%), the triple-drug regimen strikingly reduced the number of rounds of mass drug administration needed, by about four or five, but only at moderate-to-high levels of population coverage (>65%) and if systematic non-adherence to mass drug administration was low.
Interpretation
Simulation modelling suggests that the triple-drug regimen has potential to accelerate the elimination of lymphatic filariasis if high population coverage of mass drug administration can be achieved and if systematic non-adherence with mass drug administration is low. Future work will reassess these estimates in light of more clinical trial data and to understand the effect on an individual country's programme.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Western Cambodia is the epicentre of Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance and is facing high rates of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment failures. Genetic tools to detect the multidrug-resistant parasites are needed. Artemisinin resistance can be tracked using the K13 molecular marker, but no marker exists for piperaquine resistance. We aimed to identify genetic markers of piperaquine resistance and study their association with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment failures.
Methods
We obtained blood samples from Cambodian patients infected with P falciparum and treated with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. Patients were followed up for 42 days during the years 2009–15. We established in-vitro and ex-vivo susceptibility profiles for a subset using piperaquine survival assays. We determined whole-genome sequences by Illumina paired-reads sequencing, copy number variations by qPCR, RNA concentrations by qRT-PCR, and protein concentrations by immunoblotting. Fisher’s exact and non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to identify significant differences in single-nucleotide polymorphisms or copy number variants, respectively, for differential distribution between piperaquine-resistant and piperaquine-sensitive parasite lines.
Findings
Whole-genome exon sequence analysis of 31 culture-adapted parasite lines associated amplification of the plasmepsin 2–plasmepsin 3 gene cluster with in-vitro piperaquine resistance. Ex-vivo piperaquine survival assay profiles of 134 isolates correlated with plasmepsin 2 gene copy number. In 725 patients treated with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, multicopy plasmepsin 2 in the sample collected before treatment was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for treatment failure of 20·4 (95% CI 9·1–45·5, p<0·0001). Multicopy plasmepsin 2 predicted dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures with 0·94 (95% CI 0·88–0·98) sensitivity and 0·77 (0·74–0·81) specificity. Analysis of samples collected across the country from 2002 to 2015 showed that the geographical and temporal increase of the proportion of multicopy plasmepsin 2 parasites was highly correlated with increasing dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment failure rates (r=0·89 [95% CI 0·77–0·95], p<0·0001, Spearman’s coefficient of rank correlation). Dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine efficacy at day 42 fell below 90% when the proportion of multicopy plasmepsin 2 parasites exceeded 22%.
Interpretation
Piperaquine resistance in Cambodia is strongly associated with amplification of plasmepsin 2–3, encoding haemoglobin-digesting proteases, regardless of the location. Multicopy plasmepsin 2 constitutes a surrogate molecular marker to track piperaquine resistance. A molecular toolkit combining plasmepsin 2 with K13 and mdr1 monitoring should provide timely information for antimalarial treatment and containment policies.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Submicroscopic malaria infections contribute to transmission in exposed populations but their extent is underestimated even by standard molecular diagnostics. Sophisticated sampling and ultra-sensitive molecular methods can maximise test sensitivity but are not feasible in routine surveillance. Here we investigate the gains achievable by using increasingly sensitive methods with the aim to understand what diagnostic sensitivity is necessary to guide malaria interventions.
Methods
Venous blood samples were collected from participants in a cross-sectional survey in two coastal medium-endemic villages in Madang province, Papua New Guinea. Using ultra-sensitive quantitative PCR (us-qPCR) on concentrated high-volume blood samples (2 mL) as reference, we quantified the proportion of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections and gametocyte carriers detectable in fingerprick blood volumes (200 μL) by standard 18S rRNA qPCR, us-qPCR, rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and ultra-sensitive P falciparum RDT. We further compared the epidemiological patterns observed with each diagnostic approach in the study population.
Findings
Venous blood samples were collected from 300 participants between Dec 5, 2016, and Feb 24, 2017 (ie, during peak rainy season). Standard qPCR identified 87 (54%) of 161 P falciparum infections and 73 (52%) of 141 P vivax infections detected by the reference method. us-qPCR identified an additional 11 (7%) P falciparum infections and 14 (10%) P vivax infections. 80 (86%) of 93 P falciparum gametocyte carriers and 75 (91%) of 82 P vivax gametocyte carriers were found among infections detectable by us-qPCR. Ultra-sensitive RDT missed half of P falciparum infections detected by standard qPCR, including high gametocytaemic infections. Epidemiological patterns corresponded well between standard qPCR and the reference method. As the prevalence of P vivax decreased with increasing age, the proportion of P vivax infections undetectable by standard qPCR increased.
Interpretation
Almost all potentially transmitting parasite carriers were identified with us-qPCR on fingerprick blood volumes. Analysing larger blood volumes revealed a large pool of ultra-low-density P falciparum and P vivax infections, which are unlikely to be transmitted. Therefore, current RDTs cannot replace molecular diagnostics for identifying potential P falciparum transmitters.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Cystic echinococcosis is a neglected zoonotic infection that is distributed worldwide and prioritised by WHO for control efforts. The burden of human cystic echinococcosis is poorly understood in most endemic regions, including eastern Europe. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of abdominal cystic echinococcosis in rural areas of Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey.
Methods
We did a cross-sectional ultrasound-based survey that recruited volunteers from 50 villages in rural areas of Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey. These villages were in provinces with annual hospital incidence of cystic echinococcosis within the mid-range for the respective countries. All people who attended a session were allowed to participate if they agreed to be screened. Abdominal ultrasound screening sessions were hosted in public community structures such as community halls, primary health-care centres, schools, and mosques. Lesions were classified using an adapted WHO classification. We reported the prevalence of abdominal cystic echinococcosis adjusted by sex and age through direct standardisation, using the country's rural population as a reference.
Findings
From July 1, 2014, to Aug 3, 2015, 24 693 individuals presented to screening sessions and 24 687 underwent ultrasound screening. We excluded a further six indivduals due to missing data, leaving 24 681 people in our analysis. Abdominal cystic echinococcosis was detected in 31 of 8602 people screened in Bulgaria, 35 of 7461 screened in Romania, and 53 of 8618 screened in Turkey. The age and sex adjusted prevalence of abdominal cystic echinococcosis was 0·41% (95% CI 0·29–0·58) in Bulgaria, 0·41% (0·26–0·65) in Romania, and 0·59% (0·19–1·85) in Turkey. Active cysts were found in people of all ages, including children, and in all investigated provinces.
Interpretation
Our results provide population-based estimates of the prevalence of abdominal cystic echinococcosis. These findings should be useful to support the planning of cost-effective interventions, supporting the WHO roadmap for cystic echinococcosis control.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine is an effective and well tolerated artemisinin-based combination therapy that has been assessed extensively for the prevention and treatment of malaria. Piperaquine, similar to several structurally related antimalarials currently used, can prolong cardiac ventricular repolarisation duration and the electrocardiographic QT interval, leading to concerns about its proarrhythmic potential. We aimed to assess the risk of potentially lethal iatrogenic ventricular arrhythmias in individuals receiving dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine.
Methods
We did a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis. We searched clinical bibliographic databases (last on May 24, 2017) for studies of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine in human beings. Further unpublished studies were identified with the WHO Evidence Review Group on the Cardiotoxicity of Antimalarials. We searched for articles containing “dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine” as title, abstract, or subject heading keywords, with synonyms and variant spellings as additional search terms. We excluded animal studies, but did not apply limits on language or publication date. Eligible studies were prospective, randomised, controlled trials or cohort studies in which individuals received at least one 3-day treatment course of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine for mass drug administration, preventive therapy, or case management of uncomplicated malaria, with follow-up over at least 3 days. At least two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, agreed study eligibility, and extracted information about study and participant characteristics, adverse event surveillance methodology, dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine exposures, loss-to-follow up, and any deaths after dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment into a standardised database. The risk of sudden unexplained death after dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine with 95% credible intervals (CI) generated by Bayesian meta-analysis was compared with the baseline rate of sudden cardiac death.
Findings
Our search identified 94 eligible primary studies including data for 197 867 individuals who had received dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine: 154 505 in mass drug administration programmes; 15 188 in 14 studies of repeated courses in preventive therapies and case management of uncomplicated malaria; and 28 174 as single-course treatments of uncomplicated malaria in 76 case-management studies. There was one potentially drug-related sudden unexplained death: a healthy woman aged 16 in Mozambique who developed heart palpitations several hours after the second dose of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and collapsed and died on the way to hospital (no autopsy or ECG was done). The median pooled risk estimate of sudden unexplained death after dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was 1 in 757 950 (95% CI 1 in 2 854 490 to 1 in 209 114). This risk estimate was not higher than the baseline rate of sudden cardiac death (0·7–11·9 per 100 000 person-years or 1 in 1 714 280 to 1 in 100 835 over a 30-day risk period). The risk of bias was low in most studies and unclear in a few.
Interpretation
Dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was associated with a low risk of sudden unexplained death that was not higher than the baseline rate of sudden cardiac death. Concerns about repolarisation-related cardiotoxicity need not limit its current use for the prevention and treatment of malaria.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Viral meningitis is increasingly recognised, but little is known about the frequency with which it occurs, or the causes and outcomes in the UK. We aimed to determine the incidence, causes, and sequelae in UK adults to improve the management of patients and assist in health service planning.
Methods
We did a multicentre prospective observational cohort study of adults with suspected meningitis at 42 hospitals across England. Nested within this study, in the National Health Service (NHS) northwest region (now part of NHS England North), was an epidemiological study. Patients were eligible if they were aged 16 years or older, had clinically suspected meningitis, and either underwent a lumbar puncture or, if lumbar puncture was contraindicated, had clinically suspected meningitis and an appropriate pathogen identified either in blood culture or on blood PCR. Individuals with ventricular devices were excluded. We calculated the incidence of viral meningitis using data from patients from the northwest region only and used these data to estimate the population-standardised number of cases in the UK. Patients self-reported quality-of-life and neuropsychological outcomes, using the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L, the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and the Aldenkamp and Baker neuropsychological assessment schedule, for 1 year after admission.
Findings
1126 patients were enrolled between Sept 30, 2011, and Sept 30, 2014. 638 (57%) patients had meningitis: 231 (36%) cases were viral, 99 (16%) were bacterial, and 267 (42%) had an unknown cause. 41 (6%) cases had other causes. The estimated annual incidence of viral meningitis was 2·73 per 100 000 and that of bacterial meningitis was 1·24 per 100 000. The median length of hospital stay for patients with viral meningitis was 4 days (IQR 3–7), increasing to 9 days (6–12) in those treated with antivirals. Earlier lumbar puncture resulted in more patients having a specific cause identified than did those who had a delayed lumbar puncture. Compared with the age-matched UK population, patients with viral meningitis had a mean loss of 0·2 quality-adjusted life-years (SD 0·04) in that first year.
Interpretation
Viruses are the most commonly identified cause of meningitis in UK adults, and lead to substantial long-term morbidity. Delays in getting a lumbar puncture and unnecessary treatment with antivirals were associated with longer hospital stays. Rapid diagnostics and rationalising treatments might reduce the burden of meningitis on health services.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Among women, trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection worldwide, and is associated with serious reproductive morbidity, poor birth outcomes, and amplified HIV transmission. Single-dose metronidazole is the first-line treatment for trichomoniasis. However, bacterial vaginosis can alter treatment efficacy in HIV-infected women, and single-dose metronidazole treatment might not always clear infection. We compared single-dose metronidazole with a 7-day dose for the treatment of trichomoniasis among HIV-uninfected, non-pregnant women and tested whether efficacy was modified by bacterial vaginosis.
Methods
In this multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial, participants were recruited at three sexual health clinics in the USA. We included women positive for Trichomonas vaginalis infection according to clinical screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a single dose of 2 g of metronidazole (single-dose group) or 500 mg of metronidazole twice daily for 7 days (7-day-dose group). The randomisation was done by blocks of four or six for each site. Patients and investigators were aware of treatment assignment. The primary outcome was T vaginalis infection by intention to treat, at test-of-cure 4 weeks after completion of treatment. The analysis of the primary outcome per nucleic acid amplification test or culture was also stratified by bacterial vaginosis status. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01018095, and with the US Food and Drug Administration, number IND118276, and is closed to accrual.
Findings
Participants were recruited from Oct 6, 2014, to April 26, 2017. Of the 1028 patients assessed for eligibility, 623 women were randomly assigned to treatment groups (311 women in the single-dose group and 312 women in the 7-day-dose group; intention-to-treat population). Although planned enrolment had been 1664 women, the study was stopped early because of funding limitations. Patients in the 7-day-dose group were less likely to be T vaginalis positive at test-of-cure than those in the single-dose group (34 [11%] of 312 vs 58 [19%] of 311, relative risk 0·55, 95% CI 0·34–0·70; p<0·0001). Bacterial vaginosis status had no significant effect on relative risk (p=0·17). Self-reported adherence was 96% in the 7-day-dose group and 99% in the single-dose group. Side-effects were similar by group; the most common side-effect was nausea (124 [23%]), followed by headache (38 [7%]) and vomiting (19 [4%]).
Interpretation
The 7-day-dose metronidazole should be the preferred treatment for trichomoniasis among women.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are bacterial pathogens that are frequently associated with diarrhoeal disease, and are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors study 2016 (GBD 2016) is a systematic, scientific effort to quantify the morbidity and mortality due to over 300 causes of death and disability. We aimed to analyse the global burden of shigella and ETEC diarrhoea according to age, sex, geography, and year from 1990 to 2016.
Methods
We modelled shigella and ETEC-related mortality using a Bayesian hierarchical modelling platform that evaluates a wide range of covariates and model types on the basis of vital registration and verbal autopsy data. We used a compartmental meta-regression tool to model the incidence of shigella and ETEC, which enforces an association between incidence, prevalence, and remission on the basis of scientific literature, population representative surveys, and health-care data. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates.
Findings
Shigella was the second leading cause of diarrhoeal mortality in 2016 among all ages, accounting for 212 438 deaths (95% UI 136 979–326 913) and about 13·2% (9·2–17·4) of all diarrhoea deaths. Shigella was responsible for 63 713 deaths (41 191–93 611) among children younger than 5 years and was frequently associated with diarrhoea across all adult age groups, increasing in elderly people, with broad geographical distribution. ETEC was the eighth leading cause of diarrhoea mortality in 2016 among all age groups, accounting for 51 186 deaths (26 757–83 064) and about 3·2% (1·8–4·7) of diarrhoea deaths. ETEC was responsible for about 4·2% (2·2–6·8) of diarrhoea deaths in children younger than 5 years.
Interpretation
The health burden of bacterial diarrhoeal pathogens is difficult to estimate. Despite existing prevention and treatment options, they remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Additional emphasis by public health officials is needed on a reduction in disease due to shigella and ETEC to reduce disease burden.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Bedaquiline and delamanid have been approved for treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis in the past 5 years. Because of theoretical safety concerns, patients have been unable to access the two drugs in combination. Médecins Sans Frontières has supported the use of combination bedaquiline and delamanid for people with few treatment options since 2016. We describe early safety and efficacy of regimens containing the bedaquiline and delamanid combination in patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis in Yerevan, Armenia; Mumbai, India; and Khayelitsha, South Africa.
Methods
We retrospectively analysed a cohort of all patients who received 6–12 months of oral bedaquiline and delamanid in combination (400 mg bedaquiline once per day for 2 weeks, then 200 mg bedaquiline three times per week and 100 mg delamanid twice per day) in MSF-supported projects. We report serious adverse events, QTc corrected using the Fridericia formula (QTcF) interval data, and culture conversion data during the first 6 months of treatment.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2016, and Aug 31, 2016, 28 patients (median age 32·5 years [IQR 28·5–40·5], 17 men) were included in the analysis. 11 (39%) of 28 patients were HIV-positive. 24 patients (86%) had isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones; 14 patients (50%) had extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. No patient had an increase of more than 500 ms in their QTcF interval. Four patients (14%) had six instances of QTcF increase of more than 60 ms from baseline but none permanently discontinued the drugs. 16 serious adverse events were reported in seven patients. Of 23 individuals with positive baseline cultures, 17 (74%) converted to negative by month 6 of treatment.
Interpretation
Use of the bedaquiline and delamanid combination appears to reveal no additive or synergistic QTcF-prolonging effects. Access to bedaquiline and delamanid in combination should be expanded for people with few treatment options while awaiting the results of formal clinical trials.

Although vaccination is the main strategy used to control meningococcal disease outbreaks, mass chemoprophylaxis has also been used as an immediate response to outbreaks, either to supplement vaccination or when vaccination is not possible. However, public health guidelines regarding the use of mass chemoprophylaxis for outbreak control vary by country, partly because the impact of mass chemoprophylaxis on the course of an individual outbreak is difficult to assess. We have reviewed data for the use of mass chemoprophylaxis during 33 outbreaks that occurred both in military populations and in communities and non-military organisations. In most outbreaks, no additional cases of meningococcal disease occurred after mass chemoprophylaxis, or cases occurred only in individuals who had not received prophylaxis. A delay of several weeks was common before cases occurred among prophylaxis recipients. Overall, the outbreak reports that we reviewed suggest that mass chemoprophylaxis might provide temporary protection to chemoprophylaxis recipients during outbreaks."

Background
Fungal infections remain a major contributor to the opportunistic infections that affect people living with HIV. Among them, histoplasmosis is considered neglected, often being misdiagnosed as tuberculosis, and is responsible for numerous deaths in Latin America. The objective of this study was to estimate the burden of HIV-associated histoplasmosis compared with tuberculosis in Latin American countries.
Methods
For this modelling study, we estimated prevalence of previous exposure to Histoplasma capsulatum, HIV-associated histoplasmosis annual incidence, and number of deaths in 2012 in Latin American countries based on historical histoplasmin skin test studies in the general population, with an antigen dilution level of more than 1/10. Studies were identified in a literature search. Data on HIV-associated tuberculosis were extracted from the WHO notifications and outcomes tables and data on people living with HIV were extracted from the UNAIDS report for the year 2012. We systematically propagated uncertainty throughout all the steps of the estimation process.
Findings
Among 1310 articles identified as of June 1, 2015, 24 articles were included in the study, representing 129 histoplasmin skin test studies led in the general population of Latin American countries. For the year 2012, we estimated a range of 6710 (95% CI 5680–7867) to 15 657 (13 254–18 357) cases of symptomatic HIV-associated histoplasmosis in Latin America. Hotspot areas for histoplasmosis prevalence (>30%) and incidence (>1·5 cases per 100 people living with HIV) were Central America, the northernmost part of South America, and Argentina. According to realistic scenarios, we estimated a range of 671 (95% CI 568–787) to 9394 (7952–11 014) deaths related to histoplasmosis, compared with 5062 (3777–6405) deaths related to tuberculosis reported in Latin America.
Interpretation
Our estimates of histoplasmosis incidence and deaths are high and consistent with published data. For the first time, the burden of histoplasmosis is estimated to be equivalent in incidence and even higher in deaths when compared with tuberculosis among people living with HIV in Latin America.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The recommended anthelmintics show low efficacy in a single-dose regimen against Trichuris trichiura. Moxidectin, a new treatment for river blindness, might complement the drug armamentarium for the treatment and control of soil-transmitted helminthiasis. However, its efficacy against T trichiura has not yet been studied. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of moxidectin alone and in co-administrations against T trichiura infection.
Methods
A randomised, single-blind, non-inferiority trial was done in two primary schools and one secondary school in Pemba, Tanzania. Adolescents aged 12–18 years who tested positive for T trichiura were randomly assigned (5:5:3:3) with a computer-generated sequence to receive moxidectin (8 mg) plus albendazole (400 mg), albendazole (400 mg) plus oxantel pamoate (25 mg/kg; reference treatment), moxidectin (8 mg) plus tribendimidine (200 mg or 400 mg), or moxidectin (8 mg) alone. Study group assignments were masked from participants and laboratory technicians. The primary outcome was non-inferiority with a 2 percentage point margin for egg reduction rate (ERR) against T trichiura assessed as the relative change in the geometric mean egg counts from baseline to 14–21 days after treatment with the Kato-Katz method, based on the available case population. Cure rates (CR) and tolerability (assessed 3, 24, and 48 h post treatment) were secondary outcomes. The study is registered at ISRCTN (number 20398469) and is closed to accrual.
Findings
701 students were enrolled between April 1, and Aug 7, 2017. Primary outcome data were available for 634 students. We observed ERRs of 98·5% for moxidectin plus albendazole and 99·8% for albendazole plus oxantel pamoate, resulting in an absolute difference of −1·2 percentage points (95% CI −1·8 to −0·8), meeting the non-inferiority margin. 100 (51%) of 197 students receiving moxidectin plus albendazole and 166 (83%) of 200 receiving albendazole plus oxantel pamoate were cured, indicating a difference of 32 percentage points (odds ratio 5·3, 95% CI 3·3 to 8·7). ERRs were 91·6% for moxidectin–tribendimidine and 83·2% for moxidectin. Only mild adverse events (mainly headache and stomach pain) were reported. The largest number of adverse events (126 [20%] of 632 students) was observed 24 h post treatment, with no difference among the individual treatment arms (ranging from 23 [19%] of 118 students treated with moxidectin to 38 [19%] of 199 with moxidectin plus albendazole).
Interpretation
Moxidectin plus albendazole showed non-inferiority to albendazole plus oxantel pamoate in terms of ERR; however, albendazole plus oxantel pamoate showed a considerably higher cure rate. Dose-optimisation studies with moxidectin and moxidectin plus albendazole should be considered since the efficacy of the dose used for the treatment of onchocerciasis (8 mg) in this study might not be optimal for the treatment of T trichiura infections.

abstract = "Summary
Background
A single-dose regimen of inactivated whole-cell oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is attractive because it reduces logistical challenges for vaccination and could enable more people to be vaccinated. Previously, we reported the efficacy of a single dose of an OCV vaccine during the 6 months following dosing. Herein, we report the results of 2 years of follow-up.
Methods
In this placebo-controlled, double-blind trial done in Dhaka, Bangladesh, individuals aged 1 year or older with no history of receipt of OCV were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of inactivated OCV or oral placebo. The primary endpoint was a confirmed episode of non-bloody diarrhoea for which the onset was at least 7 days after dosing and a faecal culture was positive for Vibrio cholerae O1 or O139. Passive surveillance for diarrhoea was done in 13 hospitals or major clinics located in or near the study area for 2 years after the last administered dose. We assessed the protective efficacy of the OCV against culture-confirmed cholera occurring 7–730 days after dosing with both crude and multivariable per-protocol analyses. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02027207.
Findings
Between Jan 10, 2014, and Feb 4, 2014, 205 513 people were randomly assigned to receive either vaccine or placebo, of whom 204 700 (102 552 vaccine recipients and 102 148 placebo recipients) were included in the per-protocol analysis. 287 first episodes of cholera (109 among vaccine recipients and 178 among placebo recipients) were detected during the 2-year follow-up; 138 of these episodes (46 in vaccine recipients and 92 in placebo recipients) were associated with severe dehydration. The overall incidence rates of initial cholera episodes were 0·22 (95% CI 0·18 to 0·27) per 100 000 person-days in vaccine recipients versus 0·36 (0·31 to 0·42) per 100 000 person-days in placebo recipients (adjusted protective efficacy 39%, 95% CI 23 to 52). The overall incidence of severe cholera was 0·09 (0·07 to 0·12) per 100 000 person-days versus 0·19 (0·15 to 0·23; adjusted protective efficacy 50%, 29 to 65). Vaccine protective efficacy was 52% (8 to 75) against all cholera episodes and 71% (27 to 88) against severe cholera episodes in participants aged 5 years to younger than 15 years. For participants aged 15 years or older, vaccine protective efficacy was 59% (42 to 71) against all cholera episodes and 59% (35 to 74) against severe cholera. The protection in the older age groups was sustained throughout the 2-year follow-up. In participants younger than 5 years, the vaccine did not show protection against either all cholera episodes (protective efficacy −13%, −68 to 25) or severe cholera episodes (−44%, −220 to 35).
Interpretation
A single dose of the inactivated whole-cell OCV offered protection to older children and adults that was sustained for at least 2 years. The absence of protection of young children might reflect a lesser degree of pre-existing natural immunity in this age group.

Background
Several new treatments for Clostridium difficile infections have been investigated. We aimed to compare and rank treatments for non-multiply recurrent infections with C difficile in adults.
Methods
We did a random effects network meta-analysis within a frequentist setting to obtain direct and indirect comparisons of trials. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov for published and unpublished trials from the creation of these databases until June 30, 2017. We included randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-multiply recurrent infections with confirmed C difficile in adults (at least 18 years) that reported both primary cure and recurrence rates, and we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to appraise trial methods. For our analysis, we extracted the total numbers of patients with primary cure and recurrence from published and unpublished reports. The primary outcome was sustained symptomatic cure, defined as the number of patients with resolution of diarrhoea minus the number with recurrence or death.
Findings
Of 23 004 studies screened, 24 trials, which comprised 5361 patients and 13 different treatments, were included in the analysis. The overall quality of evidence was rated as moderate to low. For sustained symptomatic cure, fidaxomicin (odds ratio 0·67, 95% CI 0·55–0·82) and teicoplanin (0·37, 0·14–0·94) were significantly better than vancomycin. Teicoplanin (0·27, 0·10–0·70), ridinilazole (0·41, 0·19–0·88), fidaxomicin (0·49, 0·35–0·68), surotomycin (0·66, 0·45–0·97), and vancomycin (0·73, 0·56–0·95) were better than metronidazole. Bacitracin was inferior to teicoplanin (0·22, 0·06–0·77) and fidaxomicin (0·40, 0·17–0·94), and tolevamer was inferior to all drugs except for LFF571 (0·50, 0·18–1·39) and bacitracin (0·67, 0·28–1·58). Global heterogeneity of the entire network was low (Cochran's Q=15·70; p=0·47).
Interpretation
Among the treatments for non-multiply recurrent infections by C difficile, the highest quality evidence indicates that fidaxomicin provides a sustained symptomatic cure most frequently. Fidaxomicin is a better treatment option than vancomycin for all patients except those with severe infections with C difficile and could be considered as a first-line therapy. Metronidazole should not be recommended for treatment of C difficile.

Background
The National Hand Hygiene Initiative (NHHI) is a standardised culture-change programme based on the WHO My 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene approach to improve hand hygiene compliance among Australian health-care workers and reduce the risk of health-care-associated infections. We analysed its effectiveness.
Methods
In this longitudinal study, we assessed outcomes of the NHHI for the 8 years after implementation (between Jan 1, 2009, and June 30, 2017), including hospital participation, hand hygiene compliance (measured as the proportion of observed Moments) three times per year, educational engagement, cost, and association with the incidence of health-care-associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (HA-SAB).
Findings
Between 2009 and 2017, increases were observed in national health-care facility participation (105 hospitals [103 public and two private] in 2009 vs 937 hospitals [598 public and 339 private] in 2017) and overall hand hygiene compliance (36 213 [63·6%] of 56 978 Moments [95% CI 63·2–63·9] in 2009 vs 494 673 [84·3%] of 586 559 Moments [84·2–84·4] in 2017; p<0·0001). Compliance also increased for each Moment type and for each health-care worker occupational group, including for medical staff (4377 [50·5%] of 8669 Moments [95% CI 49·4–51·5] in 2009 vs 53 620 [71·7%] of 74 788 Moments [71·4–72·0]; p<0·0001). 1 989 713 NHHI online learning credential programmes were completed. The 2016 NHHI budget was equivalent to AUD$0·06 per inpatient admission nationally. Among Australia's major public hospitals (n=132), improved hand hygiene compliance was associated with declines in the incidence of HA-SAB (incidence rate ratio 0·85; 95% CI 0·79–0·93; p≤0·0001): for every 10% increase in hand hygiene compliance, the incidence of HA-SAB decreased by 15%.
Interpretation
The NHHI has been associated with significant sustained improvement in hand hygiene compliance and a decline in the incidence of HA-SAB. Key features include sustained central coordination of a standardised approach and incorporation into hospital accreditation standards. The NHHI could be emulated in other national culture-change programmes.

abstract = "Summary
Low-resource settings are disproportionately burdened by infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance. Good quality clinical bacteriology through a well functioning reference laboratory network is necessary for effective resistance control, but low-resource settings face infrastructural, technical, and behavioural challenges in the implementation of clinical bacteriology. In this Personal View, we explore what constitutes successful implementation of clinical bacteriology in low-resource settings and describe a framework for implementation that is suitable for general referral hospitals in low-income and middle-income countries with a moderate infrastructure. Most microbiological techniques and equipment are not developed for the specific needs of such settings. Pending the arrival of a new generation diagnostics for these settings, we suggest focus on improving, adapting, and implementing conventional, culture-based techniques. Priorities in low-resource settings include harmonised, quality assured, and tropicalised equipment, consumables, and techniques, and rationalised bacterial identification and testing for antimicrobial resistance. Diagnostics should be integrated into clinical care and patient management; clinically relevant specimens must be appropriately selected and prioritised. Open-access training materials and information management tools should be developed. Also important is the need for onsite validation and field adoption of diagnostics in low-resource settings, with considerable shortening of the time between development and implementation of diagnostics. We argue that the implementation of clinical bacteriology in low-resource settings improves patient management, provides valuable surveillance for local antibiotic treatment guidelines and national policies, and supports containment of antimicrobial resistance and the prevention and control of hospital-acquired infections."

abstract = "Summary
Background
DSM265 is a novel, long-duration inhibitor of plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) with excellent selectivity over human DHODH and activity against blood and liver stages of Plasmodium falciparum. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of DSM265 in patients with P falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria infection.
Methods
This proof-of-concept, open-label, phase 2a study was conducted at the Asociación Civil Selva Amazónica in Iquitos, Peru. Patients aged 18–70 years, weighing 45–90 kg, who had clinical malaria (P falciparum or P vivax monoinfection) and fever within the previous 24 h were eligible. Exclusion criteria were clinical or laboratory signs of severe malaria, inability to take oral medicine, and use of other antimalarial treatment in the preceding 14 days. Patients were divided into cohorts of those with P falciparum (cohort a) or P vivax (cohort b) infection. Two initial cohorts received single oral doses of 400 mg DSM265. Patients were followed up for efficacy for 28 days and safety for 35 days. Further cohorts received escalated or de-escalated doses of DSM265, after safety and efficacy assessment of the initial dose. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving PCR-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) by day 14 for patients infected with P falciparum and the proportion of patients achieving a crude cure by day 14 for those infected with P vivax. Cohort success, the criteria for dose escalation, was defined as ACPR (P falciparum) or crude cure (P vivax) in at least 80% of patients in the cohort. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population (ITT) and the per-protocol population, and safety analyses were done in all patients who received the study drug. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02123290).
Findings
Between Jan 12, 2015, and Dec 2, 2015, 45 Peruvian patients (24 with P falciparum [cohort a] and 21 with P vivax [cohort b] infection) were sequentially enrolled. For patients with P falciparum malaria in the per-protocol population, all 11 (100%) in the 400 mg group and eight (80%) of ten in the 250 mg group achieved ACPR on day 14. In the ITT analysis, 11 (85%) of 13 in the 400 mg group and eight (73%) of 11 in the 250 mg group achieved ACPR at day 14. For the patients with P vivax malaria, the primary endpoint was not met. In the per-protocol analysis, none of four patients who had 400 mg, three (50%) of six who had 600 mg, and one (25%) of four who had 800 mg DSM265 achieved crude cure at day 14. In the ITT analysis, none of five in the 400 mg group, three (33%) of nine in the 600 mg group, and one (14%) of seven in the 800 mg group achieved crude cure at day 14. During the 28-day extended observation of P falciparum patients, a resistance-associated mutation in the gene encoding the DSM265 target DHODH was observed in two of four recurring patients. DSM265 was well tolerated. The most common adverse events were pyrexia (20 [44%] of 45) and headache (18 [40%] of 45), which are both common symptoms of malaria, and no patients had any treatment-related serious adverse events or adverse events leading to study discontinuation.
Interpretation
After a single dose of DSM265, P falciparum parasitaemia was rapidly cleared, whereas against P vivax, DSM265 showed less effective clearance kinetics. Its long duration of action provides the potential to prevent recurrence of P falciparum after treatment with a single dose, which should be further assessed in future combination studies.

abstract = "Summary
Increasing reliance on antibiotics of last resort to treat the rising numbers of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in people has focused attention on how shared-use antibiotics are managed and regulated across human and animal health. Discussions at international and national levels have intensified since the identification of new plasmid-mediated genes for colistin resistance in 2016, first in China and subsequently in many other countries, removing the last line of defense against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections with carbapenem resistance. South Africa has reacted to this threat by doing a situational analysis and review of the existing legislation concerning colistin use in animals and people, to inform which course of action to take. The experiences shared in this Personal View outline the process, institution of governance with widespread stakeholder engagement, surveillance, and interventions that South Africa has taken towards optimising the shared use of colistin. The instigation of stewardship guided by the principles of the One Health concept for shared-use antibiotics at the country level is a crucial component of any action plan to combat antibiotic resistance, and is as relevant to other existing antibiotics and new chemical entities that will be forthcoming from an invigorated antibiotic pipeline as it is to colistin."

Mitigating the risks of antibiotic resistance requires a horizon scan linking the quality with the quantity of data reported on drivers of antibiotic resistance in humans, arising from the human, animal, and environmental reservoirs. We did a systematic review using a One Health approach to survey the key drivers of antibiotic resistance in humans. Two sets of reviewers selected 565 studies from a total of 2819 titles and abstracts identified in Embase, MEDLINE, and Scopus (2005–18), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and WHO (One Health data). Study quality was assessed in accordance with Cochrane recommendations. Previous antibiotic exposure, underlying disease, and invasive procedures were the risk factors with most supporting evidence identified from the 88 risk factors retrieved. The odds ratios of antibiotic resistance were primarily reported to be between 2 and 4 for these risk factors when compared with their respective controls or baseline risk groups. Food-related transmission from the animal reservoir and water-related transmission from the environmental reservoir were frequently quantified. Uniformly quantifying relationships between risk factors will help researchers to better understand the process by which antibiotic resistance arises in human infections."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Successive implementation of seven-valent then 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) led to a marked decrease in pneumococcal disease burden, including pneumococcal meningitis. We assessed the long-term effect of implementation of PCVs on incidence of pneumococcal meningitis in children in France over a 16-year period.
Methods
We did a quasi-experimental, population-based interrupted time-series analysis with a nationwide prospective survey over 16 years in France, recruiting children aged younger than 15 years from 227 paediatric wards from January, 2001, to December, 2016. The main outcome by the time-series model was the estimated incidence of pneumococcal meningitis per 100 000 children (of a population of 12·6 million children in 2017) before and after PCV7 and PCV13 implementation. The time-series model was based on segmented regression with autoregressive error.
Findings
We enrolled 1778 children with pneumococcal meningitis. PCV13 implementation led to a significant reduction in monthly incidence of pneumococcal meningitis from 0·12 per 100 000 children before PCV13 to a nadir of 0·07 in December, 2014 (−38%, 95% CI −56·1 to −20·4; p<0·0001). A sharp increase occurred during 2015 and 2016, (+2·3% per month, incidence of 0·13 per 100 000 children at the end of the study period, p=0·0002), mainly related to an increase of serotype 24F, which was frequently penicillin resistant.
Interpretation
The early effect of PCV13 implementation greatly reduced the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis in children less than 15 years old. However, a sharp rebound in incidence linked to the emergence of serotype 24F compromised the long-term PCV efficacy.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Albendazole and mebendazole are commonly used to control hookworm, but have shortcomings in their efficacy profiles. We assessed whether triple drug therapy (TDT) with albendazole, pyrantel pamoate, and oxantel pamoate was more effective than the co-administration of two drugs for the treatment of hookworm infections.
Methods
A randomised, single-blind trial was done from Sept 27 until Nov 17, 2017, in Laos. Children (6–15 years) from six schools were invited to participate. Hookworm-positive children were randomly assigned (2:2:1:1) by a computer stratified list (block sizes of six and 12) to TDT with albendazole (400 mg), pyrantel pamoate (20 mg/kg), and oxantel pamoate (20 mg/kg); albendazole plus oxantel pamoate; pyrantel pamoate plus oxantel pamoate; or mebendazole (500 mg) combined with both pyrantel pamoate and oxantel pamoate (used as proof of concept to compare the two TDTs). Two stool samples were collected at baseline and follow-up (17–30 days after treatment) and analysed with the Kato-Katz method. The primary outcome was the proportion of hookworm egg-negative children at follow-up in all Kato-Katz slides (cure rate [CR]) in the TDT with albendazole, pyrantel pamoate, and oxantel pamoate group compared with the albendazole plus oxantel pamoate and pyrantel pamoate plus oxantel pamoate groups. Secondary outcomes were tolerability 3 h and 24 h after treatment, egg reduction rates (ERRs) against hookworm, and efficacy against concomitant soil-transmitted helminth infections. Participating children and field and laboratory technicians were masked to treatment allocation. All children with follow-up data were included in the primary analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03278431.
Findings
1529 children were assessed for eligibility, of whom 533 provided complete baseline data and 414 provided complete outcome data. The CR was higher for the TDT albendazole, pyrantel pamoate, and oxantel pamoate (116 [84%] of 138) than with albendazole plus oxantel pamoate (73 [53%] of 138; odds ratio 4·7, 95% CI 2·7–8·3; p<0·0001) and pyrantel pamoate plus oxantel pamoate (36 [52%] of 69; 4·8, 2·5–9·3; p<0·0001). The geometric ERR of the TDT albendazole, pyrantel pamoate, and oxantel pamoate (99·9%) was higher than that for albendazole plus oxantel pamoate (99·0%; difference in ERR 0·9 percentage points, 95% CI 0·5–1·4), and pyrantel pamoate plus oxantel pamoate (99·2%; 0·7 percentage points, 0·3–1·3). Adverse events were reported by six (1%) children 3 h and none 24 h after treatment, without any difference across treatment groups.
Interpretation
TDT with albendazole, pyrantel pamoate, and oxantel pamoate could make a difference, in particular in the context of soil-transmitted helminth elimination. Pyrantel pamoate might be a useful alternative to prevent benzimidazole resistance; however, larger trials are needed to confirm this finding.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Escherichia coli bloodstream infections are increasing in the UK and internationally. The evidence base to guide interventions against this major public health concern is small. We aimed to investigate possible drivers of changes in the incidence of E coli bloodstream infection and antibiotic susceptibilities in Oxfordshire, UK, over the past two decades, while stratifying for time since hospital exposure.
Methods
In this observational study, we used all available data on E coli bloodstream infections and E coli urinary tract infections (UTIs) from one UK region (Oxfordshire) using anonymised linked microbiological data and hospital electronic health records from the Infections in Oxfordshire Research Database (IORD). We estimated the incidence of infections across a two decade period and the annual incidence rate ratio (aIRR) in 2016. We modelled the data using negative binomial regression on the basis of microbiological, clinical, and health-care-exposure risk factors. We investigated infection severity, 30-day all-cause mortality, and community and hospital amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) use to estimate changes in bacterial virulence and the effect of antimicrobial resistance on incidence.
Findings
From Jan 1, 1998, to Dec 31, 2016, 5706 E coli bloodstream infections occurred in 5215 patients, and 228 376 E coli UTIs occurred in 137 075 patients. 1365 (24%) E coli bloodstream infections were nosocomial (onset >48 h after hospital admission), 1132 (20%) were quasi-nosocomial (≤30 days after discharge), 1346 (24%) were quasi-community (31–365 days after discharge), and 1863 (33%) were community (>365 days after hospital discharge). The overall incidence increased year on year (aIRR 1·06, 95% CI 1·05–1·06). In 2016, 212 (41%) of 515 E coli bloodstream infections and 3921 (28%) of 13 792 E coli UTIs were co-amoxiclav resistant. Increases in E coli bloodstream infections were driven by increases in community (aIRR 1·10, 95% CI 1·07–1·13; p<0·0001) and quasi-community (aIRR 1·08, 1·07–1·10; p<0·0001) cases. 30-day mortality associated with E coli bloodstream infection decreased over time in the nosocomial (adjusted rate ratio [RR] 0·98, 95% CI 0·96–1·00; p=0·03) group, and remained stable in the quasi-nosocomial (adjusted RR 0·98, 0·95–1·00; p=0·06), quasi-community (adjusted RR 0·99, 0·96–1·01; p=0·32), and community (adjusted RR 0·99, 0·96–1·01; p=0·21) groups. Mortality was, however, substantial at 14–25% across all hospital-exposure groups. Co-amoxiclav-resistant E coli bloodstream infections increased in all groups across the study period (by 11–18% per year, significantly faster than co-amoxiclav-susceptible E coli bloodstream infections; pheterogeneity<0·0001), as did co-amoxiclav-resistant E coli UTIs (by 14–29% per year; pheterogeneity<0·0001). Previous year co-amoxiclav use in primary-care facilities was associated with increased subsequent year community co-amoxiclav-resistant E coli UTIs (p=0·003).
Interpretation
Increases in E coli bloodstream infections in Oxfordshire are primarily community associated, with substantial co-amoxiclav resistance; nevertheless, we found little or no change in mortality. Focusing interventions on primary care facilities, particularly those with high co-amoxiclav use, could be effective in reducing the incidence of co-amoxiclav-resistant E coli bloodstream infections, in this region and more generally.

abstract = "Summary
Genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection is the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection. Trachoma is caused by ocular infection with C trachomatis and is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. New serological assays for C trachomatis could facilitate improved understanding of C trachomatis epidemiology and prevention. C trachomatis serology offers a means of investigating the incidence of chlamydia infection and might be developed as a biomarker of scarring sequelae, such as pelvic inflammatory disease. Therefore, serological assays have potential as epidemiological tools to quantify unmet need, inform service planning, evaluate interventions including screening and treatment, and to assess new vaccine candidates. However, questions about the performance characteristics and interpretation of C trachomatis serological assays remain, which must be addressed to advance development within this field. In this Personal View, we explore the available information about C trachomatis serology and propose several priority actions. These actions involve development of target product profiles to guide assay selection and assessment across multiple applications and populations, establishment of a serum bank to facilitate assay development and evaluation, and development of technical and statistical methods for assay evaluation and analysis of serological findings. The field of C trachomatis serology will benefit from collaboration across the public health community to align technological developments with their potential applications."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most frequent health-care-associated infections in developing countries. Specific prevention measures are highly effective, but are often poorly implemented. We aimed to establish the effect of a multimodal intervention on SSIs in Africa.
Methods
We did a before–after cohort study, between July 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2015, at five African hospitals. The multimodal intervention consisted of the implementation or strengthening of multiple SSI prevention measures, combined with an adaptive approach aimed at the improvement of teamwork and the safety climate. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of SSI, and the secondary outcome was death within 30 days post surgery. Data on adherence to SSI prevention measures were prospectively collected. The intervention effect on SSI risk and death within 30 days post surgery was assessed in a mixed-effects logistic regression model, after adjustment for key confounders.
Findings
Four hospitals completed the baseline and follow-up; three provided suitable (ie, sufficient number and quality) data for the sustainability period. 4322 operations were followed up (1604 at baseline, 1827 at follow-up, and 891 in the sustainability period). SSI cumulative incidence significantly decreased post intervention, from 8·0% (95% CI 6·8–9·5; n=129) to 3·8% (3·0–4·8; n=70; p<0·0001), and this decrease persisted in the sustainability period (3·9%, 2·8–5·4; n=35). A substantial improvement in compliance with prevention measures was consistently observed in the follow-up and sustainability periods. The likelihood of SSI during follow-up was significantly lower than pre-intervention (odds ratio [OR] 0·40, 95% CI 0·29–0·54; p<0·0001), but the likelihood of death was not significantly reduced (0·72, 0·42–1·24; p=0·2360).
Interpretation
Implementation of our intervention is feasible in African hospitals. Improvement was observed across all perioperative prevention practices. A significant effect on the overall SSI risk was observed, but with some heterogeneity between sites. Further large-scale experimental studies are needed to confirm these results and to improve the sustainability and long-term effect of such complex programmes.

Over the past 10 years, knowledge of the burden, economic costs, and consequences of malaria in pregnancy has improved, and the prevalence of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum has declined substantially in some geographical areas. In particular, studies outside of Africa have increased the evidence base of Plasmodium vivax in pregnancy. Rapid diagnostic tests have been poor at detecting malaria in pregnant women, while PCR has shown a high prevalence of low density infection, the clinical importance of which is unknown. Erythrocytes infected with P falciparum that express the surface protein VAR2CSA accumulate in the placenta, and VAR2CSA is an important target of protective immunity. Clinical trials for a VAR2CSA vaccine are ongoing, but sequence variation needs to be carefully studied. Health system and household costs still limit access to prevention and treatment services. Within the context of malaria elimination, pregnant women could be used to monitor malaria transmission. This Series paper summarises recent progress and highlights unresolved issues related to the burden of malaria in pregnancy."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Ivermectin is being considered for mass drug administration for malaria due to its ability to kill mosquitoes feeding on recently treated individuals. However, standard, single doses of 150–200 μg/kg used for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis have a short-lived mosquitocidal effect (<7 days). Because ivermectin is well tolerated up to 2000 μg/kg, we aimed to establish the safety, tolerability, and mosquitocidal efficacy of 3 day courses of high-dose ivermectin, co-administered with a standard malaria treatment.
Methods
We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superiority trial at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital (Kisumu, Kenya). Adults (aged 18–50 years) were eligible if they had confirmed symptomatic uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria and agreed to the follow-up schedule. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using sealed envelopes, stratified by sex and body-mass index (men: <21 vs ≥21 kg/m2; women: <23 vs ≥23 kg/m2), with permuted blocks of three, to receive 3 days of ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day, ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day, or placebo, all co-administered with 3 days of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Blood of patients taken on post-treatment days 0, 2 + 4 h, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 was fed to laboratory-reared Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto mosquitoes, and mosquito survival was assessed daily for 28 days after feeding. The primary outcome was 14-day cumulative mortality of mosquitoes fed 7 days after ivermectin treatment (from participants who received at least one dose of study medication). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02511353.
Findings
Between July 20, 2015, and May 7, 2016, 741 adults with malaria were assessed for eligibility, of whom 141 were randomly assigned to receive ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day (n=47), ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day (n=48), or placebo (n=46). 128 patients (91%) attended the primary outcome visit 7 days post treatment. Compared with placebo, ivermectin was associated with higher 14 day post-feeding mosquito mortality when fed on blood taken 7 days post treatment (ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day risk ratio [RR] 2·26, 95% CI 1·93–2·65, p<0·0001; hazard ratio [HR] 6·32, 4·61–8·67, p<0·0001; ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day RR 2·18, 1·86–2·57, p<0·0001; HR 4·21, 3·06–5·79, p<0·0001). Mosquito mortality remained significantly increased 28 days post treatment (ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day RR 1·23, 1·01–1·50, p=0·0374; and ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day 1·21, 1·01–1·44, p=0·0337). Five (11%) of 45 patients receiving ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day, two (4%) of 48 patients receiving ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day, and none of 46 patients receiving placebo had one or more treatment-related adverse events.
Interpretation
Ivermectin at both doses assessed was well tolerated and reduced mosquito survival for at least 28 days after treatment. Ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day for 3 days provided a good balance between efficacy and tolerability, and this drug shows promise as a potential new tool for malaria elimination.

Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis and detection of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis is essential for achieving global tuberculosis control. Despite the introduction of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay as the first-line rapid tuberculosis diagnostic test, the gap between global estimates of incidence and new case notifications is 4·1 million people. More accurate, rapid, and cost-effective screening tests are needed to improve case detection. Diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and tuberculosis in children, people living with HIV, and pregnant women remains particularly problematic. The diagnostic molecular technology landscape has continued to expand, including the development of tests for resistance to several antituberculosis drugs. Biomarkers are urgently needed to indicate progression from latent infection to clinical disease, to predict risk of reactivation after cure, and to provide accurate endpoints for drug and vaccine trials. Sophisticated bioinformatic computational tools and systems biology approaches are being applied to the discovery and validation of biomarkers, with substantial progress taking place. New data have been generated from the study of T-cell responses and T-cell function, serological studies, flow cytometric-based assays, and protein and gene expression studies. Alternative diagnostic strategies under investigation as potential screening and triaging tools include non-sputum-based detection with breath-based tests and automated digital radiography. We review developments and key achievements in the search for new tuberculosis diagnostics and biomarkers. We highlight gaps and challenges in evaluation and rollout of new diagnostics and biomarkers, and prioritise areas needing further investment, including impact assessment and cost–benefit studies."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Outbreak response efforts for the 2014–15 Ebola virus disease epidemic in west Africa brought widespread transmission to an end. However, subsequent clusters of infection have occurred in the region. An Ebola virus disease cluster in Liberia in November, 2015, that was identified after a 15-year-old boy tested positive for Ebola virus infection in Monrovia, raised the possibility of transmission from a persistently infected individual.
Methods
Case investigations were done to ascertain previous contact with cases of Ebola virus disease or infection with Ebola virus. Molecular investigations on blood samples explored a potential linkage between Ebola virus isolated from cases in this November, 2015, cluster and epidemiologically linked cases from the 2014–15 west African outbreak, according to the national case database.
Findings
The cluster investigated was the family of the index case (mother, father, three siblings). Ebola virus genomes assembled from two cases in the November, 2015, cluster, and an epidemiologically linked Ebola virus disease case in July, 2014, were phylogenetically related within the LB5 sublineage that circulated in Liberia starting around August, 2014. Partial genomes from two additional individuals, one from each cluster, were also consistent with placement in the LB5 sublineage. Sequencing data indicate infection with a lineage of the virus from a former transmission chain in the country. Based on serology and epidemiological and genomic data, the most plausible scenario is that a female case in the November, 2015, cluster survived Ebola virus disease in 2014, had viral persistence or recurrent disease, and transmitted the virus to three family members a year later.
Interpretation
Investigation of the source of infection for the November, 2015, cluster provides evidence of Ebola virus persistence and highlights the risk for outbreaks after interruption of active transmission. These findings underscore the need for focused prevention efforts among survivors and sustained capacity to rapidly detect and respond to new Ebola virus disease cases to prevent recurrence of a widespread outbreak.

abstract = "Summary
Background
People who inject drugs (PWID) experience a high prevalence of incarceration and might be at high risk of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection during or after incarceration. We aimed to assess whether incarceration history elevates HIV or HCV acquisition risk among PWID.
Methods
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases for studies in any language published from Jan 1, 2000 until June 13, 2017 assessing HIV or HCV incidence among PWID. We included studies that measured HIV or HCV incidence among community-recruited PWID. We included only studies reporting original results and excluded studies that evaluated incident infections by self-report. We contacted authors of cohort studies that met the inclusion or exclusion criteria, but that did not report on the outcomes of interest, to request data. We extracted and pooled data from the included studies using random-effects meta-analyses to quantify the associations between recent (past 3, 6, or 12 months or since last follow-up) or past incarceration and HIV or HCV acquisition (primary infection or reinfection) risk among PWID. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Between-study heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic and the P-value for heterogeneity.
Findings
We included published results from 20 studies and unpublished results from 21 studies. These studies originated from Australasia, western and eastern Europe, North and Latin America, and east and southeast Asia. Recent incarceration was associated with an 81% (relative risk [RR] 1·81, 95% CI 1·40–2·34) increase in HIV acquisition risk, with moderate heterogeneity between studies (I2=63·5%; p=0·001), and a 62% (RR 1·62, 95% CI 1·28–2·05) increase in HCV acquisition risk, also with moderate heterogeneity between studies (I2=57·3%; p=0·002). Past incarceration was associated with a 25% increase in HIV (RR 1·25, 95% CI 0·94–1·65) and a 21% increase in HCV (1·21, 1·02–1·43) acquisition risk.
Interpretation
Incarceration is associated with substantial short-term increases in HIV and HCV acquisition risk among PWID and could be a significant driver of HCV and HIV transmission among PWID. These findings support the need for developing novel interventions to minimise the risk of HCV and HIV acquisition, including addressing structural risks associated with drug laws and excessive incarceration of PWID.

abstract = "Summary
Over the past 10 years, the available evidence on the treatment of malaria during pregnancy has increased substantially. Owing to their relative ease of use, good sensitivity and specificity, histidine rich protein 2 based rapid diagnostic tests are appropriate for symptomatic pregnant women; however, such tests are less appropriate for systematic screening because they will not detect an important proportion of infections among asymptomatic women. The effect of pregnancy on the pharmacokinetics of antimalarial drugs varies greatly between studies and class of antimalarial drugs, emphasising the need for prospective studies in pregnant and non-pregnant women. For the treatment of malaria during the first trimester, international guidelines are being reviewed by WHO. For the second and third trimester of pregnancy, results from several trials have confirmed that artemisinin-based combination treatments are safe and efficacious, although tolerability and efficacy might vary by treatment. It is now essential to translate such evidence into policies and clinical practice that benefit pregnant women in countries where malaria is endemic. Access to parasitological diagnosis or appropriate antimalarial treatment remains low in many countries and regions. Therefore, there is a pressing need for research to identify quality improvement interventions targeting pregnant women and health providers. In addition, efficient and practical systems for pharmacovigilance are needed to further expand knowledge on the safety of antimalarial drugs, particularly in the first trimester of pregnancy."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Chloroquine remains the mainstay of treatment for Plasmodium vivax malaria despite increasing reports of treatment failure. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of chloroquine dose and the addition of primaquine on the risk of recurrent vivax malaria across different settings.
Methods
A systematic review done in MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews identified P vivax clinical trials published between Jan 1, 2000, and March 22, 2017. Principal investigators were invited to share individual patient data, which were pooled using standardised methods. Cox regression analyses with random effects for study site were used to investigate the roles of chloroquine dose and primaquine use on rate of recurrence between day 7 and day 42 (primary outcome). The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO, number CRD42016053310.
Findings
Of 134 identified chloroquine studies, 37 studies (from 17 countries) and 5240 patients were included. 2990 patients were treated with chloroquine alone, of whom 1041 (34·8%) received a dose below the target 25 mg/kg. The risk of recurrence was 32·4% (95% CI 29·8–35·1) by day 42. After controlling for confounders, a 5 mg/kg higher chloroquine dose reduced the rate of recurrence overall (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 0·82, 95% CI 0·69–0·97; p=0·021) and in children younger than 5 years (0·59, 0·41–0·86; p=0·0058). Adding primaquine reduced the risk of recurrence to 4·9% (95% CI 3·1–7·7) by day 42, which is lower than with chloroquine alone (AHR 0·10, 0·05–0·17; p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Chloroquine is commonly under-dosed in the treatment of vivax malaria. Increasing the recommended dose to 30 mg/kg in children younger than 5 years could reduce substantially the risk of early recurrence when primaquine is not given. Radical cure with primaquine was highly effective in preventing early recurrence and may also improve blood schizontocidal efficacy against chloroquine-resistant P vivax.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Between Nov 3, 2014, and Feb 24, 2017, 70 cases of high-level azithromycin-resistant (HL-AziR; minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] ≥256 mg/L) Neisseria gonorrhoeae were reported from across England. Whole-genome sequencing was done to investigate this outbreak to determine whether the ongoing outbreak represented clonal spread of an HL-AziR N gonorrhoeae strain identified in Leeds. We also wanted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of azithromycin resistance in N gonorrhoeae in the UK.
Methods
In this observational study, whole-genome sequencing was done on the HL-AziR N gonorrhoeae isolates from England. As comparators, 110 isolates from the UK and Ireland with a range of azithromycin MICs were also sequenced, including eight isolates from Scotland with azithromycin MICs ranging from 0·12 mg/L to 1·00 mg/L that were N gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence type 9768 (ST9768), which was the sequence type initially responsible for the outbreak. The presence of mutations or genes associated with azithromycin resistance was also investigated.
Findings
37 of the 60 HL-AziR isolates from England belonged to ST9768, and were genetically similar (mean 4·3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms). A 2059A→G mutation was detected in three or all four alleles of the 23S rRNA gene. Five susceptible ST9768 isolates had one mutated 23S rRNA allele and one low-level resistant ST9768 isolate had two mutated alleles.
Interpretation
Sustained transmission of a successful HL-AziR clone was seen across England. Mutation 2059A→G was found in isolates with lower azithromycin MICs. Azithromycin exposure might have provided the selection pressure for one or two mutated copies of the 23S rRNA gene to recombine with wild-type copies, leading to three or four mutated copies and the HL-AziR phenotype. HL-AziR could emerge in isolates with low azithromycin MICs and eliminate the effectiveness of azithromycin as part of dual therapy for the treatment of gonorrhoea.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Timely diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmissible infections will prevent morbidity and onward transmission. We aimed to assess the efficacy of a point-of-care molecular test for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections at the cluster level to improve infection management among Indigenous Australian communities with high prevalence of sexually transmissible infections.
Methods
In this cluster-randomised crossover study, we recruited primary health services in Western Australia, Far North Queensland, and South Australia that provide care to Indigenous people in regional or remote locations. The services were eligible if they did 150 or more tests for C trachomatis or N gonorrhoeae infection per year among individuals aged 16–29 years, and if C trachomatis or N gonorrhoeae positivity was 10% or higher. Services were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a random-number generator, stratified by geographical region, to either standard care conditions with routine laboratory-based sexually transmissible infection testing for 12 months followed by 12 months of intervention with molecular point-of-care testing, or the reverse sequence. The primary outcome was the proportion of people (aged 16–29 years) found to have C trachomatis or N gonorrhoeae who had a positive result at retesting 3 weeks to 3 months after treatment, and a secondary outcome was treatment within 7 days, both in those aged 16–29 years and at the cluster level. We did these analyses using data from all participants who had a positive result at testing, by point-of-care of laboratory testing (ie, the intention-to-treat population). The trial is registered with Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12613000808741).
Findings
Between June 1, 2013, and Feb 29, 2016, 12 health services were enrolled and randomly assigned to standard care followed by intervention (six) and the reverse sequence (six). After randomisation, one health service that was initially assigned to standard care was excluded because it no longer met the inclusion criteria. 455 individuals tested positive for C trachomatis or N gonorrhoeae infection in the intervention group, and 405 tested positive in the standard care group. In the intervention group, 12 (19%) of 63 individuals retested had a positive test result, compared with nine (13%) of 67 with positive retests in the standard care group (relative ratio [RR] 1·42, 95% CI 0·64–3·13; p=0·405), and 347 (76%) were treated within 7 days in the intervention group, compared with 191 (47%) in the standard care group (RR 1·66, 1·41–1·93; p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Retesting rates were too low to draw conclusions on the effect of the intervention on repeat infections. Further research will be needed to determine whether point-of-care tests have an effect on reinfection rates, and the sustainability of using this technology. However, our findings show that time to treatment of C trachomatis or N gonorrhoeae infections in primary care clinics in remote areas in Australia with a high prevalence of sexually transmissible infections could be substantially reduced by the use of molecular point-of-care tests.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Repeated symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) affect 25% of people who use clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC) to empty their bladder. We aimed to determine the benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of recurrent UTIs in adult users of CISC.
Methods
In this randomised, open-label, superiority trial, we enrolled participants from 51 UK National Health Service organisations. These participants were community-dwelling (as opposed to hospital inpatient) users of CISC with recurrent UTIs. We randomly allocated participants (1:1) to receive either antibiotic prophylaxis once daily (prophylaxis group) or no prophylaxis (control group) for 12 months by use of an internet-based system with permuted blocks of variable length. Trial and laboratory staff who assessed outcomes were masked to allocation but participants were aware of their treatment group. The primary outcome was the incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTIs over 12 months. Participants who completed at least 6 months of follow-up were assumed to provide a reliable estimate of UTI incidence and were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. Change in antimicrobial resistance of urinary and faecal bacteria was monitored as a secondary outcome. The AnTIC trial is registered at ISRCTN, number 67145101; and EudraCT, number 2013-002556-32.
Findings
Between Nov 25, 2013, and Jan 29, 2016, we screened 1743 adult users of CISC for eligibility, of whom 404 (23%) participants were enrolled between Nov 26, 2013, and Jan 31, 2016. Of these 404 participants, 203 (50%) were allocated to receive prophylaxis and 201 (50%) to receive no prophylaxis. 1339 participants were excluded before randomisation. The primary analysis included 181 (89%) adults allocated to the prophylaxis group and 180 (90%) adults in the no prophylaxis (control) group. 22 participants in the prophylaxis group and 21 participants in the control group were not included in the primary analysis because they were missing follow-up data before 6 months. The incidence of symptomatic antibiotic-treated UTIs over 12 months was 1·3 cases per person-year (95% CI 1·1–1·6) in the prophylaxis group and 2·6 (2·3–2·9) in the control group, giving an incidence rate ratio of 0·52 (0·44–0·61; p<0·0001), indicating a 48% reduction in UTI frequency after treatment with prophylaxis. Use of prophylaxis was well tolerated: we recorded 22 minor adverse events in the prophylaxis group related to antibiotic prophylaxis during the study, predominantly gastrointestinal disturbance (six participants), skin rash (six participants), and candidal infection (four participants). However, resistance against the antibiotics used for UTI treatment was more frequent in urinary isolates from the prophylaxis group than in those from the control group at 9–12 months of trial participation (nitrofurantoin 12 [24%] of 51 participants from the prophylaxis group vs six [9%] of 64 participants from the control group with at least one isolate; p=0·038), trimethoprim (34 [67%] of 51 vs 21 [33%] of 64; p=0·0003), and co-trimoxazole (26 [53%] of 49 vs 15 [24%] of 62; p=0·002).
Interpretation
Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing UTI frequency in CISC users with recurrent UTIs, and it is well tolerated in these individuals. However, increased resistance of urinary bacteria is a concern that requires surveillance if prophylaxis is started.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria represent the highest priority for addressing global antibiotic resistance. Cefiderocol (S-649266), a new siderophore cephalosporin, has broad activity against Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, including carbapenem-resistant strains. We assessed the efficacy and safety of cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in patients at risk of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections.
Methods
We did a phase 2, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group non-inferiority trial at 67 hospitals in 15 countries. Adults (≥18 years) admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of complicated urinary tract infection with or without pyelonephritis or those with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis were randomly assigned (2:1) by an interactive web or voice response system to receive 1 h intravenous infusions of cefiderocol (2 g) or imipenem-cilastatin (1 g each) three times daily, every 8 h for 7–14 days. Patients were excluded if they had a baseline urine culture with more than two uropathogens, a fungal urinary tract infection, or pathogens known to be carbapenem resistant. The primary endpoint was the composite of clinical and microbiological outcomes at test of cure (ie, 7 days after treatment cessation), which was used to establish non-inferiority (15% and 20% margins) of cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin. The primary efficacy analysis was done on a modified intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned individuals who received at least one dose of study drug and had a qualifying Gram-negative uropathogen (≥1 × 105 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL). Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned individuals who received at least one dose of study drug, according to the treatment they received. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02321800.
Findings
Between Feb 5, 2015, and Aug 16, 2016, 452 patients were randomly assigned to cefiderocol (n=303) or imipenem-cilastatin (n=149), of whom 448 patients (n=300 in the cefiderocol group; n=148 in the imipenem-cilastatin group) received treatment. 371 patients (n=252 patients in the cefiderocol group; n=119 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group) had qualifying Gram-negative uropathogen (≥1 × 105 CFU/mL) and were included in the primary efficacy analysis. At test of cure, the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved by 183 (73%) of 252 patients in the cefiderocol group and 65 (55%) of 119 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group, with an adjusted treatment difference of 18·58% (95% CI 8·23–28·92; p=0·0004), establishing the non-inferiority of cefiderocol. Cefiderocol was well tolerated. Adverse events occurred in 122 (41%) of 300 patients in the cefiderocol group and 76 (51%) of 148 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group, with gastrointestinal disorders (ie, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain) the most common adverse events for both treatment groups (35 [12%] patients in the cefiderocol group and 27 [18%] patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group).
Interpretation
Intravenous infusion of cefiderocol (2 g) three times daily was non-inferior compared with imipenem-cilastatin (1 g each) for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in people with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. The results of this study will provide the basis for submission of a New Drug Application to the US Food and Drug Administration. Clinical trials of hospital-acquired pneumonia and carbapenem-resistant infections are ongoing.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Immunopathology contributes to the high mortality of tuberculous meningitis, but the biological pathways involved are mostly unknown. We aimed to compare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum metabolomes of patients with tuberculous meningitis with that of controls without tuberculous meningitis, and assess the link between metabolite concentrations and mortality.
Methods
In this observational cohort study at the Hasan Sadikin Hospital (Bandung, Indonesia) we measured 425 metabolites using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in CSF and serum from 33 HIV-negative Indonesian patients with confirmed or probable tuberculous meningitis and 22 control participants with complete clinical data between March 12, 2009, and Oct 27, 2013. Associations of metabolite concentrations with survival were validated in a second cohort of 101 patients from the same centre. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism typing was used to identify tryptophan quantitative trait loci, which were used for survival analysis in a third cohort of 285 patients.
Findings
Concentrations of 250 (70%) of 351 metabolites detected in CSF were higher in patients with tuberculous meningitis than in controls, especially in those who died during follow-up. Only five (1%) of the 390 metobolites detected in serum differed between patients with tuberculous meningitis and controls. CSF tryptophan concentrations showed a pattern different from most other CSF metabolites; concentrations were lower in patients who survived compared with patients who died (9-times) and to controls (31-times). The association of low CSF tryptophan with patient survival was confirmed in the validation cohort (hazard ratio 0·73; 95% CI 0·64–0·83; p<0·0001; per each halving). 11 genetic loci predictive for CSF tryptophan concentrations in tuberculous meningitis were identified (p<0·00001). These quantitative trait loci predicted survival in a third cohort of 285 HIV-negative patients in a prognostic index including age and sex, also after correction for possible confounders (p=0·0083).
Interpretation
Cerebral tryptophan metabolism, which is known to affect Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth and CNS inflammation, is important for the outcome of tuberculous meningitis. CSF tryptophan concentrations in tuberculous meningitis are under strong genetic influence, probably contributing to the variable outcomes of tuberculous meningitis. Interventions targeting tryptophan metabolism could improve outcomes of tuberculous meningitis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
A re-emergence of scarlet fever has been noted in Hong Kong, South Korea, and England, UK, since 2008. China also had a sudden increase in the incidence of the disease in 2011. In this study, we aimed to assess the epidemiological changes before and after the upsurge. We also aimed to explore the reasons for the upsurge in disease in 2011, the epidemiological factors that contributed to it, and assess how these could be managed to prevent future epidemics.
Methods
In this observational study, we extracted the epidemiological data for all cases of scarlet fever between 2004 and 2016 in China from the Chinese Public Health Science Data Center, the official website of National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, and the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System. These data had been collected from 31 provinces and regions in China and included geographical, seasonal, and patient demographic information. We used descriptive statistical methods and joinpoint regression to examine the spatiotemporal patterns and annual percentage change in incidence of the upsurge of disease across China.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2016, 502 723 cases of scarlet fever, with ten fatalities, were reported in China, resulting in an annualised average incidence of 2·8807 per 100 000 people. The annual average incidence increased from 1·457 per 100 000 people in 2004 to 4·7638 per 100 000 people in 2011 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 3·27, 95% CI 3·22–3·32; p<0·0001), peaking in 2015 (5·0092 per 100 000 people). The annual incidence after the 2011 upsurge of scarlet fever, between 2011 and 2016, was twice the average annual incidence reported between 2004 and 2010 (4·0125 vs 1·9105 per 100 000 people; IRR 2·07, 95% CI 2·06–2·09; p<0·0001). Most cases were distributed in the north, northeast, and northwest of the country. Semi-annual patterns were observed in May–June and November–December. The median age at onset of disease was 6 years, with the annual highest incidence observed in children aged 6 years (49·4675 per 100 000 people). The incidence among boys and men was 1·54 greater than that among girls and women before the upsurge, and 1·51 times greater after the upsurge (p<0·0001 for both). The median time from disease onset to reporting of the disease was shorter after the upsurge in disease than before (3 days vs 4 days; p=0·001).
Interpretation
To our knowledge, this is the largest epidemiological study of scarlet fever worldwide. The patterns of infection across the country were similar before and after the 2011 upsurge, but the incidence of disease was substantially higher after 2011. Prevention and control strategies being implemented in response to this threat include improving disease surveillance and emergency response systems. In particular, the school absenteeism and symptom monitoring and early-warning system will contribute to the early diagnosis and report of the scarlet fever. This approach will help combat scarlet fever and other childhood infectious diseases in China.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The immunogenicity of acellular pertussis vaccines and persistence of immunity after vaccination might be improved by using genetically inactivated pertussis toxin (PTgen) instead of chemically inactivated pertussis toxin (PTchem) because of the preservation of conformational epitopes. We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of two vaccines containing PTgen 1 year after vaccination.
Methods
We did a phase 2/3 non-inferiority, randomised, controlled trial involving 450 adolescents (age 12–17 years) enrolled between July 6, 2015, and Aug 20, 2015. Participants were randomised 1:1:1 to receive one dose of vaccine containing PTgen and filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) either in a monovalent formulation (aP[PTgen/FHA]) or in a combined formulation with tetanus and reduced-dose diphtheria toxoids (TdaP[PTgen/FHA]) or to receive a commercial vaccine containing reduced-dose PTchem (Tdap) as a comparator. We report a secondary trial outcome, namely antibody persistence 1 year after vaccination, assessed per protocol in 150 randomly preselected participants (50 per group). Seroconversion was defined as antibody titres at least four times greater than at baseline. Safety was assessed in all trial participants. This study is registered in the Thai Clinical Trial Registry, number TCTR20150703002.
Findings
Between June 5, 2016, and Aug 9, 2016, 442 (98%) of 450 enrolled participants attended a 1-year follow-up visit. After 1 year, persistent seroconversion for pertussis toxin neutralising antibodies was seen in 38 (76%, 95% CI 64–88) participants in the aP(PTgen/FHA) group and 41 (81%, 70–92) in the TdaP(PTgen/FHA) group, but in only four (8%, 1–16) in the Tdap comparator group. Seroconversion rates for IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin and FHA were also greater in the aP(PTgen/FHA) group (82%, 95% CI 71–93 and 64%, 51–77, respectively) and TdaP(PTgen/FHA) group (75%, 63–87 and 56%, 42–70, respectively) than in the Tdap group (4%, 0–9, p<0·0001, and 28%, 16–41, p=0·0007, respectively). 13 serious adverse events were reported in 12 participants and all were judged to be unrelated to the study vaccines. Five pregnancies were reported during follow-up, none of which had any maternal or neonatal complications.
Interpretation
A monovalent and a combined recombinant acellular pertussis vaccine containing PTgen induced antibody responses that were greater and sustained for longer than those achieved with the Tdap comparator vaccine. New recombinant pertussis vaccines containing PTgen might offer new opportunities to limit pertussis resurgence and can be widely used, including in pregnant women.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic disease endemic to west Africa. No large-scale studies exist from Nigeria, where the Lassa virus (LASV) is most diverse. LASV diversity, coupled with host genetic and environmental factors, might cause differences in disease pathophysiology. Small-scale studies in Nigeria suggest that acute kidney injury is an important clinical feature and might be a determinant of survival. We aimed to establish the demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors associated with mortality in Nigerian patients with Lassa fever, and hypothesised that LASV was the direct cause of intrinsic renal damage for a subset of the patients with Lassa fever.
Methods
We did a retrospective, observational cohort study of consecutive patients in Nigeria with Lassa fever, who tested positive for LASV with RT-PCR, and were treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital. We did univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, including logistic regression, of all demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables available at presentation to identify the factors associated with patient mortality.
Findings
Of 291 patients treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital between Jan 3, 2011, and Dec 11, 2015, 284 (98%) had known outcomes (died or survived) and seven (2%) were discharged against medical advice. Overall case-fatality rate was 24% (68 of 284 patients), with a 1·4 times increase in mortality risk for each 10 years of age (p=0·00017), reaching 39% (22 of 57) for patients older than 50 years. Of 284 patients, 81 (28%) had acute kidney injury and 104 (37%) had CNS manifestations and thus both were considered important complications of acute Lassa fever in Nigeria. Acute kidney injury was strongly associated with poor outcome (case-fatality rate of 60% [49 of 81 patients]; odds ratio [OR] 15, p<0·00001). Compared with patients without acute kidney injury, those with acute kidney injury had higher incidence of proteinuria (32 [82%] of 39 patients) and haematuria (29 [76%] of 38) and higher mean serum potassium (4·63 [SD 1·04] mmol/L) and lower blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (8·6 for patients without clinical history of fluid loss), suggesting intrinsic renal damage. Normalisation of creatinine concentration was associated with recovery. Elevated serum creatinine (OR 1·3; p=0·046), aspartate aminotransferase (OR 1·5; p=0·075), and potassium (OR 3·6; p=0·0024) were independent predictors of death.
Interpretation
Our study presents detailed clinical and laboratory data for Nigerian patients with Lassa fever and provides strong evidence for intrinsic renal dysfunction in acute Lassa fever. Early recognition and treatment of acute kidney injury might significantly reduce mortality.

abstract = "Summary
Tuberculosis remains the world's leading cause of death from an infectious disease, responsible for an estimated 1 674 000 deaths annually. WHO estimated 600 000 cases of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis in 2016—of which 490 000 were multidrug resistant (MDR), with less than 50% survival after receiving recommended treatment regimens. Concerted efforts of stakeholders, advocates, and researchers are advancing further development of shorter course, more effective, safer, and better tolerated treatment regimens. We review the developmental pipeline and landscape of new and repurposed tuberculosis drugs, treatment regimens, and host-directed therapies (HDTs) for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis. 14 candidate drugs for drug-susceptible, drug-resistant, and latent tuberculosis are in clinical stages of drug development; nine are novel in phase 1 and 2 trials, and three new drugs are in advanced stages of development for MDR tuberculosis. Specific updates are provided on clinical trials of bedaquiline, delamanid, pretomanid, and other licensed or repurposed drugs that are undergoing investigation, including trials aimed at shortening duration of tuberculosis treatment, improving treatment outcomes and patient adherence, and reducing toxic effects. Ongoing clinical trials for shortening tuberculosis treatment duration, improving treatment outcomes in MDR tuberculosis, and preventing disease in people with latent tuberculosis infection are reviewed. A range of HDTs and immune-based treatments are under investigation as adjunctive therapy for shortening duration of therapy, preventing permanent lung injury, and improving treatment outcomes of MDR tuberculosis. We discuss the HDT development pipeline, ongoing clinical trials, and translational research efforts for adjunct tuberculosis treatment."

abstract = "Summary
Mathematical modelling is commonly used to evaluate infectious disease control policy and is influential in shaping policy and budgets. Mathematical models necessarily make assumptions about disease natural history and, if these assumptions are not valid, the results of these studies can be biased. We did a systematic review of published tuberculosis transmission models to assess the validity of assumptions about progression to active disease after initial infection (PROSPERO ID CRD42016030009). We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Biosis, and Cochrane Library, and included studies from the earliest available date (Jan 1, 1962) to Aug 31, 2017. We identified 312 studies that met inclusion criteria. Predicted tuberculosis incidence varied widely across studies for each risk factor investigated. For population groups with no individual risk factors, annual incidence varied by several orders of magnitude, and 20-year cumulative incidence ranged from close to 0% to 100%. A substantial proportion of modelled results were inconsistent with empirical evidence: for 10-year cumulative incidence, 40% of modelled results were more than double or less than half the empirical estimates. These results demonstrate substantial disagreement between modelling studies on a central feature of tuberculosis natural history. Greater attention to reproducing known features of epidemiology would strengthen future tuberculosis modelling studies, and readers of modelling studies are recommended to assess how well those studies demonstrate their validity."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Surgical intervention was once the mainstay of treatment for Buruli ulcer disease, a neglected tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. Since the introduction of streptomycin and rifampicin for 8 weeks as standard care, surgery has persisted as an adjunct therapy, but its role is uncertain. We investigated the effect of delaying the decision to operate to 14 weeks on rates of healing without surgery.
Methods
In this randomised controlled trial, we enrolled patients aged 3 years or older with confirmed disease at one hospital in Lalo, Benin. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to groups assessing the need for excision surgery 8 weeks (standard care) or 14 weeks after initiation of antimicrobial treatment. The primary endpoint was the number of patients healed without the need for surgery (not including skin grafting), assessed in all patients in follow-up at 50 weeks (or last observation for those healed for >10 weeks). A doctor masked to treatment assignment checked the indications for surgery according to predefined criteria. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01432925.
Findings
Between July 1, 2011, and Jan 15, 2015, 119 patients were enrolled, with two patients per group lost to follow-up. 55 (96%) of 57 participants in the delayed-decision group and 52 (90%) of 58 participants in the standard-care group had healed lesions 1 year after start of antimicrobial treatment (relative risk [RR] 1·08, 95% CI 0·97–1·19). 37 (67%) of 55 patients in the delayed-decision group had their lesions healed without surgical intervention, as did 25 (48%) of 52 in the standard-care group (RR 1·40, 95% CI 1·00–1·96). The time to heal and residual functional limitations did not differ between the two groups (median time to heal 21 weeks [IQR 10–27] in the delayed-decision group and 21 weeks [10–39] in the standard-care group; functional limitations in six [11%] of 57 and three [5%] of 58 patients; p=0·32). Postponing the decision to operate resulted in reduced median duration of hospitalisation (5 days [IQR 0–187] vs 131 days [0–224]; p=0·024) and wound care (153 days [IQR 56–224] vs 182 days [94–307]; p=0·036).
Interpretation
In our study, patients treated for Buruli ulcer benefited from delaying the decision to operate. Even large ulcers can heal with antibiotics alone, without delaying healing rate and without an increase in residual functional limitations.

Background
Young women in southern Africa have substantial risk of HIV acquisition. Female-controlled biomedical interventions are needed to mitigate this risk. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a pericoitally applied tenofovir 1% gel.
Methods
We did a phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial at nine community-based clinical trial sites in South Africa to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tenofovir 1% gel. Sexually active women who were HIV negative and aged 18–30 years were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using sequential participant numbers to either tenofovir 1% gel or a placebo gel (one dose within 12 h before sex and one dose within 12 h after sex [BAT-24 regimen]), using dynamic permuted block sizes of 8 and 16 within each site. Women received monthly HIV-1 testing, risk reduction support, physical examinations, and product dispensing for up to 27 months. The primary efficacy outcome was incident HIV infection and the primary safety outcome was occurrence of grade 2–4 adverse events, both analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population. To assess the efficacy of tenofovir gel, the cumulative probability of HIV infection was calculated for each treatment using the Kaplan-Meier method. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01386294.
Findings
From Oct 11, 2011, to Aug 29, 2014, 3844 women were screened, 2059 enrolled, and 2029 included in the primary analysis (1032 in the tenofovir group and 1027 in the placebo group); 39 (4%) in the tenofovir group and 36 (4%) in the placebo group were lost to follow-up. 123 HIV-1 infections occurred over 3036 woman-years of observation; 61 in the tenofovir group (HIV incidence 4·0 per 100 woman-years, 95% CI 3·1–5·2) and 62 in the placebo group (4·0 per 100 woman-years, 3·1–5·2; incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·98, 95% CI 0·7–1·4). A higher incidence of grade 2 adverse events was observed in the tenofovir group than in the placebo group (IRR 1·09, 95% CI 1·0–1·2; p=0·02). The most common grade 2 or higher product-related adverse events were hypophosphataemia (n=22 for tenofovir vs n=22 for placebo), genital symptoms (n=6 for tenofovir vs n=2 for placebo), or elevated transaminases (n=2 for tenofovir vs n=2 for placebo). No product-related serious adverse events were reported, and no differences in product-related adverse events (p=0·78), grade 3 events (p=0·64), or grade 4 events (p=0·74) were observed between treatment groups.
Interpretation
Overall, pericoital tenofovir gel did not prevent HIV-1 acquisition in this population of young women at risk of HIV infection in South Africa. Alternate safe and effective products that are less user dependent than this product or do not require high adherence are needed.

The influenza epidemic of 1918 represented the greatest failure of medical science in the 20th century. Fortunately, research throughout subsequent years has been making amends. Some studies have applied RT-PCR to the tissue samples from that time, whereas others have reconstructed the pathogen in its virulent state. But the resurrection of the 1918 influenza virus leaves questions unanswered: although more virulent than contemporary H1N1 epidemic viruses in animal models, this increased virulence of the 1918 influenza virus is not sufficient to have been the sole cause of the high mortality rates recorded in humans during the epidemic. Thus, other hypotheses have been investigated. The immune history of the different age groups exposed at the time to the pandemic virus could be a factor, and the notion of original antigenic sin provides an explanation for the unusual pattern of deaths. The presence, or absence, of a cytokine storm in the lungs of young adults might also be involved. The time and location that the 1918 influenza pandemic first emerged from its avian reservoir is contentious, with arguments for China, Europe, and the USA, at various dates. Novel vaccines were tested during 1918, which are the precursors of the universal influenza vaccines that might offer protection in a future pandemic."

Treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis is largely delivered through standardised, empirical combination regimens in low-resource, high-burden settings. However, individualised treatment, guided by detailed drug susceptibility testing, probably results in improved individual outcomes and is the standard of care in well-resourced settings. Driven by the urgent need to scale up treatment provision, new tuberculosis drugs, incorporated into standardised regimens, are being tested. Although standardised regimens are expected to improve access to treatment in high-burden settings, they are also likely to contribute to the emergence of resistance, even with good clinical management. We argue that a balance is required between the need to improve treatment access and the imperative to minimise resistance amplification and provide the highest standard of care, through a precision medicine approach. In tuberculosis, as in other diseases, we should aim to reduce the entrenched inequalities that manifest as different standards of care in different settings."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Chagas disease is a major neglected vector-borne disease. In this study, we investigated the safety and efficacy of three oral E1224 (a water-soluble ravuconazole prodrug) regimens and benznidazole versus placebo in adult chronic indeterminate Chagas disease.
Method
In this proof-of-concept, double-blind, randomised phase 2 clinical trial, we recruited adults (18–50 years) with confirmed diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection from two outpatient units in Bolivia. Patients were randomised with a computer-generated randomisation list, which was stratified by centre and used a block size of ten. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to five oral treatment groups: high-dose E1224 (duration 8 weeks, total dose 4000 mg), low-dose E1224 (8 weeks, 2000 mg), short-dose E1224 (4 weeks + 4 weeks placebo, 2400 mg), benznidazole (60 days, 5 mg/kg per day), or placebo (8 weeks, E1224-matched tablets). Double-blinding was limited to the E1224 and placebo arms, and assessors were masked to all treatment allocations. The primary efficacy endpoint was parasitological response to E1224 at the end of treatment, assessed by PCR. The secondary efficacy endpoints were parasitological response to benznidazole at end of treatment, assessed by PCR; sustainability of parasitological response until 12 months; parasite clearance and changes in parasite load; incidence of conversion to negative response in conventional and non-conventional (antigen trypomastigote chemiluminescent ELISA [AT CL-ELISA]) serological response; changes in levels of biomarkers; and complete response. The primary analysis population consisted of all randomised patients by their assigned treatment arms. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01489228.
Findings
Between July 19, 2011, and July 26, 2012, we screened 560 participants with confirmed Chagas disease, of whom 231 were enrolled and assigned to high-dose E1224 (n=45), low-dose E1224 (n=48), short-dose E1224 (n=46), benznidazole (n=45), or placebo (n=47). Parasite clearance was observed with E1224 during the treatment phase, but no sustained response was seen with low-dose and short-dose regimens, whereas 13 patients (29%, 95% CI 16·4–44·3) had sustained response with the high-dose regimen compared with four (9%, 2·4–20·4) in the placebo group (p<0·0001). Benznidazole had a rapid and sustained effect on parasite clearance, with 37 patients (82%, 67·9–92·0) with sustained response at 12-month follow-up. After 1 week of treatment, mean quantitative PCR repeated measurements showed a significant reduction in parasite load in all treatment arms versus placebo. Parasite levels in the low-dose and short-dose E1224 groups gradually returned to placebo levels. Both treatments were well tolerated. Reversible, dose-dependent liver enzyme increases were seen with E1224 and benznidazole. 187 (81%) participants developed treatment-emergent adverse events and six (3%) developed treatment-emergent serious adverse events. Treatment-emergent adverse events were headaches, nausea, pruritus, peripheral neuropathy, and hypersensitivity.
Interpretation
E1224 is the first new chemical entity developed for Chagas disease in decades. E1224 displayed a transient, suppressive effect on parasite clearance, whereas benznidazole showed early and sustained efficacy until 12 months of follow-up. Despite PCR limitations, our results support increased diagnosis and access to benznidazole standard regimen, and provide a development roadmap for novel benznidazole regimens in monotherapy and in combinations with E1224.

Rates of migration to Europe, and within Europe, have increased in recent years, with considerable implications for health systems. Migrants in Europe face a disproportionate burden of tuberculosis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C, yet experience a large number of barriers to accessing statutory health care on arrival. A better understanding of how to deliver effective and cost-effective screening, vaccination, and health services to this group is now crucial. We did a systematic review to document and assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of approaches used for infectious diseases screening, and to explore facilitators and barriers experienced by migrants to accessing screening programmes. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched Embase, PubMed, PsychINFO, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science (1989 to July 1, 2015, updated on Jan 1, 2018), with no language restrictions, and systematically approached experts across the European Union (EU) for grey literature. Inclusion criteria were primary research studies assessing screening interventions for any infectious disease in the migrant (foreign-born) population residing in EU or European Economic Area (EEA) countries. Primary outcomes were the following effectiveness indicators: uptake of screening, coverage, infections detected, and treatment outcomes. Of 4112 unique records, 47 studies met our inclusion criteria, from ten European countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK) encompassing 248 402 migrants. We found that most European countries screening migrants focus on single diseases only—predominantly active or latent tuberculosis infection—and specifically target asylum seekers and refugees, with 22 studies reporting on other infections (including HIV and hepatitis B and C). An infection was detected in 3·74% (range 0·00–95·16) of migrants. Latent tuberculosis had the highest prevalence across all infections (median 15·02% [0·35–31·81]). Uptake of screening by migrants was high (median 79·50% [18·62–100·00]), particularly in primary health-care settings (uptake 96·77% [76·00–100·00]). However, in 24·62% (0·12–78·99) of migrants screening was not completed and a final diagnosis was not made. Pooled data highlight high treatment completion in migrants (83·79%, range 0·00–100·00), yet data were highly heterogeneous for this outcome, masking important disparities between studies and infections, with only 54·45% (35·71–72·27) of migrants with latent tuberculosis ultimately completing treatment after screening. Coverage of the migrant population in Europe is low (39·29% [14·53–92·50]). Data on cost-effectiveness were scarce, but suggest moderate to high cost-effectiveness of migrant screening programmes depending on migrant group and disease targeted. European countries have adopted a variety of approaches to screening migrants for infections; however, these are limited in scope to single diseases and a narrow subset of migrants, with low coverage. More emphasis must be placed on developing innovative and sustainable strategies to facilitate screening and treatment completion and improve health outcomes, encompassing multiple key infections with consideration given to a wider group of high-risk migrants. Policy makers and researchers involved with global migration need to ensure a longer-term view on improving health outcomes in migrant populations as they integrate into health systems in host countries."

abstract = "Summary
Malaria remains one of the most preventable causes of adverse birth outcomes. Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine is used to prevent malaria, but resistance to this drug combination has decreased its efficacy and new alternatives are needed. In Africa, a meta-analysis showed three-course or monthly IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine to be safe and more effective than the original two-course sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine strategy, prompting WHO to update its policy in 2012. Although resistance to sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine reduces the parasitological efficacy of IPTp, this drug combination remains associated with reduced incidence of low birthweight in areas where prevalence of parasites with quintuple Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthetase (Pfdhps) mutations is greater than 90%. Nevertheless, its effectiveness is compromised in women infected with sextuple mutant parasites. Six trials of IPTp showed that neither amodiaquine, mefloquine, nor chloroquine–azithromycin are suitable replacements for sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine because of poor tolerability. Furthermore, four trials showed that intermittent screening and treatment with the current generation of malaria rapid diagnostic tests was not a suitable alternative strategy to IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, even in areas with high prevalence of quintuple mutations. Two trials showed that IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was well tolerated, effective, and acceptable for IPTp, with monthly regimens being the most effective. Coverage of IPTp and insecticide-treated nets continues to lag behind targets. The key barriers to uptake are well documented, and many are open to intervention. Outside of Africa, a single trial suggests a potential role for integrated approaches that combine sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine with azithromycin for IPTp in areas of Papua New Guinea where malaria transmission is high. Modelling analysis suggests the importance of the prevention of malaria early in pregnancy and the need to protect pregnant women declines more slowly than the rate at which transmission declines. Improved funding has led to an increase in the number of prevention trials in the past decade, showing the value of more sustained protection with monthly IPTp regimens. There is a need for confirmatory trials of the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, for studies of intermittent screening and treatment with more sensitive rapid diagnostic tests, for studies of integrated strategies for malaria and other co-infections, and for studies of prevention strategies for malaria in pregnant women who are HIV-positive and living outside of Africa. Additional research is required on how to improve uptake of WHO's updated policy on IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine and insecticide-treated nets."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Global roll-out of rapid molecular assays is revolutionising the diagnosis of rifampicin resistance, predictive of multidrug-resistance, in tuberculosis. However, 30% of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains in an eSwatini study harboured the Ile491Phe mutation in the rpoB gene, which is associated with poor rifampicin-based treatment outcomes but is missed by commercial molecular assays or scored as susceptible by phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing deployed in South Africa. We evaluated the presence of Ile491Phe among South African tuberculosis isolates reported as isoniazid-monoresistant according to current national testing algorithms.
Methods
We screened records of 37 644 Mycobacterium tuberculosis positive cultures from four South African provinces, diagnosed at the National Health Laboratory Service–Dr George Mukhari Tertiary Laboratory, to identify isolates with rifampicin sensitivity and isoniazid resistance according to Xpert MTB/RIF, GenoType MTBDRplus, and BACTEC MGIT 960. Of 1823 isolates that met these criteria, 277 were randomly selected and screened for Ile491Phe with multiplex allele-specific PCR and Sanger sequencing of rpoB. Ile491Phe-positive strains (as well as 17 Ile491Phe-bearing isolates from the eSwatini study) were then tested by Deeplex-MycTB deep sequencing and whole-genome sequencing to evaluate their patterns of extensive resistance, transmission, and evolution.
Findings
Ile491Phe was identified in 37 (15%) of 249 samples with valid multiplex allele-specific PCR and sequencing results, thus reclassifying them as MDR. All 37 isolates were additionally identified as genotypically resistant to all first-line drugs by Deeplex-MycTB. Six of the South African isolates harboured four distinct mutations potentially associated with decreased bedaquiline sensitivity. Consistent with Deeplex-MycTB genotypic profiles, whole-genome sequencing revealed concurrent silent spread in South Africa of a MDR tuberculosis strain lineage extending from the eSwatini outbreak and at least another independently emerged Ile491Phe-bearing lineage. Whole-genome sequencing further suggested acquisition of mechanisms compensating for the Ile491Phe fitness cost, and of additional bedaquiline resistance following the introduction of this drug in South Africa.
Interpretation
A substantial number of MDR tuberculosis cases harbouring the Ile491Phe mutation in the rpoB gene in South Africa are missed by current diagnostic strategies, resulting in ineffective first-line treatment, continued amplification of drug resistance, and concurrent silent spread in the community.

Background
Scabies outbreaks in residential and nursing care homes for elderly people are common, subject to diagnostic delay, and hard to control. We studied clinical features, epidemiology, and outcomes of outbreaks in the UK between 2014 and 2015.
Methods
We did a prospective observational study in residential care homes for elderly people in southeast England that reported scabies outbreaks to Public Health England health protection teams. An outbreak was defined as two or more cases of scabies (in either residents or staff) at a single care home. All patients who provided informed consent were included; patients with dementia were included if a personal or nominated consultee (ie, a family member or nominated staff member) endorsed participation. Dermatology-trained physicians examined residents at initial clinical visits, which were followed by two mass treatments with topical scabicide as per local health protection team guidance. Follow-up clinical visits were held 6 weeks after initial visits. Scabies was diagnosed through pre-defined case definitions as definite, probable, or possible with dermatoscopy and microscopy as appropriate.
Findings
230 residents were examined in ten outbreaks between Jan 23, 2014, and April 13, 2015. Median age was 86·9 years (IQR 81·5–92·3), 174 (76%) were female, and 157 (68%) had dementia. 61 (27%) residents were diagnosed with definite, probable, or possible scabies, of whom three had crusted scabies. Physical signs differed substantially from classic presentations. 31 (51%) of the 61 people diagnosed with scabies were asymptomatic, and only 25 (41%) had burrows. Mites were visualised with dermatoscopy in seven (11%) patients, and further confirmed by microscopy in three (5%). 35 (57%) cases had signs of scabies only on areas of the body that would normally be covered. Dementia was the only risk factor for a scabies diagnosis that we identified (odds ratio 2·37 [95% CI 1·38–4·07]). At clinical follow-up, 50 people who were initially diagnosed with scabies were examined. No new cases of scabies were detected, but infestation persisted in ten people.
Interpretation
Clinical presentation of scabies in elderly residents of care homes differs from classic descriptions familiar to clinicians. This difference probably contributes to delayed recognition and suboptimal management in this vulnerable group. Dermatoscopy and microscopy were of little value. Health-care workers should be aware of the different presentation of scabies in elderly people, and should do thorough examinations, particularly in people with dementia.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The hospital environment is a source of pathogen transmission. The effect of enhanced disinfection strategies on the hospital-wide incidence of infection has not been investigated in a multicentre, randomised controlled trial. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of four disinfection strategies on hospital-wide incidence of multidrug-resistant organisms and Clostridium difficile in the Benefits of Enhanced Terminal Room (BETR) Disinfection study.
Methods
We did a prespecified secondary analysis of the results from the BETR Disinfection study, a pragmatic, multicentre, crossover cluster-randomised trial that assessed four different strategies for terminal room disinfection in nine hospitals in the southeastern USA. Rooms from which a patient with a specific infection or colonisation (due to the target organisms C difficile, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp) was discharged were terminally disinfected with one of four strategies: standard disinfection (quaternary ammonium disinfectant, except for C difficile, for which 10% hypochlorite [bleach] was used; reference); standard disinfection and disinfecting ultraviolet light (UV-C), except for C difficile, for which bleach and UV-C was used (UV strategy); 10% hypochlorite (bleach strategy); and bleach and UV-C (bleach and UV strategy). We randomly assigned the sequence of strategies for each hospital (1:1:1:1), and each strategy was used for 7 months, including a 1-month wash-in period and 6 months of data collection. The prespecified secondary outcomes were hospital-wide, hospital-acquired incidence of all target organisms (calculated as number of patients with hospital-acquired infection with a target organism per 10 000 patient days), and hospital-wide, hospital-acquired incidence of each target organism separately. BETR Disinfection is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01579370.
Findings
Between April, 2012, and July, 2014, there were 271 740 unique patients with 375 918 admissions. 314 610 admissions met all inclusion criteria (n=73 071 in the reference study period, n=81 621 in the UV study period, n=78 760 in the bleach study period, and n=81 158 in the bleach and UV study period). 2681 incidenct cases of hospital-acquired infection or colonisation occurred during the study. There was no significant difference in the hospital-wide risk of target organism acquisition between standard disinfection and the three enhanced terminal disinfection strategies for all target multidrug-resistant organisms (UV study period relative risk [RR] 0·89, 95% CI 0·79–1·00; p=0·052; bleach study period 0·92, 0·79–1·08; p=0·32; bleach and UV study period 0·99, 0·89–1·11; p=0·89). The decrease in risk in the UV study period was driven by decreases in risk of acquisition of C difficile (RR 0·89, 95% CI 0·80–0·99; p=0·031) and VRE (0·56, 0·31–0·996; p=0·048).
Interpretation
Enhanced terminal room disinfection with UV in a targeted subset of high-risk rooms led to a decrease in hospital-wide incidence of C difficile and VRE. Enhanced disinfection overcomes limitations of standard disinfection strategies and is a potential strategy to reduce the risk of acquisition of multidrug-resistant organisms and C difficile.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The multicomponent meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB) has been licensed in more than 35 countries. However, uncertainties remain about the lowest number of doses required to induce satisfactory, persistent immune responses. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide quantitative estimates for the immunogenicity, persistence of immunogenicity, and safety of 4CMenB vaccine in children and adolescents.
Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analyses (proportion, head to head, and network), we searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception to June 30, 2017, for randomised trials that compared the immunogenicity or safety of the 4CMenB vaccine with its originator meningococcal B recombinant vaccine or routine vaccines in children or adolescents. For proportion meta-analyses, we also included single arm trials and follow-up studies of randomised controlled trials. Trials that assessed immunogenicity against at least one of four Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B reference strains (44-76/SL, 5/99, NZ98/254, and M10713) and included participants younger than 18 years who had received two or more doses of the 4CMenB vaccine were eligible for inclusion. We requested individual patient-level data from study authors and extracted data from published reports and online trial registries. We did meta-analyses to assess 4CMenB safety and immunogenicity against the four reference strains 30 days after a primary immunisation course (three doses for children, two doses for adolescents), 30 days after the primary course plus one booster dose (children only), 6 months or more after primary course, and 6 months or more after the booster dose.
Findings
736 non-duplicate records were screened, and ten randomised trials and eight follow-on extension trials on 4CMenB met the inclusion criteria. In intention-to-treat analyses, the overall proportion of children and adolescents who achieved seroconversion 30 days after the primary course of 4CMenB was 92% (95% CI 89–95 [I2=95%, p<0·0001]) for the 44/76-SL strain, 91% (87–95 [I2=95%, p<0·0001]) for the 5/99 strain, 84% (77–90 [I2=97%, p<0·0001]) for the NZ98-254 strain, and 87% (68–99 [I2=97%, p<0·0001]) for the M10713 strain. 6 months after the primary course, the immunogenicity remained adequate to high against all three tested strains (5/99, 44/76-SL, and NZ98/254) in adolescents (≥77%), and against two of four strains (5/99 and 44/76-SL) in children (≥67%): the proportion of patients who achieved seroconversion substantially declined for M10713 (<50%) and NZ98/254 (<35%). A booster dose re-enhanced the proportion of patients who achieved seroconversion (≥93% for all strains). However, immunogenicity remained high 6 months after the booster dose for strains 5/99 (95%) and M10713 (75%) only, whereas the proportion of patients who achieved seroconversion against strains 44/76-SL and NZ98/254 returned to similar proportions recorded 6 months after the primary course (62% for 44/76-SL, 35% for NZ98/254). The incidence of potentially vaccine-related, acute serious adverse events in individuals receiving 4CMenB was low (5·4 per 1000 individuals), but was significantly higher than routine vaccines (1·2 per 1000 individuals).
Interpretation
4CMenB has an acceptable short-term safety profile. The primary course is sufficient to achieve a satisfactory immune response within 30 days of vaccination. A booster dose is required for children to prolong the protection against strain M10713, and the long-term immunogenicity against strain NZ98/254 remains suboptimal.

Zika virus is an emerging pathogen of substantial public health concern to human beings.

To date, there is no vaccine, antiviral drug, or other modality available to prevent or treat Zika virus infection. In this Review, we examine vaccine development efforts for Zika virus to date and research gaps in the development of candidate vaccines against Zika virus. Top research priorities should include development of a better understanding of immunity to Zika virus to establish clear correlates of protection; determination of what effect, if any, Zika vaccine-induced immune responses will have on subsequent dengue virus infection; evaluation of vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy in healthy adults and in the various subpopulations affected by Zika virus infection (children, pregnant women, women of childbearing age, and eldery people); and identification of the molecular mechanisms that underlie birth defects and neurological sequelae related to Zika virus."

The global effort to control and eliminate soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) currently depends on donations of albendazole and mebendazole, which reached more than 530 million children in 2016. As we approach 2020, the WHO goal of eliminating STH as a public health problem will not be met in most endemic countries, and ongoing treatment will be necessary. Additionally, the volume of drugs required might increase because global strategies for STH aim to interrupt transmission. Under the 2012 London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases, pharmaceutical company commitments to donate drugs to control or eliminate neglected tropical diseases extend to 2020. We are approaching a period of uncertainty regarding different strategies for control and elimination of STH, the size and target populations for future donations, and optimum drugs and drug combinations. Long-term reliance on large-scale donation of deworming drugs is not sustainable. The global STH community need to develop a strategy to secure a sustainable global supply of affordable and effective anthelmintic drugs.

Background
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have substantially reduced the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes; however, replacement disease with non-PCV serotypes remains a concern. We describe the population effect of the seven-valent and 13-valent PCVs (PCV7 and PCV13) on invasive pneumococcal disease in England and Wales.
Methods
Using national invasive pneumococcal disease surveillance data for 2016/17, we compared incidence rate ratios (IRRs) against pre-PCV13 (2008/09–2009/10) and pre-PCV7 (2000/01–2005/06) baselines. We also estimated the number of invasive pneumococcal disease cases prevented since the introduction of PCVs.
Findings
In 2016/17, overall invasive pneumococcal disease incidence (9·87 cases per 100 000; 5450 cases) across all age groups was 37% lower (IRR 0·63, 95% CI 0·60–0·65) than pre-PCV7 incidence (14·79 per 100 000; 8167 cases) and 7% lower (0·93; 0·89–0·97) than pre-PCV13 incidence (10·13 per 100 000; 5595 cases). By 2016/17, PCV7-type invasive pneumococcal disease incidence across all age groups had decreased by 97% (0·24 per 100 000; 0·03, 0·02–0·04) compared with the pre-PCV7 period, whereas additional PCV13-type invasive pneumococcal disease decreased by 64% (1·66 per 100 000; 0·36, 0·32–0·40) since the introduction of PCV13. Invasive pneumococcal disease incidence due to non-PCV13 serotypes doubled (7·97 per 100 000; 1·97, 1·86–2·09) since the introduction of PCV7, and accelerated since 2013/14—especially serotypes 8, 12F, and 9N, which were responsible for more than 40% of invasive pneumococcal disease cases by 2016/17. Invasive pneumococcal disease incidence in children younger than 5 years remained stable since 2013/14, with nearly all replacement disease occurring in adults. We estimated 38 366 invasive pneumococcal disease cases were prevented in the 11 years since the introduction of PCV7.
Interpretation
Both PCV7 and PCV13 have had a major effect in reducing the burden of invasive pneumococcal disease in England and Wales; however, rapid increases in some non-PCV13 serotypes are compromising the benefits of the programme.

Background
Enteroviruses are the most frequent cause of acute meningitis and are seen increasingly in sepsis-like disease and fever without source in the paediatric population. Detection of enterovirus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens by PCR is the gold standard diagnostic test. Our aim was to assess a method of detecting enterovirus in blood specimens by PCR.

Between June 1, 2015, and Oct 31, 2015, and between June 1, 2016, and Oct 31, 2016, we enrolled 822 patients, of whom 672 had enterovirus PCR testing done in blood and CSF specimens. Enterovirus was detected in 317 (47%) patients in either blood or CSF, or both (71 newborn babies, 83 infants, and 163 children). Detection of enterovirus was more frequent in blood samples than in CSF specimens of newborn babies (70 [99%] of 71 vs 62 [87%] of 71; p=0·011) and infants (76 [92%] of 83 vs 62 [75%] of 83; p=0·008), and was less frequent in blood samples than in CSF specimens of children (90 [55%] of 163 vs 148 [91%] of 163; p<0·0001). Detection of enterovirus was more frequent in blood samples than in CSF specimens of infants aged 2 years or younger with fever without source (55 [100%] of 55 vs 41 [75%] of 55; p=0·0002) or with sepsis-like disease (16 [100%] of 16 vs nine [56%] of 16; p=0·008). Detection of enterovirus was less frequent in blood than in CSF of patients with suspected meningitis (165 [67%] of 246 vs 222 [90%] of 246; p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Testing for enterovirus in blood by PCR should be an integral part of clinical practice guidelines for infants aged 2 years or younger. This testing could decrease the length of hospital stay and reduce exposure to antibiotics for low-risk patients admitted to the emergency department with febrile illness.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Traditional methods for molecular epidemiology of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are suboptimal. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) offers ideal resolution to describe population dynamics and to predict and infer transmission of antimicrobial resistance, and can enhance infection control through linkage with epidemiological data. We used WGS, in conjunction with linked epidemiological and phenotypic data, to describe the gonococcal population in 20 European countries. We aimed to detail changes in phenotypic antimicrobial resistance levels (and the reasons for these changes) and strain distribution (with a focus on antimicrobial resistance strains in risk groups), and to predict antimicrobial resistance from WGS data.
Methods
We carried out an observational study, in which we sequenced isolates taken from patients with gonorrhoea from the European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme in 20 countries from September to November, 2013. We also developed a web platform that we used for automated antimicrobial resistance prediction, molecular typing (N gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing [NG-MAST] and multilocus sequence typing), and phylogenetic clustering in conjunction with epidemiological and phenotypic data.
Findings
The multidrug-resistant NG-MAST genogroup G1407 was predominant and accounted for the most cephalosporin resistance, but the prevalence of this genogroup decreased from 248 (23%) of 1066 isolates in a previous study from 2009–10 to 174 (17%) of 1054 isolates in this survey in 2013. This genogroup previously showed an association with men who have sex with men, but changed to an association with heterosexual people (odds ratio=4·29). WGS provided substantially improved resolution and accuracy over NG-MAST and multilocus sequence typing, predicted antimicrobial resistance relatively well, and identified discrepant isolates, mixed infections or contaminants, and multidrug-resistant clades linked to risk groups.
Interpretation
To our knowledge, we provide the first use of joint analysis of WGS and epidemiological data in an international programme for regional surveillance of sexually transmitted infections. WGS provided enhanced understanding of the distribution of antimicrobial resistance clones, including replacement with clones that were more susceptible to antimicrobials, in several risk groups nationally and regionally. We provide a framework for genomic surveillance of gonococci through standardised sampling, use of WGS, and a shared information architecture for interpretation and dissemination by use of open access software.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pakistan is currently facing the largest outbreak of ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi described to date. Here we aimed to report the outbreak investigation done in Hyderabad, Pakistan, and identify disease risk factors.
Methods
We did an age-matched case-control (1:4) study, in which cases of ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi were identified from active sentinal sites (three hospitals in Hyderabad, Pakistan), community, and laboratory-based surveillance. Ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi infection (ie, resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, fluoroquinole, and ceftriaxone) was confirmed using blood culture. Healthy participants (controls) were enrolled for the first 200 people (cases) with ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi. A structured questionnaire was administered to identify exposures 4 weeks before the illness (cases) or enrolment (controls). Cases were included if written informed consent was provided. Four controls were selected from the same community as the corresponding case, matched on age, being healthy at the time of enrolment, and with no febrile illness in the 4 weeks before enrolment. Samples of drinking water from households and community water sources (ie, hand pumps or taps in common areas outside households) were collected for testing. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to assess the risk factors for ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi outbreak in Hyderabad.
Findings
Between Nov 30, 2016, and Dec 30, 2017, 486 people with ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi were identified from Hyderabad. Of the 486 cases, 296 (61%) were male and 447 (92%) were aged 15 years or younger. Several factors were significantly associated with acquisition of ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi, including male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·53, 95% CI 1·06–2·21), eating outside of the house (aOR 1·48, 1·01–2·19), exposure to a patient with S Typhi infection (aOR 3·81, 2·21–6·83), and a history of antimicrobial use (aOR 4·25, 2·53–7·13). Nine (69%) of 13 water samples taken from the households of people with ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi infection were positive for Escherichia coli, indicating faecal contamination. S Typhi DNA was detected in 12 (22%) of 55 water samples from community water sources. Geospatial mapping showed clustering of cases around sewerage lines.
Interpretation
Hyderabad faces the largest reported outbreak of ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi. The outbreak is suspected to be attributed to the contaminated drinking water, especially the mixing of sewage with drinking water. The risk of ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi infection is increased among children aged 15 years and younger, male individuals, and those eating outside the house. Vaccination and chlorination of water are recommended for the containment of the outbreak.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) affect about 25% of children with cancer, and treatment failure is common. Adjunctive ethanol lock therapy might prevent treatment failure but high-quality evidence is scarce. We evaluated ethanol lock therapy as treatment and secondary prophylaxis for CLABSI in children with cancer or haematological disorders.
Methods
This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial, with two interim futility and efficacy analyses (done when the first 46 and 92 evaluable participants completed study requirements), was done at two paediatric hospitals in the USA and Australia. Patients aged 6 months to 24 years, inclusive, with cancer or a haematological disorder and new CLABSI were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either ethanol lock therapy (70% ethanol) or placebo (heparinised saline) for 2–4 h per lumen daily for 5 days (treatment phase), then for up to 3 non-consecutive days per week for 24 weeks (prophylaxis phase). The primary composite outcome was treatment failure, consisting of attributable catheter removal or death, new or persistent (>72 h) infection, or additional lock therapy during the treatment phase, and recurrent CLABSI during the prophylaxis phase. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01472965.
Findings
94 evaluable participants were enrolled between Dec 14, 2011, and Sept 12, 2016, of whom 48 received ethanol lock therapy and 46 received placebo. The study met futility criteria at the second interim analysis. Treatment failure was similar with ethanol lock therapy (21 [44%] of 48) and placebo (20 [43%] of 46; relative risk [RR] 1·0, 95% CI 0·6–1·6; p=0·98). Some adverse events, including infusion reactions and catheter occlusion, were more frequent in the ethanol lock therapy group than in the placebo group. Catheter occlusion requiring thrombolytic therapy was more common with ethanol lock therapy (28 [58%] of 48) than with placebo (15 [33%] of 46; RR 1·8, 95% CI 1·1–2·9; p=0·012). Discontinuation of lock therapy because of adverse effects or patient request occurred in a similar proportion of participants in the ethanol lock therapy (nine [19%] of 48) and placebo groups (ten [22%] of 46; p=0·72).
Interpretation
Ethanol lock therapy did not prevent CLABSI treatment failure and it increased catheter occlusion. Routine ethanol lock therapy for treatment or secondary prophylaxis is not recommended in this population.

Background
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 provides an up-to-date analysis of the burden of diarrhoea in 195 countries. This study assesses cases, deaths, and aetiologies in 1990–2016 and assesses how the burden of diarrhoea has changed in people of all ages.
Methods
We modelled diarrhoea mortality with a Bayesian hierarchical modelling platform that evaluates a wide range of covariates and model types on the basis of vital registration and verbal autopsy data. We modelled diarrhoea incidence with a compartmental meta-regression tool that enforces an association between incidence and prevalence, and relies on scientific literature, population representative surveys, and health-care data. Diarrhoea deaths and episodes were attributed to 13 pathogens by use of a counterfactual population attributable fraction approach. Diarrhoea risk factors are also based on counterfactual estimates of risk exposure and the association between the risk and diarrhoea. Each modelled estimate accounted for uncertainty.
Findings
In 2016, diarrhoea was the eighth leading cause of death among all ages (1 655 944 deaths, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1 244 073–2 366 552) and the fifth leading cause of death among children younger than 5 years (446 000 deaths, 390 894–504 613). Rotavirus was the leading aetiology for diarrhoea mortality among children younger than 5 years (128 515 deaths, 105 138–155 133) and among all ages (228 047 deaths, 183 526–292 737). Childhood wasting (low weight-for-height score), unsafe water, and unsafe sanitation were the leading risk factors for diarrhoea, responsible for 80·4% (95% UI 68·2–85·0), 72·1% (34·0–91·4), and 56·4% (49·3–62·7) of diarrhoea deaths in children younger than 5 years, respectively. Prevention of wasting in 1762 children (95% UI 1521–2170) could avert one death from diarrhoea.
Interpretation
Substantial progress has been made globally in reducing the burden of diarrhoeal diseases, driven by decreases in several primary risk factors. However, this reduction has not been equal across locations, and burden among adults older than 70 years requires attention.

Background
Lower respiratory infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2016, provides an up-to-date analysis of the burden of lower respiratory infections in 195 countries. This study assesses cases, deaths, and aetiologies spanning the past 26 years and shows how the burden of lower respiratory infection has changed in people of all ages.
Methods
We used three separate modelling strategies for lower respiratory infections in GBD 2016: a Bayesian hierarchical ensemble modelling platform (Cause of Death Ensemble model), which uses vital registration, verbal autopsy data, and surveillance system data to predict mortality due to lower respiratory infections; a compartmental meta-regression tool (DisMod-MR), which uses scientific literature, population representative surveys, and health-care data to predict incidence, prevalence, and mortality; and modelling of counterfactual estimates of the population attributable fraction of lower respiratory infection episodes due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. We calculated each modelled estimate for each age, sex, year, and location. We modelled the exposure level in a population for a given risk factor using DisMod-MR and a spatio-temporal Gaussian process regression, and assessed the effectiveness of targeted interventions for each risk factor in children younger than 5 years. We also did a decomposition analysis of the change in LRI deaths from 2000–16 using the risk factors associated with LRI in GBD 2016.
Findings
In 2016, lower respiratory infections caused 652 572 deaths (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 586 475–720 612) in children younger than 5 years (under-5s), 1 080 958 deaths (943 749–1 170 638) in adults older than 70 years, and 2 377 697 deaths (2 145 584–2 512 809) in people of all ages, worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading cause of lower respiratory infection morbidity and mortality globally, contributing to more deaths than all other aetiologies combined in 2016 (1 189 937 deaths, 95% UI 690 445–1 770 660). Childhood wasting remains the leading risk factor for lower respiratory infection mortality among children younger than 5 years, responsible for 61·4% of lower respiratory infection deaths in 2016 (95% UI 45·7–69·6). Interventions to improve wasting, household air pollution, ambient particulate matter pollution, and expanded antibiotic use could avert one under-5 death due to lower respiratory infection for every 4000 children treated in the countries with the highest lower respiratory infection burden.
Interpretation
Our findings show substantial progress in the reduction of lower respiratory infection burden, but this progress has not been equal across locations, has been driven by decreases in several primary risk factors, and might require more effort among elderly adults. By highlighting regions and populations with the highest burden, and the risk factors that could have the greatest effect, funders, policy makers, and programme implementers can more effectively reduce lower respiratory infections among the world's most susceptible populations.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The development of a vaccine for norovirus requires a detailed understanding of global genetic diversity of noroviruses. We analysed their epidemiology and diversity using surveillance data from the NoroNet network.
Methods
We included genetic sequences of norovirus specimens obtained from outbreak investigations and sporadic gastroenteritis cases between 2005 and 2016 in Europe, Asia, Oceania, and Africa. We genotyped norovirus sequences and analysed sequences that overlapped at open reading frame (ORF) 1 and ORF2. Additionally, we assessed the sampling date and country of origin of the first reported sequence to assess when and where novel drift variants originated.
Findings
We analysed 16 635 norovirus sequences submitted between Jan 1, 2005, to Nov 17, 2016, of which 1372 (8·2%) sequences belonged to genotype GI, 15 256 (91·7%) to GII, and seven (<0·1%) to GIV.1. During this period, 26 different norovirus capsid genotypes circulated and 22 different recombinant genomes were found. GII.4 drift variants emerged with 2–3-year periodicity up to 2012, but not afterwards. Instead, the GII.4 Sydney capsid seems to persist through recombination, with a novel recombinant of GII.P16–GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant detected in 2014 in Germany (n=1) and the Netherlands (n=1), and again in 2016 in Japan (n=2), China (n=8), and the Netherlands (n=3). The novel GII.P17–GII.17, first reported in Asia in 2014, has circulated widely in Europe in 2015–16 (GII.P17 made up a highly variable proportion of all sequences in each country [median 11·3%, range 4·2–53·9], as did GII.17 [median 6·3%, range 0–44·5]). GII.4 viruses were more common in outbreaks in health-care settings (2239 [37·2%] of 6022 entries) compared with other genotypes (101 [12·5%] of 809 entries for GI and 263 [13·5%] of 1941 entries for GII non-GII.Pe–GII.4 or GII.P4–GII.4).
Interpretation
Continuous changes in the global norovirus genetic diversity highlight the need for sustained global norovirus surveillance, including assessment of possible immune escape and evolution by recombination, to provide a full overview of norovirus epidemiology for future vaccine policy decisions.

Background
Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance threatens efficacy of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy, and alternative regimens need to be identified. With the return of chloroquine efficacy in southern Africa, we postulated that chloroquine either as an intermittent therapy or as weekly chemoprophylaxis would be more efficacious than intermittent sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for prevention of malaria in pregnancy and associated maternal and newborn adverse outcomes.
Methods
We did an open-label, single-centre, randomised controlled trial at Ndirande Health Centre, Blantyre, in southern Malawi. We enrolled pregnant women (first or second pregnancy) at 20–28 weeks' gestation who were HIV negative. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio using a computer-generated list to either intermittent sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (two doses of 1500 mg sulfadoxine and 75 mg pyrimethamine, 4 weeks apart), intermittent chloroquine (two doses of 600 mg on day 1, 600 mg on day 2, and 300 mg on day 3), or chloroquine prophylaxis (600 mg on day 1 then 300 mg every week). The primary endpoint was placental malaria in the modified intent-to-treat population, which consisted of participants who contributed placental histopathology data at birth. Secondary outcomes included clinical malaria, maternal anaemia, low birthweight, and safety. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01443130.
Findings
Between February, 2012, and May, 2014, we enrolled and randomly allocated 900 women, of whom 765 contributed histopathological data and were included in the primary analysis. 108 (14%) women had placental malaria, which was lower than the anticipated prevalence of placental malaria infection. Protection from placental malaria was not improved by chloroquine as either prophylaxis (30 [12%] of 259 had positive histopathology; relative risk [RR] 0·75, 95% CI 0·48–1·17) or intermittent therapy (39 [15%] of 253; RR 1·00, 0·67–1·50) compared with intermittent sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (39 [15%] of 253). In protocol-specified analyses adjusted for maternal age, gestational age at enrolment, bednet use the night before enrolment, anaemia at enrolment, and malaria infection at enrolment, women taking chloroquine as prophylaxis had 34% lower placental infections than did those allocated intermittent sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (RR 0·66, 95% CI 0·46–0·95). Clinical malaria was reported in nine women assigned intermittent sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, four allocated intermittent chloroquine (p=0·26), and two allocated chloroquine prophylaxis (p=0·063). Maternal anaemia was noted in five women assigned intermittent sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, 15 allocated intermittent chloroquine (p=0·038), and six assigned chloroquine prophylaxis (p>0·99). Low birthweight was recorded for 31 babies born to women allocated intermittent sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, 29 assigned intermittent chloroquine (p=0·78), and 41 allocated chloroquine prophylaxis (p=0·28). Four women assigned intermittent sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine had adverse events possibly related to study product compared with 94 women allocated intermittent chloroquine (p<0·0001) and 26 allocated chloroquine prophylaxis (p<0·0001). Three women had severe or life-threatening adverse events related to study product, of whom all were assigned intermittent chloroquine (p=0·25).
Interpretation
Chloroquine administered as intermittent therapy did not provide better protection from malaria and related adverse effects compared with intermittent sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in a setting of high resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Chloroquine chemoprophylaxis might provide benefit in protecting against malaria during pregnancy, but studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these results.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease with an increasing case number and extensive geographical expansion, raising concerns locally and globally; however, the description of its clinical features needs to be addressed by large studies. We aimed to determine all the clinical features of SFTS in a large population of patients in an endemic area.
Methods
In this prospective observational study, data were collected on patients admitted to the People's Liberation Army Hospital in Xinyang, Henan Province, China, with laboratory-diagnosed SFTS. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected for each patient, and patients were followed up within 2 weeks after discharge or discontinuation of treatment. The association between each demographic, clinical, and laboratory variable with a fatal outcome was assessed. A clinical scoring model was designed for the early prediction of a fatal outcome, and the effect of treatment on outcome was analysed.
Findings
Between April 1, 2011, and Oct 31, 2017, 2096 patients with laboratory-confirmed SFTS were admitted. Mean age at admission was 61·4 years (SD 12·2) and 1239 (59%) patients were female. The case fatality rate (CFR) was 16·2% (95% CI 14·6–17·8). A higher risk was associated with being male (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·45, 95% CI 1·15–1·83; p=0·002), older age (for a 10-year increase, unadjusted OR 1·82, 95% CI 1·62–2·04; p<0·0001), longer delay in admission (for every extra day taken before admission to hospital, unadjusted OR 1·18, 1·12–1·24; p<0·0001), presence of diarrhoea (adjusted OR 1·44, 1·12–1·87; p=0·005) or dyspnoea (adjusted OR 8·35, 5·97–11·69; p<0·0001), and development of haemorrhagic signs (adjusted OR 2·79, 95% CI 2·18–3·57; p<0·0001) or neurological symptoms (adjusted OR 30·26, 21·39–42·81; p<0·0001). Laboratory variables that were associated with death included abnormal concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and blood urea nitrogen, and abnormal neutrophil percentage, which together with age and neurological symptoms were combined in the clinical scoring system. A total score of more than 8 was the optimal threshold to predict risk of death for patients who were evaluated within 6 days after symptom onset (area under the curve 0·879, 95% CI 0·855–0·902). For all participants, viraemia was a strong predictor of fatal outcome (all p<0·0001). Ribavirin therapy was effective in reducing CFR from 6·25% (15 of 240 participants) to 1·16% (two of 173 participants), but only in patients with a viral load below 1×106 copies per mL (hazard ratio 9·72, 95% CI 1·30–72·87; p=0·027).
Interpretation
The changing epidemiological features and high CFR of SFTS underscore the necessity of continued surveillance. Early prediction of fatal outcome can be attained by monitoring of clinical and laboratory data. Ribavirin should be applied early, with best results achieved before the viral load reaches 1 × 106 copies per mL.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Colistin–carbapenem combinations are synergistic in vitro against carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. We aimed to test whether combination therapy improves clinical outcomes for adults with infections caused by carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria.
Methods
A randomised controlled superiority trial was done in six hospitals in Israel, Greece, and Italy. We included adults with bacteraemia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, or urosepsis caused by carbapenem-non-susceptible Gram-negative bacteria. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally, by computer-generated permuted blocks stratified by centre, to intravenous colistin (9-million unit loading dose, followed by 4·5 million units twice per day) or colistin with meropenem (2-g prolonged infusion three times per day). The trial was open-label, with blinded outcome assessment. Treatment success was defined as survival, haemodynamic stability, improved or stable Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, stable or improved ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of expired oxygen for patients with pneumonia, and microbiological cure for patients with bacteraemia. The primary outcome was clinical failure, defined as not meeting all success criteria by intention-to-treat analysis, at 14 days after randomisation. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01732250, and is closed to accrual.
Findings
Between Oct 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2016, we randomly assigned 406 patients to the two treatment groups. Most patients had pneumonia or bacteraemia (355/406, 87%), and most infections were caused by Acinetobacter baumannii (312/406, 77%). No significant difference between colistin monotherapy (156/198, 79%) and combination therapy (152/208, 73%) was observed for clinical failure at 14 days after randomisation (risk difference −5·7%, 95% CI −13·9 to 2·4; risk ratio [RR] 0·93, 95% CI 0·83–1·03). Results were similar among patients with A baumannii infections (RR 0·97, 95% CI 0·87–1·09). Combination therapy increased the incidence of diarrhoea (56 [27%] vs 32 [16%] patients) and decreased the incidence of mild renal failure (37 [30%] of 124 vs 25 [20%] of 125 patients at risk of or with kidney injury).
Interpretation
Combination therapy was not superior to monotherapy. The addition of meropenem to colistin did not improve clinical failure in severe A baumannii infections. The trial was unpowered to specifically address other bacteria.

abstract = "Summary
The Maputo Declaration of 2008 advocated for commitment from global stakeholders and national governments to prioritise support and harmonisation of laboratory systems through development of comprehensive national laboratory strategies and policies in sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, HIV laboratory medicine in Africa has undergone a transformation, and substantial improvements have been made in diagnostic services, networks, and institutions, including the development of a competent workforce, introduction of point-of-care diagnostics, and innovative quality improvement programmes that saw more than 1100 laboratories enrolled and 44 accredited to international standards. These improved HIV laboratories can now be used to combat emerging continental and global health threats in the decades to come. For instance, the unprecedented Ebola virus disease outbreak in west Africa exposed the severe weaknesses in the overall national health systems in affected countries. It is now possible to build robust health-care systems in Africa and to combat emerging continental and global health threats in the future. In this Personal View, we aim to describe the remarkable transformation that has occurred in laboratory medicine to combat HIV/AIDS and improve global health in sub-Saharan Africa since 2008."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Scale-up of insecticide-based interventions has averted more than 500 million malaria cases since 2000. Increasing insecticide resistance could herald a rebound in disease and mortality. We aimed to investigate whether insecticide resistance was associated with loss of effectiveness of long-lasting insecticidal nets and increased malaria disease burden.
Methods
This WHO-coordinated, prospective, observational cohort study was done at 279 clusters (villages or groups of villages in which phenotypic resistance was measurable) in Benin, Cameroon, India, Kenya, and Sudan. Pyrethroid long-lasting insecticidal nets were the principal form of malaria vector control in all study areas; in Sudan this approach was supplemented by indoor residual spraying. Cohorts of children from randomly selected households in each cluster were recruited and followed up by community health workers to measure incidence of clinical malaria and prevalence of infection. Mosquitoes were assessed for susceptibility to pyrethroids using the standard WHO bioassay test. Country-specific results were combined using meta-analysis.
Findings
Between June 2, 2012, and Nov 4, 2016, 40 000 children were enrolled and assessed for clinical incidence during 1·4 million follow-up visits. 80 000 mosquitoes were assessed for insecticide resistance. Long-lasting insecticidal net users had lower infection prevalence (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0·63, 95% CI 0·51–0·78) and disease incidence (adjusted rate ratio [RR] 0·62, 0·41–0·94) than did non-users across a range of resistance levels. We found no evidence of an association between insecticide resistance and infection prevalence (adjusted OR 0·86, 0·70–1·06) or incidence (adjusted RR 0·89, 0·72–1·10). Users of nets, although significantly better protected than non-users, were nevertheless subject to high malaria infection risk (ranging from an average incidence in net users of 0·023, [95% CI 0·016–0·033] per person-year in India, to 0·80 [0·65–0·97] per person year in Kenya; and an average infection prevalence in net users of 0·8% [0·5–1·3] in India to an average infection prevalence of 50·8% [43·4–58·2] in Benin).
Interpretation
Irrespective of resistance, populations in malaria endemic areas should continue to use long-lasting insecticidal nets to reduce their risk of infection. As nets provide only partial protection, the development of additional vector control tools should be prioritised to reduce the unacceptably high malaria burden.

abstract = "Summary
Background
A substantial proportion of Plasmodium species infections are asymptomatic with densities too low to be detectable with standard diagnostic techniques. The importance of such asymptomatic plasmodium infections in malaria transmission is probably related to their duration and density. To explore the duration of asymptomatic plasmodium infections and changes in parasite densities over time, a cohort of participants who were infected with Plasmodium parasites was observed over a 2-year follow-up period.
Methods
In this open cohort study, inhabitants of four villages in Vietnam were invited to participate in baseline and subsequent 3-monthly surveys up to 24 months, which included the collection of venous blood samples. Samples were batch-screened using ultra-sensitive (u)PCR (lower limit of detection of 22 parasites per mL). Participants found to be infected by uPCR during any of these surveys were invited to join a prospective cohort and provide monthly blood samples. We estimated the persistence of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections and changes in parasite densities over a study period of 24 months.
Findings
Between Dec 1, 2013, and Jan 8, 2016, 356 villagers participated in between one and 22 surveys. These study participants underwent 4248 uPCR evaluations (11·9 tests per participant). 1874 (32%) of 4248 uPCR tests indicated a plasmodium infection; 679 (36%) of 1874 tests were P falciparum monoinfections, 507 (27%) were P vivax monoinfections, 463 (25%) were co-infections with P falciparum and P vivax, and 225 (12%) were indeterminate species of Plasmodium. The median duration of P falciparum infection was 2 months (IQR 1–3); after accounting for censoring, participants had a 20% chance of having parasitaemia for 4 months or longer. The median duration of P vivax infection was 6 months (3–9), and participants had a 59% chance of having parasitaemia for 4 months or longer. The parasite densities of persistent infections oscillated; following ultralow-density infections, high-density infections developed frequently.
Interpretation
Persistent largely asymptomatic P vivax and P falciparum infections are common in this area of low seasonal malaria transmission. Infections with low-density parasitaemias can develop into much higher density infections at a later time, which are likely to sustain malaria endemicity.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal zoonosis that causes death in 35·7% of cases. As of Feb 28, 2018, 2182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide, with most being reported in Saudi Arabia (1807 cases with 705 deaths). MERS-CoV features prominently in the WHO blueprint list of priority pathogens that threaten global health security. Although primary transmission of MERS-CoV to human beings is linked to exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), the exact mode by which MERS-CoV infection is acquired remains undefined. Up to 50% of MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia have been classified as secondary, occurring from human-to-human transmission through contact with asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals infected with MERS-CoV. Hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV are a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection. The clinical features associated with MERS-CoV infection are not MERS-specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections. Thus, the diagnosis of MERS can easily be missed, unless the doctor or health-care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for MERS-CoV. The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea in May, 2015, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths. This outbreak was caused by a traveller with undiagnosed MERS-CoV infection who became ill after returning to Seoul from a trip to the Middle East. The traveller visited several health facilities in South Korea, transmitting the virus to many other individuals long before a diagnosis was made. With 10 million pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia each year from 182 countries, watchful surveillance by public health systems, and a high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV infection is essential. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive update and synthesis of the latest available data on the epidemiology, determinants, and risk factors of primary, household, and nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV, and suggest measures to reduce risk of transmission."

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis is a debilitating, long-term condition that can severely affect the quality of life of affected women. No estimates of the global prevalence or lifetime incidence of this disease have been reported. For this systematic review, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for population-based studies published between 1985 and 2016 that reported on the prevalence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, defined as four or more episodes of the infection every year. We identified 489 unique articles, of which eight were included, consisting of 17 365 patients from 11 countries. We generated estimates of annual global prevalence, estimated lifetime incidence and economic loss due to recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, and predicted the number of women at risk to 2030. Worldwide, recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis affects about 138 million women annually (range 103–172 million), with a global annual prevalence of 3871 per 100 000 women; 372 million women are affected by recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis over their lifetime. The 25–34 year age group has the highest prevalence (9%). By 2030, the population of women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis each year is estimated to increase to almost 158 million, resulting in 20 240 664 extra cases with current trends using base case estimates in parallel with an estimated growth in females from 3·34 billion to 4·181 billion. In high-income countries, the economic burden from lost productivity could be up to US$14·39 billion annually. The high prevalence, substantial morbidity, and economic losses of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis require better solutions and improved quality of care for affected women."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Disruptions of vaginal microbiota might increase women's susceptibility to HIV infection. Advances in molecular microbiology have enabled detailed examination of associations between vaginal bacteria and HIV acquisition. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the association between the concentrations of specific vaginal bacteria and increased risk of HIV acquisition in African women.
Methods
We did a nested case-control study of participants from eastern and southern Africa. Data from five cohorts of African women (female sex workers, pregnant and post-partum women, and women in serodiscordant relationships) were used to form a nested case-control analysis between women who acquired HIV infection versus those who remained seronegative. Deep sequence analysis of broad-range 16S rRNA gene PCR products was applied to a subset of 55 cases and 55 controls. From these data, 20 taxa were selected for bacterium-specific real-time PCR assays, which were examined in the full cohort as a four-category exposure (undetectable, first tertile, second tertile, and third tertile of concentrations). Conditional logistic regression was used to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Regression models were stratified by cohort, and adjusted ORs (aORs) were generated from a multivariable model controlling for confounding variables. The Shannon Diversity Index was used to measure bacterial diversity. The primary analyses were the associations between bacterial concentrations and risk of HIV acquisition.
Findings
Between November, 2004, and August, 2014, we identified 87 women who acquired HIV infection (cases) and 262 controls who did not acquire HIV infection. Vaginal bacterial community diversity was higher in women who acquired HIV infection (median 1·3, IQR 0·4–2·3) than in seronegative controls (0·7, 0·1–1·5; p=0·03). Seven of the 20 taxa showed significant concentration-dependent associations with increased odds of HIV acquisition: Parvimonas species type 1 (first tertile aOR 1·67, 95% CI 0·61–4·57; second tertile 3·01, 1·13–7·99; third tertile 4·64, 1·73–12·46; p=0·005) and type 2 (first tertile 3·52, 1·63–7·61; second tertile 0·85, 0·36–2·02; third tertile 2·18, 1·01–4·72; p=0·004), Gemella asaccharolytica (first tertile 2·09, 1·01–4·36; second tertile 2·02, 0·98–4·17; third tertile 3·03, 1·46–6·30; p=0·010), Mycoplasma hominis (first tertile 1·46, 0·69–3·11; second tertile 1·40, 0·66–2·98; third tertile 2·76, 1·36–5·63; p=0·048), Leptotrichia/Sneathia (first tertile 2·04, 1·02–4·10; second tertile 1·45, 0·70–3·00; third tertile 2·59, 1·26–5·34; p=0·046), Eggerthella species type 1 (first tertile 1·79, 0·88–3·64; second tertile 2·62, 1·31–5·22; third tertile 1·53, 0·72–3·28; p=0·041), and vaginal Megasphaera species (first tertile 3·15, 1·45–6·81; second tertile 1·43, 0·65–3·14; third tertile 1·32, 0·57–3·05; p=0·038).
Interpretation
Differences in the vaginal microbial diversity and concentrations of key bacteria were associated with greater risk of HIV acquisition in women. Defining vaginal bacterial taxa associated with HIV risk could point to mechanisms that influence HIV susceptibility and provide important targets for future prevention research.

No uniformly organised collection of data regarding antimicrobial resistance has occurred in the countries of the Arab League. 19 countries of the Arab League have published data for antimicrobial susceptibility for the WHO priority organisms, and seven of 14 of these organisms are included in this Review (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Salmonella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Although E coli and Klebsiella spp resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is common in all countries, with prevalence reaching more than 50% in Egypt and Syria, carbapenem resistance is emerging, albeit with a prevalence of less than 10%. Conversely, a large amount of carbapenem resistance has been reported for P aeruginosa and A baumannii across the Arab League, reaching 50% and 88% of isolates in some countries. As for Salmonella spp, the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance has exceeded 30% in several areas. With regards to the Gram-positive pathogens, the prevalence of meticillin resistance in S aureus is reported to be between 20% and 30% in most countries, but exceeds 60% in Egypt and Iraq. The prevalence of penicillin non-susceptibility among pneumococci has reached more than 20% in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia. These findings highlight the need for structured national plans in the region to target infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship."

author = "Erik Lenguerrand and Michael R Whitehouse and Andrew D Beswick and Setor K Kunutsor and Ben Burston and Martyn Porter and Ashley W Blom",
abstract = "Summary
Background
The risk of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is influenced by patient, surgical, and health-care factors. Existing evidence is based on short-term follow-up. It does not differentiate between factors associated with early onset caused by the primary intervention from those associated with later onset more likely to result from haematogenous spread. We aimed to assess the overall and time-specific associations of these factors with the risk of revision due to PJI after primary total hip replacement.
Methods
We did a prospective observational cohort study analysing 623 253 primary hip procedures performed between April 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2013, in England and Wales and recorded the number of procedures revised because of PJI. We investigated the associations between risk factors and risk of revision for PJI across the overall follow-up period using Poisson multilevel models. We reinvestigated the associations by post-operative time periods (0–3 months, 3–6 months, 6–12 months, 12–24 months, >24 months) using piece-wise exponential multilevel models with period-specific effects. Data were obtained from the National Joint Registry linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics data.
Findings
2705 primary procedures were subsequently revised for an indication of PJI between 2003 and 2014, after a median (IQR) follow up of 4·6 years (2·6–7·0). Among the factors associated with an increased revision due to PJI there were male sex (1462 [1·2‰] of 1 237 170 male-years vs 1243 [0·7‰] of 1 849 691 female-years; rate ratio [RR] 1·7 [95% CI 1·6–1·8]), younger age (739 [1·1‰] of 688 000 person-years <60 years vs 242 [0·6‰] of 387 049 person-years ≥80 years; 0·7 [0·6–0·8]), elevated body-mass index (BMI; 941 [1·8‰] 517 278 person-years with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 vs 272 [0·9‰] of 297 686 person-years with a BMI <25 kg/m2; 1·9 [1·7–2·2]), diabetes (245 [1·4‰] 178 381 person-years with diabetes vs 2120 [1·0‰] of 2 209 507 person-years without diabetes; 1·4 [1·2–1·5]), dementia (5 [10·1‰] of 497 person-years with dementia at 3 months vs 311 [2·6‰] of 120 850 person-years without dementia; 3·8 [1·2–7·8]), previous septic arthritis (22 [7·2‰] of 3055 person-years with previous infection vs 2683 [0·9‰] of 3 083 806 person-years without previous infection; 6·7 [4·2–9·8]), fractured neck of femur (66 [1·5‰] of 43 378 person-years operated for a fractured neck of femur vs 2639 [0·9‰] of 3 043 483 person-years without a fractured neck of femur; 1·8 [1·4–2·3]); and use of the lateral surgical approach (1334 [1·0‰] of 1 399 287 person-years for lateral vs 1242 [0·8 ‰] of 1 565 913 person-years for posterior; 1·3 [1·2–1·4]). Use of ceramic rather than metal bearings was associated with a decreased risk of revision for PJI (94 [0·4‰] of 239 512 person-years with ceramic-on-ceramic bearings vs 602 [0·5‰] of 1 114 239 peron-years with metal-on-polyethylene bearings at ≥24 months; RR 0·6 [0·4–0·7]; and 82 [0·4‰] of 190 884 person-years with ceramic-on-polyethyene bearings vs metal-on-polyethylene bearings at ≥24 months; 0·7 [0·5–0·9]). Most of these factors had time-specific effects. The risk of revision for PJI was marginally or not influenced by the grade of the operating surgeon, the absence of a consultant surgeon during surgey, and the volume of procedures performed by hospital or surgeon.
Interpretation
Several modifiable and non-modifiable factors are associated with the risk of revision for PJI after primary hip replacement. Identification of modifiable factors, use of targeted interventions, and beneficial modulation of some of these factors could be effective in reducing the incidence of PJI. It is important for clinicians to consider non-modifiable factors and factors that exhibit time-specific effects on the risk of PJI to counsel patients appropriately preoperatively.

The global burden of disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is increasingly recognised, not only in infants, but also in older adults (aged ≥65 years). Advances in knowledge of the structural biology of the RSV surface fusion glycoprotein have revolutionised RSV vaccine development by providing a new target for preventive interventions. The RSV vaccine landscape has rapidly expanded to include 19 vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in clinical trials, reflecting the urgency of reducing this global health problem and hence the prioritisation of RSV vaccine development. The candidates include mAbs and vaccines using four approaches: (1) particle-based, (2) live-attenuated or chimeric, (3) subunit, (4) vector-based. Late-phase RSV vaccine trial failures highlight gaps in knowledge regarding immunological protection and provide lessons for future development. In this Review, we highlight promising new approaches for RSV vaccine design and provide a comprehensive overview of RSV vaccine candidates and mAbs in clinical development to prevent one of the most common and severe infectious diseases in young children and older adults worldwide."

abstract = "Summary
Background
REGN3470-3471-3479 is a co-formulated cocktail of three human monoclonal antibodies targeting three non-overlapping epitopes on Ebola virus. We investigated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-drug antibodies in healthy adults.
Methods
This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study was done at a phase 1 unit in the USA. Healthy adults, aged 18–60 years, with a body-mass index of 18·0–30·0 kg/m2 were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive a single intravenous dose of REGN3470-3471-3479 or placebo on day 1 (baseline) in one of the four sequential ascending intravenous dose cohorts (3 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, and 150 mg/kg). Site investigators and participants were masked to the treatment assignment, whereas designated personnel at the site who prepared and generated the study medication were aware of the randomisation treatment assignments. The primary outcome was safety and the secondary outcomes were the pharmacokinetic profiles and immunogenicity. Study assessments were done the day before study drug administration, on the day of drug administration, on day 2 (before discharge), on days 3, 4, 8, 15, 29, 57, 85, 113, and 141, and at the end of study on day 169. The safety analysis included all randomised participants who received study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT002777151.
Findings
Between May 18, 2016, and October 27, 2016, 70 adults were screened and 24 participants were enrolled in the study. 18 participants were assigned to and received REGN3470-3471-3479, and six participants were assigned to and received placebo as a single intravenous infusion. 19 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in the combined REGN3470-3471-3479 treatment groups, and four treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in combined placebo groups. Adverse events were transient and mild-to-moderate in severity. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was headache (six [33%] of 18 participants in the combined REGN3470-3471-3479 group vs none of six participants in the placebo group. Headaches were mild-to-moderate in severity, with onset between 2 h and 27 days after start of study drug infusion. There were no deaths, serious adverse events, or adverse events that led to study discontinuation. The pharmacokinetics of each antibody was linear, with mean half-lives of 27·3 days for REGN3471, 21·7 days for REGN3470, and 23·3 days for REGN3479. No participants tested positive for anti-REGN3470, anti-REGN3471, or anti-REGN3479 antibodies.
Interpretation
REGN3470-3471-3479 was well tolerated, displayed linear pharmacokinetics, and did not lead to detectable immunogenicity. These data support further clinical development of REGN3470-3471-3479 as a single-dose therapeutic drug for acute Ebola virus infection.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In 2016, an increase in invasive Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib) disease was reported in the Netherlands in children younger than 5 years, which coincided with the introduction of the hexavalent diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis-hepatitis B virus-inactivated polio virus/Hib vaccine (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib) from 2011 onwards. We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the hexavalent vaccine to assess whether this increase could be explained by decreasing effectiveness.
Methods
We did a case-control study in the Netherlands. We selected patients with a Hib infection (cases) by use of the surveillance records of the Netherlands Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis (Amsterdam). Cases with a Hib infection that began from Jan 1, 2003, to Dec 31, 2016, and who were younger than age 5 years were included. Ten controls from the national vaccination register (Praeventis) were selected for each case, matched by date of birth. Vaccination status was ascertained by use of Praeventis, which details the vaccination records of children living in the Netherlands. The last recorded vaccine dose was used to classify the child as having received the hexavalent DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine or a pentavalent vaccine (which excludes the hepatitis B virus component) or another vaccine. We estimated the effectiveness of these vaccines by use of conditional logistic regression.
Findings
We included 159 (94%) of 170 cases reported and 1590 matched controls, who had a median age of 1·5 years (IQR 0·8–2·9). The remaining 11 cases could not be cross-matched with vaccination records from Praeventis. 91 (57%) of 159 cases had been vaccinated, compared with 1408 (89%) of 1590 controls. The overall vaccine effectiveness was 92·8% (95% CI 88·7–95·4), with no differences between the year of disease onset (p=0·9670). There were no differences conferred by type of vaccine given: vaccine effectiveness of the pentavalent and other vaccines was 91·8% (95% CI 86·1–95·1) versus 94·0% (89·0–96·8) for the hexavalent vaccine (OR 0·72, 95% CI 0·36–1·45; p=0·3591). Vaccine effectiveness was highest in children aged 1–2 years at disease onset (97·1–99·0%) and was lowest in children aged 3–4 years at disease onset (60·7–82·3%; p=0·0008).
Interpretation
Our results support the current vaccination programme, since Hib vaccine effectiveness has not decreased over time or by the introduction of the hexavalent DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine. Vaccine effectiveness was high but waned with age. Alternative explanations for the increase in Hib disease therefore need to be assessed.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pfs25H-EPA is a protein-protein conjugate transmission-blocking vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum that is safe and induces functional antibodies in malaria-naive individuals. In this field trial, we assessed Pfs25H-EPA/Alhydrogel for safety and functional immunogenicity in Malian adults.
Methods
This double-blind, randomised, comparator-controlled, dose-escalation trial in Bancoumana, Mali, was done in two staggered phases, an initial pilot safety assessment and a subsequent main phase. Healthy village residents aged 18–45 years were eligible if they had normal laboratory results (including HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C tests) and had not received a previous malaria vaccine or recent immunosuppressive drugs, vaccines, or blood products. Participants in the pilot safety cohort and the main cohort were assigned (1:1) by block randomisation to a study vaccine group. Participants in the pilot safety cohort received two doses of Pfs25H-EPA/Alhydrogel 16 μg or Euvax B (comparator vaccine), and participants in the main cohort received Pfs25H-EPA/Alhydrogel 47 μg or comparator vaccine (Euvax B for the first, second, and third vaccinations and Menactra for the fourth vaccination). Participants and investigators were masked to group assignment, and randomisation codes in sealed envelopes held by a site pharmacist. Vials with study drug for injection were covered by opaque tape and labelled with a study identification number. Group assignments were unmasked at final study visit. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability for all vaccinees. The secondary outcome measure was immunogenicity 14 days after vaccination in the per-protocol population, as confirmed by the presence of antibodies against Pfs25H measured by ELISA IgG and antibody functionality assessed by standard membrane feeding assays and by direct skin feeding assays. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01867463.
Findings
Between May 15, and Jun 16, 2013, 230 individuals were screened for eligibility. 20 individuals were enrolled in the pilot safety cohort; ten participants were assigned to receive Pfs25H-EPA/Alhydrogel 16 μg, and ten participants were assigned to receive comparator vaccine. 100 individuals were enrolled in the main cohort; 50 participants were assigned to receive Pfs25H-EPA/Alhydrogel 47 μg, and 50 participants were assigned to receive comparator vaccine. Compared with comparator vaccinees, Pfs25H vaccinees had more solicited adverse events (137 events vs 86 events; p=0·022) and treatment-related adverse events (191 events vs 126 events, p=0·034), but the number of other adverse events did not differ between study vaccine groups (792 vs 683). Pfs25H antibody titres increased with each dose, with a peak geometric mean of 422·3 ELISA units (95% CI 290–615) after the fourth dose, but decreased relatively rapidly thereafter, with a half-life of 42 days for anti-Pfs25H and 59 days for anti-EPA (median ratio of titres at day 600 to peak, 0·19 for anti-Pfs25H vs 0·29 for anti-EPA; p=0·009). Serum transmission-reducing activity was greater for Pfs25H than for comparator vaccine after the fourth vaccine dose (p<0·001) but not after the third dose (p=0·09). Repeated direct skin feeds were well tolerated, but the number of participants who infected at least one mosquito did not differ between Pfs25H and comparator vaccinees after the fourth dose (p=1, conditional exact).
Interpretation
Pfs25H-EPA/Alhydrogel was well tolerated and induced significant serum activity by standard membrane feeding assays but transmission blocking activity was not confirmed by weekly direct skin feed. This activity required four doses, and titres decreased rapidly after the fourth dose. Alternative antigens or combinations should be assessed to improve activity.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are rising globally and there is concern that increased migration is contributing to the burden of antibiotic resistance in Europe. However, the effect of migration on the burden of AMR in Europe has not yet been comprehensively examined. Therefore, we did a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify and synthesise data for AMR carriage or infection in migrants to Europe to examine differences in patterns of AMR across migrant groups and in different settings.
Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus with no language restrictions from Jan 1, 2000, to Jan 18, 2017, for primary data from observational studies reporting antibacterial resistance in common bacterial pathogens among migrants to 21 European Union-15 and European Economic Area countries. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to report data on carriage or infection with laboratory-confirmed antibiotic-resistant organisms in migrant populations. We extracted data from eligible studies and assessed quality using piloted, standardised forms. We did not examine drug resistance in tuberculosis and excluded articles solely reporting on this parameter. We also excluded articles in which migrant status was determined by ethnicity, country of birth of participants' parents, or was not defined, and articles in which data were not disaggregated by migrant status. Outcomes were carriage of or infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms. We used random-effects models to calculate the pooled prevalence of each outcome. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016043681.
Findings
We identified 2274 articles, of which 23 observational studies reporting on antibiotic resistance in 2319 migrants were included. The pooled prevalence of any AMR carriage or AMR infection in migrants was 25·4% (95% CI 19·1–31·8; I2 =98%), including meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (7·8%, 4·8–10·7; I2 =92%) and antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (27·2%, 17·6–36·8; I2 =94%). The pooled prevalence of any AMR carriage or infection was higher in refugees and asylum seekers (33·0%, 18·3–47·6; I2 =98%) than in other migrant groups (6·6%, 1·8–11·3; I2 =92%). The pooled prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms was slightly higher in high-migrant community settings (33·1%, 11·1–55·1; I2 =96%) than in migrants in hospitals (24·3%, 16·1–32·6; I2 =98%). We did not find evidence of high rates of transmission of AMR from migrant to host populations.
Interpretation
Migrants are exposed to conditions favouring the emergence of drug resistance during transit and in host countries in Europe. Increased antibiotic resistance among refugees and asylum seekers and in high-migrant community settings (such as refugee camps and detention facilities) highlights the need for improved living conditions, access to health care, and initiatives to facilitate detection of and appropriate high-quality treatment for antibiotic-resistant infections during transit and in host countries. Protocols for the prevention and control of infection and for antibiotic surveillance need to be integrated in all aspects of health care, which should be accessible for all migrant groups, and should target determinants of AMR before, during, and after migration.

During onchocerciasis surveys undertaken in 25 villages in Cameroon during 1991–93, we measured MFD in individuals aged 5 years or older. In 2017, we revisited seven of these villages. With a standardised five-item questionnaire, we collected information on the occurrence of epilepsy in 856 individuals who were aged 5–10 years in 1991–93, and had MFD determined during the original surveys. We did multivariable analyses to assess the overall incidence and incidence ratios taking into account age, sex, individual MFD in 1991–93, and onchocerciasis endemicity level in the village.
Findings
In 2017, we obtained data on the history of epilepsy for 85% (729 of 856) of individuals. Among these individuals, we classified 60 as being suspected cases of epilepsy. The overall incidence of epilepsy was 350 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 270–450). The adjusted incidence ratio for developing epilepsy was 7·07 (95% CI 0·98–51·26; p=0·0530) in individuals with initial MFD of one to five microfilariae per skin snip (mf per snip), 11·26 (2·73–46·43) in individuals with six to 20 mf per snip, 12·90 (4·40–37·83) in individuals with 21–50 mf per snip, 20·00 (3·71–108·00) in individuals with 51–100 mf per snip, 22·58 (3·21–158·56) in individuals with 101–200 mf per snip, and 28·50 (95% CI 3·84–211·27; p=0·0010) in individuals with more than 200 mf per snip, compared with that of individuals without detectable densities of skin microfilariae.
Interpretation
Individual O volvulus MFD in childhood was associated with the risk of either seizures or epilepsy in an onchocerciasis focus in Cameroon. This temporal relationship suggests a potential causal link between onchocerciasis and epilepsy.

Avian and human influenza A viruses alike have shown a capacity to use the eye as a portal of entry and cause ocular disease in human beings. However, whereas influenza viruses generally represent a respiratory pathogen and only occasionally cause ocular complications, the H7 virus subtype stands alone in possessing an ocular tropism. Clarifying what confers such non-respiratory tropism to a respiratory virus will permit a greater ability to identify, treat, and prevent zoonotic human infection following ocular exposure to influenza viruses; especially those within the H7 subtype, which continue to cause avian epidemics on many continents."

Dengue virus infections cause a substantial public health burden in tropical and subtropical regions. A single dengue vaccine has been approved by regulatory authorities in 19 countries, but concerns regarding vaccine safety in people who are dengue naive at the time of immunisation has introduced uncertainty into the vaccine's future. As other dengue vaccines complete or enter large-scale efficacy trials, we argue that foundational work by Sabin, historic epidemiological observations of dengue outbreaks, and prospective cohort studies in Asia and the Americas indicate that modifications must be made to the methods of assessing dengue vaccines. In this Personal View, we review and relate previous data that supports a dynamic role of cross-protective dengue immunity to the goals and challenges of measuring and interpreting dengue vaccine immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety in clinical trials. We suggest that for partly protective vaccines, temporary cross-protective immunity could lead to overestimation of vaccine safety and efficacy in the early years following vaccination. We recommend that assessment of dengue vaccines should span several years, involve active surveillance to clinically characterise incident infections and regular blood draws to define kinetic changes in immunological profiles, and include sample sizes that are large enough to support detailed analyses of vaccine trial subgroups, such as individuals who are dengue naive."

The 1918–21 influenza pandemic was the most lethal natural event in recent history. In the Pacific region, the pandemic's effects varied greatly across different populations and settings. In this region, the pandemic's lethal effects extended over 3 years, from November, 1918, in New Zealand to as late as July, 1921, in New Caledonia. Although a single virus strain probably affected all the islands, mortality varied from less than 0·1% in Tasmania, to 22% in Western Samoa. The varied expressions of the pandemic across the islands reflected the nature and timing of past influenza epidemics, degrees of social isolation, ethnicity and sex-related effects, and the likelihood of exposures to pathogenic respiratory bacteria during influenza illnesses. The high case-fatality rate associated with this pandemic seems unlikely to recur in future influenza pandemics; however, understanding the critical determinants of the mass mortality associated with the 1918–21 pandemic is essential to prepare for future pandemics."

abstract = "Summary
Lymphatic filariasis in Africa is caused by the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti and remains a major cause of morbidity and disability in 74 countries globally. A key strategy of the Global Programme for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis, which has a target elimination date of 2020, is the treatment of entire endemic communities through mass drug administration of albendazole in combination with either ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine. Although the strategy of mass drug administration in combination with other interventions, such as vector control, has led to elimination of the infection and its transmission in many rural communities, urban areas in west Africa present specific challenges to achieving the 2020 targets. In this Personal View, we examine these challenges and the relevance of mass drug administration in urban areas, exploring the rationale for a reassessment of policy in these settings. The community-based mass treatment approach is best suited to rural areas, is challenging and costly in urban areas, and cannot easily achieve the 65% consistent coverage required for elimination of transmission. In our view, the implementation of mass drug administration might not be essential to interrupt transmission of lymphatic filariasis in urban areas in west Africa. Evidence shows that transmission levels are low and that effective mass drug distribution is difficult to implement, with assessments suggesting that specific control measures against filariasis in such dynamic settings is not an effective use of limited resources. Instead, we recommend that individuals who have clinical disease or who test positive for W bancrofti infection in surveillance activities should be offered antifilarial drugs through a passive surveillance approach, as well as morbidity management for their needs. We also recommend that more precise studies are done, so that mass drug administration in urban areas is considered if sustainable transmission is found to be ongoing. Otherwise, the limited resources should be directed towards other elements of the lymphatic filariasis programme."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In many countries, regular monitoring of the emergence of resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs is hampered by the limitations of phenotypic testing for drug susceptibility. We therefore evaluated the use of genetic sequencing for surveillance of drug resistance in tuberculosis.
Methods
Population-level surveys were done in hospitals and clinics in seven countries (Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Pakistan, Philippines, South Africa, and Ukraine) to evaluate the use of genetic sequencing to estimate the resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates to rifampicin, isoniazid, ofloxacin, moxifloxacin, pyrazinamide, kanamycin, amikacin, and capreomycin. For each drug, we assessed the accuracy of genetic sequencing by a comparison of the adjusted prevalence of resistance, measured by genetic sequencing, with the true prevalence of resistance, determined by phenotypic testing.
Findings
Isolates were taken from 7094 patients with tuberculosis who were enrolled in the study between November, 2009, and May, 2014. In all tuberculosis cases, the overall pooled sensitivity values for predicting resistance by genetic sequencing were 91% (95% CI 87–94) for rpoB (rifampicin resistance), 86% (74–93) for katG, inhA, and fabG promoter combined (isoniazid resistance), 54% (39–68) for pncA (pyrazinamide resistance), 85% (77–91) for gyrA and gyrB combined (ofloxacin resistance), and 88% (81–92) for gyrA and gyrB combined (moxifloxacin resistance). For nearly all drugs and in most settings, there was a large overlap in the estimated prevalence of drug resistance by genetic sequencing and the estimated prevalence by phenotypic testing.
Interpretation
Genetic sequencing can be a valuable tool for surveillance of drug resistance, providing new opportunities to monitor drug resistance in tuberculosis in resource-poor countries. Before its widespread adoption for surveillance purposes, there is a need to standardise DNA extraction methods, recording and reporting nomenclature, and data interpretation.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infections worldwide, but reports in the medical literature of an association between genital chlamydia infection and adverse obstetric outcomes are inconsistent.
Methods
The Western Australia Data Linkage Branch created a cohort of women of reproductive age by linking records of birth registrations with the electoral roll for women in Western Australia who were born from 1974 to 1995. The cohort was then linked to both chlamydia testing records and the state perinatal registry for data on preterm births and other adverse obstetric outcomes. We determined associations between chlamydia testing, test positivity, and adverse obstetric outcomes using multivariate logistic regression analyses.
Findings
From 2001 to 2012, 101 558 women aged 15 to 38 years had a singleton birth. Of these women, 3921 (3·9%) had a spontaneous preterm birth, 9762 (9·6% of 101 371 women with available data) had a baby who was small for gestational age, and 682 (0·7%) had a stillbirth. During their pregnancy, 21 267 (20·9%) of these women had at least one chlamydia test record, and 1365 (6·4%) of those tested were positive. Before pregnancy, 19 157 (18·9%) of these women were tested for chlamydia, of whom 1595 (8·3%) tested positive for chlamydia. Among all women with a test record, after adjusting for age, ethnicity, maternal smoking, and history of other infections, we found no significant association between a positive test for chlamydia and spontaneous preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio 1·08 [95% CI 0·91–1·28]; p=0·37), a baby who was small for gestational age (0·95 [0·85–1·07]; p=0·39), or stillbirth (0·93 [0·61–1·42]; p=0·74).
Interpretation
A genital chlamydia infection that is diagnosed and, presumably, treated either during or before pregnancy does not substantially increase a woman's risk of having a spontaneous preterm birth, having a baby who is small for gestational age, or having a stillbirth.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Massive internal migration from rural to urban areas poses new challenges for tuberculosis control in China. We aimed to combine genomic, spatial, and epidemiological data to describe the dynamics of tuberculosis in an urban setting with large numbers of migrants.
Methods
We did a population-based study of culture-positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Songjiang, Shanghai. We used whole-genome sequencing to discriminate apparent genetic clusters of M tuberculosis sharing identical variable-number-tandem-repeat (VNTR) patterns, and analysed the relations between proximity of residence and the risk of genomically clustered M tuberculosis. Finally, we used genomic, spatial, and epidemiological data to estimate time of infection and transmission links among migrants and residents.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2015, 1620 cases of culture-positive tuberculosis were recorded, 1211 (75%) of which occurred among internal migrants. 150 (69%) of 218 people sharing identical VNTR patterns had isolates within ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of at least one other strain, consistent with recent transmission of M tuberculosis. Pairs of strains collected from individuals living in close proximity were more likely to be genetically similar than those from individuals who lived far away—for every additional km of distance between patients' homes, the odds that genotypically matched strains were within ten SNPs of each other decreased by about 10% (OR 0·89 [95% CI 0·87–0·91]; p<0·0001). We inferred that transmission from residents to migrants occurs as commonly as transmission from migrants to residents, and we estimated that more than two-thirds of migrants in genomic clusters were infected locally after migration.
Interpretation
The primary mechanism driving local incidence of tuberculosis in urban centres is local transmission between both migrants and residents. Combined analysis of epidemiological, genomic, and spatial data contributes to a richer understanding of local transmission dynamics and should inform the design of more effective interventions.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Transmission of multidrug-resistant Candida auris infection has been reported in the USA. To better understand its emergence and transmission dynamics and to guide clinical and public health responses, we did a molecular epidemiological investigation of C auris cases in the USA.
Methods
In this molecular epidemiological survey, we used whole-genome sequencing to assess the genetic similarity between isolates collected from patients in ten US states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Oklahoma) and those identified in several other countries (Colombia, India, Japan, Pakistan, South Africa, South Korea, and Venezuela). We worked with state health departments, who provided us with isolates for sequencing. These isolates of C auris were collected during the normal course of clinical care (clinical cases) or as part of contact investigations or point prevalence surveys (screening cases). We integrated data from standardised case report forms and contact investigations, including travel history and epidemiological links (ie, patients that had shared a room or ward with a patient with C auris). Genetic diversity of C auris within a patient, a facility, and a state were evaluated by pairwise differences in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
Findings
From May 11, 2013, to Aug 31, 2017, isolates that corresponded to 133 cases (73 clinical cases and 60 screening cases) were collected. Of 73 clinical cases, 66 (90%) cases involved isolates related to south Asian isolates, five (7%) cases were related to South American isolates, one (1%) case to African isolates, and one (1%) case to east Asian isolates. Most (60 [82%]) clinical cases were identified in New York and New Jersey; these isolates, although related to south Asian isolates, were genetically distinct. Genomic data corroborated five (7%) clinical cases in which patients probably acquired C auris through health-care exposures abroad. Among clinical and screening cases, the genetic diversity of C auris isolates within a person was similar to that within a facility during an outbreak (median SNP difference three SNPs, range 0–12).
Interpretation
Isolates of C auris in the USA were genetically related to those from four global regions, suggesting that C auris was introduced into the USA several times. The five travel-related cases are examples of how introductions can occur. Genetic diversity among isolates from the same patients, health-care facilities, and states indicates that there is local and ongoing transmission.

CHI trials have provided landmark data for several registered drugs and vaccines, and have generated unprecedented scientific insights. Because of their invasive nature, CHI studies demand critical ethical review according to established frameworks. CHI-associated serious adverse events are rarely reported. Novel CHI models need standardised safety data from comparable CHI models to facilitate evidence-based risk assessments, as well as funds to produce challenge inoculum according to regulatory requirements.

abstract = "Summary
Background
On April 25, 2017, a cluster of unexplained illnesses and deaths associated with a funeral was reported in Sinoe County, Liberia. Molecular testing identified Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (NmC) in specimens from patients. We describe the epidemiological investigation of this cluster and metagenomic characterisation of the outbreak strain.
Methods
We collected epidemiological data from the field investigation and medical records review. Confirmed, probable, and suspected cases were defined on the basis of molecular testing and signs or symptoms of meningococcal disease. Metagenomic sequences from patient specimens were compared with 141 meningococcal isolate genomes to determine strain lineage.
Findings
28 meningococcal disease cases were identified, with dates of symptom onset from April 21 to April 30, 2017: 13 confirmed, three probable, and 12 suspected. 13 patients died. Six (21%) patients reported fever and 23 (82%) reported gastrointestinal symptoms. The attack rate for confirmed and probable cases among funeral attendees was 10%. Metagenomic sequences from six patient specimens were similar to a sequence type (ST) 10217 (clonal complex [CC] 10217) isolate genome from Niger, 2015. Multilocus sequencing identified five of seven alleles from one specimen that matched ST-9367, which is represented in the PubMLST database by one carriage isolate from Burkina Faso, in 2011, and belongs to CC10217.
Interpretation
This outbreak featured high attack and case fatality rates. Clinical presentation was broadly consistent with previous meningococcal disease outbreaks, but predominance of gastrointestinal symptoms was unusual compared with previous African meningitis epidemics. The outbreak strain was genetically similar to NmC CC10217, which caused meningococcal disease outbreaks in Niger and Nigeria. CC10217 had previously been identified only in the African meningitis belt.

Background
Globally, per-capita, South Africa reports a disproportionately high number of cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis. We sought to estimate the prevalence of resistance to tuberculosis drugs in newly diagnosed and retreated patients with tuberculosis provincially and nationally, and compared these with the 2001–02 estimates.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was done between June 15, 2012–June 14, 2014, using population proportionate randomised cluster sampling in the nine provinces in South Africa. 343 clusters were included, ranging between 31 and 48 per province. A patient was eligible for inclusion in the survey if he or she presented as a presumptive case during the intake period at a drug resistance survey enrolling facility. Consenting participants (≥18 years old) completed a questionnaire and had a sputum sample tested for resistance to first-line and second-line drugs. Analysis was by logistic regression with robust SEs, inverse probability weighted against routine data, and estimates were derived using a random effects model.
Findings
101 422 participants were tested in 2012–14. Nationally, the prevalence of MDR tuberculosis was 2·1% (95% CI 1·5–2·7) among new tuberculosis cases and 4·6% (3·2–6·0) among retreatment cases. The provincial point prevalence of MDR tuberculosis ranged between 1·6% (95% CI 0·9–2·9) and 5·1% (3·7–7·0). Overall, the prevalence of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (4·6%, 95% CI 3·5–5·7) was higher than the prevalence of MDR tuberculosis (2·8%, 2·0–3·6; p=0·01). Comparing the current survey with the previous (2001–02) survey, the overall MDR tuberculosis prevalence was 2·8% versus 2·9% and prevalance of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis was 3·4% versus 1·8%, respectively. The prevalence of isoniazid mono-resistant tuberculosis was above 5% in all provinces. The prevalence of ethionamide and pyrazinamide resistance among MDR tuberculosis cases was 44·7% (95% CI 25·9–63·6) and 59·1% (49·0–69·1), respectively. The prevalence of XDR tuberculosis was 4·9% (95% CI 1·0–8·8). Nationally, the estimated numbers of cases of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, MDR tuberculosis, and isoniazid mono-resistant tuberculosis for 2014 were 13 551, 8249, and 17 970, respectively.
Interpretation
The overall prevalence of MDR tuberculosis in South Africa in 2012–14 was similar to that in 2001–02; however, prevalence of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis almost doubled among new cases. Furthermore, the high prevalence of isoniazid mono-resistant tuberculosis, not routinely screened for, and resistance to second-line drugs has implications for empirical management.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Whether antibiotic rotation strategies reduce prevalence of antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria in intensive care units (ICUs) has not been accurately established. We aimed to assess whether cycling of antibiotics compared with a mixing strategy (changing antibiotic to an alternative class for each consecutive patient) would reduce the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria in European intensive care units (ICUs).
Methods
In a cluster-randomised crossover study, we randomly assigned ICUs to use one of three antibiotic groups (third-generation or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin–tazobactam, and carbapenems) as preferred empirical treatment during 6-week periods (cycling) or to change preference after every consecutively treated patient (mixing). Computer-based randomisation of intervention and rotated antibiotic sequence was done centrally. Cycling or mixing was applied for 9 months; then, following a washout period, the alternative strategy was implemented. We defined antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria as Enterobacteriaceae with extended-spectrum β-lactamase production or piperacillin–tazobactam resistance, and Acinetobacter spp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with piperacillin–tazobactam or carbapenem resistance. Data were collected for all admissions during the study. The primary endpoint was average, unit-wide, monthly point prevalence of antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria in respiratory and perineal swabs with adjustment for potential confounders. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01293071.
Findings
Eight ICUs (from Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal, and Slovenia) were randomly assigned and patients enrolled from June 27, 2011, to Feb 16, 2014. 4069 patients were admitted during the cycling periods in total and 4707 were admitted during the mixing periods. Of these, 745 patients during cycling and 853 patients during mixing were present during the monthly point-prevalence surveys, and were included in the main analysis. Mean prevalence of the composite primary endpoint was 23% (168/745) during cycling and 22% (184/853) during mixing (p=0·64), yielding an adjusted incidence rate ratio during mixing of 1·039 (95% CI 0·837–1·291; p=0·73). There was no difference in all-cause in-ICU mortality between intervention periods.
Interpretation
Antibiotic cycling does not reduce the prevalence of carriage of antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria in patients admitted to the ICU.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The risk of tuberculosis outbreaks among people fleeing hardship for refuge in Europe is heightened. We describe the cross-border European response to an outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among patients from the Horn of Africa and Sudan.
Methods
On April 29 and May 30, 2016, the Swiss and German National Mycobacterial Reference Laboratories independently triggered an outbreak investigation after four patients were diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. In this molecular epidemiological study, we prospectively defined outbreak cases with 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) profiles; phenotypic resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and capreomycin; and corresponding drug resistance mutations. We whole-genome sequenced all Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates and clustered them using a threshold of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We collated epidemiological data from host countries from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
Findings
Between Feb 12, 2016, and April 19, 2017, 29 patients were diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in seven European countries. All originated from the Horn of Africa or Sudan, with all isolates two SNPs or fewer apart. 22 (76%) patients reported their travel routes, with clear spatiotemporal overlap between routes. We identified a further 29 MIRU-VNTR-linked cases from the Horn of Africa that predated the outbreak, but all were more than five SNPs from the outbreak. However all 58 isolates shared a capreomycin resistance-associated tlyA mutation.
Interpretation
Our data suggest that source cases are linked to an M tuberculosis clone circulating in northern Somalia or Djibouti and that transmission probably occurred en route before arrival in Europe. We hypothesise that the shared mutation of tlyA is a drug resistance mutation and phylogenetic marker, the first of its kind in M tuberculosis sensu stricto.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Invasive meningococcal disease is an important public health problem, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. After introduction of MenAfriVac in 2010, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A disease has been almost eliminated from the region. However, serogroups C, W, Y, and X continue to cause disease outbreaks. We assessed the NmCV-5 pentavalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine targeting A, C, Y, W, and X serogroups in a first-in-man, phase 1 study.
Methods
We did a single-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial at a research clinic in Baltimore (MD, USA). Participants were healthy adults aged 18–45 years with no history of meningococcal vaccination or previous meningococcal infection. We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) by an SAS-generated random schedule to a single, 0·5 mL, intramuscular injection of aluminium-phosphate adjuvanted NmCV-5, non-adjuvanted NmCV-5, or control (the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine Menactra). The randomisation sequence used a permuted block design with randomly chosen block sizes of three and six. The vaccines were prepared, labelled, and administered with procedures to ensure participants and study personnel remained masked to treatment. After vaccination, participants were observed in the clinic for 60 min for adverse reactions. Participants recorded daily temperature and injection site or systemic reactions at home and returned to the clinic for follow-up visits on days 7, 28, and 84 for safety assessments; blood samples were also collected on day 7 for safety laboratory assessment. A phone call contact was made 6 months after vaccination. Serum was collected before vaccination and 28 days after vaccination for immunological assessment with a rabbit complement-dependent serum bactericidal antibody (rSBA) assay. The primary objective was an intention-to-treat assessment of safety, measuring local and systemic reactogenicity over 7 days, unsolicited adverse events through 28 days, and serious adverse events over 6 months. The secondary objective for the assessment of immunogenicity, was a per-protocol analysis of rSBA before and 28 days after vaccination. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02810340.
Findings
Between Aug 17, 2016, and Feb 16, 2017, we assigned 20 participants to each vaccine. All vaccines were well-tolerated. Pain was the most common local reaction, occurring in 12 (60%), ten (50%), and seven (35%) participants in the adjuvanted NmCV-5, non-adjuvanted NmCV-5, and control groups, respectively. Headache was the most common systemic reaction, occurring in five (25%), three (15%), and three (15%), respectively. Most solicited reactogenicity adverse reactions were mild (60 [74%] of 81) and all were self-limiting. None of the differences in proportions of individuals with each solicited reaction was significant (p>0·300 for all comparisons) between the three vaccination groups. There were no serious adverse events and 19 unsolicited non-serious adverse events in 14 (23%) participants. Both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted NmCV-5 elicited high rSBA titres against all five meningococcal serogroups. The pre-vaccination geometric mean titres (GMTs) ranged from 3·36 to 53·80 for the control, from 6·28 to 187·00 for the adjuvanted vaccine, and from 4·29 to 350·00 for the non-adjuvanted vaccine, and the post-vaccination GMT ranged from 3·14 to 3214 for the control, from 1351 to 8192 for the adjuvanted vaccine, and from 1607 to 11 191 for the non-adjuvanted vaccine. Predicted seroprotective responses (ie, an increase in rSBA titres of eight times or more) for the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted NmCV-5 were similar to control responses for all five serogroups.
Interpretation
The adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted NmCV-5 vaccines were well tolerated and did not produce concerning adverse effects and resulted in immune responses that are predicted to confer protection against all five targeted serogroups of invasive meningococcal disease. Further clinical testing of NmCV-5 is ongoing, and additional clinical trials are necessary to confirm the safety and immunogenicity of NmCV-5 in target populations.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Tackling tuberculosis requires testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis in high-risk groups. The aim of this study was to estimate the predictive values of the tuberculin skin test (TST) and two interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) for the development of active tuberculosis in high-risk groups—ie, people in recent contact with active tuberculosis cases and from high-burden countries.
Method
In this prospective cohort study, we recruited participants from 54 centres (eg, clinics, community settings) in London, Birmingham, and Leicester in the UK. Participants were eligible if they were aged 16 years or older and at high risk for latent tuberculosis infection (ie, recent contact with someone with active tuberculosis [contacts] or a migrant who had arrived in the UK in the past 5 years from—or who frequently travelled to—a country with a high burden of tuberculosis [migrants]). Exclusion criteria included prevalent cases of tuberculosis, and participants who were treated for latent tuberculosis after a positive test result in this study. Each participant received three tests (QuantiFERON-TB Gold-In Tube, T-SPOT.TB, and a Mantoux TST). A positive TST result was reported using three thresholds: 5 mm (TST-5), 10 mm (TST-10), and greater than 5 mm in BCG-naive or 15 mm in BCG-vaccinated (TST-15) participants. Participants were followed up from recruitment to development of tuberculosis or censoring. Incident tuberculosis cases were identified by national tuberculosis databases, telephone interview, and review of medical notes. Our primary objective was to estimate the prognostic value of IGRAs compared with TST, assessed by the ratio of incidence rate ratios and predictive values for tuberculosis development. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01162265, and is now complete.
Findings
Between May 4, 2010, and June 1, 2015, 10 045 people were recruited, of whom 9610 were eligible for inclusion. Of this cohort, 4861 (50·6%) were contacts and 4749 (49·4%) were migrants. Participants were followed up for a median of 2·9 years (range 21 days to 5·9 years). 97 (1·0%) of 9610 participants developed active tuberculosis (77 [1·2%] of 6380 with results for all three tests). In all tests, annual incidence of tuberculosis was very low in those who tested negatively (ranging from 1·2 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 0·6–2·0 for TST-5 to 1·9 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 1·3–2·7, for QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube). Annual incidence in participants who tested positively were highest for T-SPOT.TB (13·2 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 9·9–17·4), TST-15 (11·1 per 1000 person-years, 8·3–14·6), and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (10·1 per 1000 person-years, 7·4–13·4). Positive results for these tests were significantly better predictors of progression than TST-10 and TST-5 (eg, ratio of test positivity rates in those progressing to tuberculosis compared with those not progressing T-SPOT.TB vs TST-5: 1·99, 95% CI 1·68–2·34; p<0·0001). However, TST-5 identified a higher proportion of participants who progressed to active tuberculosis (64 [83%] of 77 tested) than all other tests and TST thresholds (≤75%).
Interpretation
IGRA-based or BCG-stratified TST strategies appear most suited to screening for potential disease progression among high-risk groups. Further work will be needed to assess country-specific cost-effectiveness of each screening test, and in the absence of highly specific diagnostic tests, cheap non-toxic treatments need to be developed that could be given to larger groups of people at potential risk.

Background
Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common infections associated with health care, but its importance as a global health priority is not fully understood. We quantified the burden of SSI after gastrointestinal surgery in countries in all parts of the world.
Methods
This international, prospective, multicentre cohort study included consecutive patients undergoing elective or emergency gastrointestinal resection within 2-week time periods at any health-care facility in any country. Countries with participating centres were stratified into high-income, middle-income, and low-income groups according to the UN's Human Development Index (HDI). Data variables from the GlobalSurg 1 study and other studies that have been found to affect the likelihood of SSI were entered into risk adjustment models. The primary outcome measure was the 30-day SSI incidence (defined by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for superficial and deep incisional SSI). Relationships with explanatory variables were examined using Bayesian multilevel logistic regression models. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02662231.
Findings
Between Jan 4, 2016, and July 31, 2016, 13 265 records were submitted for analysis. 12 539 patients from 343 hospitals in 66 countries were included. 7339 (58·5%) patient were from high-HDI countries (193 hospitals in 30 countries), 3918 (31·2%) patients were from middle-HDI countries (82 hospitals in 18 countries), and 1282 (10·2%) patients were from low-HDI countries (68 hospitals in 18 countries). In total, 1538 (12·3%) patients had SSI within 30 days of surgery. The incidence of SSI varied between countries with high (691 [9·4%] of 7339 patients), middle (549 [14·0%] of 3918 patients), and low (298 [23·2%] of 1282) HDI (p<0·001). The highest SSI incidence in each HDI group was after dirty surgery (102 [17·8%] of 574 patients in high-HDI countries; 74 [31·4%] of 236 patients in middle-HDI countries; 72 [39·8%] of 181 patients in low-HDI countries). Following risk factor adjustment, patients in low-HDI countries were at greatest risk of SSI (adjusted odds ratio 1·60, 95% credible interval 1·05–2·37; p=0·030). 132 (21·6%) of 610 patients with an SSI and a microbiology culture result had an infection that was resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic used. Resistant infections were detected in 49 (16·6%) of 295 patients in high-HDI countries, in 37 (19·8%) of 187 patients in middle-HDI countries, and in 46 (35·9%) of 128 patients in low-HDI countries (p<0·001).
Interpretation
Countries with a low HDI carry a disproportionately greater burden of SSI than countries with a middle or high HDI and might have higher rates of antibiotic resistance. In view of WHO recommendations on SSI prevention that highlight the absence of high-quality interventional research, urgent, pragmatic, randomised trials based in LMICs are needed to assess measures aiming to reduce this preventable complication.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Monovalent type 2 oral poliovirus vaccine (mOPV2) and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) are used to respond to type 2 poliovirus outbreaks. We aimed to assess the effect of two mOPV2 doses on the type 2 immune response by varying the time interval between mOPV2 doses and IPV co-administration with mOPV2.
Methods
We did a randomised, controlled, parallel, open-label, non-inferiority, inequality trial at two study clinics in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Healthy infants aged 6 weeks (42–48 days) at enrolment were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive two mOPV2 doses (each dose consisting of two drops [0·1 mL in total] of about 105 50% cell culture infectious dose of type 2 Sabin strain) at intervals of 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks (standard or control group), or 4 weeks with IPV (0·5 mL of type 1 [Mahoney, 40 D-antigen units], type 2 [MEF-1, 8 D-antigen units], and type 3 [Saukett, 32 D-antigen units]) administered intramuscularly with the first mOPV2 dose. We used block randomisation, randomly selecting blocks of sizes four, eight, 12, or 16 stratified by study sites. We concealed randomisation assignment from staff managing participants in opaque, sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes. Parents and clinic staff were unmasked to assignment after the randomisation envelope was opened. Laboratory staff analysing sera were masked to assignment, but investigators analysing data and assessing outcomes were not. The primary outcome was type 2 immune response measured 4 weeks after mOPV2 administration. The primary modified intention-to-treat analysis included participants with testable serum samples before and after vaccination. A non-inferiority margin of 10% and p=0·05 (one-tailed) was used. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02643368, and is closed to accrual.
Findings
Between Dec 7, 2015, and Jan 5, 2016, we randomly assigned 760 infants to receive two mOPV2 doses at intervals of 1 week (n=191), 2 weeks (n=191), 4 weeks (n=188), or 4 weeks plus IPV (n=190). Immune responses after two mOPV2 doses were observed in 161 (93%) of 173 infants with testable serum samples in the 1 week group, 169 (96%) of 177 in the 2 week group, and 176 (97%) of 181 in the 4 week group. 1 week and 2 week intervals between two mOPV2 doses were non-inferior to 4 week intervals because the lower bound of the absolute differences in the percentage of immune responses were greater than −10% (−4·2% [90% CI −7·9 to −0·4] in the 1 week group and −1·8% [–5·0 to 1·5] in the 2 week group vs the 4 week group). The immune response elicited by two mOPV2 doses 4 weeks apart was not different when IPV was added to the first dose (176 [97%] of 182 infants with IPV vs 176 [97%] of 181 without IPV; p=1·0). During the trial, two serious adverse events (pneumonia; one [1%] of 186 patients in the 1 week group and one [1%] of 182 in the 4 week group) and no deaths were reported; the adverse events were not attributed to the vaccines.
Interpretation
Administration of mOPV2 at short intervals does not interfere with its immunogenicity. The addition of IPV to the first mOPV2 dose did not improve poliovirus type 2 immune response.

Background
Although a preventable and treatable disease, tuberculosis causes more than a million deaths each year. As countries work towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target to end the tuberculosis epidemic by 2030, robust assessments of the levels and trends of the burden of tuberculosis are crucial to inform policy and programme decision making. We assessed the levels and trends in the fatal and non-fatal burden of tuberculosis by drug resistance and HIV status for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016.
Methods
We analysed 15 943 site-years of vital registration data, 1710 site-years of verbal autopsy data, 764 site-years of sample-based vital registration data, and 361 site-years of mortality surveillance data to estimate mortality due to tuberculosis using the Cause of Death Ensemble model. We analysed all available data sources, including annual case notifications, prevalence surveys, population-based tuberculin surveys, and estimated tuberculosis cause-specific mortality to generate internally consistent estimates of incidence, prevalence, and mortality using DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. We assessed how the burden of tuberculosis differed from the burden predicted by the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, average years of schooling, and total fertility rate.
Findings
Globally in 2016, among HIV-negative individuals, the number of incident cases of tuberculosis was 9·02 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 8·05–10·16) and the number of tuberculosis deaths was 1·21 million (1·16–1·27). Among HIV-positive individuals, the number of incident cases was 1·40 million (1·01–1·89) and the number of tuberculosis deaths was 0·24 million (0·16–0·31). Globally, among HIV-negative individuals the age-standardised incidence of tuberculosis decreased annually at a slower rate (–1·3% [–1·5 to −1·2]) than mortality did (–4·5% [–5·0 to −4·1]) from 2006 to 2016. Among HIV-positive individuals during the same period, the rate of change in annualised age-standardised incidence was −4·0% (–4·5 to −3·7) and mortality was −8·9% (–9·5 to −8·4). Several regions had higher rates of age-standardised incidence and mortality than expected on the basis of their SDI levels in 2016. For drug-susceptible tuberculosis, the highest observed-to-expected ratios were in southern sub-Saharan Africa (13·7 for incidence and 14·9 for mortality), and the lowest ratios were in high-income North America (0·4 for incidence) and Oceania (0·3 for mortality). For multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, eastern Europe had the highest observed-to-expected ratios (67·3 for incidence and 73·0 for mortality), and high-income North America had the lowest ratios (0·4 for incidence and 0·5 for mortality).
Interpretation
If current trends in tuberculosis incidence continue, few countries are likely to meet the SDG target to end the tuberculosis epidemic by 2030. Progress needs to be accelerated by improving the quality of and access to tuberculosis diagnosis and care, by developing new tools, scaling up interventions to prevent risk factors for tuberculosis, and integrating control programmes for tuberculosis and HIV.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Primaquine and methylene blue are gametocytocidal compounds that could prevent Plasmodium falciparum transmission to mosquitoes. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of primaquine and methylene blue in preventing human to mosquito transmission of P falciparum among glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-normal, gametocytaemic male participants.
Methods
This was a phase 2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial done at the Clinical Research Centre of the Malaria Research and Training Centre (MRTC) of the University of Bamako (Bamako, Mali). We enrolled male participants aged 5–50 years with asymptomatic P falciparum malaria. G6PD-normal participants with gametocytes detected by blood smear were randomised 1:1:1:1 in block sizes of eight, using a sealed-envelope design, to receive either sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine plus a single dose of 0·25 mg/kg primaquine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus 15 mg/kg per day methylene blue for 3 days. Laboratory staff, investigators, and insectary technicians were masked to the treatment group and gametocyte density of study participants. The study pharmacist and treating physician were not masked. Participants could request unmasking. The primary efficacy endpoint, analysed in all infected patients with at least one infectivity measure before and after treatment, was median within-person percentage change in mosquito infectivity 2 and 7 days after treatment, assessed by membrane feeding. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02831023.
Findings
Between June 27, 2016, and Nov 1, 2016, 80 participants were enrolled and assigned to the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine (n=20), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine plus primaquine (n=20), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (n=20), or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus methylene blue (n=20) groups. Among participants infectious at baseline (54 [68%] of 80), those in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine plus primaquine group (n=19) had a median 100% (IQR 100 to 100) within-person reduction in mosquito infectivity on day 2, a larger reduction than was noted with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine alone (n=12; −10·2%, IQR −143·9 to 56·6; p<0·0001). The dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus methylene blue (n=11) group had a median 100% (IQR 100 to 100) within-person reduction in mosquito infectivity on day 2, a larger reduction than was noted with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine alone (n=12; −6·0%, IQR −126·1 to 86·9; p<0·0001). Haemoglobin changes were similar between gametocytocidal arms and their respective controls. After exclusion of blue urine, adverse events were similar across all groups (59 [74%] of 80 participants had 162 adverse events overall, 145 [90%] of which were mild).
Interpretation
Adding a single dose of 0·25 mg/kg primaquine to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine or 3 days of 15 mg/kg per day methylene blue to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was highly efficacious for preventing P falciparum transmission. Both primaquine and methylene blue were well tolerated.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine expressing the Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) glycoprotein is efficacious in the weeks following single-dose injection, but duration of immunity is unknown. We aimed to assess antibody persistence at 1 and 2 years in volunteers who received single-dose rVSV-ZEBOV in three previous trials.
Methods
In this observational cohort study, we prospectively followed-up participants from the African and European phase 1 rVSV-ZEBOV trials, who were vaccinated once in 2014–15 with 300 000 (low dose) or 10–50 million (high dose) plaque-forming units (pfu) of rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine to assess ZEBOV glycoprotein (IgG) antibody persistence. The primary outcome was ZEBOV glycoprotein-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) measured yearly by ELISA compared with 1 month (ie, 28 days) after immunisation. We report GMCs up to 2 years (Geneva, Switzerland, including neutralising antibodies up to 6 months) and 1 year (Lambaréné, Gabon; Kilifi, Kenya) after vaccination and factors associated with higher antibody persistence beyond 6 months, according to multivariable analyses. Trials and the observational study were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Geneva: NCT02287480 and NCT02933931; Kilifi: NCT02296983) and the Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry (Lambaréné PACTR201411000919191).
Findings
Of 217 vaccinees from the original studies (102 from the Geneva study, 75 from the Lambaréné study, and 40 from the Kilifi study), 197 returned and provided samples at 1 year (95 from the Geneva study, 63 from the Lambaréné, and 39 from the Kilifi study) and 90 at 2 years (all from the Geneva study). In the Geneva group, 44 (100%) of 44 participants who had been given a high dose (ie, 10–50 million pfu) of vaccine and who were seropositive at day 28 remained seropositive at 2 years, whereas 33 (89%) of 37 who had been given the low dose (ie, 300 000 pfu) remained seropositive for 2 years (p=0·042). In participants who had received a high dose, ZEBOV glycoprotein IgG GMCs decreased significantly between their peak (at 1–3 months) and month 6 after vaccination in Geneva (p<0·0001) and Lambaréné (p=0·0298) but not in Kilifi (p=0·5833) and subsequently remained stable at all sites apart from Geneva, where GMC in those given a high dose of vaccine increased significantly between 6 months and 1 year (p=0·0264). Antibody persistence was similar at 1 year and at 6 months in those who had received a low dose of vaccine, with lower titres among participants from the Geneva study at 2 years than at 1 year after vaccination (GMC ratio 0·61, 95% CI 0·49–0·77; p<0·0001). In multivariable analyses, predictors of increased IgG GMCs beyond 6 months included high-dose versus low-dose vaccination (Geneva p=0·0133; Lambaréné p=0·008) and vaccine-related arthritis (p=0·0176), but not sex, age, or baseline seropositivity (all p>0·05). Neutralising antibodies seem to be less durable, with seropositivity dropping from 64–71% at 28 days to 27–31% at 6 months in participants from the Geneva study.
Interpretation
Antibody responses to single-dose rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination are sustained across dose ranges and settings, a key criterion in countries where booster vaccinations would be impractical.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antimalarial resistance is rapidly spreading across parts of southeast Asia where dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine is used as first-line treatment for Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The first published reports about resistance to antimalarial drugs came from western Cambodia in 2013. Here, we analyse genetic changes in the P falciparum population of western Cambodia in the 6 years before those reports.
Methods
We analysed genome sequence data on 1492 P falciparum samples from 11 locations across southeast Asia, including 464 samples collected in western Cambodia between 2007 and 2013. Different epidemiological origins of resistance were identified by haplotypic analysis of the kelch13 artemisinin resistance locus and the plasmepsin 2–3 piperaquine resistance locus.
Findings
We identified more than 30 independent origins of artemisinin resistance, of which the KEL1 lineage accounted for 140 (91%) of 154 parasites resistant to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. In 2008, KEL1 combined with PLA1, the major lineage associated with piperaquine resistance. By 2013, the KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage had reached a frequency of 63% (24/38) in western Cambodia and had spread to northern Cambodia.
Interpretation
The KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage emerged in the same year that dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine became the first-line antimalarial drug in western Cambodia and spread rapidly thereafter, displacing other artemisinin-resistant parasite lineages. These findings have important implications for management of the global health risk associated with the current outbreak of multidrug-resistant malaria in southeast Asia.

Background
Development of vaccines that are effective against all four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1–4) in all age groups is important. Here, we present 18-month interim data from an ongoing study undertaken to assess the immunogenicity and safety of Takeda's tetravalent dengue vaccine (TDV) candidate over 48 months in children living in dengue-endemic countries.
Methods
We undertook a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study at three sites in the Dominican Republic, Panama, and the Philippines. We randomly assigned children aged 2–17 years to receive either two TDV doses 3 months apart (group 1), one TDV dose (group 2), one TDV dose and a booster dose 1 year later (group 3), or placebo (group 4). We did the randomisation (1:2:5:1) using an interactive web response system stratified by age. The primary endpoint of this 18-month interim analysis was DENV serotype-specific antibody geometric mean titres (GMTs) in the per-protocol immunogenicity subset on days 1, 28, 91, 180, 365, 393, and 540. Secondary safety endpoints were the proportions of participants with serious adverse events and with virologically confirmed dengue in the safety set, and solicited and unsolicited adverse events in the immunogenicity subset. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02302066.
Findings
Between Dec 5, 2014, and Feb 13, 2015, 1800 children were randomly assigned to group 1 (n=201), group 2 (n=398), group 3 (n=1002), and group 4 (n=199). 1794 participants received at least one dose of TDV or placebo (safety set), of whom 562 participated in the immunogenicity subset and 509 were included in the per-protocol set. Antibody titres remained elevated 18 months after vaccination in all TDV groups. At day 540, in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, DENV-1 GMTs were 476 (95% CI 286–791), 461 (329–647), 1056 (804–1388), and 92 (49–173); DENV-2 GMTs were 1212 (842–1744), 1242 (947–1628), 1457 (1182–1796), and 177 (93–337); DENV-3 GMTs were 286 (171–478), 298 (205–433), 548 (411–730), and 78 (44–137); and DENV-4 GMTs were 98 (65–150), 102 (75–139), 172 (133–222), and 33 (21–52). Limited differences in GMTs were observed between groups 1 and 2 (in which participants received one and two doses of TDV, respectively). In baseline-seronegative participants, a 1-year booster clearly increased GMTs. Vaccine-related unsolicited adverse events occurred in 14 (2%) of 562 participants, but no vaccine-related serious adverse events arose. Symptomatic, virologically confirmed dengue was recorded in 21 (1·3%) of 1596 participants vaccinated with TDV compared with nine (4·5%) of 198 placebo recipients.
Interpretation
TDV was well tolerated and immunogenic against all four dengue serotypes, irrespective of baseline dengue serostatus. These data provide proof of concept for TDV and support the ongoing phase 3 efficacy assessment of two doses 3 months apart.

abstract = "Summary
Antibiotic resistance is a major global threat to the provision of safe and effective health care. To control antibiotic resistance, vaccines have been proposed as an essential intervention, complementing improvements in diagnostic testing, antibiotic stewardship, and drug pipelines. The decision to introduce or amend vaccination programmes is routinely based on mathematical modelling. However, few mathematical models address the impact of vaccination on antibiotic resistance. We reviewed the literature using PubMed to identify all studies that used an original mathematical model to quantify the impact of a vaccine on antibiotic resistance transmission within a human population. We reviewed the models from the resulting studies in the context of a new framework to elucidate the pathways through which vaccination might impact antibiotic resistance. We identified eight mathematical modelling studies; the state of the literature highlighted important gaps in our understanding. Notably, studies are limited in the range of pathways represented, their geographical scope, and the vaccine–pathogen combinations assessed. Furthermore, to translate model predictions into public health decision making, more work is needed to understand how model structure and parameterisation affects model predictions and how to embed these predictions within economic frameworks."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a substantial threat to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Due to its large public health and societal implications, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis has been long regarded by WHO as a global priority for investment in new drugs. In 2016, WHO was requested by member states to create a priority list of other antibiotic-resistant bacteria to support research and development of effective drugs.
Methods
We used a multicriteria decision analysis method to prioritise antibiotic-resistant bacteria; this method involved the identification of relevant criteria to assess priority against which each antibiotic-resistant bacterium was rated. The final priority ranking of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria was established after a preference-based survey was used to obtain expert weighting of criteria.
Findings
We selected 20 bacterial species with 25 patterns of acquired resistance and ten criteria to assess priority: mortality, health-care burden, community burden, prevalence of resistance, 10-year trend of resistance, transmissibility, preventability in the community setting, preventability in the health-care setting, treatability, and pipeline. We stratified the priority list into three tiers (critical, high, and medium priority), using the 33rd percentile of the bacterium's total scores as the cutoff. Critical-priority bacteria included carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and carbapenem-resistant and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The highest ranked Gram-positive bacteria (high priority) were vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Of the bacteria typically responsible for community-acquired infections, clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori, and fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter spp, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella typhi were included in the high-priority tier.
Interpretation
Future development strategies should focus on antibiotics that are active against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and Gram-negative bacteria. The global strategy should include antibiotic-resistant bacteria responsible for community-acquired infections such as Salmonella spp, Campylobacter spp, N gonorrhoeae, and H pylori.

Background
Increased rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been reported among men who have sex with men. We aimed to assess whether post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with doxycycline could reduce the incidence of STIs.
Methods
All participants attending their scheduled visit in the open-label extension of the ANRS IPERGAY trial in France (men aged 18 years or older having condomless sex with men and using pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine) were eligible for inclusion in this open-label randomised study. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) at a central site to take a single oral dose of 200 mg doxycycline PEP within 24 h after sex or no prophylaxis. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a first STI (gonorrhoea, chlamydia, or syphilis) during the 10-month follow-up. The cumulative probability of occurrence of the primary endpoint was estimated in each group with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. The primary efficacy analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population, comprising all randomised participants. All participants received risk-reduction counselling and condoms, and were tested regularly for HIV. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01473472.
Findings
Between July 20, 2015, and Jan 21, 2016, we randomly assigned 232 participants (n=116 in the doxycycline PEP group and n=116 in the no-PEP group) who were followed up for a median of 8·7 months (IQR 7·8–9·7). Participants in the PEP group used a median of 680 mg doxycycline per month (IQR 280–1450). 73 participants presented with a new STI during follow-up, 28 in the PEP group (9-month probability 22%, 95% CI 15–32) and 45 in the no-PEP group (42%, 33–53; log-rank test p=0·007). The occurrence of a first STI in participants taking PEP was lower than in those not taking PEP (hazard ratio [HR] 0·53; 95% CI 0·33–0·85; p=0·008). Similar results were observed for the occurrence of a first episode of chlamydia (HR 0·30; 95% CI 0·13–0·70; p=0·006) and of syphilis (0·27; 0·07–0·98; p=0·047); for a first episode of gonorrhoea the results did not differ significantly (HR 0·83; 0·47–1·47; p=0·52). No HIV seroconversion was observed, and 72 (71%) of all 102 STIs were asymptomatic. Rates of serious adverse events were similar in the two study groups. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported in 62 (53%) participants in the PEP group and 47 (41%) in the no-PEP group (p=0·05).
Interpretation
Doxycycline PEP reduced the occurrence of a first episode of bacterial STI in high-risk men who have sex with men.

abstract = "Summary
Inpatient management is necessary in many situations, but medical and allied-health treatments are increasingly being used on an outpatient basis to allow patients who would traditionally have been admitted to hospital to remain at home. Home-based clinical management has many potential benefits, including reduced hospital-acquired infections, cost savings, and patient and family satisfaction. Studies in adults provide evidence for the benefits of home-based versus hospital-based intravenous antibiotics, but few studies inform practice in home-based intravenous antibiotic therapy for children. We systematically reviewed the efficacy, safety, satisfaction, and cost of home-based versus hospital-based intravenous antibiotic therapy for acute infections in children. We searched MEDLINE (from Jan 1, 1946, to Jan 31, 2017) and Embase (from Jan 1, 1974, to Jan 31, 2017) for studies investigating home-based and hospital-based intravenous antibiotic therapy and assessed them for quality. 2827 articles were identified and 19 studies were included in the systematic review. Efficacy results differed between studies depending on the outcome assessed. The incidence of complications and readmission to hospital was similar for hospital-based and home-based treatments. In seven (47%) of 15 studies, patients who had all or part of their treatment at home received treatment for longer than patients who were treated entirely in hospital. No studies showed that home-based treatment was less safe than hospital-based treatment. In all studies in which treatment satisfaction or costs were assessed, home-based treatment was satisfactory to patients or patients' families and less expensive per episode than hospital-based treatment by 30–75%. Thus, home-based intravenous antibiotic therapy might be popular and cost-effective, but randomised studies of the efficacy of this strategy are needed. This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (number CRD42015024406)."

In 2006, WHO set forth its vision for a public health approach to delivering antiretroviral therapy. This approach has been broadly adopted in resource-poor settings and has provided the foundation for scaling up treatment to over 19·5 million people. There is a global commitment to end the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030 and, to support this goal, there are opportunities to adapt the public health approach to meet the ensuing challenges. These challenges include the need to improve identification of people with HIV infection through expanded approaches to testing; further simplify and improve treatment and laboratory monitoring; adapt the public health approach to concentrated epidemics; and link HIV testing, treatment, and care to HIV prevention. Implementation of these key public health principles will bring countries closer to the goals of controlling the HIV epidemic and providing universal health coverage."

Background
Pretreatment drug resistance in people initiating or re-initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) might compromise HIV control in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to assess the scale of this problem and whether it is associated with the intiation or re-initiation of ART in people who have had previous exposure to antiretroviral drugs.
Methods
This study was a systematic review and meta-regression analysis. We assessed regional prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance and risk of pretreatment drug resistance in people initiating ART who reported previous ART exposure. We systematically screened publications and unpublished datasets for pretreatment drug-resistance data in individuals in LMICs initiating or re-initiating first-line ART from LMICs. We searched for studies in PubMed and Embase and conference abstracts and presentations from the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, the International AIDS Society Conference, and the International Drug Resistance Workshop for the period Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2016. To assess the prevalence of drug resistance within a specified region at any specific timepoint, we extracted study level data and pooled prevalence estimates within the region using an empty logistic regression model with a random effect at the study level. We used random effects meta-regression to relate sampling year to prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance within geographical regions.
Findings
We identified 358 datasets that contributed data to our analyses, representing 56 044 adults in 63 countries. Prevalence estimates of pretreatment NNRTI resistance in 2016 were 11·0% (7·5–15·9) in southern Africa, 10·1% (5·1–19·4) in eastern Africa, 7·2% (2·9–16·5) in western and central Africa, and 9·4% (6·6–13·2) in Latin America and the Caribbean. There were substantial increases in pretreatment NNRTI resistance per year in all regions. The yearly increases in the odds of pretreatment drug resistance were 23% (95% CI 16–29) in southern Africa, 17% (5–30) in eastern Africa, 17% (6–29) in western and central Africa, 11% (5–18) in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 11% (2–20) in Asia. Estimated increases in the absolute prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance between 2015 and 2016 ranged from 0·3% in Asia to 1·8% in southern Africa.
Interpretation
Pretreatment drug resistance is increasing at substantial rate in LMICs, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2016, the prevalence of pretreatment NNRTI resistance was near WHO's 10% threshold for changing first-line ART in southern and eastern Africa and Latin America, underscoring the need for routine national HIV drug-resistance surveillance and review of national policies for first-line ART regimen composition.

Evidence-based guidance for national infection prevention and control (IPC) programmes is needed to support national and global capacity building to reduce health-care-associated infection and antimicrobial resistance. In this systematic review we investigate evidence on the effectiveness of IPC interventions implemented at national or subnational levels to inform the development of WHO guidelines on the core components of national IPC programmes. We searched CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and WHO IRIS databases for publications between Jan 1, 2000, and April 19, 2017. 29 studies that met the eligibility criteria (ie, economic evaluations, cluster-randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time-series studies exploring the effective of these interventions) were categorised according to intervention type: multimodal, care bundles, policies, and surveillance, monitoring, and feedback. Evidence of effectiveness was found in all categories but the best quality evidence was on multimodal interventions and surveillance, monitoring, and feedback. We call for improvements in study design, reporting of research, and quality of evidence particularly from low-income countries, to strengthen the uptake and international relevance of IPC interventions."

Microcephaly is an important sign of neurological malformation and a predictor of future disability. The 2015–16 outbreak of Zika virus and congenital Zika infection brought the world's attention to links between Zika infection and microcephaly. However, Zika virus is only one of the infectious causes of microcephaly and, although the contexts in which they occur vary greatly, all are of concern. In this Review, we summarise important aspects of major congenital infections that can cause microcephaly, and describe the epidemiology, transmission, clinical features, pathogenesis, management, and long-term consequences of these infections. We include infections that cause substantial impairment: cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, rubella virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Zika virus. We highlight potential issues with classification of microcephaly and show how some infants affected by congenital infection might be missed or incorrectly diagnosed. Although Zika virus has brought the attention of the world to the problem of microcephaly, prevention of all infectious causes of microcephaly and appropriately managing its consequences remain important global public health priorities."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In the UK, HIV incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM) has remained high for several years, despite widespread use of antiretroviral therapy and high rates of virological suppression. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be highly effective in preventing further infections in MSM, but its cost-effectiveness is uncertain.
Methods
In this modelling study and economic evaluation, we calibrated a dynamic, individual-based stochastic model, the HIV Synthesis Model, to multiple data sources (surveillance data provided by Public Health England and data from a large, nationally representative survey, Natsal-3) on HIV among MSM in the UK. We did a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (sampling 22 key parameters) along with a range of univariate sensitivity analyses to evaluate the introduction of a PrEP programme with sexual event-based use of emtricitabine and tenofovir for MSM who had condomless anal sexual intercourse in the previous 3 months, a negative HIV test at baseline, and a negative HIV test in the preceding year. The main model outcomes were the number of HIV infections, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs.
Findings
Introduction of such a PrEP programme, with around 4000 MSM initiated on PrEP by the end of the first year and almost 40 000 by the end of the 15th year, would result in a total cost saving (£1·0 billion discounted), avert 25% of HIV infections (42% of which would be directly because of PrEP), and lead to a gain of 40 000 discounted QALYs over an 80-year time horizon. This result was particularly sensitive to the time horizon chosen, the cost of antiretroviral drugs (for treatment and PrEP), and the underlying trend in condomless sex.
Interpretation
This analysis suggests that the introduction of a PrEP programme for MSM in the UK is cost-effective and possibly cost-saving in the long term. A reduction in the cost of antiretroviral drugs (including the drugs used for PrEP) would substantially shorten the time for cost savings to be realised.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In February, 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the blood infection marker procalcitonin for guiding antibiotic therapy in patients with acute respiratory infections. This meta-analysis of patient data from 26 randomised controlled trials was designed to assess safety of procalcitonin-guided treatment in patients with acute respiratory infections from different clinical settings.
Methods
Based on a prespecified Cochrane protocol, we did a systematic literature search on the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase, and pooled individual patient data from trials in which patients with respiratory infections were randomly assigned to receive antibiotics based on procalcitonin concentrations (procalcitonin-guided group) or control. The coprimary endpoints were 30-day mortality and setting-specific treatment failure. Secondary endpoints were antibiotic use, length of stay, and antibiotic side-effects.
Findings
We identified 990 records from the literature search, of which 71 articles were assessed for eligibility after exclusion of 919 records. We collected data on 6708 patients from 26 eligible trials in 12 countries. Mortality at 30 days was significantly lower in procalcitonin-guided patients than in control patients (286 [9%] deaths in 3336 procalcitonin-guided patients vs 336 [10%] in 3372 controls; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0·83 [95% CI 0·70 to 0·99], p=0·037). This mortality benefit was similar across subgroups by setting and type of infection (pinteractions>0·05), although mortality was very low in primary care and in patients with acute bronchitis. Procalcitonin guidance was also associated with a 2·4-day reduction in antibiotic exposure (5·7 vs 8·1 days [95% CI −2·71 to −2·15], p<0·0001) and a reduction in antibiotic-related side-effects (16% vs 22%, adjusted OR 0·68 [95% CI 0·57 to 0·82], p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Use of procalcitonin to guide antibiotic treatment in patients with acute respiratory infections reduces antibiotic exposure and side-effects, and improves survival. Widespread implementation of procalcitonin protocols in patients with acute respiratory infections thus has the potential to improve antibiotic management with positive effects on clinical outcomes and on the current threat of increasing antibiotic multiresistance.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a severe respiratory illness with an overall mortality of 35%. There is no licensed or proven treatment. Passive immunotherapy approaches are being developed to prevent and treat several human medical conditions where alternative therapeutic options are absent. We report the safety of a fully human polyclonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) produced from the hyperimmune plasma of transchromosomic cattle immunised with a MERS coronavirus vaccine.
Methods
We did a phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation trial at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. We recruited healthy participants aged 18–60 years who had normal laboratory parameters at enrolment, a body-mass index of 19–32 kg/m2, and a creatinine clearance of 70 mL/min or more, and who did not have any chronic medical problems that required daily oral medications, a positive rheumatoid factor (≥15 IU/mL), IgA deficiency (<7 mg/dL), or history of allergy to intravenous immunoglobulin or human blood products. Participants were randomly assigned by a computer-generated table, made by a masked pharmacist, to one of six cohorts (containing between three and ten participants each). Cohorts 1 and 2 had three participants, randomly assigned 2:1 to receive active drug SAB-301 versus normal saline placebo; cohorts 3 and 4 had six participants randomised 2:1; and cohorts 5 and 6 had ten participants, randomised 4:1. Participants received 1 mg/kg, 2·5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg of SAB-301, or equivalent volume placebo (saline control), on day 0, and were followed up by clinical, laboratory, and pharmacokinetic assessments on days 1, 3, 7, 21, 42, and 90. The primary outcome was safety, and immunogenicity was a secondary outcome. We analysed the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02788188.
Findings
Between June 2, 2016, and Jan 4, 2017, we screened 43 participants, of whom 38 were eligible and randomly assigned to receive SAB-301 (n=28) or placebo (n=10). 97 adverse events were reported: 64 adverse events occurred in 23 (82%) of 28 participants receiving SAB-301 (mean 2·3 adverse events per participant). 33 adverse events occurred in all ten participants receiving placebo (mean 3·3 adverse events per participant). The most common adverse events were headache (n=6 [21%] in participants who received SAB-301 and n=2 [20%] in those receiving placebo), albuminuria (n=5 [18%] vs n=2 [20%]), myalgia (n=3 [11%] vs n=1 [10%]), increased creatine kinase (n=3 [11%] vs 1 [10%]), and common cold (n=3 [11%] vs n=2 [20%]). There was one serious adverse event (hospital admission for suicide attempt) in one participant who received 50 mg/kg of SAB-301. The area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) in the 50 mg/kg dose (27 498 μg × days per mL) is comparable to the AUC that was associated with efficacy in a preclinical model.
Interpretation
Single infusions of SAB-301 up to 50 mg/kg appear to be safe and well tolerated in healthy participants. Human immunoglobulin derived from transchromosomic cattle could offer a new platform technology to produce fully human polyclonal IgG antibodies for other medical conditions.

abstract = "Summary
Background
A Zika virus epidemic emerged in northeast Brazil in 2015 and was followed by a striking increase in congenital microcephaly cases, triggering a declaration of an international public health emergency. This is the final report of the first case-control study evaluating the potential causes of microcephaly: congenital Zika virus infection, vaccines, and larvicides. The published preliminary report suggested a strong association between microcephaly and congenital Zika virus infection.
Methods
We did a case-control study in eight public maternity hospitals in Recife, Brazil. Cases were neonates born with microcephaly, defined as a head circumference of 2 SD below the mean. Two controls without microcephaly were matched to each case by expected date of delivery and area of residence. We tested the serum of cases and controls and the CSF of cases for detection of Zika virus genomes with quantitative RT-PCR and for detection of IgM antibodies with capture-IgM ELISA. We also tested maternal serum with plaque reduction neutralisation assays for Zika and dengue viruses. We estimated matched crude and adjusted odds ratios with exact conditional logistic regression to determine the association between microcephaly and Zika virus infection.
Findings
We screened neonates born between Jan 15 and Nov 30, 2016, and prospectively recruited 91 cases and 173 controls. In 32 (35%) cases, congenital Zika virus infection was confirmed by laboratory tests and no controls had confirmed Zika virus infections. 69 (83%) of 83 cases with known birthweight were small for gestational age, compared with eight (5%) of 173 controls. The overall matched odds ratio was 73·1 (95% CI 13·0–∞) for microcephaly and Zika virus infection after adjustments. Neither vaccination during pregnancy or use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen was associated with microcephaly. Results of laboratory tests for Zika virus and brain imaging results were available for 79 (87%) cases; within these cases, ten were positive for Zika virus and had cerebral abnormalities, 13 were positive for Zika infection but had no cerebral abnormalities, and 11 were negative for Zika virus but had cerebral abnormalities.
Interpretation
The association between microcephaly and congenital Zika virus infection was confirmed. We provide evidence of the absence of an effect of other potential factors, such as exposure to pyriproxyfen or vaccines (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis, measles and rubella, or measles, mumps, and rubella) during pregnancy, confirming the findings of an ecological study of pyriproxyfen in Pernambuco and previous studies on the safety of Tdap vaccine administration during pregnancy.

abstract = "Summary
Alveolar echinococcosis caused by Echinococcus multilocularis is an infrequent zoonosis with a high degree of disability, morbidity, and mortality, especially in disease clusters of the northern hemisphere. The diagnosis is complicated by extended incubation time, diverse clinical manifestations, and mimicking of differential diagnoses. The primary organ affected is the liver, but extrahepatic disease is possible, with vertebral involvement in only a few dozen cases described worldwide. Although vertebral alveolar echinococcosis seems to be rare, it might be under diagnosed, and it might be seen more often as the number of people with immunocompromised conditions increases. Recognition of this syndrome is crucial, because advances in medical and surgical management strategies since the introduction of benzimidazole in 1976 have controlled and relieved symptoms in most cases. In this Grand Round, we present the case of a 75-year-old woman who was referred for biopsy of a lumbar lesion 3 months after she was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia. The diagnosis of hepatic alveolar echinococcosis with metastasis to the lumbar spine and paravertebral region as well as the brain was confirmed by biopsy, PCR, and serology. The patient was given albendazole and referred for palliative surgery with the aim of pain control. Clinical features of the case are presented and discussed in the context of the literature. This case and review illustrate the complexity of extrahepatic alveolar echinococcosis manifestations and the necessity of an interdisciplinary approach."

Antimicrobial resistance is an important threat to international health. Therapeutic guidelines for empirical treatment of common life-threatening infections depend on available information regarding microbial aetiology and antimicrobial susceptibility, but sub-Saharan Africa lacks diagnostic capacity and antimicrobial resistance surveillance. We systematically reviewed studies of antimicrobial resistance among children in sub-Saharan Africa since 2005. 18 of 1075 articles reviewed met inclusion criteria, providing data from 67 451 invasive bacterial isolates from inconsistently defined populations in predominantly urban tertiary settings. Among neonates, Gram-negative organisms were the predominant cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis, with a high prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms. Gram-positive bacteria were responsible for a high proportion of infections among children beyond the neon atal period, with high reported prevalence of non-susceptibility to treatment advocated by the WHO therapeutic guidelines. There are few up-to-date or representative studies given the magnitude of the problem of antimicrobial resistance, especially regarding community-acquired infections. Research should focus on differentiating resistance in community-acquired versus hospital-acquired infections, implementation of standardised reporting systems, and pragmatic clinical trials to assess the efficacy of alternative treatment regimens."

Tuberculosis is an ancient human disease, estimated to have originated and evolved over thousands of years alongside modern human populations. Despite considerable advances in disease control, tuberculosis remains one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases with 10 million incident cases and 1·8 million deaths in 2015 alone based on the annual WHO report, due to inadequate health service resources in less-developed regions of the world, and exacerbated by the HIV/AIDS pandemic and emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Recent findings from studies of tuberculosis infection and of patients with Mendelian predisposition to severe tuberculosis have started to reveal human loci influencing tuberculosis outcomes. In this Review, we assess the current understanding of the contribution of host genetics to disease susceptibility and to drug treatment. Despite remarkable progress in technology, only a few associated genetic variants have so far been identified, strongly indicating the need for larger global studies that investigate both common and under-represented rare variants to develop new approaches to combat the disease. Pharmacogenomic discoveries are also likely to lead to more efficient drug design and development, and ultimately safer and more effective therapies for tuberculosis."

In 1796, Edward Jenner developed the smallpox vaccine consisting of pustular material obtained from lesions on cows affected by so-called cow-pox. The disease, caused by cowpox virus, confers crossprotection against smallpox. However, historical evidence suggests that Jenner might have used vaccinia virus or even horsepox virus instead of cowpox virus. Mysteries surrounding the origin and nature of the smallpox vaccine persisted during the 19th century, a period of intense exchange of vaccine strains, including the Beaugency lymph. This lymph was obtained from spontaneous cases of cow-pox in France in 1866 and then distributed worldwide. A detailed Historical Review of the distribution of the Beaugency lymph supports recent genetic analyses of extant vaccine strains, suggesting the lymph was probably a vaccinia strain or a horsepox-like virus. This Review is a historical investigation that revisits the mysteries of the smallpox vaccine and reveals an intricate evolutionary relationship of extant vaccinia strains."

abstract = "Summary
Background
An understanding of the trends in tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality is crucial to tracking of the success of tuberculosis control programmes and identification of remaining challenges. We assessed trends in the fatal and non-fatal burden of tuberculosis over the past 25 years for 195 countries and territories.
Methods
We analysed 10 691 site-years of vital registration data, 768 site-years of verbal autopsy data, and 361 site-years of mortality surveillance data using the Cause of Death Ensemble model to estimate tuberculosis mortality rates. We analysed all available age-specific and sex-specific data sources, including annual case notifications, prevalence surveys, and estimated cause-specific mortality, to generate internally consistent estimates of incidence, prevalence, and mortality using DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. We assessed how observed tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality differed from expected trends as predicted by the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator based on income per capita, average years of schooling, and total fertility rate. We also estimated tuberculosis mortality and disability-adjusted life-years attributable to the independent effects of risk factors including smoking, alcohol use, and diabetes.
Findings
Globally, in 2015, the number of tuberculosis incident cases (including new and relapse cases) was 10·2 million (95% uncertainty interval 9·2 million to 11·5 million), the number of prevalent cases was 10·1 million (9·2 million to 11·1 million), and the number of deaths was 1·3 million (1·1 million to 1·6 million). Among individuals who were HIV negative, the number of incident cases was 8·8 million (8·0 million to 9·9 million), the number of prevalent cases was 8·9 million (8·1 million to 9·7 million), and the number of deaths was 1·1 million (0·9 million to 1·4 million). Annualised rates of change from 2005 to 2015 showed a faster decline in mortality (−4·1% [−5·0 to −3·4]) than in incidence (−1·6% [−1·9 to −1·2]) and prevalence (−0·7% [−1·0 to −0·5]) among HIV-negative individuals. The SDI was inversely associated with HIV-negative mortality rates but did not show a clear gradient for incidence and prevalence. Most of Asia, eastern Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa had higher rates of HIV-negative tuberculosis burden than expected given their SDI. Alcohol use accounted for 11·4% (9·3–13·0) of global tuberculosis deaths among HIV-negative individuals in 2015, diabetes accounted for 10·6% (6·8–14·8), and smoking accounted for 7·8% (3·8–12·0).
Interpretation
Despite a concerted global effort to reduce the burden of tuberculosis, it still causes a large disease burden globally. Strengthening of health systems for early detection of tuberculosis and improvement of the quality of tuberculosis care, including prompt and accurate diagnosis, early initiation of treatment, and regular follow-up, are priorities. Countries with higher than expected tuberculosis rates for their level of sociodemographic development should investigate the reasons for lagging behind and take remedial action. Efforts to prevent smoking, alcohol use, and diabetes could also substantially reduce the burden of tuberculosis.

abstract = "Summary
Antimicrobial resistance poses a growing threat to public health and the provision of health care. Its surveillance should provide up-to-date and relevant information to monitor the appropriateness of therapy guidelines, antibiotic formulary, antibiotic stewardship programmes, public health interventions, infection control policies, and antimicrobial development. In Europe, although the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network provides annual reports on monitored resistant bacteria, national surveillance efforts are still fragmented and heterogeneous, and have substantial structural problems and issues with laboratory data. Most incidence and prevalence data cannot be linked with relevant epidemiological, clinical, or outcome data. Genetic typing, to establish whether trends of antimicrobial resistance are caused by spread of resistant strains or by transfer of resistance determinants among different strains and species, is not routinely done. Furthermore, laboratory-based surveillance using only clinical samples is not likely to be useful as an early warning system for emerging pathogens and resistance mechanisms. Insufficient coordination of surveillance systems of human antimicrobial resistance with animal surveillance systems is even more concerning. Because results from food surveillance are considered commercially sensitive, they are rarely released publicly by regulators. Inaccurate or incomplete surveillance data delay a translational approach to the threat of antimicrobial resistance and inhibit the identification of relevant target microorganisms and populations for research and the revitalisation of dormant drug-discovery programmes. High-quality, comprehensive, and real-time surveillance data are essential to reduce the burden of antimicrobial resistance. Improvement of national antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems and better alignment between human and veterinary surveillance systems in Europe must become a scientific and political priority, coordinated with international stakeholders within a global approach to reduce the burden of antimicrobial resistance."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is an automated molecular test that has improved the detection of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance, but its sensitivity is inadequate in patients with paucibacillary disease or HIV. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) was developed to overcome this limitation. We compared the diagnostic performance of Xpert Ultra with that of Xpert for detection of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance.
Methods
In this prospective, multicentre, diagnostic accuracy study, we recruited adults with pulmonary tuberculosis symptoms presenting at primary health-care centres and hospitals in eight countries (South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, India, China, Georgia, Belarus, and Brazil). Participants were allocated to the case detection group if no drugs had been taken for tuberculosis in the past 6 months or to the multidrug-resistance risk group if drugs for tuberculosis had been taken in the past 6 months, but drug resistance was suspected. Demographic information, medical history, chest imaging results, and HIV test results were recorded at enrolment, and each participant gave at least three sputum specimen on 2 separate days. Xpert and Xpert Ultra diagnostic performance in the same sputum specimen was compared with culture tests and drug susceptibility testing as reference standards. The primary objectives were to estimate and compare the sensitivity of Xpert Ultra test with that of Xpert for detection of smear-negative tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance and to estimate and compare Xpert Ultra and Xpert specificities for detection of rifampicin resistance. Study participants in the case detection group were included in all analyses, whereas participants in the multidrug-resistance risk group were only included in analyses of rifampicin-resistance detection.
Findings
Between Feb 18, and Dec 24, 2016, we enrolled 2368 participants for sputum sampling. 248 participants were excluded from the analysis, and 1753 participants were distributed to the case detection group (n=1439) and the multidrug-resistance risk group (n=314). Sensitivities of Xpert Ultra and Xpert were 63% and 46%, respectively, for the 137 participants with smear-negative and culture-positive sputum (difference of 17%, 95% CI 10 to 24); 90% and 77%, respectively, for the 115 HIV-positive participants with culture-positive sputum (13%, 6·4 to 21); and 88% and 83%, respectively, across all 462 participants with culture-positive sputum (5·4%, 3·3 to 8·0). Specificities of Xpert Ultra and Xpert for case detection were 96% and 98% (−2·7%, −3·9 to −1·7) overall, and 93% and 98% for patients with a history of tuberculosis. Xpert Ultra and Xpert performed similarly in detecting rifampicin resistance.
Interpretation
For tuberculosis case detection, sensitivity of Xpert Ultra was superior to that of Xpert in patients with paucibacillary disease and in patients with HIV. However, this increase in sensitivity came at the expense of a decrease in specificity.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Ampicillin, the first semi-synthetic penicillin active against Enterobacteriaceae, was released onto the market in 1961. The first outbreaks of disease caused by ampicillin-resistant strains of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium were identified in the UK in 1962 and 1964. We aimed to date the emergence of this resistance in historical isolates of S enterica serotype Typhimurium.
Methods
In this retrospective, whole-genome sequencing study, we analysed 288 S enterica serotype Typhimurium isolates collected between 1911 and 1969 from 31 countries on four continents and from various sources including human beings, animals, feed, and food. All isolates were tested for antimicrobial drug susceptibility with the disc diffusion method, and isolates shown to be resistant to ampicillin underwent resistance-transfer experiments. To provide insights into population structure and mechanisms of ampicillin resistance, we did whole-genome sequencing on a subset of 225 isolates, selected to maximise source, spatiotemporal, and genetic diversity.
Findings
11 (4%) of 288 isolates were resistant to ampicillin because of acquisition of various β lactamase genes, including blaTEM-1, carried by various plasmids, including the virulence plasmid of S enterica serotype Typhimurium. These 11 isolates were from three phylogenomic groups. One isolate producing TEM-1 β lactamase was isolated in France in 1959 and two isolates producing TEM-1 β lactamase were isolated in Tunisia in 1960, before ampicillin went on sale. The vectors for ampicillin resistance were different from those reported in the strains responsible for the outbreaks in the UK in the 1960s.
Interpretation
The association between antibiotic use and selection of resistance determinants is not as direct as often presumed. Our results suggest that the non-clinical use of narrow-spectrum penicillins (eg, benzylpenicillin) might have favoured the diffusion of plasmids carrying the blaTEM-1 gene in S enterica serotype Typhimurium in the late 1950s.

Background
Praziquantel is the only option for treatment of the liver fluke infection Opisthorchis viverrini. Tribendimidine could be an alternative drug. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a single, oral dose of tribendimidine, compared with praziquantel administered in two doses, in participants with O viverrini infection.
Method
We did an open-label, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 2 trial in children (8–14 years) and adolescents and adults (≥15 years) in Champasack province, southern Laos. Participants infected with O viverrini were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated block-randomisation procedure (block sizes of two, four, and six), to receive a single, oral dose of tribendimidine (200 mg for children, 400 mg for adolescents and adults) or two oral doses of praziquantel (50 mg/kg bodyweight and 25 mg/kg bodyweight, 6 h apart). Physicians assessing adverse events and laboratory personnel were masked to treatment allocation, but the investigators administering treatment and the participants could have recognised the treatment group based on differences in the number, appearance, and odour of the tablets. The primary outcomes were cure rate, defined as no parasite eggs in stool at 3 weeks' follow-up, and egg reduction rate. We did available-case analysis of all participants with primary endpoint data. The non-inferiority margin for the difference in cure rates between the groups was pre-specified as −3 percentage points. Adverse events were monitored at 3 h and 24 h after treatment. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN96948551.
Findings
Between Feb 1, and April 30, 2014, we assigned 607 participants with confirmed O viverrini infection to receive tribendimidine (n=300) or praziquantel (n=307). 11 participants (five in the tribendimidine group and six in the praziquantel group) did not provide stool samples at 3 weeks' follow-up and were excluded from the available-case analysis. 276 (93·6%) of 295 participants in the tribendimidine group were cured compared with 293 (97·3%) of 301 participants in the praziquantel group. The difference in cure rates between the two groups was −3·8 percentage points (95% CI −7·1 to −0·4), thus the lower limit of the confidence interval exceeded the non-inferiority margin. In both treatment groups, egg reduction rates were 99·9%. Adverse events were of mild and moderate intensity and were more frequent in the praziquantel group than in the tribendimidine group (odds ratio 4·5, 95% CI 3·2–6·3; p<0·0001). The most frequent adverse events were headache, vertigo, nausea, and fatigue.
Interpretation
Tribendimidine has a slightly lower cure rate than praziquantel and non-inferiority was not shown. However, tribendimidine has a similar egg reduction rate to praziquantel and leads to fewer adverse events and thus might complement praziquantel in O viverrini control programmes, particularly in settings co-endemic for hookworm.

The Zika virus crisis exemplified the risk associated with emerging pathogens and was a reminder that preparedness for the worst-case scenario, although challenging, is needed. Herein, we review all data reported during the unexpected emergence of Zika virus in French Polynesia in late 2013. We focus on the new findings reported during this outbreak, especially the first description of severe neurological complications in adults and the retrospective description of CNS malformations in neonates, the isolation of Zika virus in semen, the potential for blood-transfusion transmission, mother-to-child transmission, and the development of new diagnostic assays. We describe the effect of this outbreak on health systems, the implementation of vector-borne control strategies, and the line of communication used to alert the international community of the new risk associated with Zika virus. This outbreak highlighted the need for careful monitoring of all unexpected events that occur during an emergence, to implement surveillance and research programmes in parallel to management of cases, and to be prepared to the worst-case scenario."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Increasing evidence shows that protection induced by acellular pertussis vaccines is short-lived, requiring repeated booster vaccination to control pertussis disease. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant acellular pertussis vaccine containing genetically inactivated pertussis toxin and filamentous haemagglutinin, as either a monovalent vaccine (aP[PTgen/FHA]) or in combination with tetanus and reduced-dose diphtheria vaccines (TdaP[PTgen/FHA]), versus a licensed tetanus and reduced-dose diphtheria and acellular pertussis combination vaccine (Tdap).
Methods
We did this phase 2/3, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial at two sites in Bangkok, Thailand. Healthy adolescents (aged 12–17 years) were randomly assigned (1:1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation list with block sizes of three, to receive one dose (0·5 mL) of aP(PTgen/FHA), TdaP(PTgen/FHA), or Tdap (comparator). Clinical research staff responsible for participant randomisation, vaccine preparation and administration, and accountability were aware of group allocation. However, allocation was concealed from all other site study staff, data management personnel, statisticians, laboratory staff, and study participants. The primary outcome was non-inferior immunogenicity of TdaP(PTgen/FHA) to Tdap based on seroconversion rates (a four-fold increase or more) for pertussis toxin and filamentous haemagglutinin IgG antibodies 28 days after vaccination, with a predefined 10% margin of equivalence. We did analysis by per protocol. This study is registered with the Thai Clinical Trial Registry, number TCTR20150703002.
Findings
Between July 6 and Aug 20, 2015, we allocated 450 participants to receive one dose of TdaP(PTgen/FHA) (n=150), aP(PTgen/FHA) (n=150), or comparator Tdap (n=150). 28 days after vaccination, seroconversion rates for anti-pertussis toxin IgG were 96·6% (95% CI 93·8–99·5; n=144) in the TdaP(PTgen/FHA) group and 55·0% (47·1–63·0; n=82) in the comparator Tdap group (difference 41·6%, 95% CI 33·1–50·1; p<0·0001). Seroconversion rates for anti-filamentous haemagglutinin were 82·6% (95% CI 76·5–88·6; n=123) in the TdaP(PTgen/FHA) group and 54·4% (46·4–62·4; n=81) in the comparator group (difference 28·2%, 95% CI 18·1–38·2 p<0·0001). 28 days after vaccination, seroconversion rates in the aP(PTgen/FHA) group were 96·0% (95% CI 92·8–99·1; n=142) for anti-pertussis toxin IgG and 93·2% (89·2–97·3; n=138) for anti-filamentous haemagglutinin IgG. These findings support the non-inferior immunogenicity of TdaP(PTgen/FHA) over comparator Tdap. Reactogenicity and incidence of adverse events were similar between groups.
Interpretation
The new TdaP(PTgen/FHA) vaccine is safe and induces higher pertussis responses 28 days after vaccination than does the available licensed Tdap booster vaccine. Results of our trial led to the licensure of new acellular pertussis vaccines containing genetically inactivated pertussis toxin in Thailand. The availability of recombinant monovalent pertussis vaccines that induce high antibody responses provides the medical community and consumers with the opportunity to vaccinate against pertussis when immunisation against diphtheria and tetanus is not required or not desired. Studies are underway to pave the way for licensure studies of this acellular pertussis vaccine in other countries.

abstract = "Summary
Background
WHO recommends Xpert MTB/RIF as initial diagnostic testing for tuberculous meningitis. However, diagnosis remains difficult, with Xpert sensitivity of about 50–70% and culture sensitivity of about 60%. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of the new Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) for tuberculous meningitis.
Methods
We prospectively obtained diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens during screening for a trial on the treatment of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis in Mbarara, Uganda. HIV-infected adults with suspected meningitis (eg, headache, nuchal rigidity, altered mental status) were screened consecutively at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital. We centrifuged CSF, resuspended the pellet in 2 mL of CSF, and tested 0·5 mL with mycobacteria growth indicator tube culture, 1 mL with Xpert, and cryopreserved 0·5 mL, later tested with Xpert Ultra. We assessed diagnostic performance against uniform clinical case definition or a composite reference standard of any positive CSF tuberculous test.
Findings
From Feb 27, 2015, to Nov 7, 2016, we prospectively evaluated 129 HIV-infected adults with suspected meningitis for tuberculosis. 23 participants were classified as probable or definite tuberculous meningitis by uniform case definition, excluding Xpert Ultra results. Xpert Ultra sensitivity was 70% (95% CI 47–87; 16 of 23 cases) for probable or definite tuberculous meningitis compared with 43% (23–66; 10/23) for Xpert and 43% (23–66; 10/23) for culture. With composite standard, we detected tuberculous meningitis in 22 (17%) of 129 participants. Xpert Ultra had 95% sensitivity (95% CI 77–99; 21 of 22 cases) for tuberculous meningitis, which was higher than either Xpert (45% [24–68]; 10/22; p=0·0010) or culture (45% [24–68]; 10/22; p=0·0034). Of 21 participants positive by Xpert Ultra, 13 were positive by culture, Xpert, or both, and eight were only positive by Xpert Ultra. Of those eight, three were categorised as probable tuberculous meningitis, three as possible tuberculous meningitis, and two as not tuberculous meningitis. Testing 6 mL or more of CSF was associated with more frequent detection of tuberculosis than with less than 6 mL (26% vs 7%; p=0·014).
Interpretation
Xpert Ultra detected significantly more tuberculous meningitis than did either Xpert or culture. WHO now recommends the use of Xpert Ultra as the initial diagnostic test for suspected tuberculous meningitis.

Infections during the first 1000 days—the period from conception to a child's second birthday—can have lifelong effects on health, because this is a crucial phase of growth and development. There is increasing recognition of the burden and potential effects of schistosomiasis in women of reproductive age and young children. Exposure to schistosomes during pregnancy can modulate infant immune development and schistosomiasis can occur from early infancy, such that the high disease burden found in adolescents is often due to accumulation of infections with long-lived schistosomes from early life. Women of reproductive age and young children are largely neglected in mass drug administration programmes, but early treatment could avert subsequent disease. We evaluate the evidence that early schistosomiasis has adverse effects on birth, growth, and development. We also discuss the case for expanding public health interventions for schistosomiasis in women of reproductive age and preschool-age children, and the need for further research to evaluate the potential of treating women pre-conception to maximise health across the life course."

The massive outbreak of Ebola virus disease in west Africa between 2013 and 2016 resulted in intense efforts to evaluate the efficacy of several specific countermeasures developed through years of preclinical work, including the first clinical trials for therapeutics and vaccines. In this Review, we discuss how the experience and data generated from that outbreak have helped to advance the understanding of the use of these countermeasures for post-exposure prophylaxis against Ebola virus infection. In future outbreaks, post-exposure prophylaxis could play an important part in reducing community transmission of Ebola virus by providing more immediate protection than does immunisation as well as providing additional protection for health-care workers who are inadvertently exposed over the course of their work. We propose provisional guidance for use of post-exposure prophylaxis in Ebola virus disease and identify the priorities for future preparedness and further research."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) that enables suppression of HIV replication has been successfully rolled out at large scale to HIV-positive patients in low-income and middle-income countries. WHO guidelines for these regions define failure of ART with a lenient threshold of viraemia (HIV RNA viral load ≥1000 copies per mL). We investigated the occurrence of detectable viraemia during ART below this threshold and its effect on treatment outcomes in a large South African cohort.
Methods
In this observational cohort study, we included HIV-positive adults registered between Jan 1, 2007, and May 1, 2016, at 57 clinical sites in South Africa, who were receiving WHO-recommended ART regimens and viral load monitoring. Low-level viraemia was defined as the occurrence of at least one viral load measurement of 51–999 copies per mL during ART. Outcomes were WHO-defined virological failure (one or more viral load measurement of ≥1000 copies per mL) and switch to second-line ART. Risks were estimated with Cox proportional hazard models.
Findings
70 930 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 67 644 received first-line ART, 1476 received second-line ART, and 1810 received both. Median duration of follow-up was 124 weeks (IQR 56–221) for patients on first-line ART and 101 weeks (IQR 51–178) for patients on second-line ART. Low-level viraemia occurred in 16 013 (23%) of 69 454 patients, with an incidence of 11·5 per 100 person-years of follow-up (95% CI 11·4–11·7), during first-line ART. Virological failure during follow-up occurred in 14 380 (22%) of 69 454 patients on first-line ART. Low-level viraemia was associated with increased hazards of virological failure (hazard ratio [HR] 2·6, 95% CI 2·5–2·8; p<0·0001) and switch to second-line ART (HR 5·2, 4·4–6·1; p<0·0001]) compared with virological suppression of less than 50 copies per mL. Risk of virological failure increased further with higher ranges and persistence of low-level viraemia.
Interpretation
In this large cohort, low-level viraemia occurred frequently and increased the risk of virological failure and switch to second-line ART. Strategies for management of low-level viraemia need to be incorporated into WHO guidelines to meet UNAIDS-defined targets aimed at halting the global HIV epidemic.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Data on carcinogenicity of human papillomavirus (HPV) types in the anus are needed to inform anal cancer prevention through vaccination and screening. This is particularly the case for people infected with HIV, who are at an increased risk of anal cancer.
Methods
We did a systematic review of studies published from January, 1986, to July, 2017, in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library on anal HPV infection, without any language restrictions. Eligible studies reported type-specific HPV prevalence by strata of cytopathological or histopathological anal diagnosis, sex, and HIV status. Data requests were made to authors when necessary. We did a meta-analysis of type-specific HPV prevalence across the full spectrum of anal diagnoses, from normal cytology to anal cancer. We assessed the main outcome of type-specific HPV prevalence ratios [PR], calculated across strata of anal diagnoses, gender, or HIV status, by use of generalised linear models.
Findings
95 studies were identified from the search, published between 1992–2017, from which 18 646 individuals fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the analyses: 8534 people with normal cytology, 5730 with low-grade lesions, 2024 with high-grade lesions, and 2358 with anal cancer. HPV prevalence varied in normal cytology from 42% in HIV-negative women to 76% in HIV-positive men and, for each diagnosis, was higher in individuals who were HIV positive than those who were HIV negative. HPV16 positivity increased with diagnosis severity, being the only HPV type accounting for more HPV infection in anal cancer than normal cytology, both in individuals who were HIV negative (PR 5·0, 95% CI 3·8–6·6, p<0·0001) and those who were HIV positive (2·3, 1·9–2·7, p<0·0001). HPV16 positivity increased even between high-grade lesions and anal cancer, whereas other high-risk HPV types accounted for high proportions of low-grade or high-grade lesions but their prevalence decreased in anal cancer. However, HPV16 was less frequent in HIV-positive than HIV-negative anal cancer, both in men (PR 0·8, 95% CI 0·7–0·9, p<0·0001) and women (0·8, 0·6–1·0, p=0·063), and in HIV-positive versus HIV-negative high-grade lesions in women (0·6, 0·5–0·9, p=0·0077). Type-specific attribution of the non-HPV16 fraction of HIV-positive anal cancer is hindered by a high prevalence of multiple HPV infections.
Interpretation
HPV16 is by far the most carcinogenic HPV type in the anus, with enrichment of HPV16 even from high-grade lesions to anal cancer, both in individuals who are HIV negative and those who are HIV positive. Nevertheless, the fraction of anal cancer attributable to HPV16 is smaller in the HIV-positive population.

Background
Chronic infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV are highly prevalent in the USA and concentrated in people who inject drugs. Treatment as prevention with highly effective new direct-acting antivirals is a prospective HCV elimination strategy. We used network-based modelling to analyse the effect of this strategy in HCV-infected people who inject drugs in a US city.
Methods
Five graph models were fit using data from 1574 people who inject drugs in Hartford, CT, USA. We used a degree-corrected stochastic block model, based on goodness-of-fit, to model networks of injection drug users. We simulated transmission of HCV and HIV through this network with varying levels of HCV treatment coverage (0%, 3%, 6%, 12%, or 24%) and varying baseline HCV prevalence in people who inject drugs (30%, 60%, 75%, or 85%). We compared the effectiveness of seven treatment-as-prevention strategies on reducing HCV prevalence over 10 years and 20 years versus no treatment. The strategies consisted of treatment assigned to either a randomly chosen individual who injects drugs or to an individual with the highest number of injection partners. Additional strategies explored the effects of treating either none, half, or all of the injection partners of the selected individual, as well as a strategy based on respondent-driven recruitment into treatment.

Our model estimates show that at the highest baseline HCV prevalence in people who inject drugs (85%), expansion of treatment coverage does not substantially reduce HCV prevalence for any treatment-as-prevention strategy. However, when baseline HCV prevalence is 60% or lower, treating more than 120 (12%) individuals per 1000 people who inject drugs per year would probably eliminate HCV within 10 years. On average, assigning treatment randomly to individuals who inject drugs is better than targeting individuals with the most injection partners. Treatment-as-prevention strategies that treat additional network members are among the best performing strategies and can enhance less effective strategies that target the degree (ie, the highest number of injection partners) within the network.
Interpretation
Successful HCV treatment as prevention should incorporate the baseline HCV prevalence and will achieve the greatest benefit when coverage is sufficiently expanded.

In light of the recent Zika virus outbreak, vector control has received renewed interest. However, which interventions are efficacious and community effective and how to best deliver them remains unclear. Following PRISMA guidelines, we did a systematic review to assess evidence for applied vector control interventions providing protection against Chagas disease, dengue, leishmaniasis, and lymphatic filariasis at the household level. We searched for published literature and grey literature between Jan 1, 1980, and Nov 30, 2015, and updated our search on April 2, 2017, using databases including the Cochrane, Embase, LILACS, PubMed, Web of Science, and WHOLIS. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was used. Inclusion criteria included studies reporting vector control interventions in and around a house or dwelling; and use of insecticides as sprays on netting or screens, and any method to control larval breeding in water containers in and around the home. 1416 articles were assessed and 32 articles included. The most effective interventions affecting vector indices for multiple diseases were found to be intradomiciliary residual spraying, insecticide-treated materials (especially insecticide-treated nets or curtains), and treatment of larval habitats with biological and chemical methods. Waste management and clean-up campaigns reduce vector populations, although to a lesser extent than other interventions and not consistently. Modifications to the structure of homes (eg, wall plastering) had no impact on the control of vectors. Protection of the house and its surroundings might affect the transmission of several diseases. The most effective interventions should be prioritised when vector control programmes are designed; however, the quality of delivery (ie, coverage and reapplication) of interventions is a crucial factor to ensure their effectiveness. Additional randomised trials that assess the measures of human disease and eventually target several diseases with a combination of interventions that protect the household and its inhabitants against multiple vectors, are needed to inform global policy in this area."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Infants in the UK were first offered a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in 2006, given at 2 and 4 months of age and a booster dose at 13 months (2 + 1 schedule). A 13-valent vaccine (PCV13) replaced PCV7 in 2010. We aimed to compare the post-booster antibody response in UK infants given a reduced priming schedule of PCV13 (ie, a 1 + 1 schedule) versus the current 2 + 1 schedule and to assess the potential effect on population protection.
Methods
In this multicentre, parallel group, randomised controlled trial, we recuited infants due to receive their primary immunisations aged up to 13 weeks on first vaccinations by information booklets mailed out via the NHS Child Health Information Service and the UK National Health Application and Infrastructure Services. Eligible infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive PCV13 at 2, 4, and 12 months (2 + 1 schedule) or 3 and 12 months of age (1 + 1 schedule) delivered with other routine vaccinations. Randomisation was done by computer-generated permuted block randomisation, with a block size of six. Participants and clinical trial staff were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was serotype-specific immunoglobulin G concentrations values (geometric mean concentrations [GMC] in μg/mL) measured in blood samples collected at 13 months of age. Analysis was by modified intention to treat with all individuals included by randomised group if they had a laboratory result. This trial is registered on the EudraCT clinical trial database, number 2015-000817-32, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02482636.
Findings
Between September, 2015, and June, 2016, 376 infants were assessed for eligibility. 81 infants were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria (n=50) or for other reasons (n=31). 213 eligible infants were enrolled and randomly allocated to group 1 (n=106; 2 + 1 schedule) or to group 2 (n=107; 1 + 1 schedule). In group 1, 91 serum samples were available for analysis 1 month after booster immunisation versus 86 in group 2. At month 13, post-booster, GMCs were equivalent between schedules for serotypes 3 (0·61 μg/mL in group 1 vs 0·62 μg/mL in group 2), 5 (1·74 μg/mL vs 2·11 μg/mL), 7F (3·98 μg/mL vs 3·36 μg/mL), 9V (2·34 μg/mL vs 2·50 μg/mL), and 19A (8·38 μg/mL vs 8·83 μg/mL). Infants given the 1 + 1 schedule had significantly greater immunogenicity post-booster than those given the 2 + 1 schedule for serotypes 1 (8·92 μg/mL vs 3·07 μg/mL), 4 (3·43 μg/mL vs 2·55 μg/mL), 14 (16·9 μg/mL vs 10·49 μg/mL), and 19F (14·76 μg/mL vs 11·12 μg/mL; adjusted p value range <0·001 to 0·047). The 2 + 1 schedule was superior for serotypes 6A, 6B, 18C and 23F (adjusted p value range <0·0001 to 0·017). In a predefined numerical subset of all of the infants recruited to the study (n=40 [20%]), functional serotype-specific antibody was similar between schedules. 26 serious adverse events were recorded in 21 (10%) infants across the study period; 18 (n=13) were in the 2 + 1 group and eight (n=8) in the 1 + 1 group. Only one serious adverse event, a high temperature and refusal to feed after the first vaccination visit in a child on the 2+1 schedule was considered related to vaccine.
Interpretation
Our findings show that for nine of the 13 serotypes in PCV13, post-booster responses in infants primed with a single dose are equivalent or superior to those seen following the standard UK 2 + 1 schedule. Introducing a 1 + 1 schedule in countries with a mature PCV programme and established herd immunity is likely to maintain population control of vaccine-type pneumococcal disease.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Nosocomial pneumonia is commonly associated with antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam in patients with nosocomial pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, compared with meropenem in a multinational, phase 3, double-blind, non-inferiority trial (REPROVE).
Methods
Adults with nosocomial pneumonia (including ventilator-associated pneumonia), enrolled at 136 centres in 23 countries, were randomly assigned (1:1) to 2000 mg ceftazidime and 500 mg avibactam (by 2 h intravenous infusion every 8 h) or 1000 mg meropenem (by 30-min intravenous infusion every 8 h) for 7–14 days; regimens were adjusted for renal function. Computer-generated randomisation codes were stratified by infection type and geographical region with a block size of four. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit (21–25 days after randomisation). Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference was greater than −12·5% in the coprimary clinically modified intention-to-treat and clinically evaluable populations. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01808092) and EudraCT (2012-004006-96).
Findings
Between April 13, 2013, and Dec 11, 2015, 879 patients were randomly assigned. 808 patients were included in the safety population, 726 were included in the clinically modified intention-to-treat population, and 527 were included in the clinically evaluable population. Predominant Gram-negative baseline pathogens in the microbiologically modified intention-to-treat population (n=355) were Klebsiella pneumoniae (37%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30%); 28% were ceftazidime-non-susceptible. In the clinically modified intention-to-treat population, 245 (68·8%) of 356 patients in the ceftazidime-avibactam group were clinically cured, compared with 270 (73·0%) of 370 patients in the meropenem group (difference −4·2% [95% CI −10·8 to 2·5]). In the clinically evaluable population, 199 (77·4%) of 257 participants were clinically cured in the ceftazidime-avibactam group, compared with 211 (78·1%) of 270 in the meropenem group (difference −0·7% [95% CI −7·9 to 6·4]). Adverse events occurred in 302 (75%) of 405 patients in the ceftazidime-avibactam group versus 299 (74%) of 403 in the meropenem group (safety population), and were mostly mild or moderate in intensity and unrelated to study treatment. Serious adverse events occurred in 75 (19%) patients in the ceftazidime-avibactam group and 54 (13%) patients in the meropenem group. Four serious adverse events (all in the ceftazidime-avibactam group) were judged to be treatment related.
Interpretation
Ceftazidime-avibactam was non-inferior to meropenem in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia. These results support a role for ceftazidime-avibactam as a potential alternative to carbapenems in patients with nosocomial pneumonia (including ventilator-associated pneumonia) caused by Gram-negative pathogens.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Millions of HIV-infected people worldwide receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) in programmes using WHO-recommended standardised regimens. Recent WHO guidelines recommend a boosted protease inhibitor plus raltegravir as an alternative second-line combination. We assessed whether this treatment option offers any advantage over the standard protease inhibitor plus two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) second-line combination after 144 weeks of follow-up in typical programme settings.
Methods
We analysed the 144-week outcomes at the completion of the EARNEST trial, a randomised controlled trial done in HIV-infected adults or adolescents in 14 sites in five sub-Saharan African countries (Uganda, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, Zambia). Participants were those who were no longer responding to non-NRTI-based first-line ART, as assessed with WHO criteria, confirmed by viral-load testing. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (lopinavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg, twice per day) plus two or three clinician-selected NRTIs (protease inhibitor plus NRTI group), protease inhibitor plus raltegravir (400 mg twice per day; protease inhibitor plus raltegravir group), or protease inhibitor monotherapy (plus raltegravir induction for first 12 weeks, re-intensified to combination therapy after week 96; protease inhibitor monotherapy group). Randomisation was by computer-generated randomisation sequence, with variable block size. The primary outcome was viral load of less than 400 copies per mL at week 144, for which we assessed non-inferiority with a one-sided α of 0·025, and superiority with a two-sided α of 0·025. The EARNEST trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 37737787.
Findings
Between April 12, 2010, and April 29, 2011, 1837 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 1277 patients were randomly assigned to an intervention group. In the primary (complete-case) analysis at 144 weeks, 317 (86%) of 367 in the protease inhibitor plus NRTI group had viral loads of less than 400 copies per mL compared with 312 (81%) of 383 in the protease inhibitor plus raltegravir group (p=0·07; lower 95% confidence limit for difference 10·2% vs specified non-inferiority margin 10%). In the protease inhibitor monotherapy group, 292 (78%) of 375 had viral loads of less than 400 copies per mL; p=0·003 versus the protease inhibitor plus NRTI group at 144 weeks. There was no difference between groups in serious adverse events, grade 3 or 4 adverse events (total or ART-related), or events that resulted in treatment modification.
Interpretation
Protease inhibitor plus raltegravir offered no advantage over protease inhibitor plus NRTI in virological efficacy or safety. In the primary analysis, protease inhibitor plus raltegravir did not meet non-inferiority criteria. A regimen of protease inhibitor with NRTIs remains the best standardised second-line regimen for use in programmes in resource-limited settings.

abstract = "Summary
Parasitic nematodes of the genus Toxocara are socioeconomically important zoonotic pathogens. These parasites are usually directly transmitted to the human host via the faecal–oral route and can cause toxocariasis and associated complications, including allergic and neurological disorders. Although tens of millions of people are estimated to be exposed to or infected with Toxocara spp, global epidemiological information on the relationship between seropositivity and toxocariasis is limited. Recent findings suggest that the effect of toxocariasis on human health is increasing in some countries. Here we review the salient background on Toxocara and biology, summarise key aspects of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of toxocariasis, describe what is known about its geographic distribution and prevalence, and make some recommendations for future research towards the prevention and control of this important disease."

abstract = "Summary
Background
After decades of decreasing scarlet fever incidence, a dramatic increase was seen in England beginning in 2014. Investigations were launched to assess clinical and epidemiological patterns and identify potential causes.
Methods
In this population-based surveillance study, we analysed statutory scarlet fever notifications held by Public Health England from 1911 to 2016 in England and Wales to identify periods of sudden escalation of scarlet fever. Characteristics of cases and outbreaks in England including frequency of complications and hospital admissions were assessed and compared with the pre-upsurge period. Isolates from throat swabs were obtained and were emm typed.
Findings
Data were retrieved for our analysis between Jan 1, 1911, and Dec 31, 2016. Population rates of scarlet fever increased by a factor of three between 2013 and 2014 from 8·2 to 27·2 per 100 000 (rate ratio [RR] 3·34, 95% CI 3·23–3·45; p<0·0001); further increases were observed in 2015 (30·6 per 100 000) and in 2016 (33·2 per 100 000), which reached the highest number of cases (19 206) and rate of scarlet fever notifcation since 1967. The median age of cases in 2014 was 4 years (IQR 3–7) with an incidence of 186 per 100 000 children under age 10 years. All parts of England saw an increase in incidence, with 620 outbreaks reported in 2016. Hospital admissions for scarlet fever increased by 97% between 2013 and 2016; one in 40 cases were admitted for management of the condition or potential complications. Analysis of strains (n=303) identified a diversity of emm types with emm3 (43%), emm12 (15%), emm1 (11%), and emm4 (9%) being the most common. Longitudinal analysis identified 4-yearly periodicity in population incidence of scarlet fever but of consistently lower magnitude than the current escalation.
Interpretation
England is experiencing an unprecedented rise in scarlet fever with the highest incidence for nearly 50 years. Reasons for this escalation are unclear and identifying these remains a public health priority.

Background
The findings of randomised controlled trials (RCT), observational studies, and meta-analyses vary regarding the effectiveness of prolonged β-lactam infusion. We aimed to identify the effectiveness of prolonged versus short-term infusion of antipseudomonal β-lactams in patients with sepsis.
Methods
We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare prolonged versus short-term intravenous infusion of antipseudomonal β-lactams in patients with sepsis. Two authors independently searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library of clinical trials until November, 2016, without date or language restrictions. Any RCT comparing mortality or clinical efficacy of prolonged (continuous or ≥3 h) versus short-term (≤60 min) infusion of antipseudomonal β-lactams for the treatment of patients with sepsis was eligible. Studies were excluded if they were not RCTs, the antibiotics in the two arms were not the same, neither mortality nor clinical efficacy was reported, only pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic outcomes were reported, or if ten or fewer patients were enrolled or randomised. Data were extracted in prespecified forms and we then did a meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at any timepoint. This meta-analysis is registered with the PROSPERO database, number CRD42016051678, and is reported according to PRISMA guidelines.
Findings
2196 articles were identified and screened, and 22 studies (1876 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. According to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool, the quality of evidence for mortality was high. Carbapenems, penicillins, and cephalosporins were studied. Patients with variable age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, severity of sepsis and renal function were enrolled. Prolonged infusion was associated with lower all-cause mortality than short-term infusion (risk ratio [RR] 0·70, 95% CI 0·56–0·87). Heterogeneity was not observed (p=0·93, I2=0%). The funnel plot and the Egger's test (p=0·44) showed no evidence of publication bias.
Interpretation
Prolonged infusion of antipseudomonal β-lactams for the treatment of patients with sepsis was associated with significantly lower mortality than short-term infusion. Further studies in specific subgroups of patients according to age, sepsis severity, degree of renal dysfunction, and immunocompetence are warranted.

abstract = "Summary
Bat-acquired rabies is becoming increasingly common, and its diagnosis could be missed partly because its clinical presentation differs from that of dog-acquired rabies. We reviewed the scientific literature to compare the pathogenesis of rabies in bats and carnivores—including dogs—and related this pathogenesis to differences in the clinical presentation of bat-acquired and dog-acquired rabies in human beings. For bat-acquired rabies, we found that the histological site of exposure is usually limited to the skin, the anatomical site of exposure is more commonly the face, and the virus might be more adapted for entry via the skin than for dog-acquired rabies. These factors could help to explain several differences in clinical presentation between individuals with bat-acquired and those with dog-acquired rabies. A better understanding of these differences should improve the recording of a patient's history, enable drawing up of a more sophisticated list of clinical characteristics, and therefore obtain an earlier diagnosis of rabies after contact with a bat or carnivore that has rabies."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Clostridium difficile infection causes severe complications and frequently recurs. An extended-pulsed fidaxomicin regimen might facilitate sustained clinical cure by prolonging C difficile suppression and supporting gut microbiota recovery. We aimed to compare clinical outcomes of extended-pulsed fidaxomicin with standard vancomycin.
Methods
In this randomised, controlled, open-label, superiority study, we recruited hospitalised adults aged 60 years and older with confirmed C difficile infection at 86 European hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive web response system to receive extended-pulsed fidaxomicin (200 mg oral tablets, twice daily on days 1–5, then once daily on alternate days on days 7–25) or vancomycin (125 mg oral capsules, four times daily on days 1–10), stratified by baseline C difficile infection severity, cancer presence, age (≥75 years vs <75 years), and number of previous C difficile infection occurrences. The primary endpoint was sustained clinical cure 30 days after end of treatment (day 55 for extended-pulsed fidaxomicin and day 40 for vancomycin), assessed in all randomised patients who met the inclusion criteria and received at least one dose of study medication (modified full analysis set). Adverse events were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02254967.
Findings
Between Nov 6, 2014, and May 5, 2016, 364 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive extended-pulsed fidaxomicin or vancomycin. 362 patients received at least one dose of study medication (181 in each group). 124 (70%) of 177 patients in the modified full analysis set receiving extended-pulsed fidaxomicin achieved sustained clinical cure 30 days after end of treatment, compared with 106 (59%) of 179 patients receiving vancomycin (difference 11% [95% CI 1·0–20·7], p=0·030; odds ratio 1·62 [95% CI 1·04–2·54]). Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events did not differ between extended-pulsed fidaxomicin (121 [67%] of 181) and vancomycin (128 [71%] of 181) treatment arms. One death in the vancomycin arm was considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.
Interpretation
Extended-pulsed fidaxomicin was superior to standard-dose vancomycin for sustained cure of C difficile infection, and, to our knowledge, extended-pulsed fidaxomicin recurrence rates in this study are the lowest observed in a randomised clinical trial of antibiotic treatment for C difficile infection.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae strains often cause life-threatening community-acquired infections in young and healthy hosts, but are usually sensitive to antibiotics. In this study, we investigated a fatal outbreak of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by a new emerging hypervirulent K pneumoniae strain.
Methods
The outbreak occurred in the integrated intensive care unit of a new branch of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China). We collected 21 carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae strains from five patients and characterised these strains for their antimicrobial susceptibility, multilocus sequence types, and genetic relatedness using VITEK-2 compact system, multilocus sequence typing, and whole genome sequencing. We selected one representative isolate from each patient to establish the virulence potential using a human neutrophil assay and Galleria mellonella model and to establish the genetic basis of their hypervirulence phenotype.
Findings
All five patients had undergone surgery for multiple trauma and subsequently received mechanical ventilation. The patients were aged 53–73 years and were admitted to the intensive care unit between late February and April, 2016. They all had severe pneumonia, carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae infections, and poor responses to antibiotic treatment and died due to severe lung infection, multiorgan failure, or septic shock. All five representative carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae strains belonged to the ST11 type, which is the most prevalent carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae type in China, and originated from the same clone. The strains were positive on the string test, had survival of about 80% after 1 h incubation in human neutrophils, and killed 100% of wax moth larvae (G mellonella) inoculated with 1 × 106 colony-forming units of the specimens within 24 h, suggesting that they were hypervirulent K pneumoniae. Genomic analyses showed that the emergence of these ST11 carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K pneumoniae strains was due to the acquisition of a roughly 170 kbp pLVPK-like virulence plasmid by classic ST11 carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae strains. We also detected these strains in specimens collected in other regions of China.
Interpretation
The ST11 carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K pneumoniae strains pose a substantial threat to human health because they are simultaneously hypervirulent, multidrug resistant, and highly transmissible. Control measures should be implemented to prevent further dissemination of such organisms in the hospital setting and the community.

abstract = "Summary
Conflicting reports have emerged about the effectiveness of the live attenuated influenza vaccine. The live attenuated influenza vaccine appears to protect particularly poorly against currently circulating H1N1 viruses that are derived from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. During the 2015–16 influenza season, when pandemic H1N1 was the predominant virus, studies from the USA reported a complete lack of effectiveness of the live vaccine in children. This finding led to a crucial decision in the USA to recommend that the live vaccine not be used in 2016–17 and to switch to the inactivated influenza vaccine. Other countries, including the UK, Canada, and Finland, however, have continued to recommend the use of the live vaccine. This policy divergence and uncertainty has far reaching implications for the entire global community, given the importance of the production capabilities of the live attenuated influenza vaccine for pandemic preparedness. In this Personal View, we discuss possible explanations for the observed reduced effectiveness of the live attenuated influenza vaccine and highlight the underpinning scientific questions. Further research to understand the reasons for these observations is essential to enable informed public health policy and commercial decisions about vaccine production and development in coming years."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Little is known about the historical and current risk of Zika virus infection in southeast Asia, where the mosquito vector is widespread and other arboviruses circulate endemically. Centralised Zika virus surveillance began in Thailand in January, 2016. We assessed the long-term circulation of Zika virus in Thailand.
Methods
In this observational study, we analysed data from individuals with suspected Zika virus infection who presented at hospitals throughout the country and had biological samples (serum, plasma, or urine) tested for confirmation with PCR at the National Institute of Health laboratories in Bangkok. We analysed the spatial and age distribution of cases, and constructed time-resolved phylogenetic trees using genomes from Thailand and elsewhere to estimate when Zika virus was first introduced.
Findings
Of the 3089 samples from 1717 symptomatic individuals tested between January, 2016, and December, 2017, 368 were confirmed to have Zika virus infection. Cases of Zika virus infection were reported throughout the year, and from 29 of the 76 Thai provinces. Individuals had 2·8 times (95% CI 2·3–3·6) the odds of testing positive for Zika virus infection if they came from the same district and were sick within the same year of a person with a confirmed infection relative to the odds of testing positive anywhere, consistent with focal transmission. The probability of cases being younger than 10 years was 0·99 times (0·72–1·30) the probability of being that age in the underlying population. This probability rose to 1·62 (1·33–1·92) among those aged 21–30 years and fell to 0·53 (0·40–0·66) for those older than 50 years. This age distribution is consistent with that observed in the Zika virus epidemic in Colombia. Phylogenetic reconstructions suggest persistent circulation within Thailand since at least 2002.
Interpretation
Our evidence shows that Zika virus has circulated at a low but sustained level for at least 16 years, suggesting that Zika virus can adapt to persistent endemic transmission. Health systems need to adapt to cope with regular occurrences of the severe complications associated with infection.

abstract = "Summary
To improve virological suppression and address the emerging threat of HIV drug resistance, many low-income and middle-income countries are moving away from non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and transitioning to dolutegravir as part of a more affordable and standardised antiretroviral therapy (ART). Although this transition could decrease the effect of rising NNRTI resistance and yield improved ART outcomes, it also presents new challenges. First, current safety concerns for dolutegravir use in women of childbearing potential require alternative solutions. Second, pre-existing resistance to the co-administered nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors might reduce effectiveness and durability of dolutegravir, particularly if there is scarce access to viral load tests to monitor treatment outcomes. Third, there is inadequate information on the genetic correlates of resistance to dolutegravir, particularly in patients infected with HIV-1 non-B subtypes. Finally, clinical management of patients with confirmed virological failure on a dolutegravir-based regimen can pose challenges because of uncertainty around whether dolutegravir resistance has actually developed and switching is needed, or whether only interventions to improve adherence without switching are sufficient. These considerations should be addressed to consolidate expected gains from widespread introduction of dolutegravir in low-income and middle-income countries."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The emergence and spread of resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria to artemisinin combination therapies in the Greater Mekong subregion poses a major threat to malaria control and elimination. The current study is part of a multi-country, open-label, randomised clinical trial (TRACII, 2015–18) evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of triple artemisinin combination therapies. A very high rate of treatment failure after treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was observed in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The immediate public health importance of our findings prompted us to report the efficacy data on dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and its determinants ahead of the results of the overall trial, which will be published later this year.
Methods
Patients aged between 2 and 65 years presenting with uncomplicated P falciparum or mixed species malaria at seven sites in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam were randomly assigned to receive dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with or without mefloquine, as part of the TRACII trial. The primary outcome was the PCR-corrected efficacy at day 42. Next-generation sequencing was used to assess the prevalence of molecular markers associated with artemisinin resistance (kelch13 mutations, in particular Cys580Tyr) and piperaquine resistance (plasmepsin-2 and plasmepsin-3 amplifications and crt mutations). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453308.
Findings
Between Sept 28, 2015, and Jan 18, 2018, 539 patients with acute P falciparum malaria were screened for eligibility, 292 were enrolled, and 140 received dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The overall Kaplan-Meier estimate of PCR-corrected efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine at day 42 was 50·0% (95% CI 41·1–58·3). PCR-corrected efficacies for individual sites were 12·7% (2·2–33·0) in northeastern Thailand, 38·2% (15·9–60·5) in western Cambodia, 73·4% (57·0–84·3) in Ratanakiri (northeastern Cambodia), and 47·1% (33·5–59·6) in Binh Phuoc (southwestern Vietnam). Treatment failure was associated independently with plasmepsin2/3 amplification status and four mutations in the crt gene (Thr93Ser, His97Tyr, Phe145Ile, and Ile218Phe). Compared with the results of our previous TRACI trial in 2011–13, the prevalence of molecular markers of artemisinin resistance (kelch13 Cys580Tyr mutations) and piperaquine resistance (plasmepsin2/3 amplifications and crt mutations) has increased substantially in the Greater Mekong subregion in the past decade.
Interpretation
Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is not treating malaria effectively across the eastern Greater Mekong subregion. A highly drug-resistant P falciparum co-lineage is evolving, acquiring new resistance mechanisms, and spreading. Accelerated elimination of P falciparum malaria in this region is needed urgently, to prevent further spread and avoid a potential global health emergency.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In small community-based trials, mass drug administration of ivermectin has been shown to substantially decrease the prevalence of both scabies and secondary impetigo; however, their effect at large scale is untested. Additionally, combined mass administration of drugs for two or more neglected diseases has potential practical advantages, but efficacy of potential combinations should be confirmed.
Methods
The azithromycin ivermectin mass drug administration (AIM) trial was a prospective, single-arm, before-and-after, community intervention study to assess the efficacy of mass drug administration of ivermectin for scabies and impetigo, with coadministration of azithromycin for trachoma. Mass drug administration was offered to the entire population of Choiseul Province, Solomon Islands, and of this population we randomly selected two sets of ten sentinel villages for monitoring, one at baseline and the other at 12 months. Participants were offered a single dose of 20 mg/kg azithromycin, using weight-based bands. Children weighing less than 12·5 kg received azithromycin oral suspension (20 mg/kg), and infants younger than 6 months received topical 1% tetracycline ointment. For ivermectin, participants were offered two doses of oral ivermectin 200 μg/kg 7–14 days apart using weight-based bands, or 5% permethrin cream 7–14 days apart if ivermectin was contraindicated. Our study had the primary outcomes of safety and feasibility of large-scale mass coadministration of oral ivermectin and azithromycin, which have been previously reported. We report here the prevalence of scabies and impetigo in residents of the ten baseline villages compared with those in the ten 12-month villages, as measured by examination of the skin, which was a secondary outcome of the trial. Further outcomes were comparison of the number of all-cause outpatient attendances at government clinics in Choiseul Province at various timepoints before and after mass drug administration. The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Trials Registry (ACTRN12615001199505).
Findings
During September, 2015, over 4 weeks, 26 188 people (99·3% of the estimated population of Choiseul [n=26 372] as determined at the 2009 census) were treated. At baseline, 1399 (84·2%) of 1662 people living in the first ten villages had their skin examined, of whom 261 (18·7%) had scabies and 347 (24·8%) had impetigo. At 12 months after mass drug administration, 1261 (77·6%) of 1625 people in the second set of ten villages had their skin examined, of whom 29 (2·3%) had scabies (relative reduction 88%, 95% CI 76·5–99·3) and 81 (6·4%) had impetigo (relative reduction 74%, 63·4–84·7). In the 3 months after mass drug administration, 10 614 attended outpatient clinics for any reason compared with 16 602 in the 3 months before administration (decrease of 36·1%, 95% CI 34·7–37·6), and during this period attendance for skin sores, boils, and abscesses decreased by 50·9% (95% CI 48·6–53·1).
Interpretation
Ivermectin-based mass drug administration can be scaled to a population of over 25 000 with high efficacy and this level of efficacy can be achieved when mass drug administration for scabies is integrated with mass drug administration of azithromycin for trachoma. These findings will contribute to development of population-level control strategies. Further research is needed to assess durability and scalability of mass drug administration in larger, non-island populations, and to assess its effect on the severe bacterial complications of scabies.

abstract = "Summary
More than 80% of the global population is at risk of a vector-borne disease, with mosquito-borne diseases being the largest contributor to human vector-borne disease burden. Although many global processes, such as land-use and socioeconomic change, are thought to affect mosquito-borne disease dynamics, research to date has strongly focused on the role of climate change. Here, we show, through a review of contemporary modelling studies, that no consensus on how future changes in climatic conditions will impact mosquito-borne diseases exists, possibly due to interacting effects of other global change processes, which are often excluded from analyses. We conclude that research should not focus solely on the role of climate change but instead consider growing evidence for additional factors that modulate disease risk. Furthermore, future research should adopt new technologies, including developments in remote sensing and system dynamics modelling techniques, to enable a better understanding and mitigation of mosquito-borne diseases in a changing world."

abstract = "Summary
Tuberculosis is preventable, treatable, and curable, yet it has the highest mortality rate of infectious diseases worldwide. Over the past decade, services to prevent, screen, diagnose, and treat tuberculosis have been developed and scaled up globally, but progress to end the disease as a public health threat has been slow, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. In these settings, low-quality tuberculosis prevention, diagnostic, and treatment services frustrate efforts to translate use of existing tools, approaches, and treatment regimens into improved individual and public health outcomes. Increasingly sophisticated methods have been used to identify gaps in quality of tuberculosis care, but inadequate work has been done to apply these findings to activities that generate population-level improvements. In this Personal View, we contend that shifting the focus from the “what” to the “how” of quality improvement will require National Tuberculosis Programmes to change the way they organise, use data, implement, and respond to the needs and preferences of people with tuberculosis and at-risk communities."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A single dose of vaccine against yellow fever is routinely administered to infants aged 9–12 months under the Expanded Programme on Immunization, but the long-term outcome of vaccination in this age group is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the long-term persistence of neutralising antibodies to yellow fever virus following routine vaccination in infancy.
Methods
We did a longitudinal cohort study, using a microneutralisation assay to measure protective antibodies against yellow fever in Malian and Ghanaian children vaccinated around age 9 months and followed up for 4·5 years (Mali), or 2·3 and 6·0 years (Ghana). Healthy children with available day-0 sera, a complete follow-up history, and no record of yellow fever revaccination were included; children seropositive for yellow fever at baseline were excluded. We standardised antibody concentrations with reference to the yellow fever WHO International Standard.
Findings
We included 587 Malian and 436 Ghanaian children vaccinated between June 5, 2009, and Dec 26, 2012. In the Malian group, 296 (50·4%, 95% CI 46·4–54·5) were seropositive (antibody concentration ≥0·5 IU/mL) 4·5 years after vaccination. Among the Ghanaian children, 121 (27·8%, 23·5–32·0) were seropositive after 2·3 years. These results show a large decrease from the proportions of seropositive infants 28 days after vaccination, 96·7% in Mali and 72·7% in Ghana, reported by a previous study of both study populations. The number of seropositive children increased to 188 (43·1%, 95% CI 38·5–47·8) in the Ghanaian group 6·0 years after vaccination, but this result might be confounded by unrecorded revaccination or natural infection with wild yellow fever virus during a 2011–12 outbreak in northern Ghana.
Interpretation
Rapid waning of immunity during the early years after vaccination of 9-month-old infants argues for a revision of the single-dose recommendation for this target population in endemic countries. The short duration of immunity in many vaccinees suggests that booster vaccination is necessary to meet the 80% population immunity threshold for prevention of yellow fever outbreaks.

Background
Patients who are immunocompromised because of malignancy have an increased risk of herpes zoster and herpes zoster-related complications. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of an inactivated varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine for herpes zoster prevention in patients with solid tumour or haematological malignancies.
Methods
This phase 3, two-arm, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial with an adaptive design was done in 329 centres across 40 countries. The trial included adult patients with solid tumour malignancies receiving chemotherapy and those with haematological malignancies, either receiving or not receiving chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive four doses of VZV vaccine inactivated by γ irradiation or placebo approximately 30 days apart. The patients, investigators, trial site staff, clinical adjudication committee, and sponsor's clinical and laboratory personnel were masked to the group assignment. The primary efficacy endpoint was herpes zoster incidence in patients with solid tumour malignancies receiving chemotherapy, which was assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (defined as all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of inactivated VZV vaccine or placebo). The primary safety endpoint was serious adverse events up to 28 days after the fourth dose in patients with solid tumour malignancies receiving chemotherapy. Safety endpoints were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of inactivated VZV vaccine or placebo and had follow-up data. This trial is registered (NCT01254630 and EudraCT 2010-023156-89).
Findings
Between June 27, 2011, and April 11, 2017, 5286 patients were randomly assigned to receive VZV vaccine inactivated by γ irradiation (n=2637) or placebo (n=2649). The haematological malignancy arm was terminated early because of evidence of futility at a planned interim analysis; therefore, all prespecified haematological malignancy endpoints were deemed exploratory. In patients with solid tumour malignancies in the modified intention-to-treat population, confirmed herpes zoster occurred in 22 of 1328 (6·7 per 1000 person-years) VZV vaccine recipients and in 61 of 1350 (18·5 per 1000 person-years) placebo recipients. Estimated vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster in patients with solid tumour malignancies was 63·6% (97·5% CI 36·4 to 79·1), meeting the prespecified success criterion. In patients with solid tumour malignancies, serious adverse events were similar in frequency across treatment groups, occurring in 298 (22·5%) of 1322 patients who received the vaccine and in 283 (21·0%) of 1346 patients who received placebo (risk difference 1·5%, 95% CI −1·7 to 4·6). Vaccine-related serious adverse events were less than 1% in each treatment group. Vaccine-related injection-site reactions were more common in the vaccine group than in the placebo group. In the haematological malignancy group, VZV vaccine was well tolerated and estimated vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster was 16·8% (95% CI −17·8 to 41·3).
Interpretation
The inactivated VZV vaccine was well tolerated and efficacious for herpes zoster prevention in patients with solid tumour malignancies receiving chemotherapy, but was not efficacious for herpes zoster prevention in patients with haematological malignancies.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In September, 2017, human monkeypox re-emerged in Nigeria, 39 years after the last reported case. We aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of the 2017–18 human monkeypox outbreak in Nigeria.
Methods
We reviewed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of cases of human monkeypox that occurred between Sept 22, 2017, and Sept 16, 2018. Data were collected with a standardised case investigation form, with a case definition of human monkeypox that was based on previously established guidelines. Diagnosis was confirmed by viral identification with real-time PCR and by detection of positive anti-orthopoxvirus IgM antibodies. Whole-genome sequencing was done for seven cases. Haplotype analysis results, genetic distance data, and epidemiological data were used to infer a likely series of events for potential human-to-human transmission of the west African clade of monkeypox virus.
Findings
122 confirmed or probable cases of human monkeypox were recorded in 17 states, including seven deaths (case fatality rate 6%). People infected with monkeypox virus were aged between 2 days and 50 years (median 29 years [IQR 14]), and 84 (69%) were male. All 122 patients had vesiculopustular rash, and fever, pruritus, headache, and lymphadenopathy were also common. The rash affected all parts of the body, with the face being most affected. The distribution of cases and contacts suggested both primary zoonotic and secondary human-to-human transmission. Two cases of health-care-associated infection were recorded. Genomic analysis suggested multiple introductions of the virus and a single introduction along with human-to-human transmission in a prison facility.
Interpretation
This study describes the largest documented human outbreak of the west African clade of the monkeypox virus. Our results suggest endemicity of monkeypox virus in Nigeria, with some evidence of human-to-human transmission. Further studies are necessary to explore animal reservoirs and risk factors for transmission of the virus in Nigeria.

Meningococcal disease was first clinically characterised by Gaspard Vieusseux in 1805, and its causative agent was identified by Anton Weichselbaum in 1887, who named it Diplococcus intracellularis menigitidis. From the beginning, the disease was dreaded because of its epidemic nature, predilection for previously healthy children and adolescents, and high mortality. In the last decade of the 19th century, the concept of serum therapy for toxin-related bacterial diseases was identified. This concept was applied to meningococcal disease therapy, in an independent way, by Wilhelm Kolle, August von Wasserman, and Georg Jochmann in Germany, and Simon Flexner in the USA, resulting in the first successful approach for the treatment of meningococcal disease. During the first three decades of the 20th century, serum therapy was the standard treatment for meningococcal disease. With the advent of sulphamides first and then antibiotics, serum therapy was abandoned. The great challenges that infectious diseases medicine is facing and the awaiting menaces in the future in terms of increasing antibiotic resistance, emergence of new pathogens, and re-emergence of old ones without effective therapy, make passive immunotherapy a promising tool. Acknowledging the achievements of our predecessors might teach us some lessons to bring light to our future."

The 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic was responsible for considerable global morbidity and mortality. In 2009, several research studies in the UK were rapidly funded and activated for clinical and public health actions. However, some studies were too late for their results to have an early and substantial effect on clinical care, because of the time required to call for research proposals, assess, fund, and set up the projects. In recognition of these inherent delays, a portfolio of projects was funded by the National Institute for Health Research in 2012. These studies have now been set up (ie, with relevant permissions and arrangements made for data collection) and pilot tested where relevant. All studies are now on standby awaiting activation in the event of a pandemic being declared. In this Personal View, we describe the projects that were set up, the challenges of putting these projects into a maintenance-only state, and ongoing activities to maintain readiness for activation, and discuss how to plan research for a range of major incidents."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Few data are available to support the choice between the two currently available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), ten-valent PCV (PCV10) and 13-valent PCV (PCV13). Here we report a head-to-head comparison of the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of PCV10 and PCV13.
Methods
In this parallel, open-label, randomised controlled trial, healthy infants from two districts in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, were randomly allocated (in a 3:3:5:4:5:4 ratio), with use of a computer-generated list, to one of six infant PCV schedules: PCV10 in a 3 + 1 (group A), 3 + 0 (group B), 2 + 1 (group C), or two-dose schedule (group D); PCV13 in a 2 + 1 schedule (group E); or no infant PCV (control; group F). Blood samples were collected from infants between 2 months and 18 months of age at various timepoints before and after PCV doses and analysed (in a blinded manner) by ELISA and opsonophagocytic assay. The trial had two independent aims: to compare vaccination responses between PCV10 and PCV13, and to evaluate different schedules of PCV10. In this Article, we present results pertaining to the first aim. The primary outcome was the proportion of infants with an IgG concentration of at least 0·35 μg/mL for the ten serotypes common to the two vaccines at age 5 months, 4 weeks after the two-dose primary vaccination series (group C vs group E, per protocol population). An overall difference among the schedules was defined as at least seven of ten serotypes differing in the same direction at the 10% level. We also assessed whether the two-dose primary series of PCV13 (group E) was non-inferior at the 10% level to a three-dose primary series of PCV10 (groups A and B). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01953510.
Findings
Of 1424 infants screened between Sept 30, 2013, and Jan 9, 2015, 1201 were allocated to the six groups: 152 (13%) to group A, 149 (12%) to group B, 250 (21%) to group C, 202 (17%) to group D, 251 (21%) to group E, and 197 (16%) to group F. 237 (95%) participants in group C (PCV10) and 232 (92%) in group E (PCV13) completed the primary vaccination series and had blood draws within the specified window at age 5 months, at which time the proportion of infants with IgG concentrations of at least 0·35 μg/mL did not differ between groups at the 10% level for any serotype (PCV10–PCV13 risk difference −2·1% [95% CI −4·8 to −0·1] for serotype 1; −1·3% [–3·7 to 0·6] for serotype 4; −3·4% [–6·8 to −0·4] for serotype 5; 15·6 [7·2 to 23·7] for serotype 6B; −1·3% [–3·7 to 0·6] for serotype 7F; −1·6% [–5·1 to 1·7] for serotype 9V; 0·0% [–2·7 to 2·9] for serotype 14; −2·1% [–5·3 to 0·9] for serotype 18C; 0·0% [–2·2 to 2·3] for serotype 19F; and −11·6% [–18·2 to −4·9] for serotype 23F). At the same timepoint, two doses of PCV13 were non-inferior to three doses of PCV10 for nine of the ten shared serotypes (excluding 6B). Reactogenicity and serious adverse events were monitored according to good clinical practice guidelines, and the profiles were similar in the two groups.
Interpretation
PCV10 and PCV13 are similarly highly immunogenic when used in 2 + 1 schedule. The choice of vaccine might be influenced by factors such as the comparative magnitude of the antibody responses, price, and the relative importance of different serotypes in different settings.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by the environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. It is often fatal, with a high prevalence in tropical areas. Clinical presentation can vary from abscess formation to pneumonia and sepsis. We assessed the global burden of melioidosis, expressed in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), for 2015.
Methods
We did a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature for human melioidosis cases between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2015. Quantitative data for cases of melioidosis were extracted, including mortality, age, sex, infectious and post-infectious sequelae, antibiotic treatment, and symptom duration. These data were combined with established disability weights and expert panel discussions to construct an incidence-based disease model. The disease model was integrated with established global incidence and mortality estimates to calculate global melioidosis DALYs. The study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018106372.
Findings
2888 articles were screened, of which 475 eligible studies containing quantitative data were retained. Pneumonia, intra-abdominal abscess, and sepsis were the most common outcomes, with pneumonia occurring in 3633 (35·7%, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 34·8–36·6) of 10 175 patients, intra-abdominal abscess in 1619 (18·3%, 17·5–19·1) of 8830 patients, and sepsis in 1526 (18·0%, 17·2–18·8) of 8469 patients. We estimate that in 2015, the global burden of melioidosis was 4·6 million DALYs (UI 3·2–6·6) or 84·3 per 100 000 people (57·5–120·0). Years of life lost accounted for 98·9% (UI 97·7–99·5) of the total DALYs, and years lived with disability accounted for 1·1% (0·5–2·3).
Interpretation
Melioidosis causes a larger disease burden than many other tropical diseases that are recognised as neglected, and so it should be reconsidered as a major neglected tropical disease.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The international health authorities are backing an effort to eliminate canine-mediated rabies in humans by 2030. This effort will require improving access to adequate and timely rabies post-exposure prophylaxis as compliance is low with WHO-recommended regimens (given in four to five visits over 1 month). Access could be substantially improved by an abridged regimen to reduce doses, direct and indirect costs, and improve vaccine equity by better sharing of available vaccine. We aimed to compare rabies virus neutralising antibody titres before and after the fourth visit to determine whether that session was needed or the current regimen could be abridged.
Methods
In this observational cohort study, we measured rabies virus neutralising antibody titres using rapid fluorescent focus inhibition tests in 116 people bitten by dogs with laboratory-confirmed rabies and 20 control individuals. Percentages of circulating plasmablasts were determined by flow cytometry. All individuals had been referred to the rabies prevention clinic at Institut Pasteur in Cambodia and received two intradermal injections of post-exposure prophylaxis on days 0, 3, 7, and 28 (Thai Red Cross regimen) with or without equine rabies immunoglobulin, as per 2010 WHO recommendations.
Findings
All individuals had rabies virus neutralising antibody titres considered protective (≥0·5 IU/mL) and plasmablast activation on day 28 before the last injection. The median rabies virus neutralising antibody concentration in the group of individuals bitten by rabies virus-positive dogs was 1·08 IU/mL (IQR 0·37–3·09) on day 7, 26·86 (22·68–49·50) on day 28, and 26·74 (11·78–49·06) on day 42. No significant differences were observed in titres between days 28 and 42, after titres reached a plateau. These titres were reached notwithstanding equine rabies immunoglobulin use, age, sex, nutrition status as indicated by upper-arm circumference in children or BMI in adults, or dog infection status. Titres or plasmablast percentages did not increase between the day of the last injection and 2 weeks later. All patients were alive 1 year after post-exposure prophylaxis.
Interpretation
The fourth vaccine session on day 28 provides no additional benefit. Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis can be abridged to a two-dose, three-session, 1 week regimen to improve post-exposure prophylaxis coverage and equity at no risk to patients.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Maternal tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination offers protection for neonates against clinical pertussis until primary vaccinations, but maternal antibodies also interfere with infants' immune responses to primary vaccinations. We investigated the effect of maternal Tdap vaccination on the pertussis antibody responses of infants starting primary vaccinations at age 3 months.
Methods
In an open-label, parallel, randomised, controlled trial, pregnant women aged 18–40 years with a low risk of pregnancy complications were recruited through independent midwives at 36 midwife clinics in the Netherlands and received Tdap vaccination either at 30–32 weeks of pregnancy (maternal Tdap group) or within 48 h after delivery (control group). All term-born infants were vaccinated with the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis-inactivated poliomyelitis-Haemophilus influenzae type B-hepatitis B six-in-one vaccine and a ten-valent pneumococcal vaccine at 3 months, 5 months, and 11 months. Randomisation was done using a number generator in a 1:1 ratio and with sealed envelopes. Participants and clinical trial staff were not masked, but laboratory technicians were unaware of study group assignments. The primary endpoint was serum IgG pertussis toxin antibody concentrations at age 3 months. Cord blood and infant blood samples were collected at age 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 11 months, and 12 months. Analysis was done by modified intention to treat with all randomly assigned participants in case a laboratory result was available. This trial is registered with ClinicaltTrialsRegister.eu (EudraCT 2012-004006-9) and trialregister.nl (NTR number NTR4314). The trial is now closed to new participants.
Findings
Between Jan 16, 2014, and March 4, 2016, 118 pregnant women were enrolled into our study, with 58 in the maternal Tdap group and 60 in the control group. The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of pertussis toxin antibodies were higher in infants in the maternal Tdap group than in the control group infants at age 3 months (GMC ratio 16·6, 95% CI 10·9–25·2) and also significantly higher compared with control infants at age 2 months. After primary vaccinations, antibody concentrations for pertussis toxin, filamentous haemagglutinin, and pertactin were significantly lower at all timepoints in infants of the maternal Tdap group than in infants in the control group. No safety issues after maternal Tdap vaccination were encountered.
Interpretation
In view of the high pertussis toxin antibody concentrations at age 3 months, maternal vaccination supports a delay of the first pertussis vaccination in infants until at least age 3 months. Maternal antibody interference affects antibody concentrations after primary and booster vaccinations. The clinical consequences of this interference remain to be established.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Candida bloodstream infection is associated with high mortality. Infectious disease consultation improves outcomes in several infections, including Staphylococcus aureus and cryptococcosis, as well as multidrug-resistant organisms. We aimed to examine the association between infectious disease consultation and differences in management with mortality in candida bloodstream infections.
Methods
In this retrospective, single-centre cohort study, we reviewed the medical charts of all patients admitted to Barnes-Jewish Hospital (St Louis, MO, USA), a tertiary referral centre, aged 18 years or older with candida bloodstream infection from 2002 to 2015. We collected data for demographics, comorbidities, predisposing factors, all-cause mortality, antifungal use, central-line removal, and ophthalmological and echocardiographic evaluation to assess 90-day all-cause mortality between individuals with and without an infectious disease consultation. For the survival analysis we used Cox proportional hazards model with inverse weighting by propensity score to assess the effects of infectious disease consultation on mortality and differences in management.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2002, and Dec 31, 2015, of 1794 patients assessed for eligibility, we analysed 1691 patients with candida bloodstream infection; 776 (45·9%) who had an infectious disease consultation and 915 (54·1%) who did not have an infectious disease consultation. All 1691 patients were included in the analysis. None were missing data. Most underlying comorbidities were evenly distributed between groups. 90-day mortality was lower in the infectious disease consultation group than in patients who did not receive an infectious disease consultation (29% [222/776] vs 51% [468/915]; p<0·0001). In the model with inverse weighting by the propensity score, infectious disease consultation was associated with a hazard ratio of 0·81 (95% CI 0·73–0·91; p<0·0001) for mortality. In the consultation group, median duration of antifungal therapy was longer (18 [IQR 14–35] vs 14 [6–20] days; p<0·0001) and central-line removal (587 [76%] of 776 vs 538 [59%] of 915; p<0·0001), echocardiography use (442 [57%] of 776 vs 305 [33%] of 915; p<0·0001), and ophthalmological examination (412 [53%] of 776 vs 160 [17%] of 915; p<0·0001) were more frequently done. Fewer patients in the infectious disease consultation group were not treated (13 [2%] of 776 vs 128 [14%] of 915; p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Patients with candida bloodstream infection receiving an infectious disease consultation have lower mortality. This finding might be attributable to these individuals receiving a higher number of non-pharmacological, evidence-based interventions and lower amounts of non-treatment. These data suggest that an infectious disease consultation should be an integral part of clinical care of patients with candida bloodstream infection.

Background
Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy in children is common despite no evidence of its efficacy or safety from clinical trials. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous antibiotic therapy at home with that of standard treatment in hospital for children with moderate to severe cellulitis.
Methods
The Cellulitis at Home or Inpatient in Children from the Emergency Department (CHOICE) trial was a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in children aged 6 months to 18 years who presented to the emergency department at The Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne, VIC, Australia) with uncomplicated moderate to severe cellulitis. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg once daily) at home or intravenous flucloxacillin (50 mg/kg every 6 h) in hospital with web-based randomisation, stratified by age and periorbital cellulitis. The primary outcome was treatment failure, which was defined as no clinical improvement or occurrence of an adverse event, resulting in a change in empiric antibiotics within 48 h of the first dose. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Outcomes were assessed in all randomised participants with outcome data (intention-to-treat population) and in all individuals who received treatment as allocated and did not have any major protocol violations (per-protocol population). For home treatment to be non-inferior to hospital treatment, the difference between groups in the proportion of children with treatment failure in the intention-to-treat population had to be less than 15%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02334124.
Findings
Between Jan 9, 2015, and June 15, 2017, we screened 1135 children for eligibility, of whom 190 were randomly assigned to receive ceftriaxone at home (n=95) or flucloxacillin in hospital (n=95). The intention-to-treat analysis comprised 188 children (93 in the home group and 95 in the hospital group) because two children in the home group were found to be ineligible after randomisation and were excluded. Treatment failure occurred in two (2%) children in the home group and in seven (7%) children in the hospital group (risk difference −5·2%, 95% CI −11·3 to 0·8, p=0·088). In the per-protocol analysis, treatment failure occurred in one (1%) of 89 children in the home group and in seven (8%) of 91 children in the hospital group (−6·5%, −12·4 to −0·7). Fewer children treated at home than in hospital had an adverse event (two [2%] vs ten [11%]; p=0·048). There was no difference between groups in rates of nasal acquisition of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or gastrointestinal acquisition of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing bacteria or Clostridium difficile after 3 months.
Interpretation
Home treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone is not inferior to treatment in hospital with intravenous flucloxacillin for children with cellulitis. The standard of care for the intravenous treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis in children should be home or outpatient care when feasible.

abstract = "Summary
Background
A multidrug-resistant co-lineage of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, named KEL1/PLA1, spread across Cambodia in 2008–13, causing high rates of treatment failure with the frontline combination therapy dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Here, we report on the evolution and spread of KEL1/PLA1 in subsequent years.
Methods
For this genomic epidemiology study, we analysed whole genome sequencing data from P falciparum clinical samples collected from patients with malaria between 2007 and 2018 from Cambodia, Laos, northeastern Thailand, and Vietnam, through the MalariaGEN P falciparum Community Project. Previously unpublished samples were provided by two large-scale multisite projects: the Tracking Artemisinin Resistance Collaboration II (TRAC2) and the Genetic Reconnaissance in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GenRe-Mekong) project. By investigating genome-wide relatedness between parasites, we inferred patterns of shared ancestry in the KEL1/PLA1 population.
Findings
We analysed 1673 whole genome sequences that passed quality filters, and determined KEL1/PLA1 status in 1615. Before 2009, KEL1/PLA1 was only found in western Cambodia; by 2016–17 its prevalence had risen to higher than 50% in all of the surveyed countries except for Laos. In northeastern Thailand and Vietnam, KEL1/PLA1 exceeded 80% of the most recent P falciparum parasites. KEL1/PLA1 parasites maintained high genetic relatedness and low diversity, reflecting a recent common origin. Several subgroups of highly related parasites have recently emerged within this co-lineage, with diverse geographical distributions. The three largest of these subgroups (n=84, n=79, and n=47) mostly emerged since 2016 and were all present in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. These expanding subgroups carried new mutations in the crt gene, which arose on a specific genetic background comprising multiple genomic regions. Four newly emerging crt mutations were rare in the early period and became more prevalent by 2016–17 (Thr93Ser, rising to 19·8%; His97Tyr to 11·2%; Phe145Ile to 5·5%; and Ile218Phe to 11·1%).
Interpretation
After emerging and circulating for several years within Cambodia, the P falciparum KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage diversified into multiple subgroups and acquired new genetic features, including novel crt mutations. These subgroups have rapidly spread into neighbouring countries, suggesting enhanced fitness. These findings highlight the urgent need for elimination of this increasingly drug-resistant parasite co-lineage, and the importance of genetic surveillance in accelerating malaria elimination efforts.

abstract = "Summary
In high-income countries, the presentation of tuberculosis is changing, primarily because of migration, and understanding the specific health needs of susceptible populations is becoming increasingly important. Although disseminated tuberculosis is well documented in HIV-positive patients, the disease is poorly described and less expected in HIV-negative individuals. In this Grand Round, we report eight HIV-negative refugees, who presented with extensively disseminated tuberculosis. We discuss the multifactorial causes, such as deprivations during long journeys, precarious living conditions, and the experience of violence, which might add to nutritional factors and chronic disorders, eventually resulting in a state of predisposition to immune deficiency. We also show that disseminated tuberculosis is often difficult to diagnose when pulmonary symptoms are absent. Communication difficulties between refugees and health-care workers are another major hurdle, and every effort should be made to get a valid patient history. This medical history is crucial to guide imaging and other diagnostic procedures to establish a definite diagnosis, which should be confirmed by a positive tuberculosis culture. Because many of these patients are at risk for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, drug susceptibility testing is imperative to guide therapy. In the absence of treatment guidelines for this entity, clinicians can determine treatment duration according to recommendations provided for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and affected organs. Paradoxical expansion of tuberculous lesions during therapy should be treated with corticosteroids. In many cases, treatment duration must be individualised and might even exceed 12 months."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Most tuberculosis-related deaths in people with HIV could be prevented with earlier diagnosis and treatment. The only commercially available tuberculosis point-of-care test (Alere Determine TB LAM Ag [AlereLAM]) has suboptimal sensitivity, which restricts its use in clinical practice. The novel Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM (FujiLAM) assay has been developed to improve the sensitivity of AlereLAM. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the FujiLAM assay for the detection of tuberculosis in hospital inpatients with HIV compared with the AlereLAM assay.
Methods
For this diagnostic accuracy study, we assessed biobanked urine samples obtained from the FIND Specimen Bank and the University of Cape Town Biobank, which had been collected from hospital inpatients (aged ≥18 years) with HIV during three independent prospective cohort studies done at two South African hospitals. Urine samples were tested using FujiLAM and AlereLAM assays. The conduct and reporting of each test was done blind to other test results. The primary objective was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of FujiLAM compared with AlereLAM, against microbiological and composite reference standards (including clinical diagnoses).
Findings
Between April 18, 2018, and May 3, 2018, urine samples from 968 hospital inpatients with HIV were evaluated. The prevalence of microbiologically-confirmed tuberculosis was 62% and the median CD4 count was 86 cells per μL. Using the microbiological reference standard, the estimated sensitivity of FujiLAM was 70·4% (95% CI 53·0 to 83·1) compared with 42·3% (31·7 to 51·8) for AlereLAM (difference 28·1%) and the estimated specificity of FujiLAM was 90·8% (86·0 to 94·4) and 95·0% (87·7–98·8) for AlereLAM (difference −4·2%). Against the composite reference standard, the specificity of both assays was higher (95·7% [92·0 to 98·0] for FujiLAM vs 98·2% [95·7 to 99·6] for AlereLAM; difference −2·5%), but the sensitivity of both assays was lower (64·9% [50·1 to 76·7] for FujiLAM vs 38·2% [28·1 to 47·3] for AlereLAM; difference 26·7%).
Interpretation
In comparison to AlereLAM, FujiLAM offers superior diagnostic sensitivity, while maintaining specificity, and could transform rapid point-of-care tuberculosis diagnosis for hospital inpatients with HIV. The applicability of FujiLAM for settings of intended use requires prospective assessment.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection worldwide. National screening programmes and antibiotic treatment have failed to decrease incidence, and to date no vaccines against genital chlamydia have been tested in clinical trials. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity, in humans, of a novel chlamydia vaccine based on a recombinant protein subunit (CTH522) in a prime–boost immunisation schedule.
Methods
This phase 1, first-in-human, double-blind, parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was done at Hammersmith Hospital in London, UK, in healthy women aged 19–45 years. Participants were randomly assigned (3:3:1) to three groups: CTH522 adjuvanted with CAF01 liposomes (CTH522:CAF01), CTH522 adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide (CTH522:AH), or placebo (saline). Participants received three intramuscular injections of 85 μg vaccine (with adjuvant) or placebo to the deltoid region of the arm at 0, 1, and 4 months, followed by two intranasal administrations of 30 μg unadjuvanted vaccine or placebo (one in each nostril) at months 4·5 and 5·0. The primary outcome was safety and the secondary outcome was humoral immunogenicity (anti-CTH522 IgG seroconversion). This study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT02787109.
Findings
Between Aug 15, 2016, and Feb 13, 2017, 35 women were randomly assigned (15 to CTH522:CAF01, 15 to CTH522:AH, and five to placebo). 32 (91%) received all five vaccinations and all participants were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. No related serious adverse reactions were reported, and the most frequent adverse events were mild local injection-site reactions, which were reported in all (15 [100%] of 15) participants in the two vaccine groups and in three (60%) of five participants in the placebo group (p=0·0526 for both comparisons). Intranasal vaccination was not associated with a higher frequency of related local reactions (reported in seven [47%] of 15 participants in the active treatment groups vs three [60%] of five in the placebo group; p=1·000). Both CTH522:CAF01 and CTH522:AH induced anti-CTH522 IgG seroconversion in 15 (100%) of 15 participants after five immunisations, whereas no participants in the placebo group seroconverted. CTH522:CAF01 showed accelerated seroconversion, increased IgG titres, an enhanced mucosal antibody profile, and a more consistent cell-mediated immune response profile compared with CTH522:AH.
Interpretation
CTH522 adjuvanted with either CAF01 or aluminium hydroxide appears to be safe and well tolerated. Both vaccines were immunogenic, although CTH522:CAF01 had a better immunogenicity profile, holding promise for further clinical development.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Results from a previous phase 3 study showed efficacy of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine against severe and clinical malaria in children (in 11 sites in Africa) during a 3–4-year follow-up. We aimed to investigate malaria incidence up to 7 years postvaccination in three of the sites of the initial study.
Methods
In the initial phase 3 study, infants aged 6–12 weeks and children aged 5–17 months were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive four RTS,S/AS01 doses (four-dose group), three RTS,S/AS01 doses and a comparator dose (three-dose group), or four comparator doses (control group). In this open-label extension study in Korogwe (Tanzania), Kombewa (Kenya), and Nanoro (Burkina Faso), we assessed severe malaria incidences as the primary outcome for 3 additional years (January, 2014, to December, 2016), up to 6 years (younger children) or 7 years (older children) postprimary vaccination in the modified intention-to-treat population (ie, participants who received at least one dose of the study vaccine). As secondary outcomes, we evaluated clinical malaria incidences and serious adverse events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02207816.
Findings
We enrolled 1739 older children (aged 5–7 years) and 1345 younger children (aged 3–5 years). During the 3-year extension, 66 severe malaria cases were reported, resulting in severe malaria incidence of 0·004 cases per person-years at risk (PPY; 95% CI 0–0·033) in the four-dose group, 0·007 PPY (0·001–0·052) in the three-dose group, and 0·009 PPY (0·001–0·066) in the control group in the older children category and a vaccine efficacy against severe malaria that did not contribute significantly to the overall efficacy (four-dose group 53·7% [95% CI −13·7 to 81·1], p=0·093; three-dose group 23·3% [–67·1 to 64·8], p=0·50). In younger children, severe malaria incidences were 0·007 PPY (0·001–0·058) in the four-dose group, 0·007 PPY (0·001–0·054) in the three-dose group, and 0·011 PPY (0·001–0·083) in the control group. Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria also did not contribute significantly to the overall efficacy (four-dose group 32·1% [–53·1 to 69·9], p=0·35; three-dose group 37·6% [–44·4 to 73·0], p=0·27). Malaria transmission was still occurring as evidenced by an incidence of clinical malaria ranging from 0·165 PPY to 3·124 PPY across all study groups and sites. In older children, clinical malaria incidence was 1·079 PPY (95% CI 0·152–7·662) in the four-dose group, 1·108 PPY (0·156–7·868) in the three-dose group, and 1·016 PPY (0·14–7·213) in the control group. In younger children, malaria incidence was 1·632 PPY (0·23–11·59), 1·563 PPY (0·22–11·104), and 1·686 PPY (0·237–11·974), respectively. In the older age category in Nanoro, clinical malaria incidence was higher in the four-dose (2·444 PPY; p=0·011) and three-dose (2·411 PPY; p=0·034) groups compared with the control group (1·998 PPY). Three cerebral malaria episodes and five meningitis cases, but no vaccine-related severe adverse events, were reported.
Interpretation
Overall, severe malaria incidence was low in all groups, with no evidence of rebound in RTS,S/AS01 recipients, despite an increased incidence of clinical malaria in older children who received RTS,S/AS01 compared with the comparator group in Nanoro. No safety signal was identified.

Background
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus causes a highly fatal lower-respiratory tract infection. There are as yet no licensed MERS vaccines or therapeutics. This study (WRAIR-2274) assessed the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the GLS-5300 MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine in healthy adults.
Methods
This study was a phase 1, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study of GLS-5300 done at the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research Clinical Trials Center (Silver Spring, MD, USA). We enrolled healthy adults aged 18–50 years; exclusion criteria included previous infection or treatment of MERS. Eligible participants were enrolled sequentially using a dose-escalation protocol to receive 0·67 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg GLS-5300 administered by trained clinical site staff via a single intramuscular 1 mL injection at each vaccination at baseline, week 4, and week 12 followed immediately by co-localised intramuscular electroporation. Enrolment into the higher dose groups occurred after a safety monitoring committee reviewed the data following vaccination of the first five participants at the previous lower dose in each group. The primary outcome of the study was safety, assessed in all participants who received at least one study treatment and for whom post-dose study data were available, during the vaccination period with follow-up through to 48 weeks after dose 3. Safety was measured by the incidence of adverse events; administration site reactions and pain; and changes in safety laboratory parameters. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT02670187) and is completed.
Findings
Between Feb 17 and July 22, 2016, we enrolled 75 individuals and allocated 25 each to 0·67 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg GLS-5300. No vaccine-associated serious adverse events were reported. The most common adverse events were injection-site reactions, reported in 70 participants (93%) of 75. Overall, 73 participants (97%) of 75 reported at least one solicited adverse event; the most common systemic symptoms were headache (five [20%] with 0·67 mg, 11 [44%] with 2 mg, and seven [28%] with 6 mg), and malaise or fatigue (five [20%] with 0·67 mg, seven [28%] with 2 mg, and two [8%] with 6 mg). The most common local solicited symptoms were administration site pain (23 [92%] with all three doses) and tenderness (21 [84%] with all three doses). Most solicited symptoms were reported as mild (19 [76%] with 0·67 mg, 20 [80%] with 2 mg, and 17 [68%] with 6 mg) and were self-limiting. Unsolicited symptoms were reported for 56 participants (75%) of 75 and were deemed treatment-related for 26 (35%). The most common unsolicited adverse events were infections, occurring in 27 participants (36%); six (8%) were deemed possibly related to study treatment. There were no laboratory abnormalities of grade 3 or higher that were related to study treatment; laboratory abnormalities were uncommon, except for 15 increases in creatine phosphokinase in 14 participants (three participants in the 0·67 mg group, three in the 2 mg group, and seven in the 6 mg group). Of these 15 increases, five (33%) were deemed possibly related to study treatment (one in the 2 mg group and four in the 6 mg group). Seroconversion measured by S1-ELISA occurred in 59 (86%) of 69 participants and 61 (94%) of 65 participants after two and three vaccinations, respectively. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 34 (50%) of 68 participants. T-cell responses were detected in 47 (71%) of 66 participants after two vaccinations and in 44 (76%) of 58 participants after three vaccinations. There were no differences in immune responses between dose groups after 6 weeks. At week 60, vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were detected in 51 (77%) of 66 participants and 42 (64%) of 66, respectively.
Interpretation
The GLS-5300 MERS coronavirus vaccine was well tolerated with no vaccine-associated serious adverse events. Immune responses were dose-independent, detected in more than 85% of participants after two vaccinations, and durable through 1 year of follow-up. The data support further development of the GLS-5300 vaccine, including additional studies to test the efficacy of GLS-5300 in a region endemic for MERS coronavirus.

Menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mTSS) is a life-threatening disease caused by superantigen-producing Staphylococcus aureus. Incidence ranges from 0·03 to 0·50 cases per 100 000 people, with overall mortality around 8%. In this Grand Round, we present the case of a previously healthy 23-year-old menstruating woman who was diagnosed with mTSS after she presented at our hospital with a septic condition for the second time. The diagnosis was confirmed by fulfilment of the clinical criteria outlined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; fever, rash, desquamation, hypotension, and multi-system involvement) as well as a nasal swab positive for the S aureus strain and presence of the gene encoding for toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1). In the early 1980s, when mTSS was first described, use of tampons was considered the main risk factor. Today, the complex interplay between pathogenic factors of S aureus, immunological mechanisms of the host, and changes in the vaginal ecosystem during menstruation has broadened current understanding of the disease, and the CDC criteria have appreciable limitations in everyday clinical practice."

Sporotrichosis is an infection caused by the dimorphic fungus Sporothrix schenckii and related species that often arises from traumatic inoculation of inhabited soil and organic debris into skin. The infection is usually limited to the skin in immunocompetent patients, usually as lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis. Accurate diagnosis rests on clinical data and culture, and might be facilitated by biopsy identification of suppurative and granulomatous inflammation with fungal elements. In this Grand Round, we present a dramatic case of cutaneous sporotrichosis initially presented with an atypical large ulcer without associated lymphocutaneous spread, clinically mimicking pyoderma gangrenosum, and subsequently progressed to disseminated sporotrichosis in the setting of iatrogenic immunosuppression. We further review the clinical features, risk factors, and treatment of these disseminated sporotrichosis cases, and discuss the need for improved awareness of this fungus' potential link to cause disseminated and invasive fungal infections."

abstract = "Summary
In the past 5–10 years, Venezuela has faced a severe economic crisis, precipitated by political instability and declining oil revenue. Public health provision has been affected particularly. In this Review, we assess the impact of Venezuela's health-care crisis on vector-borne diseases, and the spillover into neighbouring countries. Between 2000 and 2015, Venezuela witnessed a 359% increase in malaria cases, followed by a 71% increase in 2017 (411 586 cases) compared with 2016 (240 613). Neighbouring countries, such as Brazil, have reported an escalating trend of imported malaria cases from Venezuela, from 1538 in 2014 to 3129 in 2017. In Venezuela, active Chagas disease transmission has been reported, with seroprevalence in children (<10 years), estimated to be as high as 12·5% in one community tested (n=64). Dengue incidence increased by more than four times between 1990 and 2016. The estimated incidence of chikungunya during its epidemic peak is 6975 cases per 100 000 people and that of Zika virus is 2057 cases per 100 000 people. The re-emergence of many vector-borne diseases represents a public health crisis in Venezuela and has the possibility of severely undermining regional disease elimination efforts. National, regional, and global authorities must take action to address these worsening epidemics and prevent their expansion beyond Venezuelan borders."

abstract = "Summary
Background
It is unknown whether increased use of antibiotics in a community increases the risk of acquiring antibiotic resistance by individuals living in that community, regardless of prior individual antibiotic consumption and other risk factors for antibiotic resistance.
Methods
We used a hierarchical multivariate logistic regression approach to evaluate the association between neighbourhood fluoroquinolone consumption and individual risk of colonisation or infection of the urinary tract with fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli. We did a population-based case-control study of adults (aged ≥22 years) living in 1733 predefined geographical statistical areas (neighbourhoods) in Israel. A multilevel study design was used to analyse data derived from electronic medical records of patients enrolled in the Clalit state-mandated health service.
Findings
300 105 events with E coli growth and 1 899 168 cultures with no growth were identified from medical records and included in the analysis. 45 427 (16·8%) of 270 190 women and 8835 (29·5%) of 29 915 men had fluoroquinolone-resistant E coli events. We found an independent association between residence in a neighbourhood with higher antibiotic consumption and an increased risk of bacteriuria caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant E coli. Odds ratios (ORs) for the quintiles with higher neighbourhood consumption (compared with the lowest quintile) were 1·15 (95% CI 1·06–1·24), 1·31 (1·20–1·43), 1·41 (1·29–1·54), and 1·51 (1·38–1·65) for women, and 1·17 (1·02–1·35), 1·24 (1·06–1·45), 1·35 (1·15–1·59), and 1·50 (1·26–1·77) for men. Results remained significant when the analysis was restricted to patients who had not consumed fluoroquinolones themselves.
Interpretation
These data suggest that increased use of antibiotics in specific geographical areas is associated with an increased personal risk of acquiring antibiotic-resistant bacteria, independent of personal history of antibiotic consumption and other known risk factors for antimicrobial resistance.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The real-time generation of information about pathogen genomes has become a vital goal for transmission analysis and characterisation in rapid outbreak responses. In response to the recently established genomic capacity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we explored the real-time generation of genomic information at the start of the 2018 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu Province.
Methods
We used targeted-enrichment sequencing to produce two coding-complete Ebola virus genomes 5 days after declaration of the EVD outbreak in North Kivu. Subsequent sequencing efforts yielded an additional 46 genomes. Genomic information was used to assess early transmission, medical countermeasures, and evolution of Ebola virus.
Findings
The genomic information demonstrated that the EVD outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri Provinces was distinct from the 2018 EVD outbreak in Équateur Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Primer and probe mismatches to Ebola virus were identified in silico for all deployed diagnostic PCR assays, with the exception of the Cepheid GeneXpert GP assay.
Interpretation
The first two coding-complete genomes provided actionable information in real-time for the deployment of the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein vaccine, available therapeutics, and sequence-based diagnostic assays. Based on the mutations identified in the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein (GP12) observed in all 48 genomes, deployed monoclonal antibody therapeutics (mAb114 and ZMapp) should be efficacious against the circulating Ebola virus variant. Rapid Ebola virus genomic characterisation should be included in routine EVD outbreak response procedures to ascertain efficacy of medical countermeasures.

abstract = "Summary
Mucormycosis is a difficult to diagnose rare disease with high morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis is often delayed, and disease tends to progress rapidly. Urgent surgical and medical intervention is lifesaving. Guidance on the complex multidisciplinary management has potential to improve prognosis, but approaches differ between health-care settings. From January, 2018, authors from 33 countries in all United Nations regions analysed the published evidence on mucormycosis management and provided consensus recommendations addressing differences between the regions of the world as part of the “One World One Guideline” initiative of the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM). Diagnostic management does not differ greatly between world regions. Upon suspicion of mucormycosis appropriate imaging is strongly recommended to document extent of disease and is followed by strongly recommended surgical intervention. First-line treatment with high-dose liposomal amphotericin B is strongly recommended, while intravenous isavuconazole and intravenous or delayed release tablet posaconazole are recommended with moderate strength. Both triazoles are strongly recommended salvage treatments. Amphotericin B deoxycholate is recommended against, because of substantial toxicity, but may be the only option in resource limited settings. Management of mucormycosis depends on recognising disease patterns and on early diagnosis. Limited availability of contemporary treatments burdens patients in low and middle income settings. Areas of uncertainty were identified and future research directions specified."

abstract = "Summary
Background
To end the global tuberculosis epidemic, latent tuberculosis infection needs to be addressed. All standard treatments for latent tuberculosis contain drugs to which multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis is resistant. We aimed to estimate the global burden of multidrug-resistant latent tuberculosis infection to inform tuberculosis elimination policy.
Methods
By fitting a flexible statistical model to tuberculosis drug resistance surveillance and survey data collated by WHO, we estimated national trends in the proportion of new tuberculosis cases that were caused by MDR strains. We used these data as a proxy for the proportion of new infections caused by MDR M tuberculosis and multiplied trends in annual risk of infection from previous estimates of the burden of latent tuberculosis to generate trends in the annual risk of infection with MDR M tuberculosis. These estimates were used in a cohort model to estimate changes in the global and national prevalence of latent infection with MDR M tuberculosis. We also estimated recent infection levels (ie, in 2013 and 2014) and made predictions for the future burden of MDR tuberculosis in 2035 and 2050.
Findings
19·1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 16·4 million–21·7 million) people were latently infected with MDR tuberculosis in 2014—a global prevalence of 0·3% (95% UI 0·2–0·3). MDR strains accounted for 1·2% (95% UI 1·0–1·4) of the total latent tuberculosis burden overall, but for 2·9% (95% UI 2·6–3·1) of the burden among children younger than 15 years (risk ratio for those younger than 15 years vs those aged 15 years or older 2·65 [95% UI 2·11–3·25]). Recent latent infection with MDR M tuberculosis meant that 1·9 million (95% UI 1·7 million–2·3 million) people globally were at high risk of active MDR tuberculosis in 2015.
Interpretation
We estimate that three in every 1000 people globally carry latent MDR tuberculosis infection, and prevalence of MDR M tuberculosis in those with latent tuberculosis infection is more than double among those younger than 15 years. If current trends continue, the proportion of latent tuberculosis caused by MDR strains will increase, which will pose serious challenges for management of latent tuberculosis—a cornerstone of tuberculosis elimination strategies.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The duration of protection provided by varicella vaccines is unclear. We assessed the 10-year vaccine efficacy of two doses of a combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV), one live attenuated varicella vaccine (V) dose given after one measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) dose (MMR + V), versus two MMR doses (control vaccine) for the prevention of confirmed varicella.
Methods
This was a phase 3b follow-up of an observer-blinded, randomised, controlled trial. In phase a, children aged 12–22 months (at first vaccination) from Czech Republic (Czechia), Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Sweden were randomly assigned by computer-generated randomisation list (3:3:1) to receive two doses of MMRV, one dose of MMR and one dose of varicella vaccine, or two doses of MMR, 42 days apart. Varicella cases were confirmed by detection of viral DNA, or epidemiological link and clinical assessment, by an independent data monitoring committee; disease severity was based on a modified Vázquez scale. Hazard ratios for MMRV and MMR + V versus MMR estimated in the per-protocol cohort using a Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to calculate vaccine efficacy and 95% CI. Serious adverse events were recorded throughout the study in all vaccinated children. Study objectives were secondary and descriptive. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00226499.
Findings
Between Sept 1, 2005, and May 10, 2006, 5803 children (mean age 14·2 months, SD 2·5) were vaccinated. The per-protocol cohort included 2279 children from the MMRV group, 2266 from the MMR + V group, and 744 from the MMR group. From baseline to a median follow-up of 9·8 years, 76 (3%) children in the MMRV group, 469 (21%) in the MMR + V group, and 352 (47%) in the MMR group had varicella. Vaccine efficacy against all varicella was 95·4% (95% CI 94·0–96·4) for MMRV and 67·2% (62·3–71·5) for MMR + V; vaccine efficacy against moderate or severe varicella was 99·1% (97·9–99·6) for MMRV and 89·5% (86·1–92·1) for MMR + V. During phase b, serious adverse events were reported by 290 (15%) of 1961 children in the MMRV group, 317 (16%) of 1978 in the MMR + V group, and 93 (15%) of 641 in the MMR group. There were no treatment-related deaths.
Interpretation
The 10-years vaccine efficacy observed, suggests that a two-dose schedule of varicella vaccine provided optimum long-term protection for the prevention of varicella by offering individual protection against all severities of disease and leading to a potential reduction in transmission, as observed in the US experience with universal mass vaccination.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Aetiological data for neonatal infections are essential to inform policies and programme strategies, but such data are scarce from sub-Saharan Africa. We therefore completed a systematic review and meta-analysis of available data from the African continent since 1980, with a focus on regional differences in aetiology and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the past decade (2008–18).
Methods
We included data for microbiologically confirmed invasive bacterial infection including meningitis and AMR among neonates in sub-Saharan Africa and assessed the quality of scientific reporting according to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology for Newborn Infection (STROBE-NI) checklist. We calculated pooled proportions for reported bacterial isolates and AMR.
Findings
We included 151 studies comprising data from 84 534 neonates from 26 countries, almost all of which were hospital-based. Of the 82 studies published between 2008 and 2018, insufficient details were reported regarding most STROBE-NI items. Regarding culture positive bacteraemia or sepsis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp, and Escherichia coli accounted for 25% (95% CI 21–29), 21% (16–27), and 10% (8–10) respectively. For meningitis, the predominant identified causes were group B streptococcus 25% (16–33), Streptococcus pneumoniae 17% (9–6), and S aureus 12% (3–25). Resistance to WHO recommended β-lactams was reported in 614 (68%) of 904 cases and resistance to aminoglycosides in 317 (27%) of 1176 cases.
Interpretation
Hospital-acquired neonatal infections and AMR are a major burden in Africa. More population-based neonatal infection studies and improved routine surveillance are needed to improve clinical care, plan health systems approaches, and address AMR. Future studies should be reported according to standardised reporting guidelines, such as STROBE-NI, to aid comparability and reduce research waste.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine threatens the antimalarial effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to assess the associations between markers of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in P falciparum and the effectiveness of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine IPTp for malaria-associated outcomes.
Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched databases (from Jan 1, 1990 to March 1, 2018) for clinical studies (aggregated data) or surveys (individual participant data) that reported data on low birthweight (primary outcome) and malaria by sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine IPTp dose, and for studies that reported on molecular markers of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. Studies that involved only HIV-infected women or combined interventions were excluded. We did a random-effects meta-analysis (clinical studies) or multivariate log-binomial regression (surveys) to obtain summarised dose-response data (relative risk reduction [RRR]) and multivariate meta-regression to explore the modifying effects of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance (as indicated by Ala437Gly, Lys540Glu, and Ala581Gly substitutions in the dhps gene). This study is registered with PROSPERO, number 42016035540.
Findings
Of 1097 records screened, 57 studies were included in the aggregated-data meta-analysis (including 59 457 births). The RRR for low birthweight declined with increasing prevalence of dhps Lys540Glu (ptrend=0·0060) but not Ala437Gly (ptrend=0·35). The RRR was 7% (95% CI 0 to 13) in areas of high resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Lys540Glu ≥90% in east and southern Africa; n=11), 21% (14 to 29) in moderate-resistance areas (Ala437Gly ≥90% [central and west Africa], or Lys540Glu ≥30% to <90% [east and southern Africa]; n=16), and 27% (21 to 33) in low-resistance areas (Ala437Gly <90% [central and west Africa], or Lys540Glu <30% [east and southern Africa]; n=30; ptrend=0·0054 [univariate], I2=69·5%). The overall RRR in all resistance strata was 21% (17 to 25). In the analysis of individual participant data from 13 surveys (42 394 births), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine IPTp was associated with reduced prevalence of low birthweight in areas with a Lys540Glu prevalence of more than 90% and Ala581Gly prevalence of less than 10% (RRR 10% [7 to 12]), but not in those with an Ala581Gly prevalence of 10% or higher (pooled Ala581Gly prevalence 37% [range 29 to 46]; RRR 0·5% [–16 to 14]; 2326 births).
Interpretation
The effectiveness of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine IPTp is reduced in areas with high resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine among P falciparum parasites, but remains associated with reductions in low birthweight even in areas where dhps Lys540Glu prevalence exceeds 90% but where the sextuple-mutant parasite (harbouring the additional dhps Ala581Gly mutation) is uncommon. Therapeutic alternatives to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine IPTp are needed in areas where the prevalence of the sextuple-mutant parasite exceeds 37%.

People in prison have multiple complex health and social care needs. These are likely to be the result of a combination of overlapping, and sometimes interlinked, risk factors for infection, ill-health, and incarceration, such as problem drug use. Incarceration can represent a unique opportunity to make high-quality health care available to people in prison and to target socially deprived groups who are often medically underserved when living in the community they originate from. In recent years, international and European institutions have increasingly acknowledged the importance of treating prison health as an inseparable component of public health. However, numerous challenges hamper the successful implementation of such a concept, including the need for evidence-based decision making, intersectoral partnerships, and better monitoring systems. New initiatives are ongoing in the EU that might contribute to bring about positive changes, such as the publication of the first evidence-based public health guidance on prevention and control of communicable diseases in prison settings."

The ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in the Ituri and North Kivu Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which began in July, 2018, is the second largest ever recorded. Despite civil unrest, outbreak control measures and the administration of experimental therapies and a vaccine have been initiated. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of candidate therapies and diagnostic tests with the outbreak strain Ituri Ebola virus. Lacking a virus isolate from this outbreak, a recombinant Ituri Ebola virus was compared with a similarly engineered Makona virus from the 2013–16 outbreak.
Methods
Using Ebola virus sequences provided by organisations in DR Congo and a reverse genetics system, we generated an authentic Ebola virus from the ongoing outbreak in Ituri and North Kivu provinces. To relate this virus to other Ebola viruses in DR Congo, we did a phylogenetic analysis of representative complete Ebola virus genome sequences from previous outbreaks. We evaluated experimental therapies being tested in clinical trials in DR Congo, including remdesivir and ZMapp monoclonal antibodies, for their ability to inhibit the growth of infectious Ituri Ebola virus in cell culture. We also tested diagnostic assays for detection of the Ituri Ebola virus sequence.
Findings
The phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome sequences from each Ebola virus outbreak suggests there are at least two Ebola virus strains in DR Congo, which have independently crossed into the human population. The Ituri Ebola strain initially grew slower than the Makona strain, yet reached similar mean yields of 3 × 107 50% tissue culture infectious dose by 72 h infection in Huh-7 cells. Ituri Ebola virus was similar to Makona in its susceptibility to inhibition by remdesivir and to neutralisation by monoclonal antibodies from ZMapp and other monoclonal antibodies. Remdesivir inhibited Ituri Ebola virus at a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 12nM (with a selectivity index of 303) and Makona Ebola virus at 13nM (with a selectivity index of 279). The Zmapp monoclonal antibodies 2G4 and 4G7 neutralised Ituri Ebola virus with a mean EC50 of 0·24 μg/mL and 0·48 μg/mL, and Makona Ebola virus with a mean EC50 of 0·45 μg/mL and 0·2 μg/mL. The Xpert Ebola and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention real-time RT-qPCR diagnostic assays detected Ituri and Makona Ebola virus sequences with similar sensitivities and efficiencies, despite primer site binding mismatches in the Ituri Ebola virus.
Interpretation
Our findings provide a rationale for the continued testing of investigational therapies, confirm the effectiveness of the diagnostic assays used in the region, and establish a paradigm for the use of reverse genetics to inform response activities in an outbreak.

Background
Sub-Saharan Africa has a large population of people with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, yet little is known about HCV among people who inject drugs this region. We assessed the prevalence of HCV mono-infection and HIV–HCV co-infection, and the estimated incidence, genotypes, and risk behaviours associated with HCV among people who inject drugs in Kenya.
Methods
People aged 18 years or older who were living in Nairobi, coastal Kenya, or western Kenya, had a history of injection drug use, and had used any illicit drugs in the past 12 months were recruited at needle and syringe programme sites using respondent-driven sampling. Participants were screened for the presence of an anti-HCV antibody. Those who were anti-HCV positive underwent confirmatory HCV RNA testing, and those with detectable HCV RNA were genotyped. Participants were interviewed regarding parenteral risk behaviours and exposure to services received at the needle and syringe programme sites. We examined correlates of HCV infection and HIV–HCV co-infection using bivariate and multivariate regression, and estimated HCV incidence.
Findings
Of 2188 enrolled participants, 291 (13%) were anti-HCV positive: 183 (22%) of 842 participants in coastal Kenya, 105 (13%) of 817 in Nairobi, and three (1%) of 529 in western Kenya. 284 anti-HCV-positive participants underwent successful HCV RNA testing, of whom 230 (81%) were viraemic. Estimated incidence rates of anti-HCV positivity per 100 person-years were 6·31 in coastal Kenya, 3·19 in Nairobi, and 0·22 in western Kenya. HCV incidence rate was greater in coastal Kenya compared with Nairobi (incidence rate ratio 1·97 [95% CI 1·35–2·93], p=0·0001) and the western region (28·17 [7·55–236·58], p<0·0001). In the coastal region, history of incarceration, more years injecting, more injections in the past month, and receptive cooker sharing were associated with increased risk of HCV, while female sex, more years injecting, more injections in the past month, and regular use of a syringe with a detachable needle were associated with HCV risk in Nairobi. HCV prevalence among HIV-positive participants was 50% (66 of 131 participants) in coastal Kenya, 35% (42 of 121) in Nairobi, and 4% (one of 23) in western Kenya. Risk factors for HIV–HCV co-infection were similar to those observed for HCV mono-infection. The prevailing genotypes were 1a (51%), 4a (47%), and mixed (2%; three 1a/4a and one 1a/2b).
Interpretation
HCV prevalence, estimated incidence, and risk behaviours among people who inject drugs in Kenya vary with region, with the highest estimated incidence observed in coastal Kenya. These findings should be used to inform focused strategies to reduce HCV transmission, such as expansion of needle and syringe programmes, upscaling of opioid agonist therapy, and treatment as prevention in regions affected by injection drug use and HCV.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy after hospital admission is increasingly popular, but its use to avoid admission to hospital altogether by treating patients wholly as outpatients remains uncommon in children. One reason for the low use of treatment at home is the scarcity of evidence of its cost-effectiveness. In this planned follow-up analysis of the Cellulitis at Home or Inpatient in Children from the Emergency Department (CHOICE) trial, we aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of an admission avoidance pathway, in which children were treated at home, compared with standard hospital care for the intravenous treatment of moderate or severe cellulitis.
Methods
We did a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare home treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone versus hospital treatment with intravenous flucloxacillin in children aged 6 months to 18 years who had presented to the emergency department at The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia, with moderate or severe uncomplicated cellulitis. We included costs from two sources: institutional costs at a patient level and expenses incurred by families. We measured effectiveness with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), which we derived from the Child Health Utility 9D questionnaire, and a clinical outcome of treatment failure, which was the primary outcome of the CHOICE trial. We planned to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, defined as the difference between groups in total cost divided by the difference between groups in effectiveness. The CHOICE trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02334124.
Findings
We included 180 children who comprised the per-protocol population in the CHOICE trial: 89 children in the home group and 91 children in the hospital group. The institutional cost per patient per episode was significantly lower in the home group than in the hospital group (AUS$1965 vs $3775; p<0·0001). The mean cost incurred per family was $182 for the home group and $593 for the hospital group (p<0·0001). Both measures of effectiveness were significantly better in the home group than in the hospital group: QALYs were 0·005 for the home group versus 0·004 for the hospital group (p<0·0001), and treatment failure occurred in one (1%) patient in the home group versus seven (8%) patients in the hospital group (risk difference −6·5%, 95% CI −12·4 to −0·7; p=0·029). Calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was thus deemed redundant.
Interpretation
Treatment at home was less costly and more effective than standard hospital care for children with moderate or severe cellulitis. These findings support development of this admission avoidance pathway in hospitals.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Identifying new antifungals for cryptococcal meningitis is a priority given the inadequacy of current therapy. Sertraline has previously shown in vitro and in vivo activity against cryptococcus. We aimed to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of adjunctive sertraline in adults with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis compared with placebo.
Methods
In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited HIV-positive adults with cryptococcal meningitis from two hospitals in Uganda. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard therapy with 7–14 days of intravenous amphotericin B (0·7–1·0 mg/kg per day) and oral fluconazole (starting at 800 mg/day) with either adjunctive sertraline or placebo. Sertraline was administered orally or via nasogastric tube at a dose of 400 mg/day for 2 weeks, followed by 200 mg/day for 12 weeks, then tapered off over 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was 18-week survival, analysed by intention-to-treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01802385.
Findings
Between March 9, 2015, and May 29, 2017, we screened 842 patients with suspected meningitis and enrolled 460 of a planned 550 participants, at which point the trial was stopped for futility. Three patients in the sertraline group and three patients in the placebo group were lost to follow-up and therefore discontinued before study end. At 18 weeks, 120 (52%) of 229 patients in the sertraline group and 106 (46%) of 231 patients in the placebo group had died (hazard ratio 1·21, 95% CI 0·93–1·57; p=0·15). The fungal clearance rate from cerebrospinal fluid was similar between groups (0·43 –log10 CFU/mL per day [95% CI 0·37–0·50] in the sertraline group vs 0·47 –log10 CFU/mL per day [0·40–0·54] in the placebo group; p=0·59), as was occurrence of grade 4 or 5 adverse events (72 [31%] of 229 vs 75 [32%] of 231; p=0·98), most of which were associated with amphotericin B toxicity.
Interpretation
Sertraline did not reduce mortality and should not be used to treat patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. The reasons for sertraline inactivity appear to be multifactorial and might be associated with insufficient duration of therapeutic sertraline concentrations.

abstract = "Summary
Estimating the global burden of disease from infections caused by pathogens that have acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is essential for resource allocation and to inform AMR action plans at national and global levels. However, the scarcity of robust and accepted methods to determine burden is widely acknowledged. In this Personal View, we discuss the underlying assumptions, characteristics, limitations, and comparability of the approaches used to quantify mortality from AMR bacterial infections. We show that the global burdens of AMR estimated in previous studies are not comparable because of their different methodological approaches, assumptions, and data used to generate the estimates. The analytical frameworks from previous studies are inadequate, and we conclude that a new approach to the estimation of deaths caused by AMR infection is needed. The innovation of a new approach will require the development of mechanisms to systematically collect a clinical dataset of substantial breadth and quality to support the accurate assessment of burden, combined with decision-making and resource allocation for interventions against AMR. We define key actions required and call for innovative thinking and solutions to address these problems."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Infections with Clostridium difficile are a health threat, yet no products are currently licensed for prevention of primary C difficile infections. Intravenous β-lactam antibiotics are considered to confer a high risk of C difficile infection because of their biliary excretion into the gastrointestinal tract and disruption of the gut microbiome. ribaxamase (SYN-004) is an orally administered β-lactamase that was designed to be given with intravenous β-lactam antibiotics to degrade excess antibiotics in the upper gastrointestinal tract before they disrupt the gut microbiome and lead to C difficile infection. We therefore aimed to determine whether administration of ribaxamase could prevent C difficile infection in patients being treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for a lower respiratory tract infection, thereby supporting continued clinical development.
Methods
In this parallel-group, double-blind, multicentre, phase 2b, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients who had been admitted to a hospital with a lower respiratory tract infection with a pneumonia index score of 90–130 and who were expected to be treated with ceftriaxone for at least 5 days. Patients were recruited from 54 clinical sites in the USA, Canada, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Serbia. We randomly assigned patients older than 50 years to groups (1:1) in blocks of four by use of an interactive web portal; these groups were assigned to receive either 150 mg ribaxamase or placebo four times per day during, and for 72 h after, treatment with ceftriaxone. All patients, clinical investigators, study staff, and sponsor personnel were masked to the study drug assignments. The primary endpoint was the incidence of C difficile infection, as diagnosed by the local laboratory, in patients who received at least one treatment dose, and this outcome was assessed during treatment and for 4 weeks after treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02563106.
Findings
Between Nov 16, 2015, and Nov 10, 2016, we screened 433 patients for inclusion in the study. Of these patients, 20 (5%) patients were excluded from the study (16 [4%] patients did not meet inclusion criteria; four [1%] patients because of dosing restrictions). We enrolled and randomly assigned 413 patients to groups, of whom 207 patients were assigned to receive ceftriaxone plus ribaxamase and 206 patients were assigned to receive ceftriaxone plus placebo. However, one (<1%) patient in the ribaxamase group withdrew consent and was not treated with ribaxamase. During the study and within the 4 weeks after antibiotic treatment, two (1·0%) patients in the ribaxamase group and seven (3·4%) patients in the placebo group were diagnosed with an infection with C difficile (risk reduction 2·4%, 95% CI −0·6 to 5·9; one-sided p=0·045). Adverse events were similar between groups but more deaths were reported in the ribaxamase group (11 deaths vs five deaths in the placebo group). This disparity was due to the higher incidence of deaths attributed to cardiac-associated causes in the ribaxamase group (six deaths vs one death in the placebo group).
Interpretation
In patients treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for lower respiratory tract infections, oral ribaxamase reduced the incidence of C difficile infections compared with placebo. The imbalance in deaths between the groups appeared to be related to the underlying health of the patients. Ribaxamase has the potential to prevent C difficile infection in patients treated with intravenous β-lactam antibiotics, and our findings support continued clinical development of ribaxamase to prevent C difficile infection.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hepatitis D is the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis. Treatment guidelines recommend 1 year of peginterferon alfa, which is effective in 25–30% of patients only. Whether prolonged therapy with peginterferon alfa-2a for 96 weeks and combination therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) would increase hepatitis D virus (HDV) RNA suppression is unknown. We aimed to explore whether prolonged treatment of HDV with 96 weeks of peginterferon would increase HDV RNA response rates and reduces post-treatment relapses.
Methods
We did two parallel, investigator-initiated, multicentre, double-blind randomised, controlled trials at 14 study sites in Germany, Greece, Romania, and Turkey. Patients with chronic HDV infection and compensated liver disease who were aged 18 years or older were eligible for inclusion. All patients were HBsAg positive for at least 7 months, anti-HDV positive for at least 3 months, and HDV-RNA positive at the local laboratory at the screening visit. Patients were ineligible if alanine aminotransferase levels were higher than ten times above the upper limit of normal and if platelet counts were lower than 90 000 per μL, or if they had received interferon therapy or treatment with a nucleoside and nucleotide analogue within the preceding 6 months. Patients were randomly assigned by blinded stratified block randomisation (1:1) to receive 180 μg of peginterferon alfa-2a weekly plus either TDF (300 mg once daily) or placebo for 96 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with undetectable HDV RNA at the end of treatment assessed by intention to treat. The trials are registered as NCT00932971 and NCT01088659.
Findings
Between June 24, 2009, and Feb 28, 2011, we randomly assigned 59 HDV RNA-positive patients to receive peginterferon alfa-2a plus TDF and 61 to receive peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo, including 48 (40%) patients with cirrhosis to the two treatment groups (23 in the peginterferon alfa-2a plus TDF group and 25 in the peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo group). The primary endpoint was achieved in 28 (48%) of 59 patients in the peginterferon alfa-2a plus TDF group and in 20 (33%) of 61 patients in the peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo group (odds ratio 1·84, 95% CI 0·86–3·91, p=0·12). We recorded 944 adverse events (459 in the peginterferon alfa-2a plus TDF group and 485 in the peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo group). The most common adverse events were haematological, behavioural (eg, fatigue), musculoskeletal, influenza-like syndromes, and psychiatric complaints.
Interpretation
Addition of TDF resulted in no significant improvement in HDV RNA response rates at the end of treatment. These findings highlight that alternative treatment options are needed for hepatitis D.

Strengthening governance is an essential strategy to tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at all levels: global, national, regional, and local. To date, no systematic approach to governance of national action plans on AMR exists. To address this issue, we aimed to develop the first governance framework to offer guidance for both the development and assessment of national action plans on AMR. We reviewed health system governance framework reviews to inform the basic structure of our framework, international guidance documents from WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Organisation for Animal Health, and the European Commission, and sought the input of 25 experts from international organisations, government ministries, policy institutes, and academic institutions to develop and refine our framework. The framework consists of 18 domains with 52 indicators that are contained within three governance areas: policy design, implementation tools, and monitoring and evaluation. To consider the dynamic nature of AMR, the framework is conceptualised as a cyclical process, which is responsive to the context and allows for continuous improvement and adaptation of national action plans on AMR."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea represents a global public health threat, and new therapies are needed. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of solithromycin, a fourth generation macrolide, with ceftriaxone plus azithromycin for the treatment of gonorrhoea.
Methods
We did an open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority trial of patients aged 15 years or older with uncomplicated untreated genital gonorrhoea at two sites in Australia and one site in the USA. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive single dose oral solithromycin 1000 mg or intramuscular ceftriaxone 500 mg plus oral azithromycin 1000 mg. Neisseria gonorrhoeae cultures were obtained at baseline and test of cure (day 7 ± 2). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with eradication of genital N gonorrhoeae based on culture at test of cure, assessed in the microbiological intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all randomly assigned patients who received any dose of study drug and had a positive genital culture for N gonorrhoeae at baseline. Non-inferiority of solithromycin was to be concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the between-group differences was greater than −10%. Safety was analysed in all patients who received any dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02210325.
Findings
Between Sept 3, 2014, and Aug 27, 2015, 262 patients were randomly assigned and 261 received treatment (130 in the solithromycin group and 131 in the ceftriaxone plus azithromycin group). In the mITT population, 99 (80%) of 123 patients in the solithromycin group and 109 (84%) of 129 patients in the ceftriaxone plus azithromycin group had N gonorrhoeae eradication at test of cure (difference −4·0%, 95% CI −13·6 to 5·5), thus solithromycin did not meet the criterion for non-inferiority at the prespecified −10% margin. The frequency of adverse events was higher in the solithromycin group than the ceftriaxone plus azithromycin group (69 [53%] of 130 patients vs 45 [34%] of 131 patients), the most common of which were diarrhoea (31 [24%] of 130 patients vs 20 [15%] of 131 patients), and nausea (27 [21%] of 130 patients vs 15 [11%] of 131 patients).

Solithromycin as a single 1000 mg dose is not a suitable alternative to ceftriaxone plus azithromycin as first-line treatment for gonorrhoea. If insufficient duration of solithromycin exposure at the infection site in a subset of individuals was the reason for treatment failures, this might be adequately addressed with dose adjustment. However, any further trials with longer dosing need to consider the potential risk of gastrointestinal effects and liver enzyme elevations.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Prosthetic joint infection is a devastating complication of knee replacement. The risk of developing a prosthetic joint infection is affected by patient, surgical, and health-care system factors. Existing evidence is limited by heterogeneity in populations studied, short follow-up, inadequate power, and does not differentiate early prosthetic joint infection, most likely related to the intervention, from late infection, more likely to occur due to haematogenous bacterial spread. We aimed to assess the overall and time-specific associations of these factors with the risk of revision due to prosthetic joint infection following primary knee replacement.
Methods
In this cohort study, we analysed primary knee replacements done between 2003 and 2013 in England and Wales and the procedures subsequently revised for prosthetic joint infection between 2003 and 2014. Data were obtained from the National Joint Registry linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics data in England and the Patient Episode Database for Wales. Each primary replacement was followed for a minimum of 12 months until the end of the observation period (Dec 31, 2014) or until the date of revision for prosthetic joint infection, revision for another indication, or death (whichever occurred first). We analysed the data using Poisson and piecewise exponential multilevel models to assess the associations between patient, surgical, and health-care system factors and risk of revision for prosthetic joint infection.
Findings
Of 679 010 primary knee replacements done between 2003 and 2013 in England and Wales, 3659 were subsequently revised for an indication of prosthetic joint infection between 2003 and 2014, after a median follow-up of 4·6 years (IQR 2·6–6·9). Male sex (rate ratio [RR] for male vs female patients 1·8 [95% CI 1·7–2·0]), younger age (RR for age ≥80 years vs <60 years 0·5 [0·4–0·6]), higher American Society of Anaesthesiologists [ASA] grade (RR for ASA grade 3–5 vs 1, 1·8 [1·6–2·1]), elevated body-mass index (BMI; RR for BMI ≥30 kg/m2 vs <25 kg/m2 1·5 [1·3–1·6]), chronic pulmonary disease (RR 1·2 [1·1–1·3]), diabetes (RR 1·4 [1·2–1·5]), liver disease (RR 2·2 [1·6–2·9]), connective tissue and rheumatic diseases (RR 1·5 [1·3–1·7]), peripheral vascular disease (RR 1·4 [1·1–1·7]), surgery for trauma (RR 1·9 [1·4–2·6]), previous septic arthritis (RR 4·9 [2·7–7·6]) or inflammatory arthropathy (RR 1·4 [1·2–1·7]), operation under general anaesthesia (RR 1·1 [1·0–1·2]), requirement for tibial bone graft (RR 2·0 [1·3–2·7]), use of posterior stabilised fixed bearing prostheses (RR for posterior stabilised fixed bearing prostheses vs unconstrained fixed bearing prostheses 1·4 [1·3–1·5]) or constrained condylar prostheses (3·5 [2·5–4·7]) were associated with a higher risk of revision for prosthetic joint infection. However, uncemented total, patellofemoral, or unicondylar knee replacement (RR for uncemented vs cemented total knee replacement 0·7 [95% CI 0·6–0·8], RR for patellofemoral vs cemented total knee replacement 0·3 [0·2–0·5], and RR for unicondylar vs cemented total knee replacement 0·5 [0·5–0·6]) were associated with lower risk of revision for prosthetic joint infection. Most of these factors had time-specific effects, depending on the time period post-surgery.
Interpretation
We have identified several risk factors for revision for prosthetic joint infection following knee replacement. Some of these factors are modifiable, and the use of targeted interventions or strategies could lead to a reduced risk of revision for prosthetic joint infection. Non-modifiable factors and the time-specific nature of the effects we have observed will allow clinicians to appropriately counsel patients preoperatively and tailor follow-up regimens.

abstract = "Summary
Neglected tropical diseases afflict more than 1 billion of the world's poorest people. Pharmaceutical donations of preventive chemotherapy for neglected tropical diseases enable the largest en masse treatment campaigns globally with respect to the number of people targeted for treatment. However, the blanket distribution of medicines at no cost to individuals in need of treatment does not guarantee that those individuals are treated. In this Personal View, we aim to examine the next steps that need to be taken towards ensuring equitable treatment access, including health system integration and the role of endemic countries in ensuring medicines are delivered to patients. We argue that the expansion of medicine donation programmes and the development of new medicines are not the primary solutions to sustaining and expanding the growth of neglected tropical disease programmes. Treatment is often not verified by a medical professional, independent surveyor, or national programme officer. Additionally, access to medicines might not be equitable across at-risk populations, and treatment targets for disease control remain largely unmet within many endemic countries. To enable equitable access and efficient use of existing medicines, research is needed now on how best to integrate the treatment of neglected tropical diseases into local health systems. A comprehensive approach should be used, which combines mass drug administration with on-demand access to treatment. Increased commitment by endemic countries, when possible, around the ownership of treatment campaigns is essential to improve access to medicines for neglected tropical diseases."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Salmonella spp are a major cause of food-borne outbreaks in Europe. We investigated a large multi-country outbreak of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis in the EU and European Economic Area (EEA).
Methods
A confirmed case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed infection with the outbreak strains of S Enteritidis based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS), occurring between May 1, 2015, and Oct 31, 2018. A probable case was defined as laboratory-confirmed infection with S Enteritidis with the multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis outbreak profile. Multi-country epidemiological, trace-back, trace-forward, and environmental investigations were done. We did a case-control study including confirmed and probable cases and controls randomly sampled from the population registry (frequency matched by age, sex, and postal code). Odds ratios (ORs) for exposure rates between cases and controls were calculated with unmatched univariable and multivariable logistic regression.
Findings
18 EU and EEA countries reported 838 confirmed and 371 probable cases. 509 (42%) cases were reported in 2016, after which the number of cases steadily increased. The case-control study results showed that cases more often ate in food establishments than did controls (OR 3·4 [95% CI 1·6–7·3]), but no specific food item was identified. Recipe-based food trace-back investigations among cases who ate in food establishments identified eggs from Poland as the vehicle of infection in October, 2016. Phylogenetic analysis identified two strains of S Enteritidis in human cases that were subsequently identified in salmonella-positive eggs and primary production premises in Poland, confirming the source of the outbreak. After control measures were implemented, the number of cases decreased, but increased again in March, 2017, and the increase continued into 2018.
Interpretation
This outbreak highlights the public health value of multi-country sharing of epidemiological, trace-back, and microbiological data. The re-emergence of cases suggests that outbreak strains have continued to enter the food chain, although changes in strain population dynamics and fewer cases indicate that control measures had some effect. Routine use of WGS in salmonella surveillance and outbreak response promises to identify and stop outbreaks in the future.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In China, measles-rubella vaccine and live attenuated SA 14–14–2 Japanese encephalitis vaccine (LJEV) are recommended for simultaneous administration at 8 months of age, which is the youngest recommended age for these vaccines worldwide. We aimed to assess the effect of the co-administration of these vaccines at 8 months of age on the immunogenicity of measles-rubella vaccine.
Methods
We did a multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority, two-group randomised controlled trial in eight counties or districts in China. We recruited healthy infants aged 8 months who had received all scheduled vaccinations according to the national immunisation recommendations and who lived in the county of the study site. Enrolled infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either measles-rubella vaccine and LJEV simultaneously (measles-rubella plus LJEV group) or measles-rubella vaccine alone (measles-rubella group). The primary outcome was the proportion of infants with IgG antibody seroconversion for measles 6 weeks after vaccination, and a secondary outcome was the proportion of infants with IgG antibody seroconversion for rubella 6 weeks after vaccination. Analyses included all infants who completed the study. We used a 5% margin to establish non-inferiority. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02643433).
Findings
1173 infants were assessed for eligibility between Aug 13, 2015, and June 10, 2016. Of 1093 (93%) enrolled infants, 545 were randomly assigned to the measles-rubella plus LJEV group and 548 to the measles-rubella group. Of the infants assigned to each group, 507 in the measles-rubella plus LJEV group and 506 in the measles-rubella group completed the study. Before vaccination, six (1%) of 507 infants in the measles-rubella plus LJEV group and one (<1%) of 506 in the measles-rubella group were seropositive for measles; eight (2%) infants in the measles-rubella plus LJEV group and two (<1%) in the measles-rubella group were seropositive for rubella. 6 weeks after vaccination, measles seroconversion in the measles-rubella plus LJEV group (496 [98%] of 507) was non-inferior to that in the measles-rubella group (499 [99%] of 506; difference −0·8% [90% CI −2·6 to 1·1]) and rubella seroconversion in the measles-rubella plus LJEV group (478 [94%] of 507) was non-inferior to that in the measles-rubella group (473 [94%] of 506 infants; difference 0·8% [90% CI −1·8 to 3·4]). There were no serious adverse events in either group and no evidence of a difference between the two groups in the prevalence of any local adverse event (redness, rashes, and pain) or systemic adverse event (fever, allergy, respiratory infections, diarrhoea, and vomiting). Fever was the most common adverse event (97 [19%] of 507 infants in the measles-rubella plus LJEV group; 108 [21%] of 506 infants in the measles-rubella group).
Interpretation
The evidence of similar seroconversion and safety with co-administered LJEV and measles-rubella vaccines supports the co-administration of these vaccines to infants aged 8 months. These results will be important for measles and rubella elimination and the expansion of Japanese encephalitis vaccination in countries where it is endemic.

Background
Zika virus infections and suspected microcephaly cases have been reported in Angola since late 2016, but no data are available about the origins, epidemiology, and diversity of the virus. We aimed to investigate the emergence and circulation of Zika virus in Angola.
Methods
Diagnostic samples collected by the Angolan Ministry of Health as part of routine arboviral surveillance were tested by real-time reverse transcription PCR by the Instituto Nacional de Investigação em Saúde (Ministry of Health, Luanda, Angola). To identify further samples positive for Zika virus and appropriate for genomic sequencing, we also tested samples from a 2017 study of people with HIV in Luanda. Portable sequencing was used to generate Angolan Zika virus genome sequences from three people positive for Zika virus infection by real-time reverse transcription PCR, including one neonate with microcephaly. Genetic and mobility data were analysed to investigate the date of introduction and geographical origin of Zika virus in Angola. Brain CT and MRI, and serological assays were done on a child with microcephaly to confirm microcephaly and assess previous Zika virus infection.
Findings
Serum samples from 54 people with suspected acute Zika virus infection, 76 infants with suspected microcephaly, 24 mothers of infants with suspected microcephaly, 336 patients with suspected dengue virus or chikungunya virus infection, and 349 samples from the HIV study were tested by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Four cases identified between December, 2016, and June, 2017, tested positive for Zika virus. Analyses of viral genomic and human mobility data suggest that Zika virus was probably introduced to Angola from Brazil between July, 2015, and June, 2016. This introduction probably initiated local circulation of Zika virus in Angola that continued until at least June, 2017. The infant with microcephaly in whom CT and MRI were done had brain abnormalities consistent with congenital Zika syndrome and serological evidence for Zika virus infection.
Interpretation
Our analyses show that autochthonous transmission of the Asian lineage of Zika virus has taken place in Africa. Zika virus surveillance and surveillance of associated cases of microcephaly throughout the continent is crucial.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The current outbreak of Ebola in eastern DR Congo, beginning in 2018, emerged in a complex and violent political and security environment. Community-level prevention and outbreak control measures appear to be dependent on public trust in relevant authorities and information, but little scholarship has explored these issues. We aimed to investigate the role of trust and misinformation on individual preventive behaviours during an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD).
Methods
We surveyed 961 adults between Sept 1 and Sept 16, 2018. We used a multistage sampling design in Beni and Butembo in North Kivu, DR Congo. Of 412 avenues and cells (the lowest administrative structures; 99 in Beni and 313 in Butembo), we randomly selected 30 in each city. In each avenue or cell, 16 households were selected using the WHO Expanded Programme on Immunization's random walk approach. In each household, one adult (aged ≥18 years) was randomly selected for interview. Standardised questionnaires were administered by experienced interviewers. We used multivariate models to examine the intermediate variables of interest, including institutional trust and belief in selected misinformation, with outcomes of interest related to EVD prevention behaviours.
Findings
Among 961 respondents, 349 (31·9%, 95% CI 27·4–36·9) trusted that local authorities represent their interest. Belief in misinformation was widespread, with 230 (25·5%, 21·7–29·6) respondents believing that the Ebola outbreak was not real. Low institutional trust and belief in misinformation were associated with a decreased likelihood of adopting preventive behaviours, including acceptance of Ebola vaccines (odds ratio 0·22, 95% CI 0·21–0·22, and 1·40, 1·39–1·42) and seeking formal health care (0·06, 0·05–0·06, and 1·16, 1·15–1·17).
Interpretation
The findings underscore the practical implications of mistrust and misinformation for outbreak control. These factors are associated with low compliance with messages of social and behavioural change and refusal to seek formal medical care or accept vaccines, which in turn increases the risk of spread of EVD.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections are important causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes in the Asia-Pacific region. We hypothesised that monthly intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) or intermittent screening and treatment (IST) with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine is more effective in reducing malaria in pregnancy than the existing single screening and treatment (SST) strategy, which is used to screen women for malaria infections at the first antenatal visit followed by passive case detection, with management of febrile cases.
Methods
We did an open-label, three-arm, cluster-randomised, superiority trial in Sumba (low malaria transmission site) and Papua (moderate malaria transmission site), Indonesia. Eligible participants were 16–30 weeks pregnant. Clusters (antenatal clinics with at least ten new pregnancies per year matched by location, size, and malaria risk) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via computer-generated lists to IPT, IST, or SST clusters. In IPT clusters, participants received the fixed-dose combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (4 and 18 mg/kg per day). In IST clusters, participants were screened with malaria rapid diagnostic tests once a month, whereas, in SST clusters, they were screened at enrolment only. In all groups, participants with fever were tested for malaria. Any participant who tested positive received dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine regardless of symptoms. The primary outcome was malaria infection in the mother at delivery. Laboratory staff were unaware of group allocation. Analyses included all randomly assigned participants contributing outcome data and were adjusted for clustering at the clinic level. This trial is complete and is registered with ISRCTN, number 34010937.
Findings
Between May 16, 2013, and April 21, 2016, 78 clusters (57 in Sumba and 21 in Papua) were randomly assigned to SST, IPT, or IST clusters (26 clusters each). Of 3553 women screened for eligibility, 2279 were enrolled (744 in SST clusters, 681 in IPT clusters, and 854 in IST clusters). At enrolment, malaria prevalence was lower in IST (5·7%) than in SST (12·6%) and IPT (10·6%) clusters. At delivery, malaria prevalence was 20·2% (128 of 633) in SST clusters, compared with 11·6% (61 of 528) in IPT clusters (relative risk [RR] 0·59, 95% CI 0·42–0·83, p=0·0022) and 11·8% (84 of 713) in IST clusters (0·56, 0·40–0·77, p=0·0005). Conditions related to the pregnancy, the puerperium, and the perinatal period were the most common serious adverse events for the mothers, and infections and infestations for the infants. There were no differences between groups in serious adverse events in the mothers or in their infants.
Interpretation
IST was associated with a lower prevalence of malaria than SST at delivery, but the prevalence of malaria in this group was also lower at enrolment, making interpretation of the effect of IST challenging. Further studies with highly sensitive malaria rapid diagnostic tests should be considered. Monthly IPT with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine is a promising alternative to SST in areas in the Asia-Pacific region with moderate or high transmission of malaria.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Nosocomial pneumonia due to antimicrobial-resistant pathogens is associated with high mortality. We assessed the efficacy and safety of the combination antibacterial drug ceftolozane–tazobactam versus meropenem for treatment of Gram-negative nosocomial pneumonia.
Methods
We conducted a randomised, controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial at 263 hospitals in 34 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, were undergoing mechanical ventilation, and had nosocomial pneumonia (either ventilator-associated pneumonia or ventilated hospital-acquired pneumonia). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with block randomisation (block size four), stratified by type of nosocomial pneumonia and age (<65 years vs ≥65 years), to receive either 3 g ceftolozane–tazobactam or 1 g meropenem intravenously every 8 h for 8–14 days. The primary endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality (at a 10% non-inferiority margin). The key secondary endpoint was clinical response at the test-of-cure visit (7–14 days after the end of therapy; 12·5% non-inferiority margin). Both endpoints were assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Investigators, study staff, patients, and patients' representatives were masked to treatment assignment. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received study treatment. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02070757.
Findings
Between Jan 16, 2015, and April 27, 2018, 726 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, 362 to the ceftolozane–tazobactam group and 364 to the meropenem group. Overall, 519 (71%) patients had ventilator-associated pneumonia, 239 (33%) had Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores of at least 20, and 668 (92%) were in the intensive care unit. At 28 days, 87 (24·0%) patients in the ceftolozane–tazobactam group and 92 (25·3%) in the meropenem group had died (weighted treatment difference 1·1% [95% CI −5·1 to 7·4]). At the test-of-cure visit 197 (54%) patients in the ceftolozane–tazobactam group and 194 (53%) in the meropenem group were clinically cured (weighted treatment difference 1·1% [95% CI −6·2 to 8·3]). Ceftolozane–tazobactam was thus non-inferior to meropenem in terms of both 28-day all-cause mortality and clinical cure at test of cure. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 38 (11%) of 361 patients in the ceftolozane–tazobactam group and 27 (8%) of 359 in the meropenem group. Eight (2%) patients in the ceftolozane–tazobactam group and two (1%) in the meropenem group had serious treatment-related adverse events. There were no treatment-related deaths.
Interpretation
High-dose ceftolozane–tazobactam is an efficacious and well tolerated treatment for Gram-negative nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients, a high-risk, critically ill population.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The hospital environment is a reservoir for the transmission of microorganisms. The effect of improved cleaning on patient-centred outcomes remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an environmental cleaning bundle to reduce health care-associated infections in hospitals.
Methods
The REACH study was a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised trial done in 11 acute care hospitals in Australia. Eligible hospitals had an intensive care unit, were classified by the National Health Performance Authority as a major hospital (public hospitals) or having more than 200 inpatient beds (private hospitals), and had a health-care-associated infection surveillance programme. The stepped-wedge design meant intervention periods varied from 20 weeks to 50 weeks. We introduced the REACH cleaning bundle, a multimodal intervention, focusing on optimising product use, technique, staff training, auditing with feedback, and communication, for routine cleaning. The primary outcomes were incidences of health-care-associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, Clostridium difficile infection, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci infection. The secondary outcome was the thoroughness of cleaning of frequent touch points, assessed by a fluorescent marking gel. This study is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, number ACTRN12615000325505.
Findings
Between May 9, 2016, and July 30, 2017, we implemented the cleaning bundle in 11 hospitals. In the pre-intervention phase, there were 230 cases of vancomycin-resistant enterococci infection, 362 of S aureus bacteraemia, and 968 C difficile infections, for 3 534 439 occupied bed-days. During intervention, there were 50 cases of vancomycin-resistant enterococci infection, 109 of S aureus bacteraemia, and 278 C difficile infections, for 1 267 134 occupied bed-days. After the intervention, vancomycin-resistant enterococci infections reduced from 0·35 to 0·22 per 10 000 occupied bed-days (relative risk 0·63, 95% CI 0·41–0·97, p=0·0340). The incidences of S aureus bacteraemia (0·97 to 0·80 per 10 000 occupied bed-days; 0·82, 0·60–1·12, p=0·2180) and C difficile infections (2·34 to 2·52 per 10 000 occupied bed-days; 1·07, 0·88–1·30, p=0·4655) did not change significantly. The intervention increased the percentage of frequent touch points cleaned in bathrooms from 55% to 76% (odds ratio 2·07, 1·83–2·34, p<0·0001) and bedrooms from 64% to 86% (1·87, 1·68–2·09, p<0·0001).
Interpretation
The REACH cleaning bundle was successful at improving cleaning thoroughness and showed great promise in reducing vancomycin-resistant enterococci infections. Our work will inform hospital cleaning policy and practice, highlighting the value of investment in both routine and discharge cleaning practice.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Strongyloides stercoralis infection is a neglected condition that places people who are immunocompromised at risk of hyperinfection and death. Ivermectin is the drug of choice for the treatment of S stercoralis infection, but there is no definitive evidence on the optimal dose. This trial aimed to assess whether multiple doses of ivermectin were superior to a single dose for the treatment of non-disseminated strongyloidiasis.
Methods
Our study was designed as a multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled superiority trial. Participants were enrolled in four centres in Italy, three in Spain, and two in the UK, and recruiting sites were predominantly hospitals. Eligible patients were older than 5 years, weighed more than 15 kg, were residents in an area not endemic for S stercoralis, and either were positive for S stercoralis in faecal tests and on serology (any titre) or had a positive serological test with high titres, irrespective of the result of faecal tests. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated, blinded allocation sequence (with randomly mixed block sizes of six, eight, and ten participants) to receive either one dose of ivermectin 200 μg/kg or four doses of ivermectin 200 μg/kg (given on days 1, 2, 15, and 16). The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with clearance of S stercoralis infection at 12 months, which was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who were not lost to follow-up (modified full-analysis set) and in participants in the modified full-analysis set who did not deviate from the assigned treatment regimen (per-protocol set). All participants were included in the safety analysis. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01570504, and is now closed for recruitment.
Findings
Of the 351 patients assessed for eligibility, 309 recruited between March 26, 2013, and May 3, 2017, were randomly assigned to one dose (n=155) or four doses (n=154) of ivermectin. At 12 months in the modified full-analysis set, 86% (95% CI 79 to 91; 102 of 118 participants) had responded to treatment in the single-dose group compared with 85% (77 to 90; 96 of 113 participants) in the four-dose group (risk difference 1·48%, 95% CI −7·55 to 10·52; p=0·75); similar results were observed in the per-protocol set. Adverse events were generally of mild intensity and more frequent in the multiple-dose than in the single-dose group. The trial was terminated early due to futility.
Interpretation
Multiple doses of ivermectin did not show higher efficacy and was tolerated less than a single dose. A single dose should therefore be preferred for the treatment of non-disseminated strongyloidiasis.

Data from mathematical models suggest that kissing and saliva exchange during sexual activity might be major contributors to community gonorrhoea morbidity. Although there is little evidence to support this, it provokes discussion of the potential role of the oropharynx in gonorrhoea control. Improved sensitivity and ease of diagnostic testing, as well as increased screening for extragenital infections among men who have sex with men, have increased awareness of the high frequency of oropharyngeal gonorrhoea. However, there are insufficient data to determine the mechanisms of transmission for these infections. Innovative studies that use quantitative microbiological techniques are needed to accurately assess how oral gonorrhoea or saliva exchange in infected people contribute to the morbidity of gonorrhoea in the community. More empirical data on pharyngeal gonorrhoea infections, and the role of transmission to and from the oropharynx, are needed to inform prevention planning."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Invasive pneumococcal disease remains an important health priority owing to increasing disease incidence caused by pneumococci expressing non-vaccine serotypes. We previously defined 621 Global Pneumococcal Sequence Clusters (GPSCs) by analysing 20 027 pneumococcal isolates collected worldwide and from previously published genomic data. In this study, we aimed to investigate the pneumococcal lineages behind the predominant serotypes, the mechanism of serotype replacement in disease, as well as the major pneumococcal lineages contributing to invasive pneumococcal disease in the post-vaccine era and their antibiotic resistant traits.
Methods
We whole-genome sequenced 3233 invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from laboratory-based surveillance programmes in Hong Kong (n=78), Israel (n=701), Malawi (n=226), South Africa (n=1351), The Gambia (n=203), and the USA (n=674). The genomes represented pneumococci from before and after pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introductions and were from children younger than 3 years. We identified predominant serotypes by prevalence and their major contributing lineages in each country, and assessed any serotype replacement by comparing the incidence rate between the pre-PCV and PCV periods for Israel, South Africa, and the USA. We defined the status of a lineage as vaccine-type GPSC (≥50% 13-valent PCV [PCV13] serotypes) or non-vaccine-type GPSC (>50% non-PCV13 serotypes) on the basis of its initial serotype composition detected in the earliest vaccine period to measure their individual contribution toward serotype replacement in each country. Major pneumococcal lineages in the PCV period were identified by pooled incidence rate using a random effects model.
Findings
The five most prevalent serotypes in the PCV13 period varied between countries, with only serotypes 5, 12F, 15B/C, 19A, 33F, and 35B/D common to two or more countries. The five most prevalent serotypes in the PCV13 period varied between countries, with only serotypes 5, 12F, 15B/C, 19A, 33F, and 35B/D common to two or more countries. These serotypes were associated with more than one lineage, except for serotype 5 (GPSC8). Serotype replacement was mainly mediated by expansion of non-vaccine serotypes within vaccine-type GPSCs and, to a lesser extent, by increases in non-vaccine-type GPSCs. A globally spreading lineage, GPSC3, expressing invasive serotypes 8 in South Africa and 33F in the USA and Israel, was the most common lineage causing non-vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease in the PCV13 period. We observed that same prevalent non-vaccine serotypes could be associated with distinctive lineages in different countries, which exhibited dissimilar antibiotic resistance profiles. In non-vaccine serotype isolates, we detected significant increases in the prevalence of resistance to penicillin (52 [21%] of 249 vs 169 [29%] of 575, p=0·0016) and erythromycin (three [1%] of 249 vs 65 [11%] of 575, p=0·0031) in the PCV13 period compared with the pre-PCV period.
Interpretation
Globally spreading lineages expressing invasive serotypes have an important role in serotype replacement, and emerging non-vaccine serotypes associated with different pneumococcal lineages in different countries might be explained by local antibiotic-selective pressures. Continued genomic surveillance of the dynamics of the pneumococcal population with increased geographical representation in the post-vaccine period will generate further knowledge for optimising future vaccine design.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Use of single-bed rooms for control of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is under debate; the added value when applying contact precautions has not been shown. We aimed to assess whether an isolation strategy of contact precautions in a multiple-bed room was non-inferior to a strategy of contact precautions in a single-bed room for preventing transmission of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
Methods
We did a cluster-randomised, crossover, non-inferiority study on medical and surgical wards of 16 Dutch hospitals. During two consecutive study periods, either contact precautions in a single-bed room or contact precautions in a multiple-bed room were applied as the preferred isolation strategy for patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae cultured from a routine clinical sample (index patients). Eligible index patients were aged 18 years or older, had no strict indication for barrier precautions in a single-bed room, had a culture result reported within 7 days of culture and before discharge, and had no wardmate known to be colonised or infected with an ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolate of the same bacterial species with a similar antibiogram. Hospitals were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by computer to one of two sequences of isolation strategies, stratified by university or non-university hospital. Allocation was masked for laboratory technicians who assessed the outcomes but not for patients, treating doctors, and infection-control practitioners enrolling index patients. The primary outcome was transmission of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae to wardmates, which was defined as rectal carriage of an ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolate that was clonally related to the index patient's isolate in at least one wardmate. The primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population, which included patients who were adherent to the assigned room type. A 10% non-inferiority margin for the risk difference was used to assess non-inferiority. This study is registered with Nederlands Trialregister, NTR2799.
Findings
16 hospitals were randomised, eight to each sequence of isolation strategies. All hospitals randomised to the sequence single-bed room then multiple-bed room and five of eight hospitals randomised to the sequence multiple-bed room then single-bed room completed both study periods and were analysed. From April 24, 2011, to Feb 27, 2014, 1652 index patients and 12 875 wardmates were assessed for eligibility. Of those, 693 index patients and 9527 wardmates were enrolled and 463 index patients and 7093 wardmates were included in the per-protocol population. Transmission of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae to at least one wardmate was identified for 11 (4%) of 275 index patients during the single-bed room strategy period and for 14 (7%) of 188 index patients during the multiple-bed room strategy period (crude risk difference 3·4%, 90% CI −0·3 to 7·1).
Interpretation
For patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae cultured from a routine clinical sample, an isolation strategy of contact precautions in a multiple-bed room was non-inferior to a strategy of contact precautions in a single-bed room for preventing transmission of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Non-inferiority of the multiple-bed room strategy might change the current single-bed room preference for isolation of patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, thus, broaden infection-control options for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in daily clinical practice.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Measles is an important cause of death in children, despite the availability of safe and cost-saving measles-containing vaccines (MCVs). The first MCV dose (MCV1) is recommended at 9 months of age in countries with ongoing measles transmission, and at 12 months in countries with low risk of measles. To assess whether bringing forward the age of MCV1 is beneficial, we did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and risks of MCV1 in infants younger than 9 months.
Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Proquest, Global Health, the WHO library database, and the WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing database, and consulted experts. We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials, outbreak investigations, and cohort and case-control studies without restriction on publication dates, in which MCV1 was administered to infants younger than 9 months. We did the literature search on June 2, 2015, and updated it on Jan 14, 2019. We assessed: proportion of infants seroconverted, geometric mean antibody titre, avidity, cellular immunity, duration of immunity, vaccine efficacy, vaccine effectiveness, and safety. We used random-effects models to derive pooled estimates of the endpoints, where appropriate. We assessed methodological quality using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation guidelines.
Findings
Our search identified 1156 studies, of which 1071 were screened for eligibility. 351 were eligible for full-text screening, and data from 56 studies that met all inclusion criteria were used for analysis. The proportion of infants who seroconverted increased from 50% (95% CI 29–71) for those vaccinated with MCV1 at 4 months of age to 85% (69–97) for those were vaccinated at 8 months. The pooled geometric mean titre ratio for infants aged 4–8 months vaccinated with MCV1 compared with infants vaccinated with MCV1 at age 9 months or older was 0·46 (95% CI 0·33–0·66; I2=99·9%, p<0·0001). Only one study reported on avidity and suggested that there was lower avidity and a shorter duration of immunity following MCV1 administration at 6 months of age than at 9 months of age (p=0·0016) or 12 months of age (p<0·001). No effect of age at MCV1 administration on cellular immunity was found. One study reported that vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed measles virus infection was 94% (95% CI 74–98) in infants vaccinated with MCV1 at 4·5 months of age. The pooled vaccine effectiveness of MCV1 in infants younger than 9 months against measles was 58% (95% CI 9–80; I2=84·9%, p<0·0001). The pooled vaccine effectiveness estimate from within-study comparisons of infants younger than 9 months vaccinated with MCV1 were 51% (95% CI −44 to 83; I2=92·3%, p<0·0001), and for those aged 9 months and older at vaccination it was 83% (76–88; I2=93·8%, p<0·0001). No differences in the risk of adverse events after MCV1 administration were found between infants younger than 9 months and those aged 9 months of older. Overall, the quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low.
Interpretation
MCV1 administered to infants younger than 9 months induces a good immune response, whereby the proportion of infants seroconverted increases with increased age at vaccination. A large proportion of infants receiving MCV1 before 9 months of age are protected and the vaccine is safe, although higher antibody titres and vaccine effectiveness are found when MCV1 is administered at older ages. Recommending MCV1 administration to infants younger than 9 months for those at high risk of measles is an important step towards reducing measles-related mortality and morbidity.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Legionnaires' disease is under-diagnosed because of inconsistent use of diagnostic tests and uncertainty about whom to test. We assessed the increase in case detection following large-scale introduction of routine PCR testing of respiratory specimens in New Zealand.
Methods
LegiNZ was a national surveillance study done over 1-year in which active case-finding was used to maximise the identification of cases of Legionnaires' disease in hospitals. Respiratory specimens from patients of any age with pneumonia, who could provide an eligible lower respiratory specimen, admitted to one of 20 participating hospitals, covering a catchment area of 96% of New Zealand's population, were routinely tested for legionella by PCR. Additional cases of Legionnaires' disease in hospital were identified through mandatory notification.
Findings
Between May 21, 2015, and May 20, 2016, 5622 eligible specimens from 4862 patients were tested by PCR. From these, 197 cases of Legionnaires' disease were detected. An additional 41 cases were identified from notification data, giving 238 cases requiring hospitalisation. The overall incidence of Legionnaires' disease cases in hospital in the study area was 5·4 per 100 000 people per year, and Legionella longbeachae was the predominant cause, found in 150 (63%) of 238 cases.
Interpretation
The rate of notified disease during the study period was three-times the average over the preceding 3 years. Active case-finding through systematic PCR testing better clarified the regional epidemiology of Legionnaires' disease and uncovered an otherwise hidden burden of disease. These data inform local Legionnaires' disease testing strategies, allow targeted antibiotic therapy, and help identify outbreaks and effective prevention strategies. The same approach might have similar benefits if applied elsewhere in the world.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Sustaining achievements in malaria control and making progress toward malaria elimination requires coordinated funding. We estimated domestic malaria spending by source in 106 countries that were malaria-endemic in 2000–16 or became malaria-free after 2000.
Methods
We collected 36 038 datapoints reporting government, out-of-pocket (OOP), and prepaid private malaria spending, as well as malaria treatment-seeking, costs of patient care, and drug prices. We estimated government spending on patient care for malaria, which was added to government spending by national malaria control programmes. For OOP malaria spending, we used data reported in National Health Accounts and estimated OOP spending on treatment. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression was used to ensure estimates were complete and comparable across time and to generate uncertainty.
Findings
In 2016, US$4·3 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 4·2–4·4) was spent on malaria worldwide, an 8·5% (95% UI 8·1–8·9) per year increase over spending in 2000. Since 2000, OOP spending increased 3·8% (3·3–4·2) per year, amounting to $556 million (487–634) or 13·0% (11·6–14·5) of all malaria spending in 2016. Governments spent $1·2 billion (1·1–1·3) or 28·2% (27·1–29·3) of all malaria spending in 2016, increasing 4·0% annually since 2000. The source of malaria spending varied depending on whether countries were in the malaria control or elimination stage.
Interpretation
Tracking global malaria spending provides insight into how far the world is from reaching the malaria funding target of $6·6 billion annually by 2020. Because most countries with a high burden of malaria are low income or lower-middle income, mobilising additional government resources for malaria might be challenging.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Yellow fever virus infection results in death in around 30% of symptomatic individuals. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of death measured at hospital admission in a cohort of patients admitted to hospital during the 2018 outbreak of yellow fever in the outskirts of São Paulo city, Brazil.
Methods
In this observational cohort study, we enrolled patients with yellow fever virus from two hospitals in São Paolo—the Hospital das Clínicas, University of São Paulo and the Infectious Diseases Institute “Emilio Ribas”. Patients older than 18 years admitted to hospital with fever or myalgia, headache, arthralgia, oedema, rash, or conjunctivitis were consecutively screened for inclusion in the present study. Consenting patients were included if they had travelled to geographical areas in which yellow fever virus cases had been previously confirmed. Yellow fever infection was confirmed by real-time PCR in blood collected at admission or tissues at autopsy. We sequenced the complete genomes of yellow fever virus from infected individuals and evaluated demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings at admission and investigated whether any of these measurements correlated with patient outcome (death).
Findings
Between Jan 11, 2018, and May 10, 2018, 118 patients with suspected yellow fever were admitted to Hospital das Clínicas, and 113 patients with suspected yellow fever were admitted to Infectious Diseases Institute “Emilio Ribas”. 95 patients with suspected yellow fever were included in the study, and 136 patients were excluded. Three (3%) of 95 patients with suspected yellow fever who were included in the study were excluded because they received a different diagnosis, and 16 patients with undetectable yellow fever virus RNA were excluded. Therefore, 76 patients with confirmed yellow fever virus infection, based on detectable yellow fever virus RNA in blood (74 patients) or yellow fever virus confirmed only at the autopsy report (two patients), were included in our analysis. 27 (36%) of 76 patients died during the 60 day period after hospital admission. We generated 14 complete yellow fever virus genomes from the first 15 viral load-detectable samples. The genomes belonged to a single monophyletic clade of the South America I genotype, sub-genotype E. Older age, male sex, higher leukocyte and neutrophil counts, higher alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase (AST), bilirubin, and creatinine, prolonged prothrombin time, and higher yellow fever virus RNA plasma viral load were associated with higher mortality. In a multivariate regression model, older age, elevated neutrophil count, increased AST, and higher viral load remained independently associated with death. All 11 (100%) patients with neutrophil counts of 4000 cells per mL or greater and viral loads of 5·1 log10 copies/mL or greater died (95% CI 72–100), compared with only three (11%) of 27 (95% CI 2–29) among patients with neutrophil counts of less than 4000 cells per mL and viral loads of less than 5·1 log10 copies/mL.
Interpretation
We identified clinical and laboratory predictors of mortality at hospital admission that could aid in the care of patients with yellow fever virus. Identification of these prognostic markers in patients could help clinicians prioritise admission to the intensive care unit, as patients often deteriorate rapidly. Moreover, resource allocation could be improved to prioritise key laboratory examinations that might be more useful in determining whether a patient could have a better outcome. Our findings support the important role of the virus in disease pathogenesis, suggesting that an effective antiviral could alter the clinical course for patients with the most severe forms of yellow fever.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Madagascar accounts for 75% of global plague cases reported to WHO, with an annual incidence of 200–700 suspected cases (mainly bubonic plague). In 2017, a pneumonic plague epidemic of unusual size occurred. The extent of this epidemic provides a unique opportunity to better understand the epidemiology of pneumonic plagues, particularly in urban settings.
Methods
Clinically suspected plague cases were notified to the Central Laboratory for Plague at Institut Pasteur de Madagascar (Antananarivo, Madagascar), where biological samples were tested. Based on cases recorded between Aug 1, and Nov 26, 2017, we assessed the epidemiological characteristics of this epidemic. Cases were classified as suspected, probable, or confirmed based on the results of three types of diagnostic tests (rapid diagnostic test, molecular methods, and culture) according to 2006 WHO recommendations.
Findings
2414 clinically suspected plague cases were reported, including 1878 (78%) pneumonic plague cases, 395 (16%) bubonic plague cases, one (<1%) septicaemic case, and 140 (6%) cases with unspecified clinical form. 386 (21%) of 1878 notified pneumonic plague cases were probable and 32 (2%) were confirmed. 73 (18%) of 395 notified bubonic plague cases were probable and 66 (17%) were confirmed. The case fatality ratio was higher among confirmed cases (eight [25%] of 32 cases) than probable (27 [8%] of 360 cases) or suspected pneumonic plague cases (74 [5%] of 1358 cases) and a similar trend was seen for bubonic plague cases (16 [24%] of 66 confirmed cases, four [6%] of 68 probable cases, and six [2%] of 243 suspected cases). 351 (84%) of 418 confirmed or probable pneumonic plague cases were concentrated in Antananarivo, the capital city, and Toamasina, the main seaport. All 50 isolated Yersinia pestis strains were susceptible to the tested antibiotics.
Interpretation
This predominantly urban plague epidemic was characterised by a large number of notifications in two major urban areas and an unusually high proportion of pneumonic forms, with only 23% having one or more positive laboratory tests. Lessons about clinical and biological diagnosis, case definition, surveillance, and the logistical management of the response identified in this epidemic are crucial to improve the response to future plague outbreaks.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Prevalence of serious bacterial infections in children in countries in western Europe and the USA is low. Antibiotic stewardship aims at a more rational use of antibiotics but information on the frequency of antibiotic prescription to children in emergency departments is scarce. We aimed to quantify and explain variability in antibiotic prescription in children attending European paediatric emergency departments.
Methods
We did a cross-sectional, observational study of children aged between 1 month and 16 years who presented with fever to one of 28 European emergency departments on one random sampling day per month between Nov 1, 2014, and Feb 28, 2016. The surveyed sites were spread across 11 countries and included 17 academic hospitals with 3000 to up to 80 000 annual visits to their paediatric emergency departments. We determined the proportion of children without comorbidities who received antibiotic prescriptions by country, focus of infection, and type of antibiotic. We then did a detailed analysis of the same population, using a multilevel logistic regression analysis, into the variability in prescriptions across hospitals, focusing particularly on respiratory tract infections and correcting for a combination of result-dependent factors. Random group assignment was done by computer randomisation.
Findings
Of 5177 children in total, 617 children had comorbidities. Of the 4560 children without comorbidities, 1454 (32%) received antibiotics. This percentage varied from 19% to 64% across countries. Of these 1454 prescriptions issued, 893 (61%) were second-line antibiotics. Antibiotic prescription for respiratory tract infections, the most common infection type, in children without comorbidities was most variable across countries (15–67% for upper respiratory tract infections and 24–87% for lower respiratory tract infections) and was associated with age (odds ratio [OR] 1·51, 95% CI 1·08–2·13), fever duration (OR 1·45, 1·01–2·07), blood concentrations of C-reactive protein (OR 2·31, 1·67–3·19), and chest x-ray results (OR 10·62, 5·65–19·94, for focal abnormalities; OR 3·49, 1·59–7·64, for diffuse abnormalities). After correcting for patient characteristics, diagnostic assessment, and hospital characteristics, antibiotic prescription for respiratory tract infections remained highly variable across emergency departments (standardised antibiotic prescription ratio 0·49–2·04).
Interpretation
Antibiotic prescription in European emergency departments is highly variable, with frequent use of second-line antibiotics. To ensure successful antibiotic stewardship initiatives in Europe aimed at reducing unnecessary prescription of antibiotics, variability of prescription across hospitals should be considered, drivers of suboptimal antibiotic prescription at the local level need to be identified, and European guidelines need to be devised.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pathogen resistance and safety concerns limit oral antibiotic options for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily oral omadacycline, an aminomethylcycline antibiotic, versus twice-daily oral linezolid for treatment of ABSSSI.
Methods
In this phase 3, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority study, eligible adults with ABSSSI at 33 sites in the USA were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive omadacycline (450 mg orally every 24 h over the first 48 h then 300 mg orally every 24 h) or linezolid (600 mg orally every 12 h) for 7–14 days. Randomisation was done via an interactive response system using a computer-generated schedule, and stratified by type of infection (wound infection, cellulitis or erysipelas, or major abscess) and receipt (yes or no) of allowed previous antibacterial treatment. Investigators, funders, and patients were masked to treatment assignments. Primary endpoints were early clinical response, 48–72 h after first dose, in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population (randomised patients without solely Gram-negative ABSSSI pathogens at baseline), and investigator-assessed clinical response at post-treatment evaluation, 7–14 days after the last dose, in the mITT population and clinically evaluable population (ie, mITT patients who had a qualifying infection as per study-entry criteria, received study drug, did not receive a confounding antibiotic, and had an assessment of outcome during the protocol-defined window). The safety population included randomised patients who received any amount of study drug. We set a non-inferiority margin of 10%. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02877927, and is complete.
Findings
Between Aug 11, 2016, and June 6, 2017, 861 participants were assessed for eligibility. 735 participants were randomly assigned, of whom 368 received omadacycline and 367 received linezolid. Omadacycline (315 [88%] of 360) was non-inferior to linezolid (297 [83%] of 360) for early clinical response (percentage-point difference 5·0, 95% CI −0·2 to 10·3) in the mITT population. For investigator-assessed clinical response at post-treatment evaluation, omadacycline was non-inferior to linezolid in the mITT (303 [84%] of 360 vs 291 [81%] of 360; percentage-point difference 3·3, 95% CI −2·2 to 9·0) and clinically evaluable (278 [98%] of 284 vs 279 [96%] of 292; 2·3, −0·5 to 5·8) populations. Mild to moderate nausea and vomiting were the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events in omadacycline (111 [30%] of 368 and 62 [17%] of 368, respectively) and linezolid (28 [8%] of 367 and 11 [3%] of 367, respectively) groups.
Interpretation
Once-daily oral omadacycline was non-inferior to twice-daily oral linezolid in adults with ABSSSI, and was safe and well tolerated. Oral-only omadacycline represents a new treatment option for ABSSSI, with potential for reduction in hospital admissions and cost savings.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) of malaria with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine is a promising strategy for malaria prevention in young African children. However, the optimal dosing strategy is unclear and conflicting evidence exists regarding the risk of malaria after cessation of chemoprevention. We aimed to compare two dosing strategies of IPT with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine in young Ugandan children, and to evaluate the risk of malaria after cessation of IPT.
Methods
In this double-blind, randomised controlled phase 2 trial, women and their unborn children were recruited at Tororo District Hospital (Tororo, Uganda). Eligible participants were HIV-negative women aged 16 years or older with a viable pregnancy (gestational age 12–20 weeks). Women and their unborn children were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to one of four treatment groups, all receiving dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, on the basis of the IPT intervention received by the woman during pregnancy: women every 8 weeks, children every 4 weeks; women every 4 weeks, children every 4 weeks; women every 8 weeks, children every 12 weeks; and women every 4 weeks, children every 12 weeks. Block randomisation was done by an independent investigator using a computer-generated randomisation list (permuted block sizes of six and 12). We analysed children on the basis of their random assignment to receive dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (20 mg/160 mg tablets) once daily for 3 consecutive days every 4 weeks or 12 weeks. Children received study drugs from age 8 weeks to 24 months and were followed-up to age 36 months. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the incidence of symptomatic malaria during the intervention and following cessation of the intervention, adjusted for potential confounders. The primary outcome and safety were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all children who reached 8 weeks of age and received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02163447.
Findings
Between Oct 21, 2014, and May 18, 2015, 191 children were born, of whom 183 reached 8 weeks of age and received at least one dose of study drug and thus were included in the primary analysis (96 children in the 4-week group and 87 in the 12-week group). During the intervention, the incidence of symptomatic malaria was significantly lower among children treated every 4 weeks than children treated every 12 weeks; three episodes occurred among children treated every 4 weeks (incidence 0·018 episodes per person-year) compared with 61 episodes among children treated every 12 weeks (incidence 0·39 episodes per person-year; adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 0·041, 95% CI 0·012–0·150, p<0·0001). After cessation of IPT, children who had previously received dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine every 4 weeks had a lower incidence of symptomatic malaria than children who were treated every 12 weeks; 62 episodes occurred among children previously treated every 4 weeks (incidence 0·73 episodes per person-year) compared with 83 episodes among children treated every 12 weeks (incidence 1·1 episodes per person-year; aIRR 0·62, 0·40–0·95, p=0·028). In the 4-week group, 94 (98%) of 96 children had adverse events versus 87 (100%) of 87 children in the 12-week group. The most commonly reported adverse event was cough in both treatment groups (94 [98%] in the 4-week group vs 87 [100%] in the 12-week group). 16 children had severe adverse events (seven [7%] children in the 4-week group vs nine [10%] children in the 12-week group). No severe adverse events were thought to be related to study drug administration. One death occurred during the intervention (age 8 weeks to 24 months), which was due to respiratory failure unrelated to malaria.
Interpretation
IPT with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine given every 4 weeks was superior to treatment every 12 weeks for the prevention of malaria during childhood, and this protection was extended for up to 1 year after cessation of IPT.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Vaccinating infants with a first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) before 9 months of age in high-risk settings has the potential to reduce measles-related morbidity and mortality. However, there is concern that early vaccination might blunt the immune response to subsequent measles vaccine doses. We systematically reviewed the available evidence on the effect of MCV1 administration to infants younger than 9 months on their immune responses to subsequent MCV doses.
Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched for randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials, outbreak investigations, and cohort and case-control studies without restriction on publication dates, in which MCV1 was administered to infants younger than 9 months. We did the literature search on June 2, 2015, and updated it on Jan 14, 2019. We included studies reporting data on strength or duration of humoral and cellular immune responses, and on vaccine efficacy or vaccine effectiveness after two-dose or three-dose MCV schedules. Our outcome measures were proportion of seropositive infants, geometric mean titre, vaccine efficacy, vaccine effectiveness, antibody avidity index, and T-cell stimulation index. We used random-effects meta-analysis to derive pooled estimates of the outcomes, where appropriate. We assessed the methodological quality of included studies using Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines.
Findings
Our search retrieved 1156 records and 85 were excluded due to duplication. 1071 records were screened for eligibility, of which 351 were eligible for full-text screening and 21 were eligible for inclusion in the review. From 13 studies, the pooled proportion of infants seropositive after two MCV doses, with MCV1 administered before 9 months of age, was 98% (95% CI 96–99; I2=79·8%, p<0·0001), which was not significantly different from seropositivity after a two-dose MCV schedule starting later (p=0·087). Only one of four studies found geometric mean titres after MCV2 administration to be significantly lower when MCV1 was administered before 9 months of age than at 9 months of age or later. There was insufficient evidence to determine an effect of age at MCV1 administration on antibody avidity. The pooled vaccine effectiveness estimate derived from two studies of a two-dose MCV schedule with MCV1 vaccination before 9 months of age was 95% (95% CI 89–100; I2=12·6%, p=0·29). Seven studies reporting on measles virus-specific cellular immune responses found that T-cell responses and T-cell memory were sustained, irrespective of the age of MCV1 administration. Overall, the quality of evidence was moderate to very low.
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that administering MCV1 to infants younger than 9 months followed by additional MCV doses results in high seropositivity, vaccine effectiveness, and T-cell responses, which are independent of the age at MCV1, supporting the vaccination of very young infants in high-risk settings. However, we also found some evidence that MCV1 administered to infants younger than 9 months resulted in lower antibody titres after one or two subsequent doses of MCV than when measles vaccination is started at age 9 months or older. The clinical and public-health relevance of this immunity blunting effect are uncertain.

Cyclospora species are socioeconomically important protistan pathogens. Cyclospora cayetanensis is usually transmitted via food or water to a human host via the faecal–oral route and can cause the gastrointestinal disease cyclosporiasis, which can be complicated by extra-intestinal disorders, particularly in immune-compromised people. Although more than 2 million children die each year from diarrhoeal diseases worldwide, it is not known to what extent cyclosporiasis is involved. Few epidemiological data are available on Cyclospora as a water-borne and food-borne pathogen in both underprivileged communities and developed countries. To gain an improved understanding of human cyclosporiasis, this Review describes the background of Cyclospora, summarises salient aspects of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and control of cyclosporiasis, and explores what is known about its prevalence and geographical distribution. The findings show that the effect on human health of cyclosporiasis is likely underestimated, and recommendations are made about areas of future research and the prevention and control of this disease within an international collaborative context."

This Personal View argues for a new framework of gonorrhoea transmission in men who have sex with men in which the oropharynx plays a major role in transmitting gonorrhoea to, or acquiring gonorrhoea from, their partner's oropharynx, penis, or anorectum through either direct contact or via saliva. To avoid preconceived notions of transmission dynamics, we ask readers to imagine that they are investigating a new sexually transmitted infection. On the basis of the existing clinical and epidemiological data for gonorrhoea at the penis, oropharynx, and anorectum site, we develop two models for transmission: the so-called penile model and the so-called oropharyngeal model. We argue that the existing epidemiological data and behavioural data best fit the oropharyngeal model. Our argument rests on the observation that, at the population level, the prevalence of urethral gonorrhoea is too rare to explain the high incidence of oropharynx and anorectum infection. We describe studies of gonorrhoea detection in saliva, saliva use during sex, epidemiological studies of kissing and oropharyngeal gonorrhoea, as well as studies aided by mathematical models. Finally, we argue that the correlation between sexual acts (eg, kissing, oral sex, anal sex, and saliva use) is so high that any epidemiological study that does not measure these factors will be prone to confounding."

abstract = "Summary
Medicine and clinical microbiology have traditionally attempted to identify and eliminate the agents that cause disease. However, this traditional approach is becoming inadequate for dealing with a changing disease landscape. Major challenges to human health are non-communicable chronic diseases, often driven by altered immunity and inflammation, and communicable infections from agents which harbour antibiotic resistance. This Review focuses on the so-called evolutionary medicine framework, to study how microbial communities influence human health. The evolutionary medicine framework aims to predict and manipulate microbial effects on human health by integrating ecology, evolutionary biology, microbiology, bioinformatics, and clinical expertise. We focus on the potential of evolutionary medicine to address three key challenges: detecting microbial transmission, predicting antimicrobial resistance, and understanding microbe–microbe and human–microbe interactions in health and disease, in the context of the microbiome."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The duration of protection offered by rotavirus vaccines varies across the world, and this variation is important to understanding and predicting the effects of the vaccines. There is now a large body of evidence on the efficacy of live oral rotavirus vaccines in different settings, but these data have never been synthesised to obtain robust estimates of efficacy by duration of follow-up. Our aim is to estimate the efficacy of live oral rotavirus vaccines at each point during follow-up and by mortality stratum.
Methods
In our meta-regression study, we identified all randomised controlled trials of rotavirus vaccines published until April 4, 2018, using the results of a Cochrane systematic review, and cross checked these studies against those identified by another systematic review. We excluded trials that were based on special populations, trials without an infant schedule, and trials without clear reporting of numbers of enrolled infants and events in different periods of follow-up. For all reported periods of follow-up, we extracted the mean duration of follow-up (time since administration of the final dose of rotavirus vaccination), the number of enrolled infants, and case counts for rotavirus-positive severe gastroenteritis in both non-vaccinated and vaccinated groups. We used a Bayesian hierarchical Poisson meta-regression model to estimate the pooled cumulative vaccine efficacy (VE) and its waning with time for three mortality strata. We then converted these VE estimates into instantaneous VE (iVE).
Findings
In settings with low mortality (15 observations), iVE pooled for infant schedules of Rotarix and RotaTeq was 98% (95% credibility interval 93–100) 2 weeks following the final dose of vaccination and 94% (87–98) after 12 months. In medium-mortality settings (11 observations), equivalent estimates were 82% (74–92) after 2 weeks and 77% (67–84) after 12 months. In settings with high mortality (24 observations), there were five different vaccines with observation points for infant schedules. The pooled iVE was 66% (48–81) after 2 weeks of follow-up and 44% (27–59) after 12 months.
Interpretation
Rotavirus vaccine efficacy is lower and wanes more rapidly in high-mortality settings than in low-mortality settings, but the earlier peak age of disease in high-mortality settings means that live oral rotavirus vaccines are still likely to provide substantial benefit.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Active case-finding among contacts of patients with tuberculosis is a global health priority, but the effects of active versus passive case-finding are poorly characterised. We assessed the contribution of active versus passive case-finding to tuberculosis detection among contacts and compared sex and disease characteristics between contacts diagnosed through these strategies.
Methods
In shanty towns in Callao, Peru, we identified index patients with tuberculosis and followed up contacts aged 15 years or older for tuberculosis. All patients and contacts were offered free programmatic active case-finding entailing sputum smear microscopy and clinical assessment. Additionally, all contacts were offered intensified active case-finding with sputum smear and culture testing monthly for 6 months and then once every 4 years. Passive case-finding at local health facilities was ongoing throughout follow-up.
Findings
Between Oct 23, 2002, and May 26, 2006, we identified 2666 contacts, who were followed up until March 1, 2016. Median follow-up was 10·0 years (IQR 7·5–11·0). 232 (9%) of 2666 contacts were diagnosed with tuberculosis. The 2-year cumulative risk of tuberculosis was 4·6% (95% CI 3·5–5·5), and overall incidence was 0·98 cases (95% CI 0·86–1·10) per 100 person-years. 53 (23%) of 232 contacts with tuberculosis were diagnosed through active case-finding and 179 (77%) were identified through passive case-finding. During the first 6 months of the study, 23 (45%) of 51 contacts were diagnosed through active case-finding and 28 (55%) were identified through passive case-finding. Contacts diagnosed through active versus passive case-finding were more frequently female (36 [68%] of 53 vs 85 [47%] of 179; p=0·009), had a symptom duration of less than 15 days (nine [25%] of 36 vs ten [8%] of 127; p=0·03), and were more likely to be sputum smear-negative (33 [62%] of 53 vs 62 [35%] of 179; p=0·0003).
Interpretation
Although active case-finding made an important contribution to tuberculosis detection among contacts, passive case-finding detected most of the tuberculosis burden. Compared with passive case-finding, active case-finding was equitable, helped to diagnose tuberculosis earlier and usually before a positive result on sputum smear microscopy, and showed a high burden of undetected tuberculosis among women.

Cytomegalovirus is one of the most important infections to occur after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and an increasing number of reports indicate that cytomegalovirus is also a potentially important pathogen in patients treated with recently introduced drugs for hematological malignancies. Expert recommendations have been produced by the 2017 European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL 7) after a review of the literature on the diagnosis and management of cytomegalovirus in patients after HSCT and in patients receiving other types of therapy for haematological malignancies. These recommendations cover diagnosis, preventive strategies such as prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy, and management of cytomegalovirus disease. Antiviral drugs including maribavir and letermovir are in development and prospective clinical trials have recently been completed. However, management of patients with resistant or refractory cytomegalovirus infection or cytomegalovirus disease is a challenge. In this Review we summarise the reviewed literature and the recommendations of the ECIL 7 for management of cytomegalovirus in patients with haematological malignancies."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Severe community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. CAL02, a novel antitoxin agent with an unprecedented mode of action, consists of liposomes that capture bacterial toxins known to dysregulate inflammation, cause organ damage, and impede immune defence. We aimed to assess the safety of CAL02 as an add-on therapy to antibiotics.
Methods
This randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial was done in ten intensive care units (ICUs) in France and Belgium (but only six units enrolled patients), in patients with severe community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia who required ICU admission and had been identified as being infected with S pneumoniae. We randomly assigned participants in two stages—the first stage randomly assigned six patients (1:1) to either low-dose CAL02 or placebo, and the second stage randomly assigned 18 patients (14:4) to either high-dose CAL02 or placebo, and stratified in four blocks (4:1, 4:1, 3:1, and 3:1), in addition to standard of care. Block randomisation was done with a computer-generated random number list. Participants, investigators, other site study personnel, the sponsor, and the sponsor's designees involved in study management and monitoring were masked to the randomisation list and treatment assignment. Patients were treated with low-dose (4 mg/kg) or high-dose (16 mg/kg) CAL02 or placebo (saline), in addition to standard antibiotic therapy. Two intravenous doses of study treatment were infused, with a 24 h interval, at a concentration of 10 mg/mL, stepwise, over a maximum of 2 h on days 1 and 2. The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of low-dose and high-dose CAL02 in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia treated with standard antibiotic therapy, and the primary analysis was done on the safety population (all patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment). Efficacy was a secondary outcome. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02583373.
Findings
Between March 21, 2016, and Jan 13, 2018, we screened 280 patients with community-acquired pneumonia. 19 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, resulting in 13 patients in the CAL02 groups (three assigned to low-dose CAL02 and ten assigned to high-dose CAL02) and six in the placebo group. One patient randomly assigned to placebo was allocated to the wrong treatment group and received high-dose CAL02 instead of placebo. Thus, 14 patients received CAL02 (three received low-dose CAL02 and 11 received high-dose CAL02) and five patients received placebo, constituting the safety population. At baseline, the mean APACHE II score for the total study population was 21·5 (SD 4·9; 95% CI 19·3–23·7) and 11 (58%) of 19 patients had septic shock. Adverse events occurred in 12 (86%) of 14 patients in the CAL02 treatment groups combined and all five (100%) patients in the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred in four (29%) of 14 patients in the CAL02 treatment groups combined and two (40%) of five patients in the placebo group. One non-serious adverse event (mild increase in triglycerides) in a patient in the high-dose CAL02 group was reported as related to study drug. However, analysis of the changes in triglyceride levels in the CAL02 groups compared with the placebo group revealed no correlation with administration of CAL02. No adverse events were linked to local tolerability events. All patients, apart from one who died in the low CAL02 group (death not related to the study drug) achieved clinical cure at the test of cure visit between days 15 and 22. The sequential organ failure assessment score decreased by mean 65·0% (95% CI 50·7–79·4) in the combined CAL02 groups compared with 29·2% (12·8–45·5) in the placebo group between baseline and day 8.
Interpretation
The nature of adverse events was consistent with the profile of the study population and CAL02 showed a promising safety profile and tolerability. However, the difference between high-dose and low-dose CAL02 could not be assessed in this study. Efficacy was in line with the expected benefits of neutralising toxins. The results of this study support further clinical development of CAL02 and provide a solid basis for a larger clinical study.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Sexually transmitted and urogenital infections are typically managed by WHO-recommended syndromic algorithms in resource-poor countries, and presumptively in Europe. However, algorithms for vaginal discharge and lower abdominal pain perform poorly in women. The women's improvement of sexual and reproductive health (WISH) study in Kigali, Rwanda, sought to improve case-finding and infection management in women by introducing point-of-care tests. The main aim was to compare the performance of the WISH algorithms and the WHO vaginal discharge and lower abdominal pain algorithms with gold standard testing.
Methods
This cross-sectional screening and diagnostic accuracy study recruited women aged 18 years or older with or without urogenital symptoms at risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections in Kigali, Rwanda. Recruitment activities were implemented by study staff with the help of community mobilisers at health centres, pharmacies, markets, women's organisations, and at “umuganda” community meetings. At the study visit, participants had a face-to-face interview that included questions about current urogenital symptoms. Participants were first asked without prompting (spontaneous reporting), followed by questions about 14 specific symptoms (structural reporting). Next, the WISH algorithms were implemented. All participants had point-of-care tests for bacterial vaginosis (vaginal pH of 5·0 or above) and Trichomonas vaginalis (immunoassay) regardless of symptom reporting. Women with a positive risk score had point-of-care tests for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoea (nucleic acid amplification tests). Vulvovaginal candidiasis was treated presumptively. Nucleic acid amplification tests for C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, T vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis were the gold standard, and all patients provided swabs for these.
Findings
Participants were recruited between July 5, 2016, and March 14, 2017. 705 participants were enrolled in the study and completed a study visit, and 51 attended 53 additional visits. Prevalence by gold standard testing was 8·5% for C trachomatis, 7·1% for N gonorrhoeae, 16·1% for T vaginalis, 18·1% for bacterial vaginosis, and 8·6% for vulvovaginal candidiasis. The WISH algorithms identified similar numbers of C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, and T vaginalis infections, but much higher numbers of bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis infections. Compared with gold standard testing, the WISH algorithms had a good sensitivity and high specificity for C trachomatis (sensitivity 71·7%, specificity 100%), N gonorrhoeae (sensitivity 76·0%, specificity 100%), and T vaginalis (sensitivity 68·5%, specificity 97·4%), high sensitivity but low specificity for bacterial vaginosis (sensitivity 95·2%, specificity 41·2%), and moderate sensitivity and specificity for vulvovaginal candidiasis (sensitivity 64·4%, specificity 69·4%). The performance of vaginal pH testing for bacterial vaginosis improved by increasing the cutoff to 5·5, followed by confirmatory testing (sensitivity 73·6%, specificity 100%). The WHO algorithms had moderate sensitivity and poor specificity for all infections compared with gold standard testing: C trachomatis sensitivity 58·3%, specificity 44·7%; N gonorrhoeae sensitivity 66·0%, specificity 45·2%; T vaginalis sensitivity 60·4%, specificity 45·6%; bacterial vaginosis sensitivity 61·6%, specificity 46·0%; and vulvovaginal candidiasis sensitivity 74·6%, specificity 50·6%. Two participants attended additional visits because they had a mild allergic reaction to metronidazole. Staff and participants considered point-of-care testing feasible and acceptable.
Interpretation
Point-of-care testing for urogenital infections might improve case-finding and infection management and is feasible in resource-poor settings. Point-of-care tests should be further developed, including those targeting multiple conditions. Additional studies in other populations, including populations with low prevalence of sexually transmitted and urogenital infections, are warranted.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Accurate estimates of long-term mortality following tuberculosis treatment are scarce. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the post-treatment mortality among tuberculosis survivors, and examine differences in mortality risk by demographic and clinical characteristics.
Methods
We systematically searched Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for cohort studies published in English between Jan 1, 1997, and May 31, 2018. We included research papers that used a cohort study design, included bacteriological or clinical confirmation of tuberculosis disease for all participants, and reported, or provided enough data to calculate, mortality estimates for people with tuberculosis and a valid control group representative of the general population. We excluded studies that reported duplicate data, had a study population of fewer than 50 people overall, had a follow-up period shorter than 12 months after treatment completion, or had a loss to follow-up of more than 30%. From eligible studies, we extracted standardised mortality ratios (SMRs), or calculated them when the data were sufficient, by dividing the sum of the observed deaths by the sum of the expected deaths. For studies that did not report SMR as their mortality estimate, either mortality hazard ratios or mortality rate ratios were extracted and pooled with SMRs. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain pooled SMRs. Between-study heterogeneity was estimated with I2. This study was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018092592).
Findings
Of the 7283 unique studies identified, data from ten studies, reporting on 40 781 individuals and 6922 deaths, were included. The pooled SMR for all-cause mortality among people with tuberculosis, compared with the control group, was 2·91 (95% CI 2·21–3·84; I2=99%, pheterogeneity<0·0001). When restricted to people with confirmed treatment completion or cure, the pooled SMR was 3·76 (95% CI 3·04–4·66; I2=95%). Effect estimates were similar when stratified by tuberculosis type, sex, age, and country income category. Causes of mortality were extracted for 4226 deaths that occurred post-treatment, with most deaths attributable to cardiovascular disease (20% [95% CI 15–26]; I2=92%).
Interpretation
People treated for tuberculosis have significantly increased mortality following treatment compared with the general population or matched controls. These findings support the need for further research to understand and address the biomedical and social factors that affect the long-term prognosis of this population.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori, we have previously shown that the eradication frequency was 83·7% (95% CI 80·4–86·6) for triple therapy for 14 days (T14; lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, and clarithromycin 500 mg, all given twice daily), 85·9% (82·7–88·6) for concomitant therapy for 10 days (C10; lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, clarithromycin 500 mg, and metronidazole 500 mg, all given twice daily), and 90·4% (87·6–92·6) for bismuth quadruple therapy for 10 days (BQ10; bismuth tripotassium dicitrate 300 mg four times a day, lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily, tetracycline 500 mg four times a day, and metronidazole 500 mg three times a day). In this follow-up study, we assess short-term and long-term effects of these therapies on the gut microbiota, antibiotic resistance, and metabolic parameters.
Methods
This was a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial done at nine medical centres in Taiwan. Adult patients (>20 years) with documented H pylori infection were randomly assigned (1:1:1, with block sizes of six) to receive T14, C10, or BQ10. We assessed long-term outcomes (reinfection frequency, changes in the gut microbiota, antibiotic resistance, and metabolic parameters) in patients with available data, excluding all protocol violators and those with unknown post-treatment H pylori status. Faecal samples were collected before treatment and 2 weeks, 2 months, and at least 1 year after eradication therapy. Amplification of the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA was done followed by high-throughput sequencing. Susceptibility testing for faecal Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was done. This trial is complete and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01906879.
Findings
Between July 17, 2013, and April 20, 2016, 1620 participants were randomly assigned to the three treatment groups (540 [33%] per group). 1214 (75%) attended 1-year follow-up and are included in this analysis. Compared with baseline, alpha diversity was significantly reduced 2 weeks after T14 (p=0·0002), C10 (p<0·0001), and BQ10 (p<0·0001) treatment. Beta diversity was also significantly altered 2 weeks after T14 (p=0·0010), C10 (p=0·0001), and BQ10 (p=0·0001). Alpha diversity and beta diversity were restored at week 8 (p=0·14 and p=0·918, respectively) and 1 year (p=0·14 and p=0·918) after T14, but were not fully recovered at week 8 and after 1 year in patients treated with C10 (p=0·0001 and p=0·013 at week 8; p=0·019 and p=0·064 at 1 year) and BQ10 (p<0·0001 and p=0·0002; p=0·001 and p=0·029). A transient increase at week 2 after T14 and C10 of the resistance rates of E coli to ampicillin-sulbactam (12% [15/127] to 66% [38/58] for T14, 7% [10/135] to 64% [28/44] for C10), cefazolin (13% [16/127] to 43% [25/58] for T14, 10% [13/135] to 41% [18/44] for C10), cefmetazole (8% [10/127] to 26% [15/58] for T14, 4% [5/135] to 18% [8/44] for C10), levofloxacin (8% [10/127] to 35% [20/58] for T14, 7% [10/135] to 32% [14/44] for C10), gentamicin (13% [19/146] to 47% [27/58] for T14, 15% [22/149] to 45% [20/44] for C10), and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (33% [48/146] to 86% [50/58] for T14, 28% [42/148] to 86% [38/44] for C10; p<0·05 in paired samples in the above analyses) returned to basal state at week 8 and after 1 year. Although bodyweight and body-mass index slightly increased, there were significant improvements in metabolic parameters, with a decrease in insulin resistance, triglycerides, and LDL and an increase in HDL. Overall, there was no significant change in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome at week 8 and 1 year after T14, C10, and BQ10.
Interpretation
Eradication of H pylori infection has minimal disruption of the microbiota, no effect on antibiotic resistance of E coli, and some positive effects on metabolic parameters. Collectively, these results lend support to the long-term safety of H pylori eradication therapy.

Low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) are under-represented in reports on the burden of antimicrobial resistance. We aimed to quantify the clinical effect of carbapenem resistance on mortality and length of hospital stay among inpatients in LMICs with a bloodstream infection due to Enterobacteriaceae.
Methods
The PANORAMA study was a multinational prospective cohort study at tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, India, Lebanon, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Vietnam, recruiting consecutively diagnosed patients with carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae (CSE) and carbapenem-resistant Entero-bacteriaceae (CRE) bloodstream infections. We excluded patients who had previously been enrolled in the study and those not treated with curative intent at the time of bloodstream infection onset. There were no age restrictions. Central laboratories in India and the UK did confirmatory testing and molecular characterisation, including strain typing. We applied proportional subdistribution hazard models with inverse probability weighting to estimate the effect of carbapenem resistance on probability of discharge alive and in-hospital death, and multistate modelling for excess length of stay in hospital. All patients were included in the analysis.
Findings
Between Aug 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015, we recruited 297 patients from 16 sites in ten countries: 174 with CSE bloodstream infection and 123 with CRE bloodstream infection. Median age was 46 years (IQR 15–61). Crude mortality was 20% (35 of 174 patients) for patients with CSE bloodstream infection and 35% (43 of 123 patients) for patients with CRE bloodstream infection. Carbapenem resistance was associated with an increased length of hospital stay (3·7 days, 95% CI 0·3–6·9), increased probability of in-hospital mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio 1·75, 95% CI 1·04–2·94), and decreased probability of discharge alive (0·61, 0·45–0·83). Multilocus sequence typing showed various clades, with marginal overlap between strains in the CRE and CSE clades.
Interpretation
Carbapenem resistance is associated with increased length of hospital stay and mortality in patients with bloodstream infections in LMICs. These data will inform global estimates of the burden of antimicrobial resistance and reinforce the need for better strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat CRE infections in LMICs.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The eradication of wild and vaccine-derived poliovirus requires the global withdrawal of oral poliovirus vaccines (OPVs) and replacement with inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPVs). The first phase of this effort was the withdrawal of the serotype 2 vaccine in April 2016, with a switch from trivalent OPVs to bivalent OPVs. The aim of our study was to produce comparative estimates of humoral and intestinal mucosal immunity associated with different routine immunisation schedules.
Methods
We did a random-effect meta-analysis with single proportions and a network meta-analysis in a Bayesian framework to synthesise direct and indirect data. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials published from Jan 1, 1980, to Nov 1, 2018, comparing poliovirus immunisation schedules in a primary series. Only trials done outside western Europe or North America and without variation in age schedules (ie, age at administration of the vaccine) between study groups were included in the analyses, because trials in high-income settings differ in vaccine immunogenicity and schedules from other settings and to ensure consistency within the network of trials. Data were extracted directly from the published reports. We assessed seroconversion against poliovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 3, and intestinal immunity against serotype 2, measured by absence of shedding poliovirus after a challenge OPV dose.
Findings
We identified 437 unique studies; of them, 17 studies with a maximum of 8279 evaluable infants were eligible for assessment of humoral immunity, and eight studies with 4254 infants were eligible for intestinal immunity. For serotype 2, there was low between-trial heterogeneity in the data (τ=0·05, 95% credible interval [CrI] 0·009–0·15) and the risk ratio (RR) of seroconversion after three doses of bivalent OPVs was 0·14 (95% CrI 0·11–0·17) compared with three doses of trivalent OPVs. The addition of one or two full doses of an IPV after a bivalent OPV schedule increased the RR to 0·85 (0·75–1·0) and 1·1 (0·98–1·4). However, the addition of an IPV to bivalent OPV schedules did not significantly increase intestinal immunity (0·33, 0·18–0·61), compared with trivalent OPVs alone. For serotypes 1 and 3, there was susbstantial inconsistency and between-trial heterogeneity between direct and indirect effects, so we only present pooled estmates on seroconversion, which were at least 80% for serotype 1 and at least 88% for serotype 3 for all vaccine schedules.
Interpretation
For WHO's polio eradication programme, the addition of one IPV dose for all birth cohorts should be prioritised to protect against paralysis caused by type 2 poliovirus; however, this inclusion will not prevent transmission or circulation in areas with faecal–oral transmission.

abstract = "Summary
Background
A record number of people survived Ebola virus infection in the 2013–16 outbreak in west Africa, and the number of survivors has increased after subsequent outbreaks. A range of post-Ebola sequelae have been reported in survivors, but little is known about subsequent mortality. We aimed to investigate subsequent mortality among people discharged from Ebola treatment units.
Methods
From Dec 8, 2015, Surveillance Active en ceinture, the Guinean national survivors' monitoring programme, attempted to contact and follow-up all survivors of Ebola virus disease who were discharged from Ebola treatment units. Survivors were followed up until Sept 30, 2016, and deaths up to this timepoint were recorded. Verbal autopsies were done to gain information about survivors of Ebola virus disease who subsequently died from their closest family members. We calculated the age-standardised mortality ratio compared with the general Guinean population, and assessed risk factors for mortality using survival analysis and a Cox proportional hazards regression model.
Findings
Of the 1270 survivors of Ebola virus disease who were discharged from Ebola treatment units in Guinea, information was retrieved for 1130 (89%). Compared with the general Guinean population, survivors of Ebola virus disease had a more than five-times increased risk of mortality up to Dec 31, 2015 (age-standardised mortality ratio 5·2 [95% CI 4·0–6·8]), a mean of 1 year of follow-up after discharge. Thereafter (ie, from Jan 1–Sept 30, 2016), mortality did not differ between survivors of Ebola virus disease and the general population. (0·6 [95% CI 0·2–1·4]). Overall, 59 deaths were reported, and the cause of death was tentatively attributed to renal failure in 37 cases, mostly on the basis of reported anuria. Longer stays (ie, equal to or longer than the median stay) in Ebola treatment units were associated with an increased risk of late death compared with shorter stays (adjusted hazard ratio 2·62 [95% CI 1·43–4·79]).
Interpretation
Mortality was high in people who recovered from Ebola virus disease and were discharged from Ebola treatment units in Guinea. The finding that survivors who were hospitalised for longer during primary infection had an increased risk of death, could help to guide current and future survivors' programmes and in the prioritisation of funds in resource-constrained settings. The role of renal failure in late deaths after recovery from Ebola virus disease should be investigated.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Non-prescription dispensing of antibiotics at community pharmacies is a major driver of antimicrobial resistance. China has regarded curbing non-prescription sales of antibiotics at community pharmacies as an important task for tackling antibiotics resistance and planned to eliminate this practice nationwide before 2020. We aimed to quantify non-prescription dispensing of antibiotics cross-sectionally at community pharmacies in China in 2017, and longitudinally (2011–17) in a single province.
Methods
A simulated client method was used to measure non-prescription antibiotic dispensing based on scenarios about paediatric diarrhoea and adult acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), which were presented at each pharmacy. We collected cross-sectional data for 2423 community pharmacies from 221 counties or districts in six provinces in different regions of China, in 2017. We also assessed 213 community pharmacies in Shaanxi province with a baseline survey in 2011 and subsequent follow-up surveys every 2 years until 2017. In the cross-sectional analysis, multivariate binary logistic regression with random-intercepts was used to evaluate the factors associated with non-prescription dispensing of antibiotics. We also estimated unadjusted period effects of non-prescription antibiotic dispensing using generalised estimated equations.
Findings
After excluding invalid interactions within 12 community pharmacies, the study included 4822 simulated interactions within 2411 community pharmacies. Non-prescription antibiotic dispensing was observed during 1169 (48·5% [95% CI 46·5–50·5]) of 2411 diarrhoea interactions and 1690 (70·1% [68·2–71·9]) of 2411 adult URTI interactions. Non-prescription antibiotic dispensing was more prevalent in rural areas and the central and western provinces, and was negatively associated with the presence of a pharmacist on-site (odds ratio 0·66 [0·56–0·78], p<0·0001) and being part of a chain pharmacy (0·75 [0·62–0·89], p=0·0012). In Shaanxi province, significant decreases of non-prescription antibiotic dispensing occurred in paediatric cases (from 154 [72·3%] of 213 community pharmacies to 107 [50·2%], p<0·0001) and adult cases (from 204 [95·8%] to 148 [69·5%], p<0·0001) between 2011 and 2017.
Interpretation
Non-prescription dispensing of antibiotics at community pharmacies was still prevalent nationwide in China in 2017, although a decrease was observed in Shaanxi Province since 2011. Multifaceted measures, including regulatory interventions, professional training, and public health education are needed.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Evidence for the benefits of antiseptic meatal cleaning in reducing catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) is inconclusive. We assessed the efficacy of 0·1% chlorhexidine solution compared with normal saline for meatal cleaning before urinary catheter insertion in reducing the incidence of catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria and UTI.
Methods
A cross-sectional, stepped-wedge, open-label, randomised controlled trial was undertaken in Australian hospitals. Eligible hospitals were Australian public and private hospitals, with an intensive care unit and more than 30 000 hospital admissions per year. Hospitals were randomly assigned to an intervention crossover date using a computer-generated randomisation system. Crossover dates occurred every 8 weeks; during the first 8 weeks of the study, no hospitals were exposed to the intervention (control phase), after which each hospital sequentially crossed over from the control to the intervention every 8 weeks. Patients requiring a urinary cathetwer were potentially eligible for inclusion in this hospital-wide study. Participants were excluded if they were younger than 2 years, had a medical reason preventing the use of the chlorhexidine, had the catheter inserted in theatre, did not have the catheter insertion date documented, required in-and-out or suprapubic catheterisation, had symptoms and signs suggestive of UTI at the time of catheter insertion, or were currently undergoing treatment for UTI. The intervention was the use of 0·1% chlorhexidine solution for meatal cleaning before urinary catheterisation with 0·9% normal saline used in the control phase. Masking of hospitals was not possible because it was not feasible to mask staff administering the intervention. The co-primary outcomes were the number of cases of catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria and UTI per 100 catheter-days and were assessed within 7 days of catheter insertion in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12617000373370.
Findings
21 hospitals were assessed for eligibility between Jan 5, 2017, and May 1, 2017; of these, three were successfully enrolled and randomised to one of three intervention crossover dates. 1642 participants in these hospitals were included in the study between Aug 1, 2017, and March 12, 2018, 697 (42%) in the control phase and 945 (58%) in the intervention period. In the control period, 13 catheter-associated UTI and 29 catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria events in 2889 catheter-days (0·45 catheter-associated UTI cases and 1·00 catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria cases per 100 catheter-days) were recorded compared with four catheter-associated UTI and 16 catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria events in 2338 catheter-days (0·17 catheter-associated UTI cases and 0·68 catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria cases per 100 catheter-days) during the intervention period. The intervention was associated with a 74% reduction in the incidence of catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (incident rate ratio 0·26, 95% CI 0·08–0·86, p=0·026), and a 94% decrease in the incidence of catheter-associated UTI (0·06, 95% CI 0·01–0·32, p=0·00080). There were no reported adverse events.
Interpretation
The use of chlorhexidine solution for meatal cleaning before catheter insertion decreased the incidence of catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria and UTI and has the potential to improve patient safety.

abstract = "Summary
Background
An alarming rise in reported Lassa fever cases continues in west Africa. Liberia has the largest reported per capita incidence of Lassa fever cases in the region, but genomic information on the circulating strains is scarce. The aim of this study was to substantially increase the available pool of data to help foster the generation of targeted diagnostics and therapeutics.
Methods
Clinical serum samples collected from 17 positive Lassa fever cases originating from Liberia (16 cases) and Guinea (one case) within the past decade were processed at the Liberian Institute for Biomedical Research using a targeted-enrichment sequencing approach, producing 17 near-complete genomes. An additional 17 Lassa virus sequences (two from Guinea, seven from Liberia, four from Nigeria, and four from Sierra Leone) were generated from viral stocks at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) from samples originating from the Mano River Union (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) region and Nigeria. Sequences were compared with existing Lassa virus genomes and published Lassa virus assays.
Findings
The 23 new Liberian Lassa virus genomes grouped within two clades (IV.A and IV.B) and were genetically divergent from those circulating elsewhere in west Africa. A time-calibrated phylogeographic analysis incorporating the new genomes suggests Liberia was the entry point of Lassa virus into the Mano River Union region and estimates the introduction to have occurred between 300–350 years ago. A high level of diversity exists between the Liberian Lassa virus genomes. Nucleotide percent difference between Liberian Lassa virus genomes ranged up to 27% in the L segment and 18% in the S segment. The commonly used Lassa Josiah-MGB assay was up to 25% divergent across the target sites when aligned to the Liberian Lassa virus genomes.
Interpretation
The large amount of novel genomic diversity of Lassa virus observed in the Liberian cases emphasises the need to match deployed diagnostic capabilities with locally circulating strains and underscores the importance of evaluating cross-lineage protection in the development of vaccines and therapeutics.

abstract = "Summary
Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most important threats to global health security. A range of Gram-negative bacteria associated with high morbidity and mortality are now resistant to almost all available antibiotics. In this context of urgency to develop novel drugs, new antibiotics for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (namely, ceftazidime-avibactam, plazomicin, and meropenem-vaborbactam) have been approved by regulatory authorities based on non-inferiority trials that provided no direct evidence of their efficacy against multidrug-resistant bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, and Acinetobacter baumannii. The use of non-inferiority and superiority trials, and selection of appropriate and optimal study designs, remains a major challenge in the development, registration, and post-marketing implementation of new antibiotics. Using an example of the development process of ceftazidime-avibactam, we propose a strategy for a new research framework based on adaptive randomised clinical trials. The operational research strategy has the aim of assessing the efficacy of new antibiotics in special groups of patients, such as those infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria, who were not included in earlier phase studies, and for whom it is important to establish an appropriate standard of care."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Since 2014, England has seen increased scarlet fever activity unprecedented in modern times. In 2016, England's scarlet fever seasonal rise coincided with an unexpected elevation in invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections. We describe the molecular epidemiological investigation of these events.
Methods
We analysed changes in S pyogenes emm genotypes, and notifications of scarlet fever and invasive disease in 2014–16 using regional (northwest London) and national (England and Wales) data. Genomes of 135 non-invasive and 552 invasive emm1 isolates from 2009–16 were analysed and compared with 2800 global emm1 sequences. Transcript and protein expression of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA; also known as scarlet fever or erythrogenic toxin A) in sequenced, non-invasive emm1 isolates was quantified by real-time PCR and western blot analyses.
Findings
Coincident with national increases in scarlet fever and invasive disease notifications, emm1 S pyogenes upper respiratory tract isolates increased significantly in northwest London in the March to May period, from five (5%) of 96 isolates in 2014, to 28 (19%) of 147 isolates in 2015 (p=0·0021 vs 2014 values), to 47 (33%) of 144 in 2016 (p=0·0080 vs 2015 values). Similarly, invasive emm1 isolates collected nationally in the same period increased from 183 (31%) of 587 in 2015 to 267 (42%) of 637 in 2016 (p<0·0001). Sequences of emm1 isolates from 2009–16 showed emergence of a new emm1 lineage (designated M1UK)—with overlap of pharyngitis, scarlet fever, and invasive M1UK strains—which could be genotypically distinguished from pandemic emm1 isolates (M1global) by 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Median SpeA protein concentration in supernatant was nine-times higher among M1UK isolates (190·2 ng/mL [IQR 168·9–200·4]; n=10) than M1global isolates (20·9 ng/mL [0·0–27·3]; n=10; p<0·0001). M1UK expanded nationally to represent 252 (84%) of all 299 emm1 genomes in 2016. Phylogenetic analysis of published datasets identified single M1UK isolates in Denmark and the USA.
Interpretation
A dominant new emm1 S pyogenes lineage characterised by increased SpeA production has emerged during increased S pyogenes activity in England. The expanded reservoir of M1UK and recognised invasive potential of emm1 S pyogenes provide plausible explanation for the increased incidence of invasive disease, and rationale for global surveillance.

Increasing evidence supports a central role of the immune system in sepsis, but the current view of how sepsis affects immunity, and vice versa, is still rudimentary. The European Group on Immunology of Sepsis has identified major gaps that should be addressed with high priority, such as understanding how immunological alterations predispose to sepsis, key aspects of the immunopathological events during sepsis, and the long-term consequences of sepsis on patient's immunity. We discuss major unmet topics in those three categories, including the role of key immune cells, the cause of lymphopenia, organ-specific immunology, the dynamics of sepsis-associated immunological alterations, the role of the microbiome, the standardisation of immunological tests, the development of better animal models, and the opportunities offered by immunotherapy. Addressing these gaps should help us to better understand sepsis physiopathology, offering translational opportunities to improve its prevention, diagnosis, and care."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease is a major cause of global morbidity and mortality. Malnourished children, those with recent malaria or sickle-cell anaemia, and adults with HIV infection are at particularly high risk of disease. We sought to estimate the burden of disease attributable to non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease for the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017.
Methods
We did a systematic review of scientific databases and grey literature, and estimated non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease incidence and mortality for the years 1990 to 2017, by age, sex, and geographical location using DisMod-MR, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. We estimated case fatality by age, HIV status, and sociodemographic development. We also calculated the HIV-attributable fraction and estimated health gap metrics, including disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
Findings
We estimated that 535 000 (95% uncertainty interval 409 000–705 000) cases of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease occurred in 2017, with the highest incidence in sub-Saharan Africa (34·5 [26·6–45·0] cases per 100 000 person-years) and in children younger than 5 years (34·3 [23·2–54·7] cases per 100 000 person-years). 77 500 (46 400–123 000) deaths were estimated in 2017, of which 18 400 (12 000–27 700) were attributable to HIV. The remaining 59 100 (33 300–98 100) deaths not attributable to HIV accounted for 4·26 million (2·38–7·38) DALYs in 2017. Mean all-age case fatality was 14·5% (9·2–21·1), with higher estimates among children younger than 5 years (13·5% [8·4–19·8]) and elderly people (51·2% [30·2–72·9] among those aged ≥70 years), people with HIV infection (41·8% [30·0–54·0]), and in areas of low sociodemographic development (eg, 15·8% [10·0–22·9] in sub-Saharan Africa).
Interpretation
We present the first global estimates of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease that have been produced as part of GBD 2017. Given the high disease burden, particularly in children, elderly people, and people with HIV infection, investigating the sources and transmission pathways of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease is crucial to implement effective preventive and control measures.

abstract = "Summary
Background
CNS infections are a leading cause of HIV-related deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, but causes and outcomes are poorly defined. We aimed to determine mortality and predictors of mortality in adults evaluated for meningitis in Botswana, which has an estimated 23% HIV prevalence among adults.
Methods
In this prevalent cohort study, patient records from 2004–15 were sampled from the Botswana national meningitis survey, a nationwide audit of all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) laboratory records from patients receiving a lumbar puncture for evaluation of meningitis. Data from all patients with culture-confirmed pneumococcal and tuberculous meningitis, and all patients with culture-negative meningitis with CSF white cell count (WCC) above 20 cells per μL were included in our analyses, in addition to a random selection of patients with culture-negative CSF and CSF WCC of up to 20 cells per μL. We used patient national identification numbers to link CSF laboratory records from the national meningitis survey to patient vital registry and HIV databases. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate clinical and laboratory predictors of mortality.
Findings
We included data from 238 patients with culture-confirmed pneumococcal meningitis, 48 with culture-confirmed tuberculous meningitis, and 2900 with culture-negative CSF (including 1691 with CSF WCC of up to 20 cells per μL and 1209 with CSF WCC above 20 cells per μL). Median age was 37 years (IQR 31–46), 1605 (50%) of 3184 patients were male, 2188 (72%) of 3023 patients with registry linkage had documentation of HIV infection, and median CD4 count was 139 cells per μL (IQR 63–271). 10-week and 1-year mortality was 47% (112 of 238) and 49% (117 of 238) for pneumococcal meningitis, 46% (22 of 48) and 56% (27 of 48) for tuberculous meningitis, and 41% (1181 of 2900) and 49% (1408 of 2900) for culture-negative patients. When the analysis of patients with culture-negative CSF was restricted to those with known HIV infection, WCC (0–20 cells per μL vs >20 cells per μL) was not predictive of mortality (average hazard ratio 0·93, 95% CI 0·80–1·09).
Interpretation
Mortality from pneumococcal, tuberculous, and culture-negative meningitis was high in this setting of high HIV prevalence. There is an urgent need for improved access to diagnostics, to better define aetiologies and develop novel diagnostic tools and treatment algorithms.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Typhoid fever is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low-income and middle-income countries. In 2017, WHO recommended the programmatic use of typhoid Vi-conjugate vaccine (TCV) in endemic settings, and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, has pledged support for vaccine introduction in these countries. Country-level health economic evaluations are now needed to inform decision-making.
Methods
In this modelling study, we compared four strategies: no vaccination, routine immunisation at 9 months, and routine immunisation at 9 months with catch-up campaigns to either age 5 years or 15 years. For each of the 54 countries eligible for Gavi support, output from an age-structured transmission-dynamic model was combined with country-specific treatment and vaccine-related costs, treatment outcomes, and disability weights to estimate the reduction in typhoid burden, identify the strategy that maximised average net benefit (ie, the optimal strategy) across a range of country-specific willingness-to-pay (WTP) values, estimate and investigate the uncertainties surrounding our findings, and identify the epidemiological conditions under which vaccination is optimal.
Findings
The optimal strategy was either no vaccination or TCV immunisation including a catch-up campaign. Routine vaccination with a catch-up campaign to 15 years of age was optimal in 38 countries, assuming a WTP value of at least US$200 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, or assuming a WTP value of at least 25% of each country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita per DALY averted, at a vaccine price of $1·50 per dose (but excluding Gavi's contribution according to each country's transition phase). This vaccination strategy was also optimal in 48 countries assuming a WTP of at least $500 per DALY averted, in 51 with assumed WTP values of at least $1000, in 47 countries assuming a WTP value of at least 50% of GDP per capita per DALY averted, and in 49 assuming a minimum of 100%. Vaccination was likely to be cost-effective in countries with 300 or more typhoid cases per 100 000 person-years. Uncertainty about the probability of hospital admission (and typhoid incidence and mortality) had the greatest influence on the optimal strategy.
Interpretation
Countries should establish their own WTP threshold and consider routine TCV introduction, including a catch-up campaign when vaccination is optimal on the basis of this threshold. Obtaining improved estimates of the probability of hospital admission would be valuable whenever the optimal strategy is uncertain.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Evaluating interventions that might lead to a reduction in tuberculosis in high-income countries with a low incidence of the disease is key to accelerate progress towards its elimination. In such countries, migrants are known to contribute a large proportion of tuberculosis cases to the burden. We assessed the effectiveness of screening for active tuberculosis before entry to the UK and for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) post-entry for reduction of tuberculosis in new-entrant migrants to the UK. Additionally, we investigated the effect of access to primary care on tuberculosis incidence in this population.
Methods
We did a retrospective, population-based cohort study of migrants from 66 countries who were negative for active tuberculosis at pre-entry screening between Jan 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2014, and eligible for LTBI screening. We used record linkage to track their first contact with primary care, uptake of LTBI screening, and development of active tuberculosis in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. To assess the effectiveness of the pre-entry screening programme, we identified a control group of migrants who were not screened for active tuberculosis using the specific code for new entrants to the UK registering in primary care within the National Health Service patient registration data system. Our primary outcome was development of active tuberculosis notified to the National Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance System.
Findings
Our cohort comprised 224 234 migrants who were screened for active tuberculosis before entry to the UK and a control group of 118 738 migrants who were not. 103 990 (50%) migrants who were screened for active tuberculosis registered in primary care; all individuals in the control group were registered in primary care. 1828 tuberculosis cases were identified during the cohort time, of which 31 were prevalent. There were 26 incident active tuberculosis cases in migrants with no evidence of primary care registration, and 1771 cases in the entire cohort of migrants who registered in primary care (n=222 728), giving an incidence rate of 174 (95% CI 166–182) per 100 000 person-years. 672 (1%) of 103 990 migrants who were screened for active tuberculosis went on to develop tuberculosis compared with 1099 (1%) of 118 738 not screened for active tuberculosis (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1·49, 95% CI 1·33–1·67; p<0·0001). 2451 (1%) of the 222 728 migrants registered in primary care were screened for LTBI, of whom 421 (17%) tested positive and 1961 (80%) tested negative; none developed active tuberculosis within the observed time period. Migrants settling in the least deprived areas had a decreased risk of developing tuberculosis (IRR 0·74, 95% CI 0·62–0·89; p=0·002), and time from UK arrival to primary care registration of 1 year or longer was associated with increased risk of active tuberculosis (2·96, 2·59–3·38; p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Pre-entry tuberculosis screening, early primary care registration, and LTBI screening are strongly and independently associated with a lower tuberculosis incidence in new-entrant migrants.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli isolates (ESBL-E coli) cause more than 5000 cases of bacteraemias annually in the UK. The contribution of the food chain to these infections is debated. We aimed to identify the most important reservoirs of ESBL-E coli that colonise and infect humans to identify strategic intervention points.
Methods
Sampling for ESBL-E coli was done between Aug 1, 2013, and Dec 15, 2014. We used selective media to seek ESBL-E coli in routinely submitted samples from human faeces, and prospectively collected samples from sewage, farm slurry, and retail foodstuffs in London, East Anglia, northwest England, Scotland, and Wales. We sequenced recovered isolates and compared these isolates with 293 bloodstream and 83 veterinary surveillance ESBL-E coli isolates from the same regions.
Findings
2157 (11%) of 20 243 human faeces samples contained ESBL-E coli, including 678 (17%) of 3995 in London. ESBL-E coli also were frequent in sewage and retail chicken (104 [65%] of 159 meat samples), but were rare in other meats and absent from plant-based foods (0 of 400 fruit and vegetable samples). Sequence type (ST) 131 dominated among ESBL-E coli from human blood (188 [64%] of 293 isolates), faeces (128 [36%] of 360), and sewage (14 [22%] of 65) with STs 38 and 648 also widespread; CTX-M-15 was the predominant ESBL in these lineages (319 [77%] of 416). By contrast, STs 602, 23, and 117—mostly with CTX-M-1 ESBL—dominated among food and veterinary isolates (68 [31%] of 218), with only two ST131 organisms recovered. ST10 occurred in both animals and humans, being frequent in surveillance bovines (11 [22%] of 51 cattle) and representing 15 (4%) of 360 human faecal isolates (but only three [1%] of 293 from bacteraemias); however, both human and animal ST10 isolates were diverse in serotype.
Interpretation
Most human bacteraemias with ESBL-E coli in the UK involve internationally prevalent human-associated STs, particularly ST131; non-human reservoirs made little contribution to invasive human disease. Any interventions that seek to target food or livestock can affect the numbers of human infections caused by ESBL-E coli; prevention of the spread of resistant lineages among humans is more vital.

Background
The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) can prevent herpes zoster in older adults and autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in adults with haematological malignancies receiving immunosuppressive cancer treatments.
Methods
In this phase 3, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study, done at 77 centres worldwide, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients with haematological malignancies aged 18 years and older to receive two doses of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine or placebo 1–2 months apart during or after immunosuppressive cancer treatments, and stratified participants according to their underlying diseases. The co-primary objectives of the study were the evaluation of safety and reactogenicity of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine compared with placebo from the first vaccination up to 30 days after last vaccination in all participants; evaluation of the proportion of participants with a vaccine response in terms of anti-glycoprotein E humoral immune response to the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine at month 2 in all participants, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; and evaluation of the anti-glycoprotein E humoral immune responses to the vaccine compared with placebo at month 2 in all participants, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We assessed immunogenicity in the per-protocol cohort for immunogenicity and safety in the total vaccinated cohort. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01767467, and with the EU Clinical Trials Register, number 2012-003438-18.
Findings
Between March 1, 2013, and Sept 10, 2015, we randomly assigned 286 participants to adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine and 283 to placebo. 283 in the vaccine group and 279 in the placebo group were vaccinated. At month 2, 119 (80·4%, 95% CI 73·1–86·5) of 148 participants had a humoral vaccine response to adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine, compared with one (0·8%, 0·0–4·2) of 130 participants in the placebo group, and the adjusted geometric mean anti-glycoprotein E antibody concentration was 23 132·9 mIU/mL (95% CI 16 642·8–32 153·9) in the vaccine group and 777·6 mIU/mL (702·8–860·3) in the placebo group (adjusted geometric mean ratio 29·75, 21·09–41·96; p<0·0001) in all patients, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses persisted above baseline until month 13 in all strata and, as expected, vaccine was more reactogenic than placebo (within 7 days after vaccination pain was reported by 221 [79·5%] of 278 vaccine group participants and 45 [16·4%] of 274 placebo group participants; fatigue was reported by 162 [58·3%] of 278 vaccine group participants and 102 [37·2%] of 274 placebo group participants). Incidences of unsolicited or serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases, disease-related events, and fatal serious adverse events were similar between the groups.
Interpretation
The immunocompromised adult population with haematological malignancies is at high risk for herpes zoster. The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine, which is currently licensed in certain countries for adults aged 50 years and older, is likely to benefit this population.

abstract = "Summary
Background
To date, epidemiological studies at the index site of the 2013–16 west African Ebola outbreak in Meliandou, Guinea, have been restricted in their scope. We aimed to determine the occurrence of previously undocumented Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases and infections, and to reconstruct transmission events.
Methods
This cross-sectional seroprevalence survey of the adult population of Meliandou used a highly specific oral fluid test and detailed interviews of all households in the village and key informants. Each household was interviewed, with all members prompted to describe the events of the outbreak, any illness within the household, and possible contact with suspected cases. Information for deceased individuals was provided by relatives living in the same household. Symptoms were based on Ebola virus Makona variant EVD case definitions (focusing on fever, vomiting, and diarrhoea). For antibody testing, we used an Ebola virus glycoprotein IgG capture enzyme immunoassay developed from a previously validated assay. A maximum exposure level was assigned to every participant using a predetermined scale. We used a generalised linear model (logit function) to estimate odds ratios for the association of sociodemographic variables and exposure level with Ebola virus infection. We adjusted estimates for age and maximum exposure, as appropriate.
Findings
Between June 22, and July 9, 2017, we enrolled 237 participants from 27 households in Meliandou. Two households refused to participate and one was absent. All adults in participating households who were present for the interview provided an oral fluid swab for testing, of which 224 were suitable for analysis. In addition to the 11 EVD deaths described previously, on the basis of clinical description and oral fluid testing, we found two probable EVD deaths and eight previously unrecognised anti-Ebola virus IgG-positive survivors, including one who had mild symptoms and one who was asymptomatic, resulting in a case fatality of 55·6% (95% CI 30·8–78·5) for adults. Health-care work (adjusted odds ratio 6·64, 1·54–28·56; p=0·001) and level of exposure (odds ratio adjusted for linear trend across five levels 2·79, 1·59–4·883; p<0·0001) were independent risk factors for infection.
Interpretation
Ebola virus infection was more widespread in this spillover population than previously recognised (21 vs 11 cases). We show the first serological evidence of survivors in this population (eight anti-Ebola virus IgG seropositive) and report a case fatality lower than previously reported (55·6% vs 100% in adults). These data show the high community coverage achievable by using a non-invasive test and, by accurately documenting the beginnings of the west African Ebola virus outbreak, reveal important insight into transmission dynamics and risk factors that underpin Ebola virus spillover events.

Natural products have been a rich source of compounds with structural and chemical diversity for drug discovery. However, antibiotic resistance in bacteria has been reported for nearly every antibiotic once it is used in clinical practice. In the past decade, pharmaceutical companies have reduced their natural product discovery projects because of challenges, such as high costs, low return rates, and high rediscovery rates. The largely unexplored marine environment harbours substantial diversity and is a large resource to discover novel compounds with novel modes of action, which is essential for the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections. In this Review, we report compounds derived from marine sources that have shown in-vivo and in-vitro efficacy against drug-resistant bacteria. Analysis of the physicochemical properties of these marine natural products with activity against drug-resistant bacteria showed that 60% of the compounds have oral bioavailability potential. Their overall distribution pattern of drug characteristics agrees with the observation that marketed antibacterial drugs have a polar distribution, with a lower median calculated logP. The aim of this Review is to summarise the diversity of these marine natural products, with a special focus on analysis of drug bioavailability. Such biologically active compounds, with high degrees of bioavailability, have the potential to be developed as effective drugs against infectious diseases."

abstract = "Summary
Following exposure to tuberculosis and subsequent infection, children often progress to tuberculosis disease more rapidly than adults. And yet the natural history of tuberculosis in children, as a continuum from exposure to infection and then to disease, is poorly understood. Children are rarely diagnosed with tuberculosis infection in routine care in international settings and few receive tuberculosis infection treatment. In this Personal View, we review the most up-to-date knowledge in three areas of childhood tuberculosis infection—namely, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. We then outline what is missing in each of these three areas to generate a priority research agenda. Finally, we suggest potential study designs that might answer these questions. Understanding of pathophysiology could be improved through animal models, laboratory studies assessing the immunological responses of blood or respiratory samples to Mycobacterium spp in vitro, as well as investigating immune responses in children exposed to tuberculosis. Identification of children with sub-clinical disease and at high risk of progression to clinically overt disease, would allow treatment to be targeted at those most likely to benefit. Optimisation and discovery of novel treatments for tuberculosis infection in children should account for mechanisms of action of tuberculosis drugs, as well as child-specific factors including pharmacokinetics and appropriate formulations. To conduct these studies, a change in mindset is required, with a recognition that the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis infection in children is a necessary component in addressing the overall tuberculosis epidemic. Collaboration between stakeholders will be required and funding will need to increase, both for research and implementation. The consequences of inaction, however, will lead to further decades of children suffering from what should increasingly be recognised as a preventable disease."

Background
ExPEC4V (JNJ-63871860) is a bioconjugate vaccine, containing O-antigens from Escherichia coli serotypes O1A, O2, O6A, and O25B, developed for the prevention of invasive extra-intestinal pathogenic E coli (ExPEC) disease. We aimed to assess safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of ExPEC4V in healthy adults.
Methods
In this phase 2 randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled study, we recruited healthy adults (≥18 years with a body-mass index of 35 kg/m2 or less) between Nov 16, 2015, and Aug 8, 2017, and randomly assigned them to receive a single dose of ExPEC4V (antigen O1A:O2:O6A:O25B content 4:4:4:4 μg [group 1]; 4:4:4:8 μg [group 2], 8:8:8:8 μg [group 3], 8:8:8:16 μg [group 4], or 16:16:16:16 μg [group 5]) or placebo. The primary objectives were evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ExPEC4V and determination of its dose-dependent immunogenicity 15 days after vaccination by ELISA in individuals who had received at least one vaccination dose. Antibody titres and safety evaluation were used to select two ExPEC4V doses for assessment up to day 360. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02546960.
Findings
Of 848 enrolled participants, 843 (99%) received the ExPEC4V vaccine (757) or placebo (86) and were included in the safety analysis. Of 757 participants vaccinated with ExPEC4V, 222 (29%) had a solicited local adverse event and 325 (43%) had any solicited systemic adverse event, compared with 11 (13%) and 30 (35%) of 86 participants in the control group. Symptoms were mild-to-moderate. The most frequently reported solicited local adverse event was pain or tenderness (205 [27·1%] of 757 in combined ExPEC4V groups) and the most frequently reported solicited systemic adverse event was fatigue (208 [27·6%] of 757). Only 13 (2%) of 843 had a grade 3 event. At day 15, 80% or more of all participants achieved a two times or greater increase in serotype-specific IgG antibodies (except O25B at the lowest dose, 103 [72%] of 144). At day 360, 66% (95% CI 56·47–74·33) of participants in group 2 and 71% (62·13–78·95) of participants in group 4 selected for long-term follow-up maintained a two times or greater increase in serotype-specific antibody compared with baseline.
Interpretation
EXPEC4V seemed well tolerated and elicited robust and functional antibody responses across all serotypes, doses, and age groups. For the two dosages evaluated (4:4:4:8 μg and 8:8:8:16 μg), the immune response persisted for 1 year.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Data describing the coagulopathy of Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever are scarce. We did rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and conventional coagulation testing in patients with Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever to increase our understanding of the coagulopathy of this infectious disease.
Methods
We did a prospective observational cohort study of adults aged 18 years and older and admitted to hospitals with PCR-confirmed Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever in Samsun and Tokat, Turkey. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected and blood samples for ROTEM analysis and coagulation testing were drawn at admission and during hospital admission and convalescence (up to 30 days after onset of illness). For the ROTEM analysis we recorded the following extrinsically activated ROTEM (EXTEM S) variables, with normal ranges indicated: clotting time (38–79 s), clot formation time (34–159 s), amplitude at 10 min after clotting time (43–65 mm), maximum clot firmness (50–72 mm), and maximum lysis (>15% at 1 h). The following fibrin-specific ROTEM (FIBTEM S) variables were also recorded: amplitude at 10 min after clotting time (normal range 7–23 mm) and maximum clot firmness (9–25 mm). Disease severity was assessed by Swanepoel criteria, severity grading score (SGS), and the severity scoring index (SSI), with mild disease defined as meeting no Swanepoel criteria, graded mild by SSI, and graded low risk by SGS.
Findings
Between May 27, 2015, and Aug 2, 2015, 65 patients with confirmed Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever were recruited and had blood taken at 110 time points. Most were male (40 [62%] of 65) with mild disease (49 [75%] of 65). Haemorrhage occurred in 13 (20%; 95% CI 11·1–31·8) of 65 patients and 23 (35%) of 65 received blood products (15 received fresh frozen plasma and eight received red blood cell concentrates), and 21 patients received platelet transfusions. At admission, the following EXTEM S variables differed significantly between mild cases and moderate to severe cases: median clotting time 56 s (range 42–81; IQR 48–64) versus 69 s (range 48–164; IQR 54–75; p=0·01); mean amplitude at 10 min after clotting time 45·1 mm (SD 7·0) versus 33·9 mm (SD 8·6; p<0·0001); median clot formation time 147 s (range 72–255; IQR 101–171) versus 197 s (range 98–418; IQR 156–296; p=0·006); and maximum clot firmness 54·4 mm (SD 7·2) versus 45·1 mm (SD 12·5; p=0·003). The EXTEM S variables were compared at different time points; maximum clot firmness (p=0·024) and amplitude at 10 min after clotting time (p=0·090) were lowest on days 4–6 of illness. We found no significant differences in FIBTEM variables between mild and moderate to severe cases (median amplitude at 10 min, 13 mm [range 8–20; IQR 11–15] vs 12 mm [range 6–25; IQR 10–15; p=0·68]; and median maximum clot firmness, 15 mm [range 9–60; IQR 13–21] vs 17 mm [range 7–39; IQR 13–23; p=0·21]); and no hyperfibrinolysis (maximum lysis >15%).
Interpretation
Coagulopathy of Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever is related to defects in clot development and stabilisation that are more marked in severe disease than in mild disease. The combination of normal and slightly deranged coagulation screens and FIBTEM results with the absence of hyperfibrinolysis suggests that the coagulopathy of Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever relates to platelet dysfunction.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Cervical cancer screening might contribute to the prevention of anal cancer in women. We aimed to investigate if routine cervical cancer screening results—namely high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cytohistopathology—predict anal HPV16 infection, anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and, hence, anal cancer.
Methods
We did a systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane library for studies of cervical determinants of anal HPV and HSIL published up to Aug 31, 2018. We centrally reanalysed individual-level data from 13 427 women with paired cervical and anal samples from 36 studies. We compared anal high-risk HPV prevalence by HIV status, cervical high-risk HPV, cervical cytohistopathology, age, and their combinations, using prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% CIs. Among 3255 women with anal cytohistopathology results, PRs were similarly calculated for all anal HSIL and HPV16-positive anal HSIL.
Findings
Cervical and anal HPV infections were highly correlated. In HIV-negative women, anal HPV16 prevalence was 41% (447/1097) in cervical HPV16-positive versus 2% (214/8663) in cervical HPV16-negative women (PR 16·5, 95% CI 14·2–19·2, p<0·0001); these values were 46% (125/273) versus 11% (272/2588) in HIV-positive women (4·4, 3·7–5·3, p<0·0001). Anal HPV16 was also associated with cervical cytohistopathology, with a prevalence of 44% [101/228] for cervical cancer in HIV-negative women (PR vs normal cytology 14·1, 11·1–17·9, p<0·0001). Anal HSIL was associated with cervical high-risk HPV, both in HIV-negative women (from 2% [11/527] in cervical high-risk HPV-negative women up to 24% [33/138] in cervical HPV16-positive women; PR 12·9, 95% CI 6·7–24·8, p<0·0001) and HIV-positive women (from 8% [84/1094] to 17% [31/186]; 2·3, 1·6–3·4, p<0·0001). Anal HSIL was also associated with cervical cytohistopathology, both in HIV-negative women (from 1% [5/498] in normal cytology up to 22% [59/273] in cervical HSIL; PR 23·1, 9·4–57·0, p<0·0001) and HIV-positive women (from 7% [105/1421] to 25% [25/101]; 3·6, 2·5–5·3, p<0·0001). Prevalence of HPV16-positive anal HSIL was 23–25% in cervical HPV16-positive women older than 45 years (5/20 in HIV-negative women, 12/52 in HIV-positive women).
Interpretation
HPV-based cervical cancer screening programmes might help to stratify anal cancer risk, irrespective of HIV status. For targeted secondary anal cancer prevention in high-risk groups, HIV-negative women with cervical HPV16, especially those older than 45 years, have a similar anal cancer risk profile to that of HIV-positive women.

Antimalarial drug resistance, in particular resistance to Plasmodium falciparum, challenges the treatment and control of malaria. In this Review, we summarise evolving patterns of antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. Resistance to aminoquinolines and antifolates is long-standing, yet with greatly decreased use of chloroquine to treat malaria, the prevalence of resistance to chloroquine has decreased. Resistance to antifolates, which are used to prevent malaria in some settings, remains widespread. Resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies, the standard treatments for malaria in Africa, has emerged in southeast Asia. At present, resistance to artemisinins or key partner drugs included in combination therapies does not appear to be a substantial problem in Africa. However, emergence of resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies in Africa would probably have devastating consequences, and continued surveillance for the emergence of resistance on this continent is a high priority."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The 2018 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Équateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, began on May 8, and was declared over on July 24; it resulted in 54 documented cases and 33 deaths. We did a retrospective genomic characterisation of the outbreak and assessed potential therapeutic agents and vaccine (medical countermeasures).
Methods
We used target-enrichment sequencing to produce Ebola virus genomes from samples obtained in the 2018 Équateur Province outbreak. Combining these genomes with genomes associated with known outbreaks from GenBank, we constructed a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree. In-silico analyses were used to assess potential mismatches between the outbreak strain and the probes and primers of diagnostic assays and the antigenic sites of the experimental rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine and therapeutics. An in-vitro flow cytometry assay was used to assess the binding capability of the individual components of the monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp.
Findings
A targeted sequencing approach produced 16 near-complete genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of these genomes and 1011 genomes from GenBank revealed a distinct cluster, confirming a new Ebola virus variant, for which we propose the name “Tumba”. This new variant appears to have evolved at a slower rate than other Ebola virus variants (0·69 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year with “Tumba” vs 1·06 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year without “Tumba”). We found few sequence mismatches in the assessed assay target regions and antigenic sites. We identified nine amino acid changes in the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein, of which one resulted in reduced binding of the 13C6 antibody within the ZMapp cocktail.
Interpretation
Retrospectively, we show the feasibility of using genomics to rapidly characterise a new Ebola virus variant within the timeframe of an outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis provides further indications that these variants are evolving at differing rates. Rapid in-silico analyses can direct in-vitro experiments to quickly assess medical countermeasures.

Background
The prevalence of Ebola virus infection among people who have been in contact with patients with Ebola virus disease remains unclear, but is essential to understand the dynamics of transmission. This study aimed to identify risk factors for seropositivity and to estimate the prevalence of Ebola virus infection in unvaccinated contact persons.
Methods
In this retrospective, cross-sectional observational study, we recruited individuals between May 12, 2016, and Sept 8, 2017, who had been in physical contact with a patient with Ebola virus disease, from four medical centres in Guinea (Conakry, Macenta, N'zérékoré, and Forécariah). Contact persons had to be 7 years or older and not diagnosed with Ebola virus disease. Participants were selected through the Postebogui survivors' cohort. We collected self-reported information on exposure and occurrence of symptoms after exposure using a questionnaire, and tested antibody response against glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, and 40-kDa viral protein of Zaire Ebola virus by taking a blood sample. The prevalence of Ebola virus infection was estimated with a latent class model.
Findings
1721 contact persons were interviewed and given blood tests, 331 of whom reported a history of vaccination so were excluded, resulting in a study population of 1390. Symptoms were reported by 216 (16%) contact persons. The median age of participants was 26 years (range 7–88) and 682 (49%) were male. Seropositivity was identified in 18 (8·33%, 95% CI 5·01–12·80) of 216 paucisymptomatic contact persons and 39 (3·32%, 5·01–12·80) of 1174 (2–4) asymptomatic individuals (p=0·0021). Seropositivity increased with participation in burial rituals (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2·30, 95% CI 1·21–4·17; p=0·0079) and exposure to blood or vomit (aOR 2·15, 1·23–3·91; p=0·0090). Frequency of Ebola virus infection varied from 3·06% (95% CI 1·84–5·05) in asymptomatic contact persons who did not participate in burial rituals to 5·98% (2·81–8·18) in those who did, and from 7·17% (3·94–9·09) in paucisymptomatic contact persons who did not participate in burial rituals to 17·16% (12·42–22·31) among those who did.
Interpretation
This study provides a new assessment of the prevalence of Ebola virus infection among contact persons according to exposure, provides evidence for the occurrence of paucisymptomatic cases, and reinforces the importance of closely monitoring at-risk contact persons.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Nepalese infants receive ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) with a 1 month interval between priming doses for programmatic reasons. We aimed to investigate whether immune responses to PCV10 serotypes were non-inferior if the second priming dose of PCV10 was delivered at a 1 month interval as opposed to a 2 month interval.
Methods
We did an open-label, randomised, parallel group trial in healthy Nepalese infants aged 40–60 days at Patan Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal. Children were eligible for inclusion if they were healthy, were born at more than or equal to 37 weeks' gestation, were residing in Kathmandu, and had not had any previous vaccinations other than BCG, and oral polio vaccine. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by means of a computer-generated list with randomly varying permuted block sizes accessed through a validated web-based interface, to receive PCV10 either at 6 weeks and 10 weeks of age (6 + 10 group) or at 6 weeks and 14 weeks of age (6 + 14 group), with both groups receiving a booster at 9 months of age. Laboratory staff, masked to study intervention, analysed serum samples for antibodies against PCV10 serotypes by ELISA. The primary outcome was to determine whether the 6 + 10 schedule was non-inferior to the 6 + 14 schedule at 9 months of age, on the basis of the proportion of infants with serotype-specific IgG greater than or equal to 0·35 μg/mL. Non-inferiority was established with a 10% margin, and the primary endpoint was measured in a modified intention-to-treat population, which included only participants who successfully had a blood sample collected. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02385513.
Findings
Between Aug 21, 2015, and April 4, 2016, 304 Nepalese children were randomly assigned to either the 6 + 10 group (n=152) or the 6 + 14 group (n=152). At 9 months of age, the 6 + 10 schedule was non-inferior for serotype 5 (79 [55·2%] of 143 vs 78 [53·4%] of 146, difference 1·82% [95% CI −9·6 to 13·25], p=0·021), serotype 9V (66 [46·1%] of 143 vs 55 [37·6%] of 146, difference 8·48% [−2·84 to 19·8], p=0·001), serotype 14 (110 [77·4%] of 142 vs 110 [74·8%] of 147, difference 2·63% [−7·27 to 12·54], p=0·006), and serotype 19F (135 [95%] of 142 vs 146 [100%] of 146, difference −4·92% [−9·86 to 0], p=0·022). At the same timepoint, non-inferiority was not shown for serotype 1 (36 [25·1%] of 143 vs 42 [28·5%] of 147, difference −3·39% [95% CI −13·56 to 6·77], p=0·102), serotype 4 (70 [48·9%] of 143 vs 87 [59·1%] of 147, difference −10·23% [−21·64 to 1·18], p=0·516), serotype 6B (96 [67·1%] of 143 vs 114 [77·5%] of 147, difference −10·41% [−20·65 to −0·18], p=0·532), serotype 7F (99 [69·2%] of 143 vs 109 [74·1%] of 147, difference −4·91% [−15·26 to 5·42], p=0·168), serotype 18C (89 [62·2%] of 143 vs 114 [77·5%] of 147, difference −15·31% [−25·78 to −4·83], p=0·840), and serotype 23F (37 [25·8%] of 143 vs 41 [27·8%] of 147, difference −2·01% [−12·19 to 8·16], p=0·062). After the booster dose, at 10 months of age, there were no significant differences in immunogenicity (proportion of children with antibody greater than or equal to 0.35 μg/mL) for any of the ten serotypes, when comparing the two schedules. Serious adverse events occurred in 32 participants, 11 (7%) of 152 in the 6 + 10 group and 21 (14%) of 152 in the 6  +  14 group.
Interpretation
The 6 week, 14 week, and 9 month schedule should be implemented where possible. However, post-booster responses, which are thought to drive herd immunity, were similar in the two schedules. Therefore, the 6 week, 10 week, and 9 month schedule is an alternative that can be used when logistically necessary, and is expected to provide herd protection.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The clinical utility of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) for diagnosis of active tuberculosis is unclear, although they are commonly used in countries with a low incidence of tuberculosis. We aimed to resolve this clinical uncertainty by determining the accuracy and utility of commercially available and second-generation IGRAs in the diagnostic assessment of suspected tuberculosis in a low-incidence setting.
Methods
We did a prospective cohort study of adults with suspected tuberculosis in routine secondary care in England. Patients were tested for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection at baseline with commercially available (T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube [QFT-GIT]) and second-generation (incorporating novel M tuberculosis antigens) IGRAs and followed up for 6–12 months to establish definitive diagnoses. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and predictive values of the tests were determined.
Findings
Of the 1060 adults enrolled in the study, 845 were included in the analyses and 363 were diagnosed with tuberculosis. Sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB for all tuberculosis diagnosis, including culture-confirmed and highly probable cases, was 81·4% (95% CI 76·6–85·3), which was higher than QFT-GIT (67·3% [62·0–72·1]). Second-generation IGRAs had a sensitivity of 94·0% (90·0–96·4) for culture-confirmed tuberculosis and 89·2% (85·2–92·2) when including highly probable tuberculosis, giving a negative likelihood ratio for all tuberculosis cases of 0·13 (95% CI 0·10–0·19). Specificity ranged from 86·2% (95% CI 82·3–89·4) for T-SPOT.TB to 80·0% (75·6–83·8) for second-generation IGRAs.
Interpretation
Commercially available IGRAs do not have sufficient accuracy for diagnostic evaluation of suspected tuberculosis. Second-generation tests, however, might have sufficiently high sensitivity, low negative likelihood ratio, and correspondingly high negative predictive value in low-incidence settings to facilitate prompt rule-out of tuberculosis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Doubts exist regarding optimal second-line treatment options for HIV-1-infected patients in resource-limited settings. We assessed safety and efficacy of dolutegravir compared with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in adults in whom previous first-line antiretroviral therapy with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus two NRTIs has failed.
Methods
DAWNING is a phase 3b, open-label, parallel-group, non-inferiority, active-controlled trial done at 58 sites in 13 countries. Eligible adults were aged at least 18 years and, during at least 6 months of treatment with a first-line treatment containing an NNRTI and two NRTIs, had virological failure (confirmed HIV-1 RNA ≥400 copies per mL). Participants were randomly assigned by a central randomisation system to receive oral dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (800 mg lopinavir plus 200 mg ritonavir once daily or 400 mg plus 100 mg twice daily), plus two investigator-selected NRTIs (at least one fully active based on resistance testing at screening). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants achieving viral suppression (defined as plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) at week 48 using the snapshot algorithm and a non-inferiority margin of −12%. The primary analysis was done in an intention-to-treat-exposed (ITT-E) population of participants who received at least one dose of study medication, according to original group assignment. Safety was analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug, according to which drug was received. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02227238, and viiv-studyregister.com, number 200304.
Findings
Between Dec 11, 2014, and June 27, 2016, 968 adults were screened and 627 were randomly assigned to the dolutegravir group (n=312) or the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group (n=315). Three patients in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group did not receive study medication and so 624 were included in the ITT-E population. At week 48, 261 (84%) of 312 participants in the dolutegravir group achieved viral suppression compared with 219 (70%) of 312 in the ritonavir-boosted lopinavir group (adjusted difference 13·8%; 95% CI 7·3–20·3). Non-inferiority was achieved on the basis of the 95% CI of the adjusted treatment difference having a lower bound greater than −12% (prespecified non-inferiority margin). Because the lower bound of the 95% CI is greater than zero (7·3%), superiority of dolutegravir was also concluded (p<0·0001). The safety profile for dolutegravir was favourable compared with that of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir. More grade 2–4 drug-related adverse events occurred with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir than dolutegravir (44 [14%] of 310 with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir vs 11 [4%] of 314 with dolutegravir), mainly driven by gastrointestinal disorders.
Interpretation
When administered with two NRTIs, dolutegravir was superior to ritonavir-boosted lopinavir at 48 weeks and can be considered a suitable option for second-line treatment.

Background
Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) rarely receive gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate a pay-it-forward strategy to increase uptake of gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing among MSM.
Methods
We performed a quasi-experimental pragmatic study to compare a pay-it-forward model with standard of care at two HIV testing sites for MSM in Guangzhou, China: an STD clinic for MSM and a local MSM community-based organisation. All men who arrived at the STD clinic or the community-based organisation were invited to participate. In the pay-it-forward programme, men were offered free gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing and given the option of donating money toward testing for future participants. In the standard-of-care group, men were offered gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing at the standard patient price of ¥150 (about US$21·50). The pay-it-forward programme was implemented for 3 months, after which both sites switched to standard of care offering dual testing for 3 months. The primary outcome for this study was uptake of dual gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing, which we compared using χ2 test and logistic regression, reported as crude odds ratios (cOR) and adjusted odds ratios (aOR), by adjusting for nationality, marital status, income, and site of testing.
Findings
The pay-it-forward programme took place from Dec 2, 2017, to Feb 3, 2018, and the standard-of-care control took place from March 11, 2018, to May 1, 2018. 408 men were included in this study. 203 men were offered pay-it-forward, and 205 were offered standard of care. Overall, 109 (54%) of 203 men in the pay-it-forward group and 12 (6%) of 205 men in the standard-of-care group received gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing (cOR 18·65, 9·78–35·54; p<0·0001; aOR 19·73, 95% CI 10·02–38·85; p<0·0001). Of all 121 men who tested, this was the first gonorrhoea test for 97 (80%) men and the first chlamydia test for 104 (86%) men. Five (4%) of these 121 men were diagnosed with gonorrhoea and 15 (12%) were diagnosed with chlamydia. 97 (89%) of 109 men who received testing in the pay-it-forward group donated some money toward testing for future participants.
Interpretation
Pay-it-forward might be a sustainable model for expanding integrated HIV testing services among MSM in China.

abstract = "Summary
Patients with haematological malignancies are at high risk of infection because of various mechanisms of humoral and cell-mediated immune deficiencies, which mainly depend on underlying disease and specific therapies. Some of these infections are vaccine preventable. However, these malignancies are different from each other, and the treatment approaches are diverse and rapidly evolving, so it is difficult to have a common programme for vaccination in a haematology ward. Additionally, because of insufficient training about the topic, vaccination is an area often neglected by haematologists, and influenced by cultural differences, even among health-care workers, in compliance to vaccines. Several issues are encountered when addressing vaccination in haematology: the small size of the cohorts that makes it difficult to show the clinical benefits of vaccination, the subsequent need to rely on biological parameters, their clinical pertinence not being established in immunocompromised patients, scarcity of clarity on the optimal timing of vaccination in complex treatment schedules, and the scarcity of data on long-term protection in patients receiving treatments. Moreover, the risk of vaccine-induced disease with live-attenuated vaccines strongly limits their use. Here we summarise guidelines for patients without transplantations, and address the issue by the haematological group—myeloid and lymphoid—of diseases, with a special consideration for children with acute leukaemia."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A 14-day course of primaquine is used for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale malaria only. We quantified the risk of P vivax parasitaemia after treatment of Plasmodium falciparum with commonly used antimalarial drugs to assess the potential benefits of radical cure for all patients with uncomplicated malaria in co-endemic regions.
Methods
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for prospective clinical studies in any language, published between Jan 1, 1960, and Jan 5, 2018, assessing drug efficacy in patients with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in countries co-endemic for P vivax. Studies were included if the presence or absence of P vivax parasitaemia was recorded after treatment. The primary outcome was the risk of P vivax parasitaemia between day 7 and day 42 after initiation of antimalarial treatment for P falciparum, with the pooled risk calculated by random-effects meta-analysis. We compared the risk of P vivax parasitaemia after treatment with different artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017064838.
Findings
153 of 891 screened studies were included in the analysis, including 31 262 patients from 323 site-specific treatment groups: 130 (85%) studies were from the Asia-Pacific region, 16 (10%) from the Americas, and seven (5%) from Africa. The risk of P vivax parasitaemia by day 42 was 5·6% (95% CI 4·0–7·4; I2=92·0%; 117 estimates). The risk of P vivax parasitaemia was 6·5% (95% CI 4·6–8·6) in regions of short relapse periodicity compared with 1·9% (0·4–4·0) in regions of long periodicity, and was greater after treatment with a more rapidly eliminated ACT: 15·3% (5·1–29·3) for artemether-lumefantrine compared with 4·5% (1·2–9·3) for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and 5·2% (2·9–7·9) for artesunate-mefloquine. Recurrent parasitaemia was delayed in patients treated with ACTs containing mefloquine or piperaquine compared with artemether-lumefantrine, but by day 63 the risk of vivax parasitaemia was more than 15% for all ACTs assessed.
Interpretation
Our findings show a high risk of vivax parasitaemia after treatment of falciparum malaria, particularly in areas with short relapse periodicity and after rapidly eliminated treatment. In co-endemic regions, universal radical cure for all patients with uncomplicated malaria has the potential to substantially reduce recurrent malaria.

Angiostrongylus cantonensis is the most common cause of eosinophilic meningitis worldwide. Infection typically occurs through ingestion of undercooked molluscs or vegetables contaminated by infective larvae. Endemic regions were previously limited to southeast Asia and the Pacific basin; however, this parasite is seeing an alarming increase in global distribution with reported cases in more than 30 countries, including several states in the USA. Although infection typically results in meningitis, a broad spectrum of CNS involvement and severity is emerging as diagnostic methods (such as real-time PCR) continue to improve diagnosis. In this Grand Round, we report a case of a 20-year-old active duty US marine serving in Okinawa, Japan, afflicted with severe CNS angiostrongyliasis marked by radiculomyelitis with quadriparesis, hyperaesthesia, and urinary retention. We present this case to highlight that no clear guidelines exist for the treatment of severe CNS angiostrongyliasis and provide our consensus recommendation that treatment algorithms include use of dual corticosteroids plus anthelmintics when radicular symptoms are present. In this Grand Round we review the clinical features, epidemiology, advances to diagnostic techniques, and available data on current treatment options for CNS angiostrongyliasis. This diagnosis should be highly considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with meningeal symptoms, paraesthesia or hyperaesthesia, and CSF eosinophilia so that treatment can be started early, which is particularly important in children, because of their increased risk of severe disease and mortality. We recommend combined therapy with albendazole and prednisolone, with consideration for increased steroid dosing in severe cases."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In 2007–08, a genotype J mumps outbreak occurred among Aboriginal people in northern Western Australia, despite high vaccine coverage. In March, 2015, a second protracted mumps outbreak occurred in northern Western Australia and spread widely across rural areas of the state. This time the outbreak was caused by a genotype G virus and again primarily affected Aboriginal people. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of this outbreak.
Methods
In this population-based surveillance study, we analysed statutory notifications and public health case follow-up data from the Western Australia Notifiable Infectious Diseases Database and vaccination information from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register. An outbreak case of mumps was notified if the affected person was living in or visiting a community in Western Australia where there was active mumps transmission, and if mumps infection was confirmed by laboratory diagnosis or by an epidemiological link. We analysed case demographics, vaccination status, and age-standardised attack rates in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people by region of notification. Laboratory diagnoses were made by real-time RT-PCR, serology, or both, and carried out by the sole public pathology provider in Western Australia.
Findings
Between March 1, 2015, and December 31, 2016, 893 outbreak cases were notified. 798 (89%) of 893 outbreak cases were reported in Aboriginal people. 40 (4%) of 893 people were admitted to hospital, and 33 (7%) of 462 men reported orchitis. Mumps attack rates increased sharply with age, peaking in the 15–19 age group. 371 (89%) of 419 people aged 1–19 years were fully vaccinated and 29 (7%) were partly vaccinated. Of the 240 people who tested positive by real-time RT-PCR and had also been tested for mumps-specific IgG and IgM, 165 (69%) were positive for IgG but negative for IgM, indicating the importance of RT-PCR testing for diagnosis in vaccinated populations. None of the cases from the 2007–08 genotype J outbreak were re-notified.
Interpretation
The number of mumps outbreaks reported in recent years among highly vaccinated populations, including Indigenous populations, has been growing. More widespread and pre-emptive use of the third dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine might be required to control and prevent future outbreaks in high-risk populations. Research should explore the benefit of increasing the intervals between vaccine doses to strengthen the durability of vaccine protection.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Group B streptococcus is a leading cause of serious infection in young infants in many countries worldwide. We aimed to define the burden and clinical features of invasive group B streptococcal disease in infants younger than 90 days in the UK and Ireland, together with the characteristics of disease-causing isolates.
Methods
Prospective, active national surveillance of invasive group B streptococcal disease in infants younger than 90 days was done from April 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015, through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit, microbiology reference laboratories, and national public health agencies in the UK and Ireland. Early onset was defined as disease in the first 6 days of life and late onset was defined as 7–89 days of life. Incidence was calculated using livebirths in 2014 (after adjustment for the 13-month surveillance period). Isolates were characterised by serotyping, multilocus sequence typing, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
Findings
856 cases of group B streptococcus were identified in 2014–15, an incidence of 0·94 per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 0·88–1·00). Incidence for early-onset disease (n=517) was 0·57 per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 0·52–0·62), and for late-onset disease (n=339) was 0·37 per 1000 livebirths (0·33–0·41). 53 infants died (case fatality rate 6·2%), of whom 27 had early-onset disease (case fatality rate 5·2%) and 26 had late-onset disease (case fatality rate 7·7%). The predominant serotypes were III (241 [60%] of 402 serotyped isolates) and Ia (69 [17%]); five serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, III, V) accounted for 377 (94%) of all serotyped isolates.
Interpretation
The incidence of invasive infant group B streptococcal disease in the UK and Ireland has increased since a comparable study done in 2000–01. The burden of early-onset disease has not declined despite the introduction of national prevention guidelines. New strategies for prevention are required.

abstract = "Summary
Infection is a main concern after haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and a major cause of transplant-related mortality. Some of these infections are preventable by vaccination. Most HSCT recipients lose their immunity to various pathogens as soon as the first months after transplant, irrespective of the pre-transplant donor or recipient vaccinations. Vaccination with inactivated vaccines is safe after transplantation and is an effective way to reinstate protection from various pathogens (eg, influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae), especially for pathogens whose risk of infection is increased by the transplant procedure. The response to vaccines in patients with transplants is usually lower than that in healthy individuals of the same age during the first months or years after transplant, but it improves over time to become close to normal 2–3 years after the procedure. However, because immunogenic vaccines have been found to induce a response in a substantial proportion of the patients as early as 3 months after transplant, we recommend to start crucial vaccinations with inactivated vaccines from 3 months after transplant, irrespectively of whether the patient has or has not developed graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or received immunosuppressants. Patients with GvHD have higher risk of infection and are likely to benefit from vaccination. Another challenge is to provide HSCT recipients the same level of vaccine protection as healthy individuals of the same age in a given country. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be limited to specific situations because of the risk of vaccine-induced disease."

The burden of influenza in Africa is substantial and underappreciated. Although surveillance has increased, the medical community's understanding of seasonal influenza vaccine performance remains limited. We did a systematic review, using PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42017058107), on the efficacy, effectiveness, and immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in populations within Africa with the aim of identifying key data gaps to help direct future research. We searched Embase, MEDLINE, Global Health database, and Web of Science for published studies from database inception to May 9, 2018. Unpublished studies were identified by searching ClinicalTrials.gov and the Pan-African Clinical Trial Registry, and by contacting experts within the field. Human studies that reported influenza vaccine immunogenicity, effectiveness, and efficacy were included. 1746 articles were assessed and 23 articles were included. Only three of the 23 studies were of high quality and many studies were underpowered. All 23 studies came from only six African countries (16 from South Africa), highlighting the need for data from a broader range of African populations. The majority of studies focused on effectiveness or efficacy against laboratory supported influenza with limited data for severe outcomes. Several factors known to interfere with influenza immunisation, such as malaria, HIV, and malnutrition were under-represented in this Review and require further study. Substantial gaps exist in our understanding of influenza vaccine performance across all WHO high-risk groups in Africa. Filling these knowledge gaps is vital to guide future influenza vaccine policies."

abstract = "Summary
Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of young infant mortality and morbidity globally, with vaccines being developed for over four decades but none licensed to date. A serocorrelate of protection against invasive disease in young infants is being considered to facilitate vaccine early licensure, followed by demonstration of efficacy assessed postlicensure. In this Review, we synthesise the available scientific evidence to define an immune correlate associated with GBS disease risk reduction on the basis of studies of natural infection. We summarise studies that have investigated GBS serum anticapsular or anti-protein antibodies, and studies measuring the association between antibody function and disease risk reduction. We highlight how knowledge on the development of correlates of protection from existing vaccines could be harnessed to facilitate GBS vaccine development. These lessons include aggregation of serocorrelates of protection for individual serotypes, understanding the relationship between immunity derived from natural exposure of adults and vaccine-induced immunity, or using extrapolation of protection from in-vitro immunoassay results. We also highlight key considerations for the assessment of the role of antibodies to derive a serocorrelate of risk reduction in future seroepidemiological studies of GBS disease."

abstract = "Summary
Background
During 2000–15, Arkansas Department of Health, Little Rock, AR, USA, investigated between one and six cases of mumps each year. From Aug 5, 2016, to Aug 5, 2017, the department received notification of more than 4000 suspected mumps cases in the second largest outbreak in the USA in the past 30 years.
Methods
Arkansas Department of Health investigated all reported cases of mumps to ascertain exposure, travel, and vaccination histories and identify close contacts. Cases were classified as confirmed if the patient had laboratory confirmation of mumps virus or probable if they had clinical symptoms and either a positive serological test or a known epidemiological link to a confirmed case.
Findings
2954 cases of mumps related to the outbreak were identified during the outbreak period: 1665 (56%) were laboratory confirmed, 1676 (57%) were in children aged 5–17 years, and 1692 (57%) were in Marshallese people. Among the 1676 school-aged cases, 1536 (92%) had previously received at least two doses of a vaccine containing the mumps virus. Although 19 cases of orchitis were reported, severe complications were not identified. Unusual occurrences, such as recurrent parotitis and prolonged viral shedding, were observed mostly in Marshallese individuals. Viral samples were characterised as genotype G.
Interpretation
This large-scale outbreak, primarily affecting a marginalised community with intense household crowding, highlights the need for coordinated, interdisciplinary, and non-traditional outbreak responses. This outbreak raises questions about mumps vaccine effectiveness and potential waning immunity.

abstract = "Summary
Research is an important component of an effective response to the increasing frequency of widespread infectious disease outbreaks. In turn, the ability to do such studies relies on willingness of partners in different regions to collaborate and the capacity to mount a rapid research response. The EU-funded ZIKAlliance Consortium has initiated a multicountry epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory research agenda to determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of Zika virus infection in pregnant women and their children. We reviewed the timeline of patient cohort initiation in relation to the Zika virus epidemic and mapped key events regarding funding, regulatory approvals, and site preparation during this timeline. We then assessed barriers and delays that the international research team experienced through a systematic telephone interview. We have identified three major bottlenecks in the implementation of a swift response: the absence of a timeline for the funding process, delays in regulatory and ethical approval, and the challenging logistics of laboratory support, including diagnostics. These bottlenecks illustrate the clear and urgent need for implementing a strong and permanent global emerging infectious diseases research capacity that has structured funding, enables long-term partnerships, and develops basic clinical and laboratorial research and a response infrastructure that is ready to deploy."

Background
Global genetic diversity of HIV-1 is a major challenge to the development of HIV vaccines. We aimed to estimate the regional and global distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants during 1990–2015.
Methods
We searched PubMed, EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (Ebscohost), and Global Health (Ovid) for HIV-1 subtyping studies published between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2015. We collected additional unpublished HIV-1 subtyping data through a global survey. We included prevalence studies with HIV-1 subtyping data collected during 1990–2015. We grouped countries into 14 regions and analysed data for four time periods (1990–99, 2000–04, 2005–09, and 2010–15). The distribution of HIV-1 subtypes, circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), and unique recombinant forms (URFs) in individual countries was weighted according to the UNAIDS estimates of the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in each country to generate regional and global estimates of HIV-1 diversity in each time period. The primary outcome was the number of samples designated as HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, CRFs, and URFs. The systematic review is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017067164.
Findings
This systematic review and global survey yielded 2203 datasets with 383 519 samples from 116 countries in 1990–2015. Globally, subtype C accounted for 46·6% (16 280 897/34 921 639 of PLHIV) of all HIV-1 infections in 2010–15. Subtype B was responsible for 12·1% (4 235 299/34 921 639) of infections, followed by subtype A (10·3%; 3 587 003/34 921 639), CRF02_AG (7·7%; 2 705 110/34 921 639), CRF01_AE (5·3%; 1 840 982/34 921 639), subtype G (4·6%; 1 591 276/34 921 639), and subtype D (2·7%; 926 255/34 921 639). Subtypes F, H, J, and K combined accounted for 0·9% (311 332/34 921 639) of infections. Other CRFs accounted for 3·7% (1 309 082/34 921 639), bringing the proportion of all CRFs to 16·7% (5 844 113/34 921 639). URFs constituted 6·1% (2 134 405/34 921 639), resulting in recombinants accounting for 22·8% (7 978 517/34 921 639) of all global HIV-1 infections. The distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants changed over time in countries, regions, and globally. At a global level during 2005–15, subtype B increased, subtypes A and D were stable, and subtypes C and G and CRF02_AG decreased. CRF01_AE, other CRFs, and URFs increased, leading to a consistent increase in the global proportion of recombinants over time.
Interpretation
Global and regional HIV diversity is complex and evolving, and is a major challenge to HIV vaccine development. Surveillance of the global molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 remains crucial for the design, testing, and implementation of HIV vaccines.

Global epidemics of infectious diseases are increasing in frequency and severity. Diagnostics are needed for rapid identification of the cause of the epidemic to facilitate effective control and prevention. Lessons learned from the recent Ebola virus and Zika virus epidemics are that delay in developing the right diagnostic for the right population at the right time has been a costly barrier to disease control and prevention. We believe that it is possible to accelerate and optimise diagnostic development through a five-pronged strategy: by doing a global landscape analysis of diagnostic availability worldwide; through strategic partnerships for accelerating test development, in particular with vaccine companies to identify novel diagnostic targets; by creating and sharing repositories of data, reagents, and well characterised specimens for advancing the development process; by involving key public and private stakeholders, including appropriate regulatory bodies and policy makers, to ensure rapid access for researchers to diagnostics; and last, by fostering an enabling environment for research and access to diagnostics in the countries that need them. The need is great, but not insurmountable and innovative and faster development pathways are urgently required to address current shortfalls."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Although the association between low socioeconomic status and non-communicable diseases is well established, the effect of socioeconomic factors on many infectious diseases is less clear, particularly in high-income countries. We examined the associations between socioeconomic characteristics and 29 infections in Sweden.
Methods
We did an individually matched case-control study in Sweden. We defined a case as a person aged 18–65 years who was notified with one of 29 infections between 2005 and 2014, in Sweden. Cases were individually matched with respect to sex, age, and county of residence with five randomly selected controls. We extracted the data on the 29 infectious diseases from the electronic national register of notified infections and infectious diseases (SmiNet). We extracted information on country of birth, educational and employment status, and income of cases and controls from Statistics Sweden's population registers. We calculated adjusted matched odds ratios (amOR) using conditional logistic regression to examine the association between infections or groups of infections and place of birth, education, employment, and income.
Findings
We included 173 729 cases notified between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2014 and 868 645 controls. Patients with invasive bacterial diseases, blood-borne infectious diseases, tuberculosis, and antibiotic-resistant infections were more likely to be unemployed (amOR 1·59, 95% CI 1·49–1·70; amOR 3·62, 3·48–3·76; amOR 1·88, 1·65–2·14; and amOR 1·73, 1·67–1·79, respectively), to have a lower educational attainment (amOR 1·24, 1·15–1·34; amOR 3·63, 3·45–3·81; amOR 2·14, 1·85–2·47; and amOR 1·07, 1·03–1·12, respectively), and to have a lowest income (amOR 1·52, 1·39–1·66; amOR 3·64, 3·41–3·89; amOR 3·17, 2·49–4·04; and amOR 1·2, 1·14–1·25, respectively). By contrast, patients with food-borne and water-borne infections were less likely than controls to be unemployed (amOR 0·74, 95% CI 0·72–0·76), to have lower education (amOR 0·75, 0·73–0·77), and lowest income (amOR 0·59, 0·58–0·61).
Interpretation
These findings indicate persistent socioeconomic inequalities in infectious diseases in an egalitarian high-income country with universal health care. We recommend using these findings to identify priority interventions and as a baseline to monitor programmes addressing socioeconomic inequalities in health.

abstract = "Summary
The emergence and expansion of the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis epidemic is a threat to the global control of tuberculosis. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is the result of the selection of resistance-conferring mutations during inadequate antituberculosis treatment. However, HIV has a profound effect on the natural history of tuberculosis, manifesting in an increased rate of disease progression, leading to increased transmission and amplification of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Interventions specific to HIV-endemic areas are urgently needed to block tuberculosis transmission. These interventions should include a combination of rapid molecular diagnostics and improved chemotherapy to shorten the duration of infectiousness, implementation of infection control measures, and active screening of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis contacts, with prophylactic regimens for individuals without evidence of disease. Development and improvement of the efficacy of interventions will require a greater understanding of the factors affecting the transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in HIV-endemic settings, including population-based molecular epidemiology studies. In this Series article, we review what we know about the transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in settings with high burdens of HIV and define the research priorities required to develop more effective interventions, to diminish ongoing transmission and the amplification of drug resistance."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Drug resistance is a challenge for the global control of tuberculosis. We examined mortality in patients with tuberculosis from high-burden countries, according to concordance or discordance of results from drug susceptibility testing done locally and in a reference laboratory.
Methods
This multicentre cohort study was done in Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Peru, and Thailand. We collected Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates and clinical data from adult patients aged 16 years or older. Patients were stratified by HIV status and tuberculosis drug resistance. Molecular or phenotypic drug susceptibility testing was done locally and at the Swiss National Center for Mycobacteria, Zurich, Switzerland. We examined mortality during treatment according to drug susceptibility test results and treatment adequacy in multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for sex, age, sputum microscopy, and HIV status.
Findings
We obtained M tuberculosis isolates from 871 patients diagnosed between 2013 and 2016. After exclusion of 237 patients, 634 patients with tuberculosis were included in this analysis; the median age was 33·2 years (IQR 26·9–42·5), 239 (38%) were women, 272 (43%) were HIV-positive, and 69 (11%) patients died. Based on the reference laboratory drug susceptibility test, 394 (62%) strains were pan-susceptible, 45 (7%) monoresistant, 163 (26%) multidrug-resistant (MDR), and 30 (5%) had pre-extensively or extensively drug resistant (pre-XDR or XDR) tuberculosis. Results of reference and local laboratories were concordant for 513 (81%) of 634 patients and discordant for 121 (19%) of 634. Overall, sensitivity to detect any resistance was 90·8% (95% CI 86·5–94·2) and specificity 84·3% (80·3–87·7). Mortality ranged from 6% (20 of 336) in patients with pan-susceptible tuberculosis treated according to WHO guidelines to 57% (eight of 14) in patients with resistant strains who were under-treated. In logistic regression models, compared with concordant drug susceptibility test results, the adjusted odds ratio of death was 7·33 (95% CI 2·70–19·95) for patients with discordant results potentially leading to under-treatment.
Interpretation
Inaccurate drug susceptibility testing by comparison with a reference standard leads to under-treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis and increased mortality. Rapid molecular drug susceptibility test of first-line and second-line drugs at diagnosis is required to improve outcomes in patients with MDR tuberculosis and pre-XDR or XDR tuberculosis.

abstract = "Summary
This analysis of the global clinical antibacterial pipeline was done in support of the Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance. The study analysed to what extent antibacterial and antimycobacterial drugs for systemic human use as well as oral non-systemic antibacterial drugs for Clostridium difficile infections were active against pathogens included in the WHO priority pathogen list and their innovativeness measured by their absence of cross-resistance (new class, target, mode of action). As of July 1, 2018, 30 new chemical entity (NCE) antibacterial drugs, ten biologics, ten NCEs against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and four NCEs against C difficile were identified. Of the 30 NCEs, 11 are expected to have some activity against at least one critical priority pathogen expressing carbapenem resistance. The clinical pipeline is dominated by derivatives of established classes and most development candidates display limited innovation. New antibacterial drugs without pre-existing cross-resistance are under-represented and are urgently needed, especially for geographical regions with high resistance rates among Gram-negative bacteria and M tuberculosis."

abstract = "Summary
Mass azithromycin distribution is a core component of trachoma control programmes and could reduce mortality in children younger than 5 years in some settings. In this systematic review we synthesise evidence on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance after mass azithromycin distribution. We searched electronic databases for publications up to June 14, 2018. We included studies of any type (excluding modelling studies, surveillance reports, and review articles) on community-wide distribution of oral azithromycin for the prevention and treatment of trachoma that assessed macrolide resistance, without restrictions to the type of organism. We extracted prevalence of resistance from published reports and requested unpublished data from authors of included studies. Of 213 identified studies, 19 met inclusion criteria (12 assessed Streptococcus pneumoniae) and were used for qualitative synthesis. Macrolide resistance after azithromycin distribution was reported in three of the five organisms studied. The lack of resistance in Chlamydia trachomatis suggests that azithromycin might remain effective for trachoma programmes, but evidence is scarce. As mass azithromycin distribution for trachoma continues and is considered for other indications, ongoing monitoring of antimicrobial resistance will be required."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A meningococcal group A conjugate vaccine, PsA-TT (also known as MenAfriVac), was developed with the support of the Meningitis Vaccine Project. Around 280 million individuals aged 1–29 years have been immunised across the African meningitis belt. We analysed the kinetics of vaccine-induced antibody response and assessed the possible implications for duration of protection.
Methods
We obtained data from two longitudinal studies done in The Gambia, Mali, and Senegal of antibody responses in 193 children aged 12–23 months and 604 participants aged 2–29 years following MenAfriVac vaccination. Antibodies were measured using two methods: group A serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) assay and group A-specific IgG ELISA. Data on antibody responses were analysed using a mixed-effects statistical model accounting for the mean response and variation in patterns of antibody kinetics. Determinants of antibody duration were investigated using regression analysis.
Findings
In children age 12–23 months, the reduction in MenAfriVac-induced antibody levels assessed by SBA titres had two phases: with 97·0% (95% credible interval [CrI] 95·1–98·3) of the response being short lived and decaying within the first 6 months and the remainder being long lived and decaying with a half-life of 2690 days (95% CrI 1016–15 078). Antibody levels assessed by SBA titres in participants aged 2–29 years were more persistent, with 95·0% (85·7–98·1) of the response being short lived, and the long lived phase decaying with a half-life of 6007 days (95% CrI 2826–14 279). Greater pre-vaccination antibody levels were associated with greater immunogenicity following vaccination, as well as greater antibody persistence. Despite rapid antibody declines in the first phase, antibodies in the second phase persisted at SBA titres greater than 128. Although there is no strong evidence base for a correlate of protection against infection with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A, we use an assumed SBA titre of 128 as a threshold of protection to predict that 20 years after vaccination with a single dose of MenAfriVac, vaccine efficacy will be 52% (29–73) in children vaccinated at age 12–23 months and 70% (60–79) in participants vaccinated at age 2–29 years.
Interpretation
Population-level immunity induced by routine vaccination with the Expanded Programme on Immunization is predicted to persist at levels sufficient to confer more than 50% protection over a 20-year time period. Further increases in population-level immunity could be obtained via mass campaigns or by delaying the age of vaccination through the Expanded Programme on Immunization. However, the benefits of such a strategy would need to be weighed against the risks of leaving young children unvaccinated for longer.

The resurgence and changing epidemiology of pertussis in high-income countries, the high infant mortality caused by pertussis in low-income countries, and the increasing morbidity in all age groups worldwide call for a concerted effort to both improve the current vaccines and develop new vaccines and vaccination strategies against pertussis. In this Personal View, we identify several key obstacles on the path to developing a durable solution for global control of pertussis. To systematically address these obstacles, the PERtussIS Correlates Of Protection Europe (PERISCOPE) Consortium was established in March, 2016. The objectives of this consortium are to increase scientific understanding of immunity to pertussis in humans induced by vaccines and infections, to identify biomarkers of protective immunity, and to generate technologies and infrastructure for the future development of improved pertussis vaccines. By working towards the accelerated licensure and implementation of novel, well tolerated, and effective pertussis vaccines, we hope to strengthen and stimulate further collaboration and transparency between the key stakeholders, including the public, the scientific community, public health institutes, regulatory authorities, and vaccine manufacturers."

Children represent both a clinically important population susceptible to tuberculosis and a key group in whom to study intrinsic and vaccine-induced mechanisms of protection. After exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, children aged under 5 years are at high risk of progressing first to tuberculosis infection, then to tuberculosis disease and possibly disseminated forms of tuberculosis, with accompanying high risks of morbidity and mortality. Children aged 5–10 years are somewhat protected, until risk increases again in adolescence. Furthermore, neonatal BCG programmes show the clearest proven benefit of vaccination against tuberculosis. Case-control comparisons from key cohorts, which recruited more than 15 000 children and adolescents in total, have identified that the ratio of monocytes to lymphocytes, activated CD4 T cell count, and a blood RNA signature could be correlates of risk for developing tuberculosis. Further studies of protected and susceptible populations are necessary to guide development of novel tuberculosis vaccines that could facilitate the achievement of WHO's goal to eliminate deaths from tuberculosis in childhood."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria are threatening modern health care. However, estimating their incidence, complications, and attributable mortality is challenging. We aimed to estimate the burden of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria of public health concern in countries of the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) in 2015, measured in number of cases, attributable deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
Methods
We estimated the incidence of infections with 16 antibiotic resistance–bacterium combinations from European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) 2015 data that was country-corrected for population coverage. We multiplied the number of bloodstream infections (BSIs) by a conversion factor derived from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control point prevalence survey of health-care-associated infections in European acute care hospitals in 2011–12 to estimate the number of non-BSIs. We developed disease outcome models for five types of infection on the basis of systematic reviews of the literature.
Findings
From EARS-Net data collected between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2015, we estimated 671 689 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 583 148–763 966) infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, of which 63·5% (426 277 of 671 689) were associated with health care. These infections accounted for an estimated 33 110 (28 480–38 430) attributable deaths and 874 541 (768 837–989 068) DALYs. The burden for the EU and EEA was highest in infants (aged <1 year) and people aged 65 years or older, had increased since 2007, and was highest in Italy and Greece.
Interpretation
Our results present the health burden of five types of infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria expressed, for the first time, in DALYs. The estimated burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA is substantial compared with that of other infectious diseases, and has increased since 2007. Our burden estimates provide useful information for public health decision-makers prioritising interventions for infectious diseases.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Tens of thousands of people die from dog-mediated rabies annually. Deaths can be prevented through post-exposure prophylaxis for people who have been bitten, and the disease eliminated through dog vaccination. Current post-exposure prophylaxis use saves many lives, but availability remains poor in many rabies-endemic countries due to high costs, poor access, and supply.
Methods
We developed epidemiological and economic models to investigate the effect of an investment in post-exposure prophylaxis by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. We modelled post-exposure prophylaxis use according to the status quo, with improved access using WHO-recommended intradermal vaccination, with and without rabies immunoglobulin, and with and without dog vaccination. We took the health provider perspective, including only direct costs.
Findings
We predict more than 1 million deaths will occur in the 67 rabies-endemic countries considered from 2020 to 2035, under the status quo. Current post-exposure prophylaxis use prevents approximately 56 000 deaths annually. Expanded access to, and free provision of, post-exposure prophylaxis would prevent an additional 489 000 deaths between 2020 and 2035. Under this switch to efficient intradermal post-exposure prophylaxis regimens, total projected vaccine needs remain similar (about 73 million vials) yet 17·4 million more people are vaccinated, making this an extremely cost-effective method, with costs of US$635 per death averted and $33 per disability-adjusted life-years averted. Scaling up dog vaccination programmes could eliminate dog-mediated rabies over this time period; improved post-exposure prophylaxis access remains cost-effective under this scenario, especially in combination with patient risk assessments to reduce unnecessary post-exposure prophylaxis use.
Interpretation
Investing in post-exposure vaccines would be an extremely cost-effective intervention that could substantially reduce disease burden and catalyse dog vaccination efforts to eliminate dog-mediated rabies.

As the leading infectious cause of death worldwide and the primary proximal cause of death in individuals living with HIV, tuberculosis remains a global concern. Existing tuberculosis control strategies that rely on passive case-finding appear insufficient to achieve targets for reductions in tuberculosis incidence and mortality. Active case-finding strategies aim to detect infectious individuals earlier in their infectious period to reduce onward transmission and improve treatment outcomes. Empirical studies of active case-finding have produced mixed results and determining how to direct active screening to those most at risk remains a topic of intense research. Our systematic review of literature evaluating the effects of geographically targeted tuberculosis screening interventions found three studies in low tuberculosis incidence settings, but none conducted in high tuberculosis incidence countries. We discuss open questions related to the use of spatially targeted approaches for active screening in countries where tuberculosis incidence is highest."

abstract = "Summary
Typhoid fever is an acute systemic infectious disease responsible for an estimated 12–20 million illnesses and over 150 000 deaths annually. In March, 2018, a new recommendation was issued by WHO for the programmatic use of typhoid conjugate vaccines in endemic countries. Health economic analyses of typhoid vaccines have informed funding decisions and national policies regarding vaccine rollout. However, by focusing only on averted typhoid cases and their associated costs, traditional cost-effectiveness analyses might underestimate crucial benefits of typhoid vaccination programmes, because the potential effect of typhoid vaccines on the treatment of patients with non-specific acute febrile illnesses is not considered. For every true case of typhoid fever, three to 25 patients without typhoid disease are treated with antimicrobials unnecessarily, conservatively amounting to more than 50 million prescriptions per year. Antimicrobials for suspected typhoid might therefore be an important selective pressure for the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance globally. We propose that large-scale, more aggressive typhoid vaccination programmes—including catch-up campaigns in children up to 15 years of age, and vaccination in lower incidence settings—have the potential to reduce the overuse of antimicrobials and thereby reduce antimicrobial resistance in many bacterial pathogens. Funding bodies and national governments must therefore consider the potential for broad reductions in antimicrobial use and resistance in decisions related to the rollout of typhoid conjugate vaccines."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Efforts to quantify the global burden of enteric fever are valuable for understanding the health lost and the large-scale spatial distribution of the disease. We present the estimates of typhoid and paratyphoid fever burden from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017, and the approach taken to produce them.
Methods
For this systematic analysis we broke down the relative contributions of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers by country, year, and age, and analysed trends in incidence and mortality. We modelled the combined incidence of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers and split these total cases proportionally between typhoid and paratyphoid fevers using aetiological proportion models. We estimated deaths using vital registration data for countries with sufficiently high data completeness and using a natural history approach for other locations. We also estimated disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for typhoid and paratyphoid fevers.
Findings
Globally, 14·3 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 12·5–16·3) cases of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers occurred in 2017, a 44·6% (42·2–47·0) decline from 25·9 million (22·0–29·9) in 1990. Age-standardised incidence rates declined by 54·9% (53·4–56·5), from 439·2 (376·7–507·7) per 100 000 person-years in 1990, to 197·8 (172·0–226·2) per 100 000 person-years in 2017. In 2017, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi caused 76·3% (71·8–80·5) of cases of enteric fever. We estimated a global case fatality of 0·95% (0·54–1·53) in 2017, with higher case fatality estimates among children and older adults, and among those living in lower-income countries. We therefore estimated 135·9 thousand (76·9–218·9) deaths from typhoid and paratyphoid fever globally in 2017, a 41·0% (33·6–48·3) decline from 230·5 thousand (131·2–372·6) in 1990. Overall, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers were responsible for 9·8 million (5·6–15·8) DALYs in 2017, down 43·0% (35·5–50·6) from 17·2 million (9·9–27·8) DALYs in 1990.
Interpretation
Despite notable progress, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers remain major causes of disability and death, with billions of people likely to be exposed to the pathogens. Although improvements in water and sanitation remain essential, increased vaccine use (including with typhoid conjugate vaccines that are effective in infants and young children and protective for longer periods) and improved data and surveillance to inform vaccine rollout are likely to drive the greatest improvements in the global burden of the disease.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The 2017 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children (EMLc) groups antibiotics as Access, Watch, or Reserve, based on recommendations of their use as first-choice and second-choice empirical treatment for the most common infections. This grouping provides an opportunity to review country-level antibiotic consumption and a potential for stewardship. Therefore, we aimed to review 2015 levels of oral antibiotic consumption by young children globally.
Methods
We analysed wholesale antibiotic sales in 70 middle-income and high-income countries in 2015. We identified oral antibiotic formulations appropriate for use in young children (defined as child-appropriate formulations [CAFs]) using wholesale data from the IQVIA-Multinational Integrated Data Analysis System database, and we estimated 2015 antibiotic consumption in reference to the 2017 WHO EMLc Access, Watch, Reserve (AWaRe) antibiotic groups. We used three metrics for assessment of intra-country patterns: access percentage, defined as the number of CAF standard units of Access antibiotics divided by the total number of CAF standard units; amoxicillin index, defined as the number of amoxicillin CAF standard units divided by the total number of CAF standard units; and access-to-watch index, defined as the ratio of Access-to-Watch CAF standard units.
Findings
The overall median volume of CAF antibiotic standard units sold in 2015 per country was 74·5 million (IQR 12·4–210·7 million). The median access percentage among the 70 countries was 76·3% (IQR 62·6–84·2). The amoxicillin index was low (median 30·7%, IQR 14·3–47·3). The median access-to-watch index was 6·0 (IQR 3·1–9·8). CAF antibiotic consumption patterns were highly variable between the 70 countries, without a clear difference between high-income and middle-income countries.
Interpretation
Antibiotics in the Access group have a key role in treating young children globally. A simple combination of metrics based on the AWaRe groups can be informative on individual countries' patterns of antibiotic consumption and stewardship opportunities. These metrics could support countries in the development of programmes to improve access to core Access antibiotics, particularly amoxicillin.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Wound infections are the main cause of sepsis in patients with burns and increase burn-related morbidity and mortality. Bacteriophages, natural bacterial viruses, are being considered as an alternative therapy to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. We aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a cocktail of lytic anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophages with standard of care for patients with burns.
Methods
In this randomised phase 1/2 trial, patients with a confirmed burn wound infection were recruited from nine burn centres in hospitals in France and Belgium. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older and had a burn wound clinically infected with P aeruginosa. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of an interactive web response system to a cocktail of 12 natural lytic anti-P aeruginosa bacteriophages (PP1131; 1 × 106 plaque-forming units [PFU] per mL) or standard of care (1% sulfadiazine silver emulsion cream), both given as a daily topical treatment for 7 days, with 14 days of follow-up. Masking of treatment from clinicians was not possible because of the appearance of the two treatments (standard of care a thick cream, PP1131 a clear liquid applied via a dressing), but assignments were masked from microbiologists who analysed the samples and patients (treatment applied while patients were under general anaesthetic). The primary endpoint was median time to sustained reduction in bacterial burden by at least two quadrants via a four-quadrant method, assessed by use of daily swabs in all participants with a microbiologically documented infection at day 0 who were given at least one sulfadiazine silver or phage dressing (modified intention-to-treat population). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dressing according to protocol. Ancillary studies were done in the per-protocol population (all PP1131 participants who completed 7 days of treatment) to assess the reasons for success or failure of phage therapy. This trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials database, number 2014-000714-65, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02116010, and is now closed.
Findings
Between July 22, 2015, and Jan 2, 2017, across two recruitment periods spanning 13 months, 27 patients were recruited and randomly assigned to receive phage therapy (n=13) or standard of care (n=14). One patient in the standard of care group was not exposed to treatment, giving a safety population of 26 patients (PP1131 n=13, standard of care n=13), and one patient in the PP1131 group did not have an infection at day 0, giving an efficacy population of 25 patients (PP1131 n=12, standard of care n=13). The trial was stopped on Jan 2, 2017, because of the insufficient efficacy of PP1131. The primary endpoint was reached in a median of 144 h (95% CI 48–not reached) in the PP1131 group versus a median of 47 h (23–122) in the standard of care group (hazard ratio 0·29, 95% CI 0·10–0·79; p=0·018). In the PP1131 group, six (50%) of 12 analysable participants had a maximal bacterial burden versus two (15%) of 13 in the standard of care group. PP1131 titre decreased after manufacturing and participants were given a lower concentration of phages than expected (1 × 102 PFU/mL per daily dose). In the PP1131 group, three (23%) of 13 analysable participants had adverse events versus seven (54%) of 13 in the standard of care group. One participant in each group died after follow-up and the deaths were determined to not be related to treatment. The ancillary study showed that the bacteria isolated from patients with failed PP1131 treatment were resistant to low phage doses.
Interpretation
At very low concentrations, PP1131 decreased bacterial burden in burn wounds at a slower pace than standard of care. Further studies using increased phage concentrations and phagograms in a larger sample of participants are warranted.

Human parechovirus infections are the second most common cause of viral meningitis in children. These infections are most frequently seen in infants younger than 90 days. Clinical manifestations include encephalitis, meningitis, myocarditis, and sepsis, which can lead to serious neurodevelopmental sequelae in young infants. Molecular techniques, including PCR assays, are the preferred diagnostic methods and have contributed to an increase in reported cases, along with an increasing awareness of the causal role of human parechovirus in infant diseases. However, focused clinical and diagnostic investigations of human parechovirus in infants and the use of their results in management is varied, partly because of the scarcity of robust incidence data and spectrum of clinical presentations of the infection. In this Review, we outline clinical cohort and epidemiological studies that can be used to inform the evidence-based management of young infants with human parechovirus disease and identify key research priorities. An improved understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of these infections is required to inform an evidence-based approach to diagnosis and treatment in the future."

abstract = "Summary
The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization advises WHO on global policies for vaccines. In April, 2016, SAGE issued recommendations on the use of the first licenced dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV. In November, 2017, a retrospective analysis of clinical trial data, stratifying participants according to their dengue serostatus before the first vaccine dose, showed that although in high seroprevalence settings the vaccine provides overall population benefit, there was an excess risk of severe dengue in seronegative vaccinees. SAGE's working group on dengue vaccines met to discuss the new data and mainly considered two vaccination strategies: vaccination of populations with dengue seroprevalence rates above 80% or screening of individuals before vaccination, and vaccinating only seropositive individuals. We report on the deliberations that informed the recommendation of the pre-vaccination screening strategy, in April, 2018. Important research and implementation questions remain for CYD-TDV, including the development of a highly sensitive and specific rapid diagnostic test to determine serostatus, simplified immunisation schedules, and assessment of the need for booster doses."

abstract = "Summary
Serotype replacement in invasive pneumococcal disease threatens to undermine the most costly vaccination programme currently undertaken. However, the effects of replacement on public health have varied geographically. Striking differences have emerged between the UK and USA, countries that otherwise often resemble each other epidemiologically. Similar to other European settings, the UK has had rising non-vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease, most notably in older adults, since introducing a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to the paediatric immunisation schedule. Such impacts of serotype replacement have not been reported in the USA, where incidence of non-vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease in young children and older people has been stable since the introduction of the same vaccine. Here, we explore factors that have been suggested to account for these differences, including surveillance practices, transmission dynamics, population risk factors, and pathogen evolution. We contend that none of these factors individually appears sufficient to account for the observed differences. Assessing the existing evidence, we define priorities for research and data collection to discern causes and inform future pneumococcal vaccine policy."

Tuberculosis claims more human lives than any other infectious disease. This alarming epidemic has fuelled the development of novel antimicrobials and diagnostics. However, public health interventions that interrupt transmission have been slow to emerge, particularly in HIV-endemic settings. Transmission of tuberculosis is complex, involving various environmental, bacteriological, and host factors, among which concomitant HIV infection is important. Preventing person-to-person spread is central to halting the epidemic and, consequently, tuberculosis transmission is now being studied with renewed interest. In this Series paper, we review recent advances in the understanding of tuberculosis transmission, from the view of source-case infectiousness, inherent susceptibility of exposed individuals, appending tools for predicting risk of disease progression, the biophysical nature of the contagion, and the environments in which transmission occurs and is sustained in populations. We focus specifically on how HIV infection affects these features with a view to describing novel transmission blocking strategies in HIV-endemic settings."

abstract = "Summary
In 2018, WHO issued guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of HIV-related cryptococcal disease. Two strategies are recommended to reduce the high mortality associated with HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs): optimised combination therapies for confirmed meningitis cases and cryptococcal antigen screening programmes for ambulatory people living with HIV who access care. WHO's preferred therapy for the treatment of HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis in LMICs is 1 week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine, and the alternative therapy is 2 weeks of fluconazole plus flucytosine. In the ACTA trial, 1-week (short course) amphotericin B plus flucytosine resulted in a 10-week mortality of 24% (95% CI −16 to 32) and 2 weeks of fluconazole and flucytosine resulted in a 10-week mortality of 35% (95% CI −29 to 41). However, with widely used fluconazole monotherapy, mortality because of HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis is approximately 70% in many African LMIC settings. Therefore, the potential to transform the management of HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings is substantial. Sustainable access to essential medicines, including flucytosine and amphotericin B, in LMICs is paramount and the focus of this Personal View."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hand-to-genital contact is hypothesised to be a transmission mode of human papillomavirus (HPV) of the Alphapapillomavirus genus. We compared the relative importance of hand-to-genital and genital-to-genital HPV transmission between sexual partners.
Methods
In this prospective cohort study, we recruited and followed up female university students aged 18–24 years and their male sexual partners in Montreal, QC, Canada (2005–11). Participants were eligible if they had initiated sexual activity within the past 6 months. Women were examined at clinic visits at baseline and every 4–6 months for up to 24 months. Men had a baseline visit and a single follow-up visit approximately 4 months later. Partners provided hand and genital swab samples, which we tested for DNA of 36 HPV types using PCR. We assessed predictors of incident type-specific HPV detections using Cox proportional hazards models.
Findings
Participants were recruited between June 5, 2006, and April 4, 2013. 264 women and 291 men had valid hand samples. The hazard ratio (HR) of incident detection of HPV in genital samples from women was 5·0 (95% CI 1·5–16·4) when her partner was positive for the same HPV type on his hand versus negative, but adjustment for his genital HPV status reduced the HR to 0·5 (0·1–1·8). Similarly, the HR of incident detection of HPV on men's genitals was 17·4 (95% CI 7·9–38·5) when his partner was positive for the same HPV type on her hand versus negative, but adjustment for her genital HPV status reduced the HR to 2·3 (0·9–6·2). Conversely, the HR of type-specific incident detection of HPV in genital samples associated with partner genital HPV positivity was 19·3 (95% CI 11·8–31·8) for women and 28·4 (15·4–52·1) for men after adjustment for their hand HPV status.
Interpretation
Clinicians can reassure their patients that HPV transmission is unlikely to occur through hand-to-genital contact. The majority of genital HPV infections are likely to be caused by genital-to-genital sexual transmission.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Cadazolid is a novel quinoxolidinone antibiotic developed for treating Clostridium difficile infection. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of cadazolid compared with vancomycin in patients with C difficile infection.
Methods
IMPACT 1 and IMPACT 2 were identically designed, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority, randomised phase 3 trials. IMPACT 1 was done in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Romania, Spain, and the USA, and IMPACT 2 was done in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Romania, Slovakia, South Korea, the UK, and the USA. Patients (aged 18 years or older) with mild-to-moderate or severe C difficile infection (diarrhoea with positive glutamate dehydrogenase and toxin A or B enzyme immunoassays) were randomly assigned (1:1) with a randomisation list stratified by centre and C difficile infection episode type (block size of four), and allocation was masked to investigators and participants. Patients received either oral cadazolid 250 mg twice daily with vancomycin-matching placebo capsule four times daily or oral vancomycin 125 mg four times a day with cadazolid-matching placebo suspension twice daily for 10 days, with 30 days of follow-up. The primary efficacy outcome was non-inferiority (margin −10%) of cadazolid versus vancomycin for clinical cure in the modified intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. Clinical cure was defined as resolution of diarrhoea with no additional treatment for C difficile infection. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01987895 (IMPACT 1) and NCT01983683 (IMPACT 2).
Findings
Between March 28, 2014, and March 24, 2017, for IMPACT 1, and Dec 13, 2013, and May 2, 2017, for IMPACT 2, 1263 participants were randomly assigned to receive cadazolid (306 in IMPACT 1 and 298 in IMPACT 2) or vancomycin (326 in IMPACT 1 and 311 in IMPACT 2). In the modified intention-to-treat population in IMPACT 1, 253 (84%) of 302 had clinical cure in the cadazolid group versus 271 (85%) of 318 in the vancomycin group. In IMPACT 2, 235 (81%) of 290 versus 258 (86%) of 301 had clinical cure. In the per-protocol population, 247 (88%) of 282 versus 264 (92%) of 288 had clinical cure in IMPACT 1 and 214 (87%) of 247 versus 237 (92%) of 259 in IMPACT 2. Non-inferiority for clinical cure to vancomycin was shown in IMPACT 1 but not in IMPACT 2 (IMPACT 1 treatment difference: −1·4 [95% CI −7·2 to 4·3] for modified intention to treat and −4·1 [–9·2 to 1·0] for per protocol; IMPACT 2: −4·7 [–10·7 to 1·3] for modified intention to treat and −4·9 [–10·4 to 0·6] for per protocol). The safety and tolerability profiles of the two antibiotics were similar.
Interpretation
Cadazolid was safe and well tolerated but did not achieve its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to vancomycin for clinical cure in one of two phase 3 C difficile infection trials. Therefore, further commercial development of cadazolid for C difficile infection is unlikely.

HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) infants are at an increased risk of many infectious diseases that can contribute to the high mortality seen among HEU children. Maternal immunisation could be a promising strategy to reduce infections in HEU infants. However, very little research has explored the effect of HIV on the immunogenicity and effectiveness of vaccines given during pregnancy. We review the available evidence on maternal immunisation among women living with HIV (WLWH) for all vaccines recommended, considered, or being investigated for routine or risk-based use during pregnancy. Of the 11 vaccines included, only three have been investigated in WLWH. Available evidence suggests that maternal HIV infection limits the immunogenicity of several vaccines, leaving HEU infants more susceptible to infection during their first few months of life. Whether maternal immunisation reduces the infectious morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases in HEU children remains unknown. We conclude the Review by identifying future research priorities."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Linezolid improves the treatment outcomes of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis substantially. We investigated whether use of linezolid instead of ethambutol increases the proportion of sputum culture conversion at 8 weeks of treatment in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.
Methods
We did a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, open-label trial for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis at the three affiliated hospitals to Seoul National University and National Medical Center (Seoul–Seongnam, South Korea). Patients, aged 20–80 years, with a positive sputum for pulmonary tuberculosis, but without resistance to rifampicin, and current treatment administered for 7 days or fewer, were randomly assigned at a 1:1:1 ratio into three groups. The control group received ethambutol (2 months) with isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide. The second group used linezolid (600 mg/day) for 2 weeks and the third group for 4 weeks instead of ethambutol for 2 months. We used a minimisation method to randomise, and stratified according to institution, cavitation on chest radiographs, and diabetes. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with negative culture conversion of sputum in liquid media after 8 weeks of treatment. The results of this trial were analysed primarily in the modified intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01994460.
Findings
Between Feb 19, 2014, and Jan 13, 2017, a total of 429 patients were enrolled and 428 were randomly assigned into either the control group (142 patients), the linezolid 2 weeks group (143 patients), or the linezolid 4 weeks group (143 patients). Among them, 401 were eligible for primary efficacy analyses. In the modified intention-to-treat analyses, negative cultures in liquid media at 8 weeks of treatment were observed in 103 (76·9%) of 134 control patients, 111 (82·2%) of 135 in the linezolid 2 weeks group, and 100 (75·8%) of 132 in the linezolid 4 weeks groups. The difference from the control group was 5.4% (95% CI −4·3 to 15·0, p=0·28) for the linezolid 2 weeks group and −1·1% (−11·3 to 9·1, p=0·83) for the linezolid 4 weeks group. Numbers of patients who experienced at least one adverse event were similar across the groups (86 [62·8%] of 137 in control, 79 [57·2%] of 138 in the linezolid 2 weeks group, and 75 [62·0%] of 121 in the linezolid 4 weeks group). Resistance to linezolid was not identified in any patient.
Interpretation
Higher rates of culture conversion at 8 weeks of treatment with short-term use of linezolid were not observed. However, safety analyses and the resistance profile suggested the potential role of linezolid in shortening of treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Oral vaccines underperform in low-income and middle-income countries compared with in high-income countries. Whether interventions can improve oral vaccine performance is uncertain.
Methods
We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions designed to increase oral vaccine efficacy or immunogenicity. We searched Ovid-MEDLINE and Embase for trials published until Oct 23, 2017. Inclusion criteria for meta-analysis were two or more studies per intervention category and available seroconversion data. We did random-effects meta-analyses to produce summary relative risk (RR) estimates. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017060608).
Findings
Of 2843 studies identified, 87 were eligible for qualitative synthesis and 66 for meta-analysis. 22 different interventions were assessed for oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), oral rotavirus vaccine (RVV), oral cholera vaccine (OCV), and oral typhoid vaccines. There was generally high heterogeneity. Seroconversion to RVV was significantly increased by delaying the first RVV dose by 4 weeks (RR 1·37, 95% CI 1·16–1·62) and OPV seroconversion was increased with monovalent or bivalent OPV compared with trivalent OPV (RR 1·51, 95% CI 1·20–1·91). There was some evidence that separating RVV and OPV increased RVV seroconversion (RR 1·21, 95% CI 1·00–1·47) and that higher vaccine inoculum improved OCV seroconversion (RR 1·12, 95% CI 1·00–1·26). There was no evidence of effect for anthelmintics, antibiotics, probiotics, zinc, vitamin A, withholding breastfeeding, extra doses, or vaccine buffering.
Interpretation
Most strategies did not improve oral vaccine performance. Delaying RVV and reducing OPV valence should be considered within immunisation programmes to reduce global enteric disease. New strategies to address the gap in oral vaccine efficacy are urgently required.

abstract = "Summary
Global terrorism is a rapidly growing threat to world security, and increases the risk of bioterrorism. In this Review, we discuss the potential threat of bioterrorism, agents that could be exploited, and recent developments in technologies and policy for detecting and controlling epidemics that have been initiated intentionally. The local and international response to infectious disease epidemics, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome and west African Ebola virus epidemic, revealed serious shortcomings which bioterrorists might exploit when intentionally initiating an epidemic. Development of new vaccines and antimicrobial therapies remains a priority, including the need to expedite clinical trials using new methodologies. Better means to protect health-care workers operating in dangerous environments are also needed, particularly in areas with poor infrastructure. New and improved approaches should be developed for surveillance, early detection, response, effective isolation of patients, control of the movement of potentially infected people, and risk communication. Access to dangerous pathogens should be appropriately regulated, without reducing progress in the development of countermeasures. We conclude that preparedness for intentional outbreaks has the important added value of strengthening preparedness for natural epidemics, and vice versa."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A cruise ship is a closed-off environment that simulates the basic functioning of a city in terms of living conditions and interpersonal interactions. Thus, the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined because of an onboard outbreak of COVID-19 in February, 2020, provides an opportunity to define the shedding pattern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and patient antibody responses before and after the onset of symptoms.
Methods
We recruited adult (≥18 years) passengers from Hong Kong who had been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan in February, 2020. All participants had been found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR 4 days before disembarking and were transferred to further quarantine in a public estate in Hong Kong, where they were recruited. Participants were prospectively screened by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs, and serum IgG and IgM against internal nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor-binding protein (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (upon entering quarantine) and on days 4, 8, and 12 of quarantine.
Findings
On Feb 22, 2020, 215 adults were recruited, of whom nine (4%; 95% CI 2–8) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR or serology and were hospitalised. Of these nine patients, nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR was positive in eight patients (89%; 57–99) at baseline. All nine patients were positive for anti-RBD IgG by day 8. Eight (89%; 57–99) were simultaneously positive for nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR and anti-RBD IgG. One patient who was positive for anti-RBD IgG and had a negative viral load had multifocal peripheral ground-glass changes on high-resolution CT that were typical of COVID-19. Five patients (56%; 27–81) with ground-glass changes on high-resolution CT were found to have higher anti-nucleoprotein-IgG OD values on day 8 and 12 and anti-RBD IgG OD value on day 12 than patients without ground-glass changes. Six (67%; 35–88) patients remained asymptomatic throughout the 14-day quarantine period.
Interpretation
Patients with COVID-19 can develop asymptomatic lung infection with viral shedding and those with evidence of pneumonia on imaging tend to have an increased antibody response. Positive IgG or IgM confirmed infection of COVID-19 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. A combination of RT-PCR and serology should be implemented for case finding and contact tracing to facilitate early diagnosis, prompt isolation, and treatment.

Background
In the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.
Methods
We collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.
Findings
Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged <60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ≥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.
Interpretation
These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019, 68 imported cases and 175 locally acquired infections have been reported in Singapore. We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful.
Methods
We adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R0] of 1·5, 2·0, or 2·5) and assuming 7·5% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R0 value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22·7%, 30·0%, 40·0%, and 50·0%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures.
Findings
For the baseline scenario, when R0 was 1·5, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279 000 (IQR 245 000–320 000), corresponding to 7·4% (IQR 6·5–8·5) of the resident population of Singapore. The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727 000 cases (670 000–776 000) when R0 was 2·0, corresponding to 19·3% (17·8–20·6) of the Singaporean population, and 1 207 000 cases (1 164 000–1 249 000) when R0 was 2·5, corresponding to 32% (30·9–33·1) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99·3% (IQR 92·6–99·9) when R0 was 1·5, by 93·0% (81·5–99·7) when R0 was 2·0, and by 78·2% (59·0 −94·4) when R0 was 2·5. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50·0%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R0 of 1·5.
Interpretation
Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In the first 2 years after a nationwide mass vaccination campaign of 1–29-year-olds with a meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine (MenAfriVac) in Burkina Faso, carriage and disease due to serogroup A Neisseria meningitidis were nearly eliminated. We aimed to assess the long-term effect of MenAfriVac vaccination on meningococcal carriage and herd immunity.
Methods
We did four cross-sectional studies of meningococcal carriage in people aged 9 months to 36 years in two districts of Burkina Faso between May 2, 2016, and Nov 6, 2017. Demographic information and oropharyngeal swabs were collected. Meningococcal isolates were characterised using whole-genome sequencing.
Findings
Of 14 295 eligible people, 13 758 consented and had specimens collected and laboratory results available, 1035 of whom were meningococcal carriers. Accounting for the complex survey design, prevalence of meningococcal carriage was 7·60% (95% CI 5·67–9·52), including 6·98% (4·86–9·11) non-groupable, 0·48% (0·01–0·95) serogroup W, 0·10% (0·01–0·18) serogroup C, 0·03% (0·00–0·80) serogroup E, and 0% serogroup A. Prevalence ranged from 5·44% (95% CI 4·18–6·69) to 9·14% (6·01–12·27) by district, from 4·67% (2·71–6·64) to 11·17% (6·75–15·59) by round, and from 3·39% (0·00–8·30) to 10·43% (8·08–12·79) by age group. By clonal complex, 822 (88%) of 934 non-groupable isolates were CC192, all 83 (100%) serogroup W isolates were CC11, and nine (69%) of 13 serogroup C isolates were CC10217.
Interpretation
Our results show the continued effect of MenAfriVac on serogroup A meningococcal carriage, for at least 7 years, among vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. Carriage prevalence of epidemic-prone serogroup C CC10217 and serogroup W CC11 was low. Continued monitoring of N meningitidis carriage will be crucial to further assess the effect of MenAfriVac and inform the vaccination strategy for future multivalent meningococcal vaccines.

abstract = "Summary
The existing vaccine paradigm assumes that vaccines only protect against the target infection, that effective vaccines reduce mortality corresponding to the target infection's share of total mortality, and that the effects of vaccines are similar for males and females. However, epidemiological vaccine research has generated observations that contradict these assumptions and suggest that vaccines have important non-specific effects on overall health in populations. These include the observations that several live vaccines reduce the incidence of all-cause mortality in vaccinated compared with unvaccinated populations far more than can be explained by protection against the target infections, and that several non-live vaccines are associated with increased all-cause mortality in females. In this Personal View we describe current observations and contradictions and define six emerging principles that might explain them. First, that live vaccines enhance resistance towards unrelated infections. Second, non-live vaccines enhance the susceptibility of girls to unrelated infections. Third, the most recently administered vaccination has the strongest non-specific effects. Fourth, combinations of live and non-live vaccines given together have variable non-specific health effects. Fifth, vaccinating children with live vaccines in the presence of maternal immunity enhances beneficial non-specific effects and reduces mortality. Finally, vaccines might interact with other co-administered health interventions, for example vitamin A supplementation. The potential implications for child health are substantial. For example, if BCG vaccination was given to children at birth, if higher measles vaccination coverage could be obtained, if diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis-containing vaccines were not given with or after measles vaccine, or if the BCG strain with the best non-specific effects could be used consistently, then child mortality could be considerably lower. Pursuing these emerging principles could improve our understanding and use of vaccines globally."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A monovalent, parenteral, subunit rotavirus vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic in adults in the USA and in toddlers and infants in South Africa, but elicited poor responses against heterotypic rotavirus strains. We aimed to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a trivalent vaccine formulation (P2-VP8-P[4],[6],[8]).
Methods
A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, phase 1/2 study was done at three South African research sites. Healthy adults (aged 18–45 years), toddlers (aged 2–3 years), and infants (aged 6–8 weeks, ≥37 weeks' gestation, and without previous receipt of rotavirus vaccination), all without HIV infection, were eligible for enrolment. In the dose-escalation phase, adults and toddlers were randomly assigned in blocks (block size of five) to receive 30 μg or 90 μg of vaccine, or placebo, and infants were randomly assigned in blocks (block size of four) to receive 15 μg, 30 μg, or 90 μg of vaccine, or placebo. In the expanded phase, infants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 15 μg, 30 μg, or 90 μg of vaccine, or placebo, in block sizes of four. Participants, parents of participants, and clinical, data, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment assignment. Adults received an intramuscular injection of vaccine or placebo in the deltoid muscle on the day of randomisation (day 0), day 28, and day 56; toddlers received a single injection of vaccine or placebo in the anterolateral thigh on day 0. Infants in both phases received an injection of vaccine or placebo in the anterolateral thigh on days 0, 28, and 56, at approximately 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Primary safety endpoints were local and systemic reactions (grade 2 or worse) within 7 days and adverse events and serious adverse events within 28 days after each injection in all participants who received at least one injection. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were analysed in infants in either phase who received all planned injections, had blood samples analysed at the relevant timepoints, and presented no major protocol violations considered to have an effect on the immunogenicity results of the study, and included serum anti-P2-VP8 IgA, IgG, and neutralising antibody geometric mean titres and responses measured 4 weeks after the final injection in vaccine compared with placebo groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02646891.
Findings
Between Feb 15, 2016, and Dec 22, 2017, 30 adults (12 each in the 30 μg and 90 μg groups and six in the placebo group), 30 toddlers (12 each in the 30 μg and 90 μg groups and six in the placebo group), and 557 infants (139 in the 15 μg group, 140 in the 30 μg group, 139 in the 90 μg group, and 139 in the placebo group) were randomly assigned, received at least one dose, and were assessed for safety. There were no significant differences in local or systemic adverse events, or unsolicited adverse events, between vaccine and placebo groups. There were no serious adverse events within 28 days of injection in adults, whereas one serious adverse event occurred in a toddler (febrile convulsion in the 30 μg group) and 23 serious adverse events (four in placebo, ten in 15 μg, four in 30 μg, and five in 90 μg groups) occurred among 20 infants, most commonly respiratory tract infections. One death occurred in an infant within 28 days of injection due to pneumococcal meningitis. In 528 infants (130 in placebo, 132 in 15 μg, 132 in 30 μg, and 134 in 90 μg groups), adjusted anti-P2-VP8 IgG seroresponses (≥4-fold increase from baseline) to P[4], P[6], and P[8] antigens were significantly higher in the 15 μg, 30 μg, and 90 μg groups (99–100%) than in the placebo group (10–29%; p<0·0001). Although significantly higher than in placebo recipients (9–10%), anti-P2-VP8 IgA seroresponses (≥4-fold increase from baseline) to each individual antigen were modest (20–34%) across the 15 μg, 30 μg, and 90 μg groups. Adjusted neutralising antibody seroresponses in infants (≥2·7-fold increase from baseline) to DS-1 (P[4]), 1076 (P[6]), and Wa (P[8]) were higher in vaccine recipients than in placebo recipients: p<0·0001 for all comparisons.
Interpretation
The trivalent P2-VP8 vaccine was well tolerated, with promising anti-P2-VP8 IgG and neutralising antibody responses across the three vaccine P types. Our findings support advancing the vaccine to efficacy testing.

Background
Since December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally. Little is known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19.
Methods
We retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0–16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China. We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features.
Findings
From Jan 17 to March 1, 2020, 36 children (mean age 8·3 [SD 3·5] years) were identified to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures. 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]). Common symptoms on admission were fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]). Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38·5°C or higher, and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37·5–38·5°C. Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]). Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB. All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir–ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation. Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days. By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured.
Interpretation
Although all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community-acquired infections.

Background
Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are a global threat. We aimed to describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-defined CRE in the USA.
Methods
CRACKLE-2 is a prospective, multicentre, cohort study. Patients hospitalised in 49 US hospitals, with clinical cultures positive for CDC-defined CRE between April 30, 2016, and Aug 31, 2017, were included. There was no age exclusion. The primary outcome was desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) at 30 days after index culture. Clinical data and bacteria were collected, and whole genome sequencing was done. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03646227.
Findings
1040 patients with unique isolates were included, 449 (43%) with infection and 591 (57%) with colonisation. The CDC-defined CRE admission rate was 57 per 100 000 admissions (95% CI 45–71). Three subsets of CDC-defined CRE were identified: carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (618 [59%] of 1040), non-carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (194 [19%]), and unconfirmed CRE (228 [22%]; initially reported as CRE, but susceptible to carbapenems in two central laboratories). Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing clonal group 258 K pneumoniae was the most common carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales. In 449 patients with CDC-defined CRE infections, DOOR outcomes were not significantly different in patients with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, non-carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, and unconfirmed CRE. At 30 days 107 (24%, 95% CI 20–28) of these patients had died.
Interpretation
Among patients with CDC-defined CRE, similar outcomes were observed among three subgroups, including the novel unconfirmed CRE group. CDC-defined CRE represent diverse bacteria, whose spread might not respond to interventions directed to carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In 1994, prevalence and incidence of epilepsy were high in the Itwara onchocerciasis focus (western Uganda), and cases of nodding and Nakalanga syndrome were documented. Onchocerciasis transmission was interrupted successfully in 2001. 17 years later, we re-investigated the epilepsy burden in this area.
Methods
From Dec 11 to Dec 15, 2018, a door-to-door survey was done in the three villages (Kabende Centre, Masongora South, and Rwesenene) with the highest epilepsy rates in 1994 to identify people with suspected epilepsy. Epilepsy diagnoses were confirmed by an interview and physical examination by a study clinician. The prevalence and incidence of epilepsy were measured using methods consistent with those used in 1994. Results from 2018 were compared with those from 1994.
Findings
The overall crude prevalence of epilepsy in the study villages decreased from 3·0% (35 of 1169) in 1994 to 1·2% (27 of 2325) in 2018 (p=0·0002), with a concomitant decrease in the proportion of people with epilepsy with unknown cause (p=0·037). Between 1994 and 2018, the overall incidence of epilepsy decreased from 418 cases per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 265–626) to 73 new cases per 100 000 person-years (32–114; p<0·0001); this reduction was more pronounced for cases having the first seizure between ages 3 years and 18 years (p<0·0001). No new case of nodding or Nakalanga syndromes had occurred since the interruption of onchocerciasis transmission.
Interpretation
Our findings support the existence of a negative association between onchocerciasis elimination and epilepsy burden in previously hyperendemic areas. Therefore, onchocerciasis elimination efforts should be intensified in endemic regions with a high prevalence of epilepsy, which might reduce the burden of epilepsy.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The isolation of symptomatic cases and tracing of contacts has been used as an early COVID-19 containment measure in many countries, with additional physical distancing measures also introduced as outbreaks have grown. To maintain control of infection while also reducing disruption to populations, there is a need to understand what combination of measures—including novel digital tracing approaches and less intensive physical distancing—might be required to reduce transmission. We aimed to estimate the reduction in transmission under different control measures across settings and how many contacts would be quarantined per day in different strategies for a given level of symptomatic case incidence.
Methods
For this mathematical modelling study, we used a model of individual-level transmission stratified by setting (household, work, school, or other) based on BBC Pandemic data from 40 162 UK participants. We simulated the effect of a range of different testing, isolation, tracing, and physical distancing scenarios. Under optimistic but plausible assumptions, we estimated reduction in the effective reproduction number and the number of contacts that would be newly quarantined each day under different strategies.
Results
We estimated that combined isolation and tracing strategies would reduce transmission more than mass testing or self-isolation alone: mean transmission reduction of 2% for mass random testing of 5% of the population each week, 29% for self-isolation alone of symptomatic cases within the household, 35% for self-isolation alone outside the household, 37% for self-isolation plus household quarantine, 64% for self-isolation and household quarantine with the addition of manual contact tracing of all contacts, 57% with the addition of manual tracing of acquaintances only, and 47% with the addition of app-based tracing only. If limits were placed on gatherings outside of home, school, or work, then manual contact tracing of acquaintances alone could have an effect on transmission reduction similar to that of detailed contact tracing. In a scenario where 1000 new symptomatic cases that met the definition to trigger contact tracing occurred per day, we estimated that, in most contact tracing strategies, 15 000–41 000 contacts would be newly quarantined each day.
Interpretation
Consistent with previous modelling studies and country-specific COVID-19 responses to date, our analysis estimated that a high proportion of cases would need to self-isolate and a high proportion of their contacts to be successfully traced to ensure an effective reproduction number lower than 1 in the absence of other measures. If combined with moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation and contact tracing would be more likely to achieve control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Characterising sexual networks with transmission of sexually transmitted infections might allow identification of individuals at increased risk of infection. We aimed to investigate sexual mixing in Neisseria gonorrhoeae transmission networks between women, heterosexual men, and men who report sex with men (MSM), and between people with and without HIV.
Methods
In this cross-sectional observational study, we whole-genome sequenced N gonorrhoeae isolates from the archive of the Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme (GRASP).w Isolates that varied by five single nucleotide polymorphisms or fewer were grouped into clusters that represented sexual networks with N gonorrhoeae transmission. Clusters were described by gender, sexual risk group, and HIV status.
Findings
We sequenced 1277 N gonorrhoeae isolates with linked clinical and sociodemographic data that were collected in five clinics in England during 2013–16 (July 1 to Sept 30 in 2013–15; July 1 to Sept 9 in 2016). The isolates grouped into 213 clusters. 30 (14%) clusters contained isolates from heterosexual men and MSM but no women and three (1%) clusters contained isolates from only women and MSM. 146 (69%) clusters comprised solely people with negative or unknown HIV status and seven (3%) comprised only HIV-positive people. 60 (28%) clusters comprised MSM with positive and negative or unknown HIV status.
Interpretation
N gonorrhoeae molecular data can provide information indicating risk of HIV or other sexually transmitted infections for some individuals for whom such risk might not be known from clinical history. These findings have implications for sexual health care, including offering testing, prevention advice, and preventive treatment, such as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis.

Background
The monoclonal antibody m102.4 is a potent, fully human antibody that neutralises Hendra and Nipah viruses in vitro and in vivo. We aimed to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of m102.4 in healthy adults.
Methods
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial of m102.4, we randomly assigned healthy adults aged 18–50 years with a body-mass index of 18·0–35·0 kg/m2 to one of five cohorts. A sentinel pair for each cohort was randomly assigned to either m102.4 or placebo. The remaining participants in each cohort were randomly assigned (5:1) to receive m102.4 or placebo. Cohorts 1–4 received a single intravenous infusion of m102.4 at doses of 1 mg/kg (cohort 1), 3 mg/kg (cohort 2), 10 mg/kg (cohort 3), and 20 mg/kg (cohort 4), and were monitored for 113 days. Cohort 5 received two infusions of 20 mg/kg 72 h apart and were monitored for 123 days. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability. Secondary outcomes were pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. Analyses were completed according to protocol. The study was registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12615000395538.
Findings
Between March 27, 2015, and June 16, 2016, 40 (52%) of 77 healthy screened adults were enrolled in the study. Eight participants were assigned to each cohort (six received m102.4 and two received placebo). 86 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported, with similar rates between placebo and treatment groups. The most common treatment-related event was headache (12 [40%] of 30 participants in the combined m102.4 group, and three [30%] of ten participants in the pooled placebo group). No deaths or severe adverse events leading to study discontinuation occurred. Pharmacokinetics based on those receiving m102.4 (n=30) were linear, with a median half-life of 663·3 h (range 474·3–735·1) for cohort 1, 466·3 h (382·8–522·3) for cohort 2, 397·0 h (333·9–491·8) for cohort 3, and 466·7 h (351·0–889·6) for cohort 4. The elimination kinetics of those receiving repeated dosing (cohort 5) were similar to those of single-dose recipients (median elimination half-time 472·0 [385·6–592·0]). Anti-m102.4 antibodies were not detected at any time-point during the study.
Interpretation
Single and repeated dosing of m102.4 were well tolerated and safe, displayed linear pharmacokinetics, and showed no evidence of an immunogenic response. This study will inform future dosing regimens for m102.4 to achieve prolonged exposure for systemic efficacy to prevent and treat henipavirus infections.

abstract = "Summary
Background
PRIMVAC is a VAR2CSA-derived placental malaria vaccine candidate aiming to prevent serious clinical outcomes of Plasmodium falciparum infection during pregnancy. We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of PRIMVAC adjuvanted with Alhydrogel or glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant in stable emulsion (GLA-SE) in French and Burkinabe women who were not pregnant.
Methods
This first-in-human, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial was done in two staggered phases, a phase 1A trial in 18–35-year-old women who were malaria naive in a hospital in France and a subsequent phase 1B trial in women who were naturally exposed to P falciparum and nulligravid in the clinical site of a research centre in Burkina Faso. Volunteers were recruited into four sequential cohorts receiving PRIMVAC intramuscularly at day 0, 28, and 56: two cohorts in France receiving 20 μg or 50 μg of PRIMVAC and then two in Burkina Faso receiving 50 μg or 100 μg of PRIMVAC. Volunteers were randomly assigned (1:1) to two groups (PRIMVAC adjuvanted with either Alhydrogel or GLA-SE) in France and randomly assigned (2:2:1) to three groups (PRIMVAC adjuvanted with either Alhydrogel, GLA-SE, or placebo) in Burkina Faso. Randomisation was centralised, using stratification by cohort and blocks of variable size, and syringes were masked by opaque labels. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with any grade 3 or higher adverse reaction to vaccination up until day 35. Safety at later time points as well as humoral and cellular immunogenicity were assessed in secondary endpoints. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02658253.
Findings
Between April 19, 2016, and July 13, 2017, 68 women (18 in France, 50 in Burkina Faso) of 101 assessed for eligibility were included. No serious adverse event related to the vaccine occurred. PRIMVAC antibody titres increased with each dose and seroconversion was observed in all women vaccinated with PRIMVAC (n=57). PRIMVAC antibody titres reached a peak (geometric mean 11 843·0, optical density [OD] 1·0, 95% CI 7559·8–18 552·9 with 100 μg dose and GLA-SE) 1 week after the third vaccination (day 63). Compared with Alhydrogel, GLA-SE tended to improve the PRIMVAC antibody response (geometric mean 2163·5, OD 1·0, 95% CI 1315·7–3557·7 with 100 μg dose and Alhydrogel at day 63). 1 year after the last vaccination, 20 (71%) of 28 women who were vaccinated with PRIMVAC/Alhydrogel and 26 (93%) of 28 women who were vaccinated with PRIMVAC/GLA-SE still had anti-PRIMVAC antibodies, although antibody magnitude was markedly lower (452·4, OD 1·0, 95% CI 321·8–636·1 with 100 μg dose and GLA-SE). These antibodies reacted with native homologous VAR2CSA expressed by NF54-CSA infected erythrocytes (fold change from baseline at day 63 with 100 μg dose and GLA-SE: 10·74, 95% CI 8·36–13·79). Limited cross-recognition, restricted to sera collected from women that received the 100 μg PRIMVAC dose, was observed against heterologous VAR2CSA variants expressed by FCR3-CSA (fold change from baseline at day 63: 1·49, 95% CI 1·19–1·88) and 7G8-CSA infected erythrocytes (1·2, 1·08–1·34).
Interpretation
PRIMVAC adjuvanted with Alhydrogel or GLA-SE had an acceptable safety profile, was immunogenic, and induced functional antibodies reacting with the homologous VAR2CSA variant expressed by NF54-CSA infected erythrocytes. Cross-reactivity against heterologous VAR2CSA variants was limited and only observed in the higher dose group. An alternate schedule of immunisation, antigen dose, and combinations with other VAR2CSA-based vaccines are envisaged to improve the cross-reactivity against heterologous VAR2CSA variants.

Syphilis is caused by a spirochaete bacterium called Treponema pallidum. Vertical transmission of spirochaetes can lead to congenital infection of the fetus in pregnant women who are inadequately treated or not treated at all, causing various clinical manifestations including stillbirth and neonatal death, cutaneous and visceral manifestations, or asymptomatic infection. We present a severe case of syphilis in a 3-month-old boy with skin lesions, portal hypertension, and anaemia. Because the mother was tested negative for syphilis antibodies at 16 weeks of gestation, a diagnosis of congenital syphilis was initially not considered. This case shows that transmission of T pallidum can still occur in high-income countries with a high rate of antenatal screening. Early recognition might be hampered if physicians do not consider congenital syphilis as a possible diagnosis. Congenital syphilis should be considered in any severe and diagnostically challenging infectious disease case, even in the context of negative antenatal screening."

abstract = "Summary
Background
10 days after the first reported case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the Netherlands (on Feb 27, 2020), 55 (4%) of 1497 health-care workers in nine hospitals located in the south of the Netherlands had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We aimed to gain insight in possible sources of infection in health-care workers.
Methods
We did a cross-sectional study at three of the nine hospitals located in the south of the Netherlands. We screened health-care workers at the participating hospitals for SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on clinical symptoms (fever or mild respiratory symptoms) in the 10 days before screening. We obtained epidemiological data through structured interviews with health-care workers and combined this information with data from whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples taken from health-care workers and patients. We did an in-depth analysis of sources and modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in health-care workers and patients.
Findings
Between March 2 and March 12, 2020, 1796 (15%) of 12 022 health-care workers were screened, of whom 96 (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We obtained complete and near-complete genome sequences from 50 health-care workers and ten patients. Most sequences were grouped in three clusters, with two clusters showing local circulation within the region. The noted patterns were consistent with multiple introductions into the hospitals through community-acquired infections and local amplification in the community.
Interpretation
Although direct transmission in the hospitals cannot be ruled out, our data do not support widespread nosocomial transmission as the source of infection in patients or health-care workers.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The Greater Mekong subregion is a recurrent source of antimalarial drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This study aimed to characterise the extent and spread of resistance across this entire region between 2007 and 2018.
Methods
P falciparum isolates from Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia were obtained from clinical trials and epidemiological studies done between Jan 1, 2007, and Dec 31, 2018, and were genotyped for molecular markers (pfkelch, pfcrt, pfplasmepsin2, and pfmdr1) of antimalarial drug resistance. Genetic relatedness was assessed using microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism typing of flanking sequences around target genes.
Findings
10 632 isolates were genotyped. A single long pfkelch Cys580Tyr haplotype (from −50 kb to +31·5 kb) conferring artemisinin resistance (PfPailin) now dominates across the eastern Greater Mekong subregion. Piperaquine resistance associated with pfplasmepsin2 gene amplification and mutations in pfcrt downstream of the Lys76Thr chloroquine resistance locus has also developed. On the Thailand–Myanmar border a different pfkelch Cys580Tyr lineage rose to high frequencies before it was eliminated. Elsewhere in Myanmar the Cys580Tyr allele remains widespread at low allele frequencies. Meanwhile a single artemisinin-resistant pfkelch Phe446Ile haplotype has spread across Myanmar. Despite intense use of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine in Kayin state, eastern Myanmar, both in treatment and mass drug administrations, no selection of piperaquine resistance markers was observed. pfmdr1 amplification, a marker of resistance to mefloquine, remains at low prevalence across the entire region.
Interpretation
Artemisinin resistance in P falciparum is now prevalent across the Greater Mekong subregion. In the eastern Greater Mekong subregion a multidrug resistant P falciparum lineage (PfPailin) dominates. In Myanmar a long pfkelch Phe446Ile haplotype has spread widely but, by contrast with the eastern Greater Mekong subregion, there is no indication of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) partner drug resistance from genotyping known markers, and no evidence of spread of ACT resistant P falciparum from the east to the west. There is still a window of opportunity to prevent global spread of ACT resistance.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Loiasis is a highly prevalent helminth infection found in distinct regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The disease has been considered to be of minor clinical significance, but this belief is being increasingly challenged by recent evidence. We aimed to prospectively quantify the overall burden of disease caused by loiasis in an endemic region of Gabon, using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
Methods
We did a cross-sectional survey during 2017 and 2018 in rural Gabon. Volunteers underwent diagnostic tests for loiasis and were given a standardised questionnaire on symptoms. Participants reporting eye worm migration or harbouring Loa loa microfilariae were defined as loiasis positive. Morbidity-based DALYs associated with loiasis were estimated for the rural population of Gabon.
Findings
Between Sept 1, 2017 and May 31, 2018, 1235 participants residing in 38 villages in the Gabonese departments of Tsamba-Magotsi and Ogooué et des Lacs were screened. 626 (50·8%) of 1232 eligible participants had loiasis. 520 (42·2%) of 1232 participants reported eye worm migration. 478 (93·9%) of 509 individuals with eye worm migration also reported associated pain, and 397 (78·6%) of 505 reported vision disturbances. After correcting for age and sex, loiasis was significantly associated with a variety of symptoms, including transient painful oedema (adjusted odds ratio 1·76 [95% CI 1·37–2·26]) and arthralgia (1·30 [1·01–1·69]). Application of attributable fractions of correlating symptoms resulted in 412·9 (95% CI 273·9–567·7) morbidity-based DALYs per 100 000 people in rural Gabon.
Interpretation
Loiasis, with the pathognomonic sign of eye worm migration, appears to not be benign, but severely impeding to affected individuals. Furthermore, loiasis is associated with substantial morbidity, comparable to that of other neglected tropical parasitic diseases. These findings call for reconsideration of L loa as a relevant pathogen in affected populations, with a need for more concerted research and control of these infections.

WHO has listed several priority diseases with epidemic potential for which there are no, or insufficient, medical countermeasures. In response, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (with support from PricewaterhouseCoopers) coordinated subject matter experts to create a preparedness plan for Disease X. Disease X is caused by Pathogen X, an infectious agent that is not currently known to cause human disease, but an aetiologic agent of a future outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential. We have identified crucial areas for acceleration in medical countermeasure product development and international coordination. We have also reviewed novel platforms and process improvements related to manufacturing, which could revolutionise the response to the next pandemic. Finally, we created several coordination and engagement guides. These guides range from the rational design of an intervention target product profile, to the key facets of vaccine and therapeutic development, to accelerated manufacturing and regulatory mechanisms. In this Personal View, we provide a high-level summary of the outcomes of the medical countermeasure development workstream, intended for a broad audience including academia, medical countermeasure developers, and multilateral coordinating bodies. We hope that they might find this piece useful in prioritising strategic investments and efforts to accelerate medical countermeasure development. We observed that in-depth analyses of clinical trial design, chemistry, manufacturing and control activities, and accelerated regulatory pathways are necessary for shortening the timelines for the product development of medical countermeasures.

abstract = "Summary
Background
COVID-19 is characterised by respiratory symptoms, which deteriorate into respiratory failure in a substantial proportion of cases, requiring intensive care in up to a third of patients admitted to hospital. Analysis of the pathological features in the lung tissues of patients who have died with COVID-19 could help us to understand the disease pathogenesis and clinical outcomes.
Methods
We systematically analysed lung tissue samples from 38 patients who died from COVID-19 in two hospitals in northern Italy between Feb 29 and March 24, 2020. The most representative areas identified at macroscopic examination were selected, and tissue blocks (median seven, range five to nine) were taken from each lung and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for at least 48 h. Tissues were assessed with use of haematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining for inflammatory infiltrate and cellular components (including staining with antibodies against CD68, CD3, CD45, CD61, TTF1, p40, and Ki-67), and electron microscopy to identify virion localisation.
Findings
All cases showed features of the exudative and proliferative phases of diffuse alveolar damage, which included capillary congestion (in all cases), necrosis of pneumocytes (in all cases), hyaline membranes (in 33 cases), interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema (in 37 cases), type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia (in all cases), squamous metaplasia with atypia (in 21 cases), and platelet–fibrin thrombi (in 33 cases). The inflammatory infiltrate, observed in all cases, was largely composed of macrophages in the alveolar lumina (in 24 cases) and lymphocytes in the interstitium (in 31 cases). Electron microscopy revealed that viral particles were predominantly located in the pneumocytes.
Interpretation
The predominant pattern of lung lesions in patients with COVID-19 patients is diffuse alveolar damage, as described in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses. Hyaline membrane formation and pneumocyte atypical hyperplasia are frequent. Importantly, the presence of platelet–fibrin thrombi in small arterial vessels is consistent with coagulopathy, which appears to be common in patients with COVID-19 and should be one of the main targets of therapy.

abstract = "Summary
Health-care workers are crucial to any health-care system. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, health-care workers are at a substantially increased risk of becoming infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and could come to considerable harm as a result. Depending on the phase of the pandemic, patients with COVID-19 might not be the main source of SARS-CoV-2 infection and health-care workers could be exposed to atypical patients, infected family members, contacts, and colleagues, or live in communities of active transmission. Clear strategies to support and appropriately manage exposed and infected health-care workers are essential to ensure effective staff management and to engender trust in the workplace. These management strategies should focus on risk stratification, suitable clinical monitoring, low-threshold access to diagnostics, and decision making about removal from and return to work. Policy makers need to support health-care facilities in interpreting guidance during a pandemic that will probably be characterised by fluctuating local incidence of SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the impact of this pandemic on their workforce."

abstract = "Summary
Background
(+)-SJ000557733 (SJ733) is a novel, orally bioavailable inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum ATP4. In this first-in-human and induced blood-stage malaria phase 1a/b trial, we investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antimalarial activity of SJ733 in humans.
Methods
The phase 1a was a single-centre, dose-escalation, first-in-human study of SJ733 allowing modifications to dose increments and dose-cohort size on the basis of safety and pharmacokinetic results. The phase 1a took place at St Jude Children's Research Hospital and at the University of Tennessee Clinical Research Center (Memphis, TN, USA). Enrolment in more than one non-consecutive dose cohort was allowed with at least 14 days required between doses. Participants were fasted in seven dose cohorts and fed in one 600 mg dose cohort. Single ascending doses of SJ733 (75, 150, 300, 600, 900, or 1200 mg) were administered to participants, who were followed up for 14 days after SJ733 dosing. Phase 1a primary endpoints were safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of SJ733, and identification of an SJ733 dose to test in the induced blood-stage malaria model. The phase 1b was a single-centre, open-label, volunteer infection study using the induced blood-stage malaria model in which fasted participants were intravenously infected with blood-stage P falciparum and subsequently treated with a single dose of SJ733. Phase 1b took place at Q-Pharm (Herston, QLD, Australia) and was initiated only after phase 1a showed that exposure exceeding the threshold minimum exposure could be safely achieved in humans. Participants were inoculated on day 0 with P falciparum-infected human erythrocytes (around 2800 parasites in the 150 mg dose cohort and around 2300 parasites in the 600 mg dose cohort), and parasitaemia was monitored before malaria inoculation, after inoculation, immediately before SJ733 dosing, and then post-dose. Participants were treated with SJ733 within 24 h of reaching 5000 parasites per mL or at a clinical score higher than 6. Phase 1b primary endpoints were calculation of a parasite reduction ratio (PRR48) and parasite clearance half-life, and safety and tolerability of SJ733 (incidence, severity, and drug-relatedness of adverse events). In both phases of the trial, SJ733 hydrochloride salt was formulated as a powder blend in capsules containing 75 mg or 300 mg for oral administration. Healthy men and women (of non-childbearing potential) aged 18–55 years were eligible for both studies. Both studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02661373 for the phase 1a and NCT02867059 for the phase 1b).
Findings
In the phase 1a, 23 healthy participants were enrolled and received one to three non-consecutive doses of SJ733 between March 14 and Dec 7, 2016. SJ733 was safe and well tolerated at all doses and in fasted and fed conditions. 119 adverse events were recorded: 54 (45%) were unrelated, 63 (53%) unlikely to be related, and two (2%) possibly related to SJ733. In the phase 1b, 17 malaria-naive, healthy participants were enrolled. Seven participants in the 150 mg dose cohort were inoculated and dosed with SJ733. Eight participants in the 600 mg dose cohort were inoculated, but two participants could not be dosed with SJ733. Two additional participants were subsequently inoculated and dosed with SJ733. SJ733 exposure increased proportional to the dose through to the 600 mg dose, then was saturable at higher doses. Fasted participants receiving 600 mg exceeded the target area under the concentration curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC0–∞) of 13 000 μg × h/L (median AUC0–∞ 24 283 [IQR 16 135–31 311] μg × h/L, median terminal half-life 17·4 h [IQR 16·1–24·0], and median timepoint at which peak plasma concentration is reached 1·0 h [0·6–1·3]), and this dose was tested in the phase 1b. All 15 participants dosed with SJ733 had at least one adverse event. Of the 172 adverse events recorded, 128 (74%) were mild. The only adverse event attributed to SJ733 was mild bilateral foot paraesthesia that lasted 3·75 h and resolved spontaneously. The most common adverse events were related to malaria. Based on parasite clearance half-life, the derived log10 PRR48 and corresponding parasite clearance half-lives were 2·2 (95% CI 2·0–2·5) and 6·47 h (95% CI 5·88–7·18) for 150 mg, and 4·1 (3·7–4·4) and 3·56 h (3·29–3·88) for 600 mg.
Interpretation
The favourable pharmacokinetic, tolerability, and safety profile of SJ733, and rapid antiparasitic effect support its development as a fast-acting component of combination antimalarial therapy.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Characterisation of the dynamics of Zika virus persistence following acute infection is needed to inform blood donor and diagnostic testing policies and understand the natural history of Zika virus infection. We aimed to characterise the natural history, persistence, and clinical outcomes of Zika virus infection through a prospective study in initially asymptomatic Zika virus RNA-positive blood donors.
Methods
Zika virus-infected blood donors identified through Zika virus nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) screening at three blood collection organisations in the USA were enrolled into a 1-year follow-up study, with blood and body fluid samples and detailed symptom data collected at up to seven visits. All samples were tested for Zika virus RNA by real-time PCR (rtPCR); follow-up plasma, whole blood, and urine were also tested by replicate NAAT. Plasma was tested for flavivirus-specific IgM and IgG by ELISA. Zika virus RNA persistence for each assay or sample type and plasma antibody persistence from estimated date of plasma NAAT-detectable infection were calculated from follow-up data using survival statistical methods.
Findings
Between July 6, 2016 and March 7, 2017, we enrolled 53 participants. From the estimated date of plasma NAAT-detectable infection, Zika virus RNA was detectable in plasma for 9·9 days (95% CI 8·1–12·0), in red blood cells for 95·4 days (62·8–129·1), and in whole blood for 73·5 days (39·8–107·5). Replicate NAATs (one or more of eight replicates positive) extended detection of Zika virus RNA in plasma to 34·8 days (19·9–56·2) and in whole blood (at least one of two tests positive) to 104·8 days (76·7–129·9). Urine was rtPCR reactive up to 14·5 days (10·5–20·3) and saliva up to 26·4 days (19·7–38·7). Zika virus IgM persisted for 237·7 days (128·7–459·5) from estimated time since plasma NAAT-detectable infection. Zika virus RNA fell below detectable limits more rapidly in the saliva of participants with pre-existing dengue virus IgG than in those without. Of 25 donors identified pre-seroconversion with symptom data at the first or second study visit, 16 (64%) developed multiple Zika virus-related symptoms after asymptomatic index donations, compared with nine (36%) of 25 donors detected after seroconversion.
Interpretation
Determination of viral marker persistence is enhanced by follow-up of blood donors who are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, Zika virus RNA-positive, and antibody negative. Zika virus RNA persists in red blood cells for several months following clearance from plasma and body fluids, and replicate, highly sensitive NAATs extend RNA detection in all compartments. Whole blood testing can extend detection of acute infection for diagnostics and monitoring of pregnant women, sexual partners, and travellers.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Estimates of government spending and development assistance for tuberculosis exist, but less is known about out-of-pocket and prepaid private spending. We aimed to provide comprehensive estimates of total spending on tuberculosis in low-income and middle-income countries for 2000–17.
Methods
We extracted data on tuberculosis spending, unit costs, and health-care use from the WHO global tuberculosis database, Global Fund proposals and reports, National Health Accounts, the WHO-Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective project database, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Development Assistance for Health Database. We extracted data from at least one of these sources for all 135 low-income and middle-income countries using the World Bank 2019 definitions. We estimated tuberculosis spending by source and function for notified (officially reported) and non-notified tuberculosis cases separately and combined, using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression to fill in for missing data and estimate uncertainty. We aggregated estimates of government, out-of-pocket, prepaid private, and development assistance spending on tuberculosis to estimate total spending in 2019 US$.
Findings
Total spending on tuberculosis in 135 low-income and middle-income countries increased annually by 3·9% (95% CI 3·0 to 4·6), from $5·7 billion (5·2 to 6·5) in 2000 to $10·9 billion (10·3 to 11·8) in 2017. Government spending increased annually by 5·1% (4·4 to 5·7) between 2000 and 2017, and reached $6·9 billion (6·5 to 7·5) or 63·5% (59·2 to 66·8) of all tuberculosis spending in 2017. Of government spending, $5·8 billion (5·6 to 6·1) was spent on notified cases. Out-of-pocket spending decreased annually by 0·8% (−2·9 to 1·3), from $2·4 billion (1·9 to 3·1) in 2000 to $2·1 billion (1·6 to 2·7) in 2017. Development assistance for country-specific spending on tuberculosis increased from $54·6 million in 2000 to $1·1 billion in 2017. Administrative costs and development assistance for global projects related to tuberculosis care increased from $85·3 million in 2000 to $576·2 million in 2017. 30 high tuberculosis burden countries of low and middle income accounted for 73·7% (71·8–75·8) of tuberculosis spending in 2017.
Interpretation
Despite substantial increases since 2000, funding for tuberculosis is still far short of global financing targets and out-of-pocket spending remains high in resource-constrained countries, posing a barrier to patient's access to care and treatment adherence. Of the 30 countries with a high-burden of tuberculosis, just over half were primarily funded by government, while others, especially lower-middle-income and low-income countries, were still primarily dependent on development assistance for tuberculosis or out-of-pocket health spending.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China. The number of affected pregnant women is increasing, but scarce information is available about the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19.
Methods
In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical features, treatments, and maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed.
Findings
Seven patients, admitted to Tongji Hospital from Jan 1, to Feb 8, 2020, were included in our study. The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 29–34 years) and the mean gestational age was 39 weeks plus 1 day (range 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 2 days). Clinical manifestations were fever (six [86%] patients), cough (one [14%] patient), shortness of breath (one [14%] patient), and diarrhoea (one [14%] patient). All the patients had caesarean section within 3 days of clinical presentation with an average gestational age of 39 weeks plus 2 days. The final date of follow-up was Feb 12, 2020. The outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Three neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and one neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2 36 h after birth.
Interpretation
The maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of patients who were infected in late pregnancy appeared very good, and these outcomes were achieved with intensive, active management that might be the best practice in the absence of more robust data. The clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 during pregnancy were similar to those of non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 that have been reported in the literature.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Elucidation of the chain of disease transmission and identification of the source of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections are crucial for effective disease containment. We describe an epidemiological investigation that, with use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological assays, established links between three clusters of COVID-19.
Methods
In Singapore, active case-finding and contact tracing were undertaken for all COVID-19 cases. Diagnosis for acute disease was confirmed with RT-PCR testing. When epidemiological information suggested that people might have been nodes of disease transmission but had recovered from illness, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing was used to establish past infection.
Findings
Three clusters of COVID-19, comprising 28 locally transmitted cases, were identified in Singapore; these clusters were from two churches (Church A and Church B) and a family gathering. The clusters in Church A and Church B were linked by an individual from Church A (A2), who transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection to the primary case from Church B (F1) at a family gathering they both attended on Jan 25, 2020. All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR testing because they had active disease, except for A2, who at the time of testing had recovered from their illness and tested negative. This individual was eventually diagnosed with past infection by serological testing. ELISA assays showed an optical density of more than 1·4 for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and receptor binding domain antigens in titres up to 1/400, and viral neutralisation was noted in titres up to 1/320.
Interpretation
Development and application of a serological assay has helped to establish connections between COVID-19 clusters in Singapore. Serological testing can have a crucial role in identifying convalescent cases or people with milder disease who might have been missed by other surveillance methods.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Catheter-associated bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections are frequently encountered health care-associated infections. We aimed to reduce inappropriate use of catheters to reduce health care-associated infections.
Methods
In this multicentre, interrupted time-series and before and after study, we introduced a de-implementation strategy with multifaceted interventions in seven hospitals in the Netherlands. Adult patients admitted to internal medicine, gastroenterology, geriatic, oncology, or pulmonology wards, and non-surgical acute admission units, and who had a (central or peripheral) venous or urinary catheter were eligible for inclusion. One of the interventions was that nurses in the participating wards attended educational meetings on appropriate catheter use. Data on catheter use were collected every 2 weeks by the primary research physician during the baseline period (7 months) and intervention period (7 months), which were separated by a 5 month transition period. The primary outcomes were percentages of short peripheral intravenous catheters and urinary catheters used inappropriately on the days of data collection. Indications for catheter use were based on international guidelines. This study is registered with Netherlands Trial Register, NL5438.
Findings
Between Sept 1, 2016, and April 1, 2018, we screened 6157 patients for inclusion, of whom 5696 were enrolled: 2650 patients in the baseline group, and 3046 in the intervention group. Inappropriate use of peripheral intravenous catheters occurred in 366 (22·0%, 95% CI 20·0 to 24·0) of 1665 patients in the baseline group and in 275 (14·4%, 12·8 to 16·0) of 1912 patients in the intervention group (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·65, 95% CI 0·56 to 0·77, p<0·0001). Time-series analyses showed an absolute reduction in inappropriate use of peripheral intravenous catheters from baseline to intervention periods of 6·65% (95% CI 2·47 to 10·82, p=0·011). Inappropriate use of urinary catheters occurred in 105 (32·4%, 95% CI 27·3 to 37·8) of 324 patients in the baseline group compared with 96 (24·1%, 20·0 to 28·6) of 398 patients in the intervention group (IRR 0·74, 95% CI 0·56 to 0·98, p=0·013). Time-series analyses showed an absolute reduction in inappropriate use of urinary catheters of 6·34% (95% CI −12·46 to 25·13, p=0·524).
Interpretation
Our de-implementation strategy reduced inappropriate use of short peripheral intravenous catheters in patients who were not in the intensive care unit. The reduction of inappropriate use of urinary catheters was substantial, yet not statistically significant in time-series analysis due to a small sample size. The strategy appears well suited for broad-scale implementation to reduce health care-associated infections.

Tuberculosis continues to be a major threat to global health. Cavitation is a dangerous consequence of pulmonary tuberculosis associated with poor outcomes, treatment relapse, higher transmission rates, and development of drug resistance. However, in the antibiotic era, cavities are often identified as the most extreme outcome of treatment failure and are one of the least-studied aspects of tuberculosis. We review the epidemiology, clinical features, and concurrent standards of care for individuals with cavitary tuberculosis. We also discuss developments in the understanding of tuberculosis cavities as dynamic physical and biochemical structures that interface the host response with a unique mycobacterial niche to drive tuberculosis-associated morbidity and transmission. Advances in preclinical models and non-invasive imaging can provide valuable insights into the drivers of cavitation. These insights will guide the development of specific pharmacological interventions to prevent cavitation and improve lung function for individuals with tuberculosis."

Background
The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same. However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Methods
We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents.
Findings
The weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22–64) of Singapore's capacity. This value is equivalent to 2·8 (95% HPDI 1·5–4·4) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22–67) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18–68) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0–42) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence.
Interpretation
Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.

abstract = "Summary
In 2013, a Lancet Infectious Diseases Commission described the state of antimicrobial resistance worldwide. Since then, greater awareness of the public health ramifications of antimicrobial resistance has led to national actions and global initiatives, including a resolution at the high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly in 2016. Progress in addressing this issue has ranged from a ban on irrational drug combinations in India to commitments to ban colistin as a growth promoter in animals, improve hospital infection control, and implement better antimicrobial stewardship. Funds have been mobilised, and regulatory barriers to new antibiotic development have been relaxed. These efforts have been episodic and uneven across countries, however. Sustained funding for antimicrobial resistance and globally harmonised targets to monitor progress are still urgently needed. Except for in a few leading countries, antimicrobial resistance has not captured the sustained focus of national leaders and country-level actors, including care providers."

abstract = "Summary
Chronic and emerging infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance remain a substantial global health threat. Microbiota are increasingly recognised to play an important role in health. Infections also have a profound effect beyond health, especially on global and local economies. To maximise health improvements, the field of infectious disease epidemiology needs to derive learning from ecology and traditional epidemiology. New methodologies and tools are transforming understanding of these systems, from a better understanding of socioeconomic, environmental, and cultural drivers of infection, to improved methods to detect microorganisms, describe the immunome, and understand the role of human microbiota. However, exploiting the potential of novel methods to improve global health remains elusive. We argue that to exploit these advances a shift is required in the teaching of infectious disease epidemiology to ensure that students are well versed in a breadth of disciplines, while maintaining core epidemiological skills. We discuss the following key points using a series of teaching vignettes: (1) integrated training in classic and novel techniques is needed to develop future scientists and professionals who can work from the micro (interactions between pathogens, their cohabiting microbiota, and the host at a molecular and cellular level), with the meso (the affected communities), and to the macro (wider contextual drivers of disease); (2) teach students to use a team-science multidisciplinary approach to effectively integrate biological, clinical, epidemiological, and social tools into public health; and (3) develop the intellectual skills to critically engage with emerging technologies and resolve evolving ethical dilemmas. Finally, students should appreciate that the voices of communities affected by infection need to be kept at the heart of their work."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In December, 2019, the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing COVID-19, a respiratory disease presenting with fever, cough, and often pneumonia. WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January, 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates.
Methods
A case was defined as a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Case interviews were done to describe timing of onset and nature of symptoms and to identify and classify contacts as high risk (had cumulative face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for ≥15 min, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) or low risk (all other contacts). High-risk contacts were ordered to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days and were actively followed up and monitored for symptoms, and low-risk contacts were tested upon self-reporting of symptoms. We defined fever and cough as specific symptoms, and defined a prodromal phase as the presence of non-specific symptoms for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms. Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm epidemiological links and clarify transmission events where contact histories were ambiguous; integration with epidemiological data enabled precise reconstruction of exposure events and incubation periods. Secondary attack rates were calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of contacts, using Fisher's exact test for the 95% CIs.
Findings
Patient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons. 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in four transmission generations. Signature mutations in the viral genome occurred upon foundation of generation 2, as well as in one case pertaining to generation 4. The median incubation period was 4·0 days (IQR 2·3–4·3) and the median serial interval was 4·0 days (3·0–5·0). Transmission events were likely to have occurred presymptomatically for one case (possibly five more), at the day of symptom onset for four cases (possibly five more), and the remainder after the day of symptom onset or unknown. One or two cases resulted from contact with a case during the prodromal phase. Secondary attack rates were 75·0% (95% CI 19·0–99·0; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 10·0% (1·2–32·0; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 5·1% (2·6–8·9; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts.
Interpretation
Although patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial. Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred. These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Ebola virus disease case definition is a crucial surveillance tool to detect suspected cases for referral and as a screening tool for clinicians to support admission and laboratory testing decisions at Ebola health facilities. We aimed to assess the performance of the WHO Ebola virus disease case definitions and other screening scores.
Methods
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published in English between June 13, 1978, and Jan 14, 2020. We included studies that estimated the sensitivity and specificity of WHO Ebola virus disease case definitions, clinical and epidemiological characteristics (symptoms at admission and contact history), and predictive risk scores against the reference standard (laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus disease). Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were calculated using bivariate and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (when four or more studies provided data) or random-effects meta-analysis (fewer than four studies provided data).
Findings
We identified 2493 publications, of which 14 studies from four countries (Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Angola) were included in the analysis. 12 021 people with suspected disease were included, of whom 4874 were confirmed as positive for Ebola virus infection. Six studies explored the performance of WHO case definitions in non-paediatric populations, and in all of these studies, suspected and probable cases were combined and could not be disaggregated for analysis. The pooled sensitivity of the WHO Ebola virus disease case definitions from these studies was 81·5% (95% CI 74·1–87·2) and pooled specificity was 35·7% (28·5–43·6). History of contact or epidemiological link was a key predictor for the WHO case definitions (seven studies) and for risk scores (six studies). The most sensitive symptom was intense fatigue (79·0% [95% CI 74·4–83·0]), assessed in seven studies, and the least sensitive symptom was pain behind the eyes (1·0% [0·0–7·0]), assessed in three studies. The performance of fever as a symptom varied depending on the cutoff used to define fever.
Interpretation
WHO Ebola virus disease case definitions perform suboptimally to identify cases at both community level and during triage at Ebola health facilities. Inclusion of intense fatigue as a key symptom and contact history could improve the performance of case definitions, but implementation of these changes will require effective collaboration with, and trust of, affected communities.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Long-term protection and herd immunity induced by existing pertussis vaccines are imperfect, and a need therefore exists to develop new pertussis vaccines. This study aimed to investigate the safety, colonisation, and immunogenicity of the new, live attenuated pertussis vaccine, BPZE1, when given intranasally.
Methods
This phase 1b, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study was done at the phase 1 unit, Karolinska Trial Alliance, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Healthy adults (18–32 years) were screened and included sequentially into three groups of increasing BPZE1 dose strength (107 colony-forming units [CFU], 108 CFU, and 109 CFU), and were randomly assigned (3:1 within each group) to receive vaccine or placebo. Vaccine and placebo were administered in phosphate-buffered saline contained 5% saccharose as 0·4 mL in each nostril. The primary outcome was solicited and unsolicited adverse events between day 0 and day 28. The analysis included all randomised participants who received a vaccine dose. Colonisation with BPZE1 was determined by repeatedly culturing nasopharyngeal aspirates at day 4, day 7, day 11, day 14, day 21, and day 28 after vaccination. Immunogenicity, as serum IgG and IgA responses were assessed at day 0, day 7, day 14, day 21, day 28, 6 months, and 12 months after vaccination. This trial is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02453048.
Findings
Between Sept 1, 2015, and Feb 3, 2016, 120 participants were assessed for eligibility, 48 of whom were enrolled and randomly assigned (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo, with 12 participants each in a low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose vaccine group. Adverse events between day 0 and day 28 were reported by one (8%, 95% CI 0–39) of 12 participants in both the placebo and low-dose groups, and two (17%; 2–48) of 12 participants in both the medium-dose and high-dose groups, including cough of grade 2 or more, oropharyngeal pain, and rhinorrhoea and nasal congestion. During this time, none of the participants experienced any spasmodic cough, difficulties in breathing, or adverse events following immunisation concerning vital signs. The tested doses of BPZE1 or placebo were well tolerated, with no apparent difference in solicited or unsolicited adverse events following immunisation between groups. Colonisation at least once after vaccination was observed in 29 (81%; 68–93) of 36 vaccinated participants. The tested vaccine doses were immunogenic, with increases in serum IgG and IgA titres against the four B pertussis antigens from baseline to 12 months.
Interpretation
The tested vaccine was safe, induced a high colonisation rate in an adult population, and was immunogenic at all doses. These findings justify further clinical development of BPZE1 to ultimately be used as a priming vaccine for neonates or a booster vaccine for adolescents and adults, or both.

abstract = "Summary
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death globally that is due to a single pathogen, and up to a fifth of patients with tuberculosis in high-incidence countries are children younger than 16 years. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis is challenging because the disease is often paucibacillary and it is difficult to obtain suitable specimens, causing poor sensitivity of currently available pathogen-based tests. Chest radiography is important for diagnostic evaluations because it detects abnormalities consistent with childhood tuberculosis, but several limitations exist in the interpretation of such results. Therefore, other imaging methods need to be systematically evaluated in children with tuberculosis, although current data suggest that when available, cross-sectional imaging, such as CT, should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation for tuberculosis in a symptomatic child. Additionally, much of the understanding of childhood tuberculosis stems from clinical specimens that might not accurately represent the lesional biology at infection sites. By providing non-invasive measures of lesional biology, advanced imaging tools could enhance the understanding of basic biology and improve on the poor sensitivity of current pathogen detection systems. Finally, there are key knowledge gaps regarding the use of imaging tools for childhood tuberculosis that we outlined in this Personal View, in conjunction with a proposed roadmap for future research."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Evidence-based needs assessments for novel antibiotics against highly-resistant Gram-negative infections (GNIs) are scarce. We aimed to use real-world data from an electronic health record repository to identify treatment opportunities in US hospitals for GNIs resistant to all first-line drugs.
Methods
For this retrospective cohort study, population estimates with an unmet need for novel Gram-negative antibiotics were quantified using the Cerner Health Facts database (2009–15), aggregating episodes of infection in US hospitals with pathogens displaying difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR; resistance to carbapenems, other β-lactams, and fluoroquinolones) and episodes involving empirical coverage with reserve drugs (colistin or polymyxin B and aminoglycosides). Episodes displaying extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance (ECR) were also estimated. Episodes were multiplied by site-specific and fixed 14-day treatment durations for conservative and liberal days-of-therapy (DOT) estimates and stratified by site and taxon. Hospital type-specific DOT rates were reliability adjusted to account for random variation; cluster analyses quantified contribution from outbreaks.
Findings
Across 2 996 271 inpatient encounters and 134 hospitals, there were 1352 DTR-GNI episodes, 1765 episodes involving empirical therapy with colistin or polymyxin B, and 16 632 episodes involving aminoglycosides. Collectively, these yielded 39·0 (conservative estimate) to 138·2 (liberal estimate) DOT per 10 000 encounters for a novel DTR-GNI-targeted drug, whereas greater treatment opportunities were identified for ECR (six times greater) and β-lactam susceptible GNIs (70 times greater). The most common DTR-GNI site and pathogen was lower respiratory (14·3 [43·3%] of 33 DOT per 10 000 encounters) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (522 [38·1%] of 1371 episodes), whereas Enterobacteriaceae urinary-tract infections dominated the ECR or carbapenem-sparing niche (59·0% [5589 of 9535 episodes]) equating to 210·7 DOT per 10 000 encounters. DTR Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia spp, and Achromobacter spp represented less than 1 DOT per 10 000 encounters each. The estimated need for DTR-GNI-targeted antibiotics saw minor contributions by outbreaks and varied from 0·5 to 73·1 DOT per 10 000 encounters by hospital type.
Interpretation
Suspected or documented GNIs with no or suboptimal treatment options are relatively infrequent. Non-revenue-based strategies and innovative trial designs are probably essential to the development of antibiotics with improved effectiveness for these GNIs.

Background
There are few primary care studies of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre primary care network.
Methods
We analysed routinely collected, pseudonymised data for patients in the RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre primary care sentinel network who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between Jan 28 and April 4, 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression models with multiple imputation to identify risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within this surveillance network.
Findings
We identified 3802 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 587 were positive. In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (296 [18·4%] of 1612 men vs 291 [13·3%] of 2190 women; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·55, 95% CI 1·27–1·89). Adults were at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with children, and people aged 40–64 years were at greatest risk in the multivariable model (243 [18·5%] of 1316 adults aged 40–64 years vs 23 [4·6%] of 499 children; adjusted OR 5·36, 95% CI 3·28–8·76). Compared with white people, the adjusted odds of a positive test were greater in black people (388 [15·5%] of 2497 white people vs 36 [62·1%] of 58 black people; adjusted OR 4·75, 95% CI 2·65–8·51). People living in urban areas versus rural areas (476 [26·2%] of 1816 in urban areas vs 111 [5·6%] of 1986 in rural areas; adjusted OR 4·59, 95% CI 3·57–5·90) and in more deprived areas (197 [29·5%] of 668 in most deprived vs 143 [7·7%] of 1855 in least deprived; adjusted OR 2·03, 95% CI 1·51–2·71) were more likely to test positive. People with chronic kidney disease were more likely to test positive in the adjusted analysis (68 [32·9%] of 207 with chronic kidney disease vs 519 [14·4%] of 3595 without; adjusted OR 1·91, 95% CI 1·31–2·78), but there was no significant association with other chronic conditions in that analysis. We found increased odds of a positive test among people who are obese (142 [20·9%] of 680 people with obesity vs 171 [13·2%] of 1296 normal-weight people; adjusted OR 1·41, 95% CI 1·04–1·91). Notably, active smoking was linked with decreased odds of a positive test result (47 [11·4%] of 413 active smokers vs 201 [17·9%] of 1125 non-smokers; adjusted OR 0·49, 95% CI 0·34–0·71).
Interpretation
A positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in this primary care cohort was associated with similar risk factors as observed for severe outcomes of COVID-19 in hospital settings, except for smoking. We provide evidence of potential sociodemographic factors associated with a positive test, including deprivation, population density, ethnicity, and chronic kidney disease.

Controlled human infection trials, whereby a small group of healthy participants is deliberately exposed to a pathogen under controlled circumstances, can provide preliminary data for vaccine efficacy and for the selection of the most promising candidate vaccines for field trials. Because of the potential harm to participants through the deliberate exposure to a pathogen, the use of smaller groups minimises the cumulative risk. As such, a control group that receives a placebo vaccine followed by controlled exposure to a pathogen should be scientifically well justified. As these types of trials are designed to generate consistent infection rates and thus comparable outcomes across populations and trial sites, data from past studies (historical data) could be used as a valid alternative to placebo groups. In this Personal View, we review this option and highlight the considerations for choosing historical data as a suitable control. For the widespread application of this method, responsibility for the centralisation and sharing of data from controlled human infection trials lies with the scientific community."

The majority (17) of zoonoses were bacterial, with nine viruses, three protozoa, and one helminth also identified. Leptospira species and non-typhoidal salmonella serovars were the most frequently reported pathogens.

The discovery of phages in the early 20th century was closely tied to clinical practice, and phage therapy quickly spread around the world. The use of phage therapy in South America in the previous century is still shrouded in mystery and has been mentioned only briefly in recent scientific literature. Research on Brazilian reference collections of medical texts showed that Brazil was an important, but so far little-known, player of phage therapy, uncovering interesting priority claims and missing pieces of phage therapy history. Of note, there is the widespread use of phages against bacillary dysentery and staphylococcal infections, with José da Costa Cruz from the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) as Brazil's leading expert and pioneer. This Historical Review about historical phage use in Brazil fills the gaps in our knowledge about the so-called golden years of phage therapy, providing information about successful experiences that can be useful against dangerous pathogens in our time."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Following the discovery and emergence of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene, mcr-1, the Chinese government formally banned colistin as an animal growth promoter on April 30, 2017. Herein, we report patterns in colistin resistance and mcr-1 abundance in Escherichia coli from animals and humans between 2015 and 2019, to evaluate the effects of the colistin withdrawal.
Methods
We did an epidemiology comparative study to investigate: annual production and sales of colistin in agriculture across mainland China according to data from the China Veterinary Drug Association from 2015 to 2018; the prevalence of colistin-resistant E coli (CREC) in pigs and chickens in 23 Chinese provinces and municipalities as reported in the China Surveillance on Antimicrobial Resistance of Animal Origin database from Jan 1, 2015, to Dec 31, 2016, and Jan 1, 2017, to Dec 31, 2018; the presence of residual colistin and mcr-1 in faeces from 118 animal farms (60 pig, 29 chicken, and 29 cattle) across four provinces over July 1, 2017, to August 31, 2017, and July 1, 2018 to August 31, 2018; the prevalence of mcr-1-positive E coli (MCRPEC) carriage in healthy individuals attending routine hospital examinations across 24 provinces and municipalities from June 1 to July 30, 2019, comparing with equivalent 2016 data (June 1 to September 30) from our previous study in the same hospitals; and the patterns in CREC prevalence among hospital E coli infections across 26 provinces and municipalities from Jan 1, 2015, to Dec 31, 2016, and Jan 1, 2018, to Dec 31, 2019, reported on the China Antimicrobial Surveillance Network.
Findings
After the ban on colistin as a growth promoter, marked reductions were observed in the production (27 170 tonnes in 2015 vs 2497 tonnes in 2018) and sale (US$71·5 million in 2015 vs US$8·0 million in 2018) of colistin sulfate premix. Across 118 farms in four provinces, mean colistin residue concentration was 191·1 μg/kg (SD 934·1) in 2017 versus 7·5 μg/kg (50·0) in 2018 (p<0·0001), and the median relative abundance of mcr-1 per 16S RNA was 0·0009 [IQR 0·0001–0·0059] in 2017 versus 0·0002 [0·0000–0·0020] in 2018 (p=0·0001). Across 23 provinces and municipalities, CREC was identified in pig faeces in 1153 (34·0%) of 3396 samples in 2015–16 versus 142 (5·1%) of 2781 in 2017–18 (p<0·0001); and in chickens in 474 (18·1%) of 2614 samples in 2015–16 versus 143 (5·0%) of 2887 in 2017–18 (p<0·0001). In hospitals across 24 provincial capital cities and municipalities, human carriage of MCRPEC was identified in 644 (14·3%) of 4498 samples in 2016 versus 357 (6·3%) of 5657 in 2019 (p<0·0001). Clinical CREC infections in 26 provinces and municipalities comprised 1059 (1·7%) of 62 737 E coli infections in 2015–16 versus 794 (1·3%) of 59 385 in 2018–19 (p<0·0001).
Interpretation
The colistin withdrawal policy and the decreasing use of colistin in agriculture have had a significant effect on reducing colistin resistance in both animals and humans in China. However, continuous colistin monitoring is essential, in particular to act as an early warning system for colistin stewardship in Chinese hospitals.

abstract = "Summary
Accelerating growth and global expansion of antimicrobial resistance has deepened the need for discovery of novel antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial peptides have clear advantages over conventional antibiotics which include slower emergence of resistance, broad-spectrum antibiofilm activity, and the ability to favourably modulate the host immune response. Broad bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobial peptides offers an additional tool to expand knowledge about the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. Structural and functional limitations, combined with a stricter regulatory environment, have hampered the clinical translation of antimicrobial peptides as potential therapeutic agents. Existing computational and experimental tools attempt to ease the preclinical and clinical development of antimicrobial peptides as novel therapeutics. This Review identifies the benefits, challenges, and opportunities of using antimicrobial peptides against multidrug-resistant pathogens, highlights advances in the deployment of novel promising antimicrobial peptides, and underlines the needs and priorities in designing focused development strategies taking into account the most advanced tools available."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Baloxavir marboxil (hereafter baloxavir), a selective inhibitor of influenza cap-dependent endonuclease, was approved in 2018 in the USA and Japan for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy individuals aged 12 years and older. We aimed to study the efficacy of baloxavir in outpatients at high risk of developing influenza-associated complications.
Methods
We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled and oseltamivir-controlled trial in outpatients aged 12 years and older in 551 sites in 17 countries and territories. Eligible patients had clinically diagnosed influenza-like illness, at least one risk factor for influenza-associated complications (eg, age older than 65 years), and a symptom duration of less than 48 h. Patients were stratified by baseline symptom score (≤14 vs ≥15), pre-existing and worsened symptoms at onset of illness compared with pre-influenza (yes or no), region (Asia, North America and Europe, or southern hemisphere), and weight (<80 kg vs ≥80 kg), and randomly assigned (1:1:1) via an interactive web-response system to either a single weight-based dose of baloxavir (40 mg for patients weighing <80 kg and 80 mg for patients weighing ≥80 kg; baloxavir group), oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days (oseltamivir group), or matching placebo (placebo group). All patients, investigators, study personnel, and data analysts were masked to treatment assignment until database lock. The primary endpoint was time to improvement of influenza symptoms (TTIIS) in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had RT-PCR-confirmed influenza virus infection. Safety was assessed in all patients who receved at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02949011.
Findings
2184 patients were enrolled from Jan 11, 2017, to March 30, 2018, and randomly assigned to receive baloxavir (n=730), placebo (n=729), or oseltamivir (n=725). The modified intention-to-treat population included 1163 patients: 388 in the baloxavir group, 386 in the placebo group, and 389 in the oseltamivir group. 557 (48%) of 1163 patients had influenza A H3N2, 484 (42%) had influenza B, 80 (7%) had influenza A H1N1, 14 patients had a mixed infection, and 28 had infections with non-typable viruses. The median TTIIS was shorter in the baloxavir group (73·2 h [95% CI 67·2 to 85·1]) than in the placebo group (102·3 h [92·7 to 113·1]; difference 29·1 h [95% CI 14·6 to 42·8]; p<0·0001). The median TTIIS in the oseltamivir group was 81·0 h (95% CI 69·4 to 91·5), with a difference from the baloxavir group of 7·7 h (−7·9 to 22·7). Adverse events were reported in 183 (25%) of 730 patients in the baloxavir group, 216 (30%) of 727 in the placebo group, and 202 (28%) of 721 in the oseltamivir group. Serious adverse events were noted in five patients in the baloxavir group, nine patients in the placebo group, and eight patients in the oseltamivir group; one case each of hypertension and nausea in the placebo group and two cases of transaminase elevation in the oseltamivir group were considered to be treatment related. Polymerase acidic protein variants with Ile38Thr, Ile38Met, or Ile38Asn substitutions conferring reduced baloxavir susceptibility emerged in 15 (5%) of 290 baloxavir recipients assessed for amino acid substitutions in the virus.
Interpretation
Single-dose baloxavir has superior efficacy to placebo and similar efficacy to oseltamivir for ameliorating influenza symptoms in high-risk outpatients. The safety of baloxavir was comparable to placebo. This study supports early therapy for patients at high risk of complications of influenza to speed clinical recovery and reduce complications.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antibiotic prophylaxis is frequently continued for 1 day or more after surgery to prevent surgical site infection. Continuing antibiotic prophylaxis after an operation might have no advantage compared with its immediate discontinuation, and it unnecessarily exposes patients to risks associated with antibiotic use. In 2016, WHO recommended discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis after surgery. We aimed to update the evidence that formed the basis for that recommendation.
Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and WHO regional medical databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis that were published from Jan 1, 1990, to July 24, 2018. RCTs comparing the effect of postoperative continuation versus discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of surgical site infection in patients undergoing any surgical procedure with an indication for antibiotic prophylaxis were eligible. The primary outcome was the effect of postoperative surgical antibiotic prophylaxis continuation versus its immediate discontinuation on the occurrence of surgical site infection, with a prespecified subgroup analysis for studies that did and did not adhere to current best practice standards for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. We calculated summary relative risks (RRs) with corresponding 95% CIs using a random effects model (DerSimonian and Laird). We evaluated heterogeneity with the χ2 test, I2, and τ2, and visually assesed publication bias with a contour-enhanced funnel plot. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42017060829.
Findings
We identified 83 relevant RCTs, of which 52 RCTs with 19 273 participants were included in the primary meta-analysis. The pooled RR of surgical site infection with postoperative continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis versus its immediate discontinuation was 0·89 (95% CI 0·79–1·00), with low heterogeneity in effect size between studies (τ2=0·001, χ2 p=0·46, I2=0·7%). Our prespecified subgroup analysis showed a significant association between the effect estimate and adherence to best practice standards of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis: the RR of surgical site infection was reduced with continued antibiotic prophylaxis after surgery compared with its immediate discontinuation in trials that did not meet best practice standards (0·79 [95% CI 0·67–0·94]) but not in trials that did (1·04 [0·85–1·27]; p=0·048). Whether studies adhered to best practice standards explained all variance in the pooled estimate from the primary meta-analysis.
Interpretation
Overall, we identified no conclusive evidence for a benefit of postoperative continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis over its discontinuation. When best practice standards were followed, postoperative continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis did not yield any additional benefit in reducing the incidence of surgical site infection. These findings support WHO recommendations against this practice.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The long-term benefits of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) remain unknown because of serotype replacement. We aimed to estimate the effect of PCV implementation on invasive pneumococcal disease incidence in France.
Methods
We did a quasi-experimental interrupted time-series analysis using data from a French national prospective surveillance system. We included all invasive pneumococcal disease cases in children and adults from more than 250 participating hospitals between Jan 1, 2001, and Dec 31, 2017. The primary outcome was incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (meningitis and non-meningitis) over time, analysed by segmented regression with autoregressive error. Isolates were serotyped by latex agglutination with antiserum samples.
Findings
We included 75 903 patients with invasive pneumococcal disease, including 4302 (5·7%) children younger than 2 years and 37 534 (49·4%) adults aged 65 years or older. Before PCV7 implementation, the estimated monthly incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease was 0·78 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, which did not change significantly up to May, 2010. PCV13 implementation in 2010 was followed by a significant decrease in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (−1·5% per month, 95% CI −2·2 to −0·8), reaching an estimated monthly incidence of 0·52 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in December, 2014. From January, 2015, the incidence rebounded (1·8% per month, 95% CI 1·0 to 2·6), reaching an estimated monthly incidence of 0·73 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in December, 2017. The estimated monthly incidence increased from 0·93 cases per 100 000 in December, 2014, to 1·73 cases per 100 000 in December, 2017, for children younger than 2 years, and from 1·54 cases per 100 000 in December, 2014, to 2·08 cases per 100 000 in December, 2017, for adults aged 65 years or older. The main non-PCV13 serotypes involved in the increase were 24F in young children and 12F, 22F, 9N, and 8 in adults aged 65 years or older.
Interpretation
PCV13 implementation led to a major reduction in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease. However, a rebound in cases among children and adults since 2015, driven by several emerging non-PCV13 serotypes, jeopardises the long-term PCV benefits. These findings, if confirmed in the coming years, should be considered in the development of next-generation PCVs and might guide policy makers in the selection of future pneumococcal vaccines.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The globally synchronised introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and replacement of trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) with bivalent OPV (bOPV) were successfully implemented in China's routine immunisation programme in May, 2016. In response to the global shortage of Salk-strain IPV, Sabin-strain IPV production was encouraged to develop and use in low-income and middle-income countries. We assessed the immunogenicity of the current routine poliovirus vaccination schedule in China and compared it with alternative schedules that use Sabin-strain IPV (sIPV) and bOPV.
Methods
This open-label, randomised, controlled trial recruited healthy infants aged 60–75 days from two centres in Zhejiang, China. Eligible infants were full-term, due for their first polio vaccination, weighed more than 2·5 kg at birth, were healthy on physical examination with no obvious medical conditions, and had no contraindications to vaccination. Infants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using permuted block randomisation (block size of 12) to one of three polio vaccination schedules, with the first, second, and third doses given at ages 2 months, 3 months, and 4 months, respectively: sIPV-bOPV-bOPV (1sIPV+2bOPV group; current regimen), sIPV-sIPV-bOPV (2sIPV+1bOPV group), or sIPV-sIPV-sIPV (3sIPV group). The primary endpoint was the proportion of infants with seroconversion to each of the three poliovirus serotypes 1 month after the third dose. Serious and medically important adverse events were monitored for up to 30 days after each vaccination. We assessed immunity in the per-protocol population (all children who completed all three vaccinations and had pre-vaccination and post-vaccination laboratory data) and safety in all children who received at least one dose of study vaccine. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03147560.
Results
Between May 1, 2016, and Dec 1, 2017, we enrolled and randomly assigned 528 eligible infants to one of the three treatment groups (176 in each group); 473 infants (158 in the 1sIPV+2bOPV group, 152 in the 2sIPV+1bOPV group, and 163 in the 3sIPV group) were included in the per-protocol population. 100% seroconversion against poliovirus types 1 and 3 was observed in all three groups. Infants who received an immunisation schedule containing bOPV had significantly higher antibody titres against poliovirus types 1 and 3 than did the sIPV-only group (2048 in all three treatment groups; p<0·0001). Seroconversion against type 2 poliovirus was observed in 98 (62%) infants in the 1sIPV+2bOPV group, 145 (95%) infants in the 2sIPV+1bOPV group, and 161 (99%) infants in the 3sIPV group. No serious adverse events occurred during the study; 14 minor, transient adverse events were observed, with no significant differences across study groups.
Interpretation
All three study schedules were well tolerated and highly immunogenic against poliovirus types 1 and 3. Schedules containing two or three sIPV doses had higher seroconversion rates against poliovirus type 2 than did the schedule with a single dose of sIPV. Our findings support inclusion of two sIPV doses in the routine poliovirus vaccination schedule in China to provide better protection against poliovirus type 2 than provided by the current regimen.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The 2014 Zaire Ebola virus disease epidemic accelerated vaccine development for the virus. We aimed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of one dose of monovalent, recombinant, chimpanzee adenovirus type-3 vectored Zaire Ebola glycoprotein vaccine (ChAd3-EBO-Z) in adults.
Methods
This phase 2, randomised, observer-blind, controlled trial was done in study centres in Cameroon, Mali, Nigeria, and Senegal. Healthy adults (≥18 years) were randomly assigned with a web-based system (1:1; minimisation procedure accounting for age, gender, centre) to receive ChAd3-EBO-Z (day 0), or saline placebo (day 0) and ChAd3-EBO-Z (month 6). The study was observer-blind until planned interim day 30 analysis, single-blind until month 6, and open-label after month 6 vaccination. Primary outcomes assessed in the total vaccinated cohort, which comprised all participants with at least one study dose administration documented, were serious adverse events (up to study end, month 12); and for a subcohort were solicited local or general adverse events (7 days post-vaccination), unsolicited adverse events (30 days post-vaccination), haematological or biochemical abnormalities, and clinical symptoms of thrombocytopenia (day 0–6). Secondary endpoints (subcohort; per-protocol cohort) evaluated anti-glycoprotein Ebola virus antibody titres (ELISA) pre-vaccination and 30 days post-vaccination. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02485301.
Findings
Between July 22, 2015, and Dec 10, 2015, 3030 adults were randomly assigned; 3013 were included in the total vaccinated cohort (1509 [50·1%] in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group and 1504 [49·9%] in the placebo/ChAd3-EBO-Z group), 17 were excluded because no vaccine was administered. The most common solicited injection site symptom was pain (356 [48%] of 748 in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group vs 57 [8%] of 751 in the placebo/ChAd3-EBO-Z group); the most common solicited general adverse event was headache (345 [46%] in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group vs 136 [18%] in the placebo/ChAd3-EBO-Z group). Unsolicited adverse events were reported by 123 (16%) of 749 in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group and 119 (16%) of 751 in the placebo/ChAd3-EBO-Z group. Serious adverse events were reported for 11 (1%) of 1509 adults in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group, and 18 (1%) of 1504 in the placebo/ChAd3-EBO-Z group; none were considered vaccination-related. No clinically meaningful thrombocytopenia was reported. At day 30, anti-glycoprotein Ebola virus antibody geometric mean concentration was 900 (95% CI 824–983) in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group. There were no treatment-related deaths.
Interpretation
ChAd3-EBO-Z was immunogenic and well tolerated in adults. Our findings provide a strong basis for future development steps, which should concentrate on multivalent approaches (including Sudan and Marburg strains). Additionally, prime-boost approaches should be a focus with a ChAd3-based vaccine for priming and boosted by a modified vaccinia Ankara-based vaccine.

abstract = "Summary
For centuries, yellow fever virus infection generated substantial fear among explorers, tourist travellers, workers, military personnel, and others entering areas of transmission. Currently, there is transmission only in some areas of tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa. When symptomatic, yellow fever infection causes severe liver dysfunction and coagulopathy with elevated mortality rates. Since there is no effective treatment, vaccination against yellow fever, available since 1937, represents an important preventive intervention in endemic areas. Every year, an increasing number of individuals are travelling to yellow fever endemic areas, many of whom have complex medical conditions. Travel health practitioners should do individualised assessments of the risks and benefits of yellow fever vaccination to identify potential contraindications. The most relevant contraindications include a history of thymoma or thymus dysfunction, AIDS, and individuals receiving immunosuppressive drugs including biological therapies or chemotherapy. We briefly review strategies to prevent yellow fever infection in travellers with the use of yellow fever vaccination and the use of personal protection measures to avoid mosquito bites."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Tuberculosis remains a global health challenge, with early diagnosis key to its reduction. Face-mask sampling detects exhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We aimed to investigate bacillary output from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and to assess the potential of face-mask sampling as a diagnostic method in active case-finding.
Methods
We did a 24-h longitudinal study in patients from three hospitals in Pretoria, South Africa, with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Patients underwent 1 h of face-mask sampling eight times over a 24-h period, with contemporaneous sputum sampling. M tuberculosis was detected by quantitative PCR. We also did an active case-finding pilot study in inhabitants of an informal settlement near Pretoria. We enrolled individuals with symptoms of tuberculosis on the WHO screening questionnaire. Participants provided sputum and face-mask samples that were tested with the molecular assay Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra. Sputum-negative and face-mask-positive individuals were followed up prospectively for 20 weeks by bronchoscopy, PET-CT, and further sputum analysis to validate the diagnosis.
Findings
Between Sept 22, 2015, and Dec 3, 2015, 78 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were screened for the longitudinal study, of whom 24 completed the study (20 had HIV co-infection). M tuberculosis was detected in 166 (86%) of 192 face-mask samples and 38 (21%) of 184 assessable sputum samples obtained over a 24-h period. Exhaled M tuberculosis output showed no diurnal pattern and did not associate with cough frequency, sputum bacillary content, or chest radiographic disease severity. On May 16, 2018, 45 individuals were screened for the prospective active case-finding pilot study, of whom 20 had tuberculosis symptoms and were willing to take part. Eight participants were diagnosed prospectively with pulmonary tuberculosis, of whom six were exclusively face-mask positive at screening. Four of these participants (three of whom were HIV-positive) had normal findings on chest radiography but had treatment-responsive early tuberculosis-compatible lesions on PET-CT scans, with Xpert-positive sputum samples after 6 weeks.
Interpretation
Face-mask sampling offers a highly efficient and non-invasive method for detecting exhaled M tuberculosis, informing the presence of active infection both with greater consistency and at an earlier disease stage than with sputum samples. The approach shows potential for diagnosis and screening, particularly in difficult-to-reach communities.

Our understanding of congenital infections is based on prospective studies of women infected during pregnancy. The EU has funded three consortia to study Zika virus, each including a prospective study of pregnant women. Another multi-centre study has been funded by the US National Institutes of Health. This Personal View describes the study designs required to research Zika virus, and questions whether funding academics in the EU and USA to work with collaborators in outbreak areas is an effective strategy. 3 years after the 2015–16 Zika virus outbreaks, these collaborations have taught us little about vertical transmission of the virus. In the time taken to approve funding, agree contracts, secure ethics approval, and equip laboratories, Zika virus had largely disappeared. By contrast, prospective studies based on local surveillance and standard-of-care protocols have already provided valuable data. Threats to fetal and child health pose new challenges for global preparedness requiring support for the design and implementation of locally appropriate protocols. These protocols can answer the key questions earlier than externally designed studies and at lower cost. Local protocols can also provide a framework for recruitment of unexposed controls that are required to study less specific outcomes. Other priorities include accelerated development of non-invasive tests, and longer-term storage of neonatal and antenatal samples to facilitate retrospective reconstruction of cohort studies."

The outbreaks of Ebola virus between 2014 and 2020 have drawn attention to knowledge gaps related to Ebola virus disease in pregnant women. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate available data on pregnant and lactating women with acute Ebola virus disease or following recovery. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection, CINAHL, POPLINE, Global Health, and WHO Global Index Medicus, in addition to grey literature, for relevant articles. Studies of all types and published between database inception and Aug 19, 2019, were eligible (PROSPERO 129335). We identified 1060 records, of which 52 studies met our inclusion criteria. Overall, mortality in 274 pregnant women with Ebola virus disease was 72% (197 women died); mortality for pregnant women with Ebola virus disease were not higher than those in the general population of patients with Ebola virus disease. Nearly all women with Ebola virus disease had adverse pregnancy outcomes. Among survivors, Ebola virus RNA was detected by RT-PCR in amniotic fluid up to 32 days after maternal clearance of Ebola virus from the blood and in breastmilk 26 days after symptom onset. A risk of transmission of Ebola virus from pregnancy-related fluids and breastmilk probably exists, and precautions should be taken."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Mycoplasma genitalium is now recognised as an important bacterial sexually transmitted infection. We summarised data from studies of mutations associated with macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance in M genitalium to establish the prevalence of resistance. We also investigated temporal trends in resistance and aimed to establish the association between resistance and geographical location.
Methods
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, and MEDLINE for studies that included data for the prevalence of mutations associated with macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance in M genitalium published in any language up to Jan 7, 2019. We defined prevalence as the proportion of M genitalium samples positive for key mutations associated with azithromycin resistance (23S rRNA gene, position 2058 or 2059) or moxifloxacin resistance (S83R, S83I, D87N, or D87Y in parC), or both, among all M genitalium samples that were successfully characterised. We used random-effects meta-analyses to calculate summary estimates of prevalence. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses by WHO region and time period were done. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016050370.
Results
Overall, 59 studies from 21 countries met the inclusion criteria for our study: 57 studies of macrolide resistance (8966 samples), 25 of fluoroquinolone resistance (4003 samples), and 22 of dual resistance to macrolides and fluoroquinolones (3280 samples). The summary prevalence of mutations associated with macrolide resistance among M genitalium samples was 35·5% (95% CI 28·8–42·5); prevalence increased from 10·0% (95% CI 2·6–20·1%) before 2010, to 51·4% (40·3–62·4%) in 2016–17 (p<0·0001). Prevalence of mutations associated with macrolide resistance was significantly greater in samples in the WHO Western Pacific and Americas regions than in those from the WHO European region. The overall prevalence of mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in M genitalium samples was 7·7% (95% CI 4·5–11·4%). Prevalence did not change significantly over time, but was significantly higher in the Western Pacific region than in the European region. Overall, the prevalence of both mutations associated with macrolide resistance and those associated with fluoroquinolone resistance among M genitalium samples was 2·8% (1·3–4·7%). The prevalence of dual resistance did not change significantly over time, and did not vary significantly by geographical region.
Interpretation
Global surveillance and measures to optimise the efficacy of treatments—including resistance-guided strategies, new antimicrobials, and antimicrobial combination approaches—are urgently needed to ensure cure in a high proportion of M genitalium infections and to prevent further spread of resistant strains.

For 12 of 46 AEFI examined, a causal relationship has been established with at least one vaccine currently routinely recommended to the general USA population: anaphylaxis, arthralgia or arthritis (mild, acute, and transient, not chronic), deltoid bursitis (when vaccine is administered improperly), disseminated varicella infection (in immune deficient individuals for whom the varicella vaccine is contraindicated), encephalitis, febrile seizures, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hepatitis (in immune deficient individuals for whom the varicella vaccine is contraindicated), herpes zoster, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, meningitis, and syncope. Other than mild acute and transient arthralgia or arthritis, which is very common in adult women after rubella vaccine, these adverse reactions are rare or very rare.

abstract = "Summary
The collapse of global cooperation and a failure of international solidarity have led to many low-income and middle-income countries being denied access to molecular diagnostics in the COVID-19 pandemic response. Yet the scarcity of knowledge on the dynamics of the immune response to infection has led to hesitation on recommending the use of rapid immunodiagnostic tests, even though rapid serology tests are commercially available and scalable. On the basis of our knowledge and understanding of viral infectivity and host response, we urge countries without the capacity to do molecular testing at scale to research the use of serology tests to triage symptomatic patients in community settings, to test contacts of confirmed cases, and in situational analysis and surveillance. The WHO R&D Blue Print expert group identified eight priorities for research and development, of which the highest is to mobilise research on rapid point-of-care diagnostics for use at the community level. This research should inform control programmes of the required performance and utility of rapid serology tests, which, when applied specifically for appropriate public health measures to then be put in place, can make a huge difference."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures.
Methods
From Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts. We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk.
Findings
Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20–22). Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1–2·7). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49–26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43–34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1–13·8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7·4% in children <10 years vs population average of 6·6%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3–0·5), with a mean serial interval of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2–7·6).
Interpretation
Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

Background
The burden and influence of health-care associated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is unknown. We aimed to examine the use of rapid SARS-CoV-2 sequencing combined with detailed epidemiological analysis to investigate health-care associated SARS-CoV-2 infections and inform infection control measures.
Methods
In this prospective surveillance study, we set up rapid SARS-CoV-2 nanopore sequencing from PCR-positive diagnostic samples collected from our hospital (Cambridge, UK) and a random selection from hospitals in the East of England, enabling sample-to-sequence in less than 24 h. We established a weekly review and reporting system with integration of genomic and epidemiological data to investigate suspected health-care associated COVID-19 cases.
Findings
Between March 13 and April 24, 2020, we collected clinical data and samples from 5613 patients with COVID-19 from across the East of England. We sequenced 1000 samples producing 747 high-quality genomes. We combined epidemiological and genomic analysis of the 299 patients from our hospital and identified 35 clusters of identical viruses involving 159 patients. 92 (58%) of 159 patients had strong epidemiological links and 32 (20%) patients had plausible epidemiological links. These results were fed back to clinical, infection control, and hospital management teams, leading to infection-control interventions and informing patient safety reporting.
Interpretation
We established real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a UK hospital and showed the benefit of combined genomic and epidemiological analysis for the investigation of health-care associated COVID-19. This approach enabled us to detect cryptic transmission events and identify opportunities to target infection-control interventions to further reduce health-care associated infections. Our findings have important implications for national public health policy as they enable rapid tracking and investigation of infections in hospital and community settings.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The development of an effective vaccine against Zika virus remains a public health priority. A Zika purified inactivated virus (ZPIV) vaccine candidate has been shown to protect animals against Zika virus challenge and to be well tolerated and immunogenic in humans up to 8 weeks of follow-up. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of ZPIV in humans up to 52 weeks of follow-up when given via standard or accelerated vaccination schedules.
Methods
We did a single-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled, phase 1 trial in healthy adults aged 18–50 years with no known history of flavivirus vaccination or infection at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, USA. Participants were sequentially enrolled into one of three groups: ZPIV given at weeks 0 and 4 (standard regimen), weeks 0 and 2 (accelerated regimen), or week 0 alone (single-dose regimen). Within each group, participants were randomly assigned using a computer-generated randomisation schedule to receive an intramuscular injection of 5 μg ZPIV or saline placebo, in a ratio of 5:1. The sponsor, clinical staff, investigators, participants, and laboratory personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was safety up to day 364 after final dose administration, and secondary endpoints were proportion of participants with positive humoral immune responses (50% microneutralisation titre [MN50] ≥100) and geometric mean MN50 at observed peak response (ie, the highest neutralising antibody level observed for an individual participant across all timepoints) and week 28. All participants who received at least one dose of ZPIV or placebo were included in the safety population; the analysis of immunogenicity at observed peak included all participants who received at least one dose of ZPIV or placebo and had any adverse events or immunogenicity data after dosing. The week 28 immunogenicity analysis population consisted of all participants who received ZPIV or placebo and had immunogenicity data available at week 28. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02937233.
Findings
Between Dec 8, 2016, and May 17, 2017, 12 participants were enrolled into each group and then randomly assigned to vaccine (n=10) or placebo (n=2). There were no serious or grade 3 treatment-related adverse events. The most common reactions among the 30 participants who received the vaccine were injection-site pain (24 [80%]), fatigue (16 [53%]), and headache (14 [46%]). A positive response at observed peak titre was detected in all participants who received ZPIV via the standard regimen, in eight (80%) of ten participants who received ZPIV via the accelerated regimen, and in none of the ten participants who received ZPIV via the single-dose regimen. The geometric mean of all individual participants' observed peak values was 1153·9 (95% CI 455·2–2925·2) in the standard regimen group, 517·7 (142·9–1875·6) in the accelerated regimen group, and 6·3 (3·7–10·8) in the single-dose regimen group. At week 28, a positive response was observed in one (13%) of eight participants who received ZPIV via the standard regimen and in no participant who received ZPIV via the accelerated (n=7) or single-dose (n=10) regimens. The geomteric mean titre (GMT) at this timepoint was 13·9 (95% CI 3·5–55·1) in the standard regimen group and 6·9 (4·0–11·9) in the accelerated regimen group; antibody titres were undetectable at 28 weeks in participants who received ZPIV via the single-dose regimen. For all vaccine schedules, GMTs peaked 2 weeks after the final vaccination and declined to less than 100 by study week 16. There was no difference in observed peak GMTs between the standard 4-week and the accelerated 2-week boosting regimens (p=0·4494).
Interpretation
ZPIV was safe and well tolerated in humans up to 52 weeks of follow-up. ZPIV immunogenicity required two doses and was not durable. Additional studies of ZPIV to optimise dosing schedules are ongoing.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Raxibacumab is a monoclonal antibody against protective antigen, which is the cell-binding part of Bacillus anthracis toxin, and is approved for treatment and postexposure prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax. Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA), for anthrax prophylaxis, consists primarily of adsorbed protective antigen. We did a postapproval study to assess the effect of raxibacumab on immunogenicity of AVA.
Methods
We did an open-label, parallel-group, randomised non-inferiority study at three centres in the USA. We enrolled healthy volunteers (aged 18–65 years) with no evidence of exposure to protective antigen. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) according to a pregenerated balanced independent randomisation schedule to either subcutaneous 0·5 mL AVA on days 1, 15, and 29 or raxibacumab intravenous infusion (40 mg/kg) immediately before AVA on day 1, followed by AVA only on days 15 and 29. It was an open-label study to investigators and participants; however, the sponsor remained blinded during the study. The primary outcome was the ratio of geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of anti-protective antigen antibodies (attributable to the immune response to AVA) between AVA and AVA plus raxibacumab 4 weeks after the first AVA dose in the per-protocol population. The per-protocol population comprised all individuals who received the allocated treatment within the protocol-specified visit window and completed the primary study outcome assessment, without a protocol deviation requiring exclusion. The non-inferiority margin for the ratio of GMCs was predefined (upper limit of 90% CI <1·5). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02339155.
Findings
Between Feb 24, 2015, and June 6, 2017, 873 participants were screened for eligibility, of whom 300 were excluded. 573 were randomly allocated either AVA (n=287) or AVA plus raxibacumab (n=286). The per-protocol population comprised 276 individuals assigned AVA and 269 allocated AVA plus raxibacumab. At week 4, the GMC of anti-protective antigen antibodies in participants allocated AVA was 26·5 μg/mL (95% CI 23·6–29·8) compared with 22·5 μg/mL (20·1–25·1) among individuals allocated AVA plus raxibacumab. The ratio between groups was 1·18 (90% CI 1·03–1·35; p=0·0019), which met the predefined non-inferiority margin. Adverse events in the safety population were similar across groups (87 [30%] of 286 in the AVA group vs 80 [29%] of 280 in the AVA plus raxibacumab group) and no treatment-related serious adverse events were reported.
Interpretation
Co-administration of raxibacumab with AVA does not negatively affect AVA immunogenicity. This finding suggests that combining raxibacumab with AVA might provide added benefit in postexposure prophylaxis against inhalational anthrax.

Background
The effectiveness of contact isolation for decreasing the spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) has been questioned. The aim of this study was to establish the benefits of contact isolation over standard precautions for reducing the incidence density of ESBL-E colonisation and infection in adult medical and surgical wards with an active surveillance culture programme.
Methods
We did a cluster-randomised crossover trial in adult wards in four European university hospitals. Medical, surgical, or combined medical–surgical wards without critical care were randomised to continue standard precautions alone or implement contact isolation alongside standard precautions for 12 months, followed by a 1 month washout period and 12 months of the alternate strategy. Randomisation was done via a computer-generated sequence, with a block size of two consecutive wards. Only laboratory technicians and data analysts were masked to allocation. Patients were screened for ESBL-E carriage within 3 days of admission, once a week thereafter, and on discharge. The primary outcome was the incidence density of ESBL-E, defined as the acquisition rate per 1000 patient-days at risk at the ward level and assessed in the per-protocol population, which included all patients screened at least twice with a length of stay of more than 1 week for each intervention period. No specific safety measures were assessed given the minimal risk of adverse events. The trial is registered, ISRCTN57648070.
Findings
We enrolled 20 wards from four hospitals in Germany (eight wards), the Netherlands (four wards), Spain (four wards), and Switzerland (four wards). Between Jan 6, 2014, and Aug 31, 2016, 38 357 patients were admitted to these wards. Among 15 184 patients with a length of stay of more than 1 week, 11 368 patients (75%) were screened at least twice. The incidence density of ward-acquired ESBL-E was 6·0 events per 1000 patient-days at risk (95% CI 5·4–6·7) during periods of contact isolation and 6·1 (5·5–6·7) during periods of standard precautions (p=0·9710). Multivariable analysis adjusted for length of stay, percentage of patients screened, and prevalence in first screening cultures yielded an incidence rate ratio of 0·99 (95% CI 0·80–1·22; p=0·9177) for care under contact isolation compared with standard precautions.
Interpretation
Contact isolation showed no benefit when added to standard precautions for controlling the spread of ESBL-E on non-critical care wards with extensive surveillance screening.

Leprosy is endemic in more than 100 countries worldwide, with over 200 000 new diagnoses each year and more than 4 million people living with some form of impairment related to leprosy. The term leprosy, as used in the Bible, designated a multitude of diseases with skin manifestations. Biblical leprosy carried huge stigma and was considered synonymous with impurity and divine punishment. Global actions to eliminate leprosy have been implemented but have yet to succeed, with stigmatisation and discrimination against people affected by the disease being recognised as two of the biggest obstacles. In Brazil, leprosy was officially renamed hanseníase (Hansen's disease) in 1975, and the Brazilian experience of renaming leprosy during the past four decades has given clear signs of the benefit of this measure in fighting stigma and discrimination. More recent actions by WHO and many years of advocacy by patient organisations have followed, but concrete and effective measures to dignify language and terminology need to be implemented as soon as possible."

Background
A cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were successively reported in Wuhan, China. We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course.
Methods
Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done ≤1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups.
Findings
81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49·5 years (SD 11·0). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10·5 (SD 6·4) overall, 2·8 (3·3) in group 1, 11·1 (5·4) in group 2, 13·0 (5·7) in group 3, and 12·1 (5·9) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4).
Interpretation
COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1–3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat. Identification of markers for symptom onset and disease progression is a pressing issue. We described the clinical features of people infected on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship who were diagnosed with asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or mild or severe COVID-19, on admission to the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) and at the end of observation.
Methods
This retrospective, single-centre study included participants with laboratory-detected SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital from Feb 11 to Feb 25, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory data, and radiological findings were analysed. Clinical outcomes were followed up until discharge or Feb 26, 2020, whichever came first. We defined asymptomatic infection as SARS-CoV-2 infection with no history of clinical signs and symptoms, severe COVID-19 as clinical symptoms of pneumonia (dyspnoea, tachypnoea, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation <93%, and need for oxygen therapy), and mild COVID-19 as all other symptoms. Clinical features on admission were compared among patients with different disease severity, including asymptomatic infection, at the end of observation. We used univariable analysis to identify factors associated with symptomatic illness among asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and disease progression in patients with COVID-19.
Findings
Among the 104 participants included in the final analysis, the median age was 68 years (IQR 47–75) and 54 (52%) were male. On admission, 43 (41%) participants were classified as asymptomatic, 41 (39%) as having mild COVID-10, and 20 (19%) as having severe COVID-19. At the end of observation, 33 (32%) participants were confirmed as being asymptomatic, 43 (41%) as having mild COVID-19, and 28 (27%) as having severe COVID-19. Serum lactate hydrogenase concentrations were significantly higher in the ten participants who were asymptomatic on admission but developed symptomatic COVID-19 compared with the 33 participants who remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period (five [50%] vs four [12%] participants; odds ratio 7·25, 95% CI 1·43–36·70; p=0·020). Compared with patients with mild disease at the end of observation, patients with severe COVID-19 were older (median age 73 years [IQR 55–77] vs 60 years [40–71]; p=0·028) and had more frequent consolidation on chest CT (13 [46%] of 28 vs nine [21%] of 43; p=0·035) and lymphopenia (16 [57%] vs ten [23%]; p=0·0055) on admission.
Interpretation
Older age, consolidation on chest CT images, and lymphopenia might be risk factors for disease progression of COVID-19 and contribute to improved clinical management.

COVID-19 poses an extraordinary threat to global public health and an effective vaccine could provide a key means of overcoming this crisis. Human challenge studies involve the intentional infection of research participants and can accelerate or improve vaccine development by rapidly providing estimates of vaccine safety and efficacy. Human challenge studies of low virulence coronaviruses have been done in the past and human challenge studies with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have been proposed. These studies of coronaviruses could provide considerable benefits to public health; for instance, by improving and accelerating vaccine development. However, human challenge studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in particular might be controversial, in part, for ethical reasons. The ethical issues raised by such studies thus warrant early consideration involving, for example, broad consultation with the community. This Personal View provides preliminary analyses of relevant ethical considerations regarding human challenge studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, including the potential benefits to public health and to participants, the risks and uncertainty for participants, and the third-party risks (ie, to research staff and the wider community). We argue that these human challenge studies can reasonably be considered ethically acceptable insofar as such studies are accepted internationally and by the communities in which they are done, can realistically be expected to accelerate or improve vaccine development, have considerable potential to directly benefit participants, are designed to limit and minimise risks to participants, and are done with strict infection control measures to limit and reduce third-party risks."

Neurocysticercosis, the infection of the CNS with larval cysts of Taenia solium, is a leading cause of seizures in low-income countries. The clinical presentation of neurocysticercosis is variable and depends on the number, size, and location of cysticerci, and on the immune response of the host. In most patients, the affected site is the brain parenchyma, where cysts can precipitate seizures. Neurocysticercosis has seldom been described in pregnant women. In this Grand Round, we report two cases of pregnant women who immigrated to Italy from Bolivia and Ecuador, and who developed seizures in the early post-partum period, due to calcified parenchymal neurocysticercosis lesions. We discuss the complex interactions between neurocysticercosis and the immune system in pregnancy and the post-partum period. Building on this scenario, we propose practices for the management of neurocysticercosis in pregnancy and the post-partum period, highlighting important gaps in the literature that should be addressed."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The clinical and epidemiological significance of HIV-associated Mycobacterium tuberculosis bloodstream infection (BSI) is incompletely understood. We hypothesised that M tuberculosis BSI prevalence has been underestimated, that it independently predicts death, and that sputum Xpert MTB/RIF has suboptimal diagnostic yield for M tuberculosis BSI.
Methods
We did a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies performing routine mycobacterial blood culture in a prospectively defined patient population of people with HIV aged 13 years or older. Studies were identified through searching PubMed and Scopus up to Nov 10, 2018, without language or date restrictions and through manual review of reference lists. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed with an adapted QUADAS-2 framework. IPD were requested for all identified studies and subject to harmonised inclusion criteria: age 13 years or older, HIV positivity, available CD4 cell count, a valid mycobacterial blood culture result (excluding patients with missing data from lost or contaminated blood cultures), and meeting WHO definitions for suspected tuberculosis (presence of screening symptom). Predicted probabilities of M tuberculosis BSI from mixed-effects modelling were used to estimate prevalence. Estimates of diagnostic yield of sputum testing with Xpert (or culture if Xpert was unavailable) and of urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) testing for M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by two-level random-effect meta-analysis. Estimates of mortality associated with M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by mixed-effect Cox proportional-hazard modelling and of effect of treatment delay on mortality by propensity-score analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number 42016050022.
Findings
We identified 23 datasets for inclusion (20 published and three unpublished at time of search) and obtained IPD from 20, representing 96·2% of eligible IPD. Risk of bias for the included studies was assessed to be generally low except for on the patient selection domain, which was moderate in most studies. 5751 patients met harmonised IPD-level inclusion criteria. Technical factors such as number of blood cultures done, timing of blood cultures relative to blood sampling, and patient factors such as inpatient setting and CD4 cell count, explained significant heterogeneity between primary studies. The predicted probability of M tuberculosis BSI in hospital inpatients with HIV-associated tuberculosis, WHO danger signs, and a CD4 count of 76 cells per μL (the median for the cohort) was 45% (95% CI 38–52). The diagnostic yield of sputum in patients with M tuberculosis BSI was 77% (95% CI 63–87), increasing to 89% (80–94) when combined with urine LAM testing. Presence of M tuberculosis BSI compared with its absence in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis increased risk of death before 30 days (adjusted hazard ratio 2·48, 95% CI 2·05–3·08) but not after 30 days (1·25, 0·84–2·49). In a propensity-score matched cohort of participants with HIV-associated tuberculosis (n=630), mortality increased in patients with M tuberculosis BSI who had a delay in anti-tuberculosis treatment of longer than 4 days compared with those who had no delay (odds ratio 3·15, 95% CI 1·16–8·84).
Interpretation
In critically ill adults with HIV-tuberculosis, M tuberculosis BSI is a frequent manifestation of tuberculosis and predicts mortality within 30 days. Improved diagnostic yield in patients with M tuberculosis BSI could be achieved through combined use of sputum Xpert and urine LAM. Anti-tuberculosis treatment delay might increase the risk of mortality in these patients.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Voluntary individual quarantine and voluntary active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies for emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Given the impact of quarantine on resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions individual quarantine can more effectively control COVID-19 than active monitoring. As an epidemic grows, it is also important to consider when these interventions are no longer feasible and broader mitigation measures must be implemented.
Methods
To estimate the comparative efficacy of individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts to control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we fit a stochastic branching model to reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Specifically, we fit a model to the incubation period distribution (mean 5·2 days) and to two estimates of the serial interval distribution: a shorter one with a mean serial interval of 4·8 days and a longer one with a mean of 7·5 days. To assess variable resource settings, we considered two feasibility settings: a high-feasibility setting with 90% of contacts traced, a half-day average delay in tracing and symptom recognition, and 90% effective isolation; and a low-feasibility setting with 50% of contacts traced, a 2-day average delay, and 50% effective isolation.
Findings
Model fitting by sequential Monte Carlo resulted in a mean time of infectiousness onset before symptom onset of 0·77 days (95% CI −1·98 to 0·29) for the shorter serial interval, and for the longer serial interval it resulted in a mean time of infectiousness onset after symptom onset of 0·51 days (95% CI −0·77 to 1·50). Individual quarantine in high-feasibility settings, where at least 75% of infected contacts are individually quarantined, contains an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 with a short serial interval (4·8 days) 84% of the time. However, in settings where the outbreak continues to grow (eg, low-feasibility settings), so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine, particularly uninfected contacts (who never develop symptoms). When resources are prioritised for scalable interventions such as physical distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to mitigation efforts. Even under the shorter serial interval, if physical distancing reduces the reproductive number to 1·25, active monitoring of 50% of contacts can result in overall outbreak control (ie, effective reproductive number <1).
Interpretation
Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost–benefit comparisons of individual quarantine versus active monitoring of contacts. To the extent that these interventions can be implemented, they can help mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Suboptimal diagnostics for pulmonary tuberculosis drive the use of the so-called trial of antibiotics, a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics without activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is given to patients who are mycobacteriology negative but symptomatic, with the aim of distinguishing pulmonary tuberculosis from bacterial lower respiratory tract infection. The underlying assumption—that patients with lower respiratory tract infection will improve, whereas those with pulmonary tuberculosis will not—has an unclear evidence base for such a widely used intervention (at least 26·5 million courses are prescribed per year). We aimed to collate available evidence on the diagnostic performance of the trial of antibiotics.
Methods
In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and Global Health databases for studies published up to March 15, 2019, that investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the trial of antibiotics against mycobacteriology tests in adults (≥15 years) with tuberculosis symptoms. We used the QUADAS-2 tool to assess the risk of bias. We estimated pooled values for sensitivity and specificity of trial of antibiotics (as the index text) versus mycobacteriology tests (as the reference standard) using random-effects bivariate modelling, and we used the I2 statistic to assess heterogeneity between studies contributing to these estimates. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017083915.
Findings
Of the 9410 articles identified by our search, eight studies were eligible for inclusion. The studies were from seven countries in Africa, South America, and Asia, and involved 2786 participants. Six studies used mycobacterial culture as the reference standard, and six used penicillins for the trial of antibiotics. The treatment duration, number of antimicrobial courses, and definition of what constituted response to treatment varied substantially between studies. The pooled sensitivity (67%, 95% CI 42–85) and specificity (73%, 58–85) of the trial of antibiotics versus mycobacteriology tests were below internationally defined minimum performance profiles for tuberculosis diagnostics and had substantial heterogeneity (I2 was 96% for sensitivity and 99% for specificity). Each included study failed on one or more domain of the QUADAS-2 tool.
Interpretation
Current policy and practice regarding the trial of antibiotics appear inappropriate, given the weak evidence base, poor diagnostic performance, potential contribution to the global antimicrobial resistance crisis, and adverse individual and public health consequences from the misclassification of tuberculosis status. Antibiotic strategies during tuberculosis investigations should instead optimise clinical outcomes, ideally guided by clinical trials in both inpatient and outpatient groups.

Background
On Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province. The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020.
Methods
In this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done.
Findings
The patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020.
Interpretation
We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Use of an interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assay or tuberculin skin test for detection and management of latent tuberculosis infection is controversial. For both types of test, we assessed their predictive value for the progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease, the targeting value of preventive treatment, and the necessity of dual testing.
Methods
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, with no start date or language restrictions, on Oct 18, 2019, using the keywords (“latent tuberculosis” OR “latent tuberculosis infection” OR “LTBI”) AND (“interferon gamma release assays” OR “Interferon-gamma Release Test” OR “IGRA” OR “QuantiFERON®-TB in tube” OR “QFT” OR “T-SPOT.TB”) AND (“tuberculin skin test” OR “tuberculin test” OR “Mantoux test” OR “TST”). We included articles that used a cohort study design; included information that individuals with latent tuberculosis infection detected by IFN-γ release assay, tuberculin skin test, or both, progressed to active tuberculosis; reported information about treatment; and were limited to high-risk populations. We excluded studies that included patients with active or suspected tuberculosis at baseline, evaluated a non-commercial IFN-γ release assay, and had follow-up of less than 1 year. We extracted study details (study design, population investigated, tests used, follow-up period) and the number of individuals observed at baseline, who progressed to active tuberculosis, and who were treated. We then calculated the pooled risk ratio (RR) for disease progression, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of IFN-γ release assay versus tuberculin skin test.
Findings
We identified 1823 potentially eligible studies after exclusion of duplicates, of which 256 were eligible for full-text screening. From this screening, 40 studies (50 592 individuals in 41 cohorts) were identified as eligible and included in our meta-analysis. Pooled RR for the rate of disease progression in untreated individuals who were positive by IFN-γ release assay versus those were negative was 9·35 (95% CI 6·48–13·49) compared with 4·24 (3·30–5·46) for tuberculin skin test. Pooled PPV for IFN-γ release assay was 4·5% (95% CI 3·3–5·8) compared with 2·3% (1·5–3·1) for tuberculin skin test. Pooled NPV for IFN-γ release assay was 99·7% (99·5–99·8) compared with 99·3% (99·0–99·5) for tuberculin skin test. Pooled RR for rates of disease progression in individuals positive by IFN-γ release assay who were untreated versus those who were treated was 3·09 (95% CI 2·08–4·60) compared with 1·11 (0·69–1·79) for the same populations who were positive by tuberculin skin test. Pooled proportion of disease progression for individuals who were positive by IFN-γ release assay and tuberculin skin test was 6·1 (95% CI 2·3–11·5). Pooled RR for rates of disease progression in individuals who were positive by IFN-γ release assay and tuberculin skin test who were untreated versus those who were treated was 7·84 (95% CI 4·44–13·83).
Interpretation
IFN-γ release assays have a better predictive ability than tuberculin skin tests. Individuals who are positive by IFN-γ release assay might benefit from preventive treatment, but those who are positive by tuberculin skin test probably will not. Dual testing might improve detection, but further confirmation is needed.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a respiratory disease with a case fatality rate of up to 35%. Given its potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of efficacious drugs or vaccines, MERS is one of the WHO priority diseases warranting urgent research and development of countermeasures. We aimed to assess safety and tolerability of an anti-MERS-CoV modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine candidate that expresses the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein, MVA-MERS-S, in healthy adults.
Methods
This open-label, phase 1 trial was done at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). Participants were healthy men and women aged 18–55 years with no clinically significant health problems as determined during medical history and physical examination, a body-mass index of 18·5–30·0 kg/m2 and weight of more than 50 kg at screening, and a negative pregnancy test for women. A key exclusion criterion was a previous MVA vaccination. For the prime immunisation, participants received doses of 1 × 107 plaque-forming unit (PFU; low-dose group) or 1 × 108 PFU (high-dose group) MVA-MERS-S intramuscularly. A second identical dose was administered intramuscularly as a booster immunisation 28 days after first injection. As a control group for immunogenicity analyses, blood samples were drawn at identical study timepoints from six healthy adults, who did not receive any injections. The primary objectives of the study were safety and tolerability of the two dosage levels and reactogenicity after administration. Immunogenicity was assessed as a secondary endpoint by ELISA and neutralisation tests. T-cell immunity was evaluated by interferon-γ-linked enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot assay. All participants who were vaccinated at least once were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity was analysed in the participants who completed 6 months of follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03615911, and EudraCT, 2014-003195-23
Findings
From Dec 17, 2017, to June 5, 2018, 26 participants (14 in the low-dose group and 12 in the high-dose group) were enrolled and received the first dose of the vaccine according to their group allocation. Of these, 23 participants (12 in the low-dose group and 11 in the high-dose group) received a second dose of MVA-MERS-S according to their group allocation after a 28-day interval and completed follow-up. Homologous prime–boost immunisation with MVA-MERS-S revealed a benign safety profile with only transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity. Participants had no severe or serious adverse events. 67 vaccine-related adverse events were reported in ten (71%) of 14 participants in the low-dose group, and 111 were reported in ten (83%) of 12 participants in the high-dose group. Solicited local reactions were the most common adverse events: pain was observed in 17 (65%; seven in the low-dose group vs ten in the high-dose group) participants, swelling in ten (38%; two vs eight) participants, and induration in ten (38%; one vs nine) participants. Headaches (observed in seven participants in the low-dose group vs nine in the high-dose group) and fatigue or malaise (ten vs seven participants) were the most common solicited systemic adverse events. All adverse events resolved swiftly (within 1–3 days) and without sequelae. Following booster immunisation, nine (75%) of 12 participants in the low-dose group and 11 (100%) participants in the high-dose group showed seroconversion using a MERS-CoV S1 ELISA at any timepoint during the study. Binding antibody titres correlated with MERS-CoV-specific neutralising antibodies (Spearman's correlation r=0·86 [95% CI 0·6960–0·9427], p=0·0001). MERS-CoV spike-specific T-cell responses were detected in ten (83%) of 12 immunised participants in the low-dose group and ten (91%) of 11 immunised participants in the high-dose group.
Interpretation
Vaccination with MVA-MERS-S had a favourable safety profile without serious or severe adverse events. Homologous prime–boost immunisation induced humoral and cell-mediated responses against MERS-CoV. A dose–effect relationship was demonstrated for reactogenicity, but not for vaccine-induced immune responses. The data presented here support further clinical testing of MVA-MERS-S in larger cohorts to advance MERS vaccine development.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Indirect financial costs and barriers to health-care access might contribute to leprosy treatment non-adherence. We estimated the association of the Brazilian conditional cash transfer programme, the Programa Bolsa Família (PBF), on leprosy treatment adherence and cure in patients in Brazil.
Methods
In this quasi-experimental study, we linked baseline demographic and socioeconomic information for individuals who entered the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort between Jan 1, 2007, and Dec 31, 2014, with the PBF payroll database and the Information System for Notifiable Diseases, which includes nationwide leprosy registries. Individuals were eligible for inclusion if they had a household member older than 15 years and had not received PBF aid or been diagnosed with leprosy before entering the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort; they were excluded if they were partial receivers of PBF benefits, had missing data, or had a monthly per-capita income greater than BRL200 (US$50). Individuals who were PBF beneficiaries before leprosy diagnosis were matched to those who were not beneficiaries through propensity-score matching (1:1) with replacement on the basis of baseline covariates, including sex, age, race or ethnicity, education, work, income, place of residence, and household characteristics. We used logistic regression to assess the average treatment effect on the treated of receipt of PBF benefits on leprosy treatment adherence (six or more multidrug therapy doses for paucibacillary cases or 12 or more doses for multibacillary cases) and cure in individuals of all ages. We stratified our analysis according to operational disease classification (paucibacillary or multibacillary). We also did a subgroup analysis of paediatric leprosy restricted to children aged up to 15 years.
Findings
We included 11 456 new leprosy cases, of whom 8750 (76·3%) had received PBF before diagnosis and 2706 (23·6%) had not. Overall, 9508 (83·0%) patients adhered to treatment and 10 077 (88·0%) were cured. After propensity score matching, receiving PBF before diagnosis was associated with adherence to treatment (OR 1·22, 95% CI 1·01–1·48) and cure (1·26, 1·01–1·58). PBF receipt did not significantly improve treatment adherence (1·37, 0·98–1·91) or cure (1·12, 0·75–1·67) in patients with paucibacillary leprosy. For patients with multibacillary disease, PBF beneficiaries had better treatment adherence (1·37, 1·08–1·74) and cure (1·43, 1·09–1·90) than non-beneficiaries. In the propensity score-matched analysis in 2654 children younger than 15 years with leprosy, PBF exposure was not associated with leprosy treatment adherence (1·55, 0·89–2·68) or cure (1·57, 0·83–2·97).
Interpretation
Our results suggest that being a beneficiary of the PBF, which facilitates cash transfers and improved access to health care, is associated with greater leprosy multidrug therapy adherence and cure in multibacillary cases. These results are especially relevant for patients with multibacillary disease, who are treated for a longer period and have lower cure rates than those with paucibacillary disease.

abstract = "Summary
Background
WHO recommends that men who have sex with men (MSM) receive gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing, but many evidence-based preventive services are unaffordable. The pay-it-forward strategy offers an individual a gift (eg, a test for sexually transmitted diseases) and then asks whether they would like to give a gift (eg, a future test) to another person. This study examined the effectiveness of a pay-it-forward programme to increase gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing among MSM in China.
Methods
We did a randomised controlled superiority trial at three HIV testing sites run by MSM community-based organisations in Guangzhou and Beijing, China. We included MSM aged 16 years or older who were seeking HIV testing and met indications for gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing. Restricted randomisation was done using computer-generated permuted blocks. 30 groups were randomised into three arms (1:1:1): a pay-it-forward arm in which men were offered free gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing and then asked whether they would like to donate for testing of prospective participants, a pay-what-you-want arm in which men were offered free testing and given the option to pay any desired amount for the test, and a standard-of-care arm in which testing was offered at ¥150 (US$22). There was no masking to arm assignment. The primary outcome was gonorrhoea and chlamydia test uptake ascertained by administrative records. We used generalised estimating equations to estimate intervention effects with one-sided 95% CIs and a prespecified superiority margin of 20%. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03741725.
Findings
Between Dec 8, 2018, and Jan 19, 2019, 301 men were recruited and included in the analysis. 101 were randomly assigned to the pay-it-forward group, 100 to the pay-what-you-want group, and 100 to the standard-of-care group. Test uptake for gonorrhoea and chlamydia was 56% (57 of 101 participants) in the pay-it-forward arm, 46% (46 of 100 participants) in the pay-what-you-want arm, and 18% (18 of 100 participants) in the standard-of-care arm. The estimated difference in test uptake between the pay-it-forward and standard-of-care group was 38·4% (95% CI lower bound 28·4%). Among men in the pay-it-forward arm, 54 of 57 (95%) chose to donate to support testing for others.
Interpretation
The pay-it-forward strategy can increase gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing uptake among Chinese MSM and could be a useful tool for scaling up preventive services that carry a mandatory fee.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The incidence of infective endocarditis related to injection drug use is increasing. On the basis of clinical practice and epidemiological and in-vitro data, we postulated that exposure to controlled-release hydromorphone is associated with an increased risk of infective endocarditis among people who inject drugs.
Methods
We used linked health administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, to assemble a retrospective cohort of adults (aged 18–55 years) who inject drugs for the period of April 1, 2006, to Sept 30, 2015. Cases of infective endocarditis among this cohort were identified using International Classification of Diseases 10 codes. We estimated exposure to hydromorphone and risk of infective endocarditis among this cohort in two ways. First, in a population-level analysis, we identified patients living in regions with high (≥25%) and low (≤15%) hydromorphone prescription rates and, after matching 1:1 on various baseline characteristics, compared their frequency of infective endocarditis. Second, in a patient-level analysis including only those with prescription drug data, we identified those who had filled prescriptions (ie, received the drug from the pharmacy) for controlled-release or immediate-release hydromorphone and, after matching 1:1 on various baseline characteristics, compared their frequency of infective endocarditis with that of patients who had filled prescriptions for other opioids.
Results
Between April 1, 2006, and Sept 30, 2015, 60 529 patients had evidence of injection drug use, 733 (1·2%, 95% CI 1·1–1·3) of whom had infective endocarditis. In the population-level analysis of 32 576 matched patients, we identified 254 (1·6%) admissions with infective endocarditis in regions with high hydromorphone use and 113 (0·7%) admissions in regions with low use (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2·2, 95% CI 1·8–2·8, p<0·0001). In the patient-level analysis of 3884 matched patients, the frequency of infective endocarditis was higher among patients who filled prescriptions for hydromorphone than among those who filled prescriptions for non-hydromorphone opioids (2·8% [109 patients] vs 1·1% [41 patients]; adjusted OR 2·5, 95% CI 1·8–3·7, p<0·0001). This significant association was seen for controlled-release hydromorphone (3·9% [73 of 1895 patients] vs 1·1% [20 of 1895]; adjusted OR 3·3, 95% CI 2·1–5·6, p<0·0001), but not for immediate-release hydromorphone (1·8% [36 of 1989] vs 1·1% [21 of 1989]; 1·7, 0·9–3·6, p=0·072.
Interpretation
Among people who inject drugs, the risk of infective endocarditis is significantly higher for those exposed to controlled-release hydromorphone than to other opioids. This association might be mediated by the controlled-release mechanism and should be the subject of further investigation.

abstract = "Summary
Clinical research is necessary for an effective response to an emerging infectious disease outbreak. However, research efforts are often hastily organised and done using various research tools, with the result that pooling data across studies is challenging. In response to the needs of the rapidly evolving COVID-19 outbreak, the Clinical Characterisation and Management Working Group of the WHO Research and Development Blueprint programme, the International Forum for Acute Care Trialists, and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium have developed a minimum set of common outcome measures for studies of COVID-19. This set includes three elements: a measure of viral burden (quantitative PCR or cycle threshold), a measure of patient survival (mortality at hospital discharge or at 60 days), and a measure of patient progression through the health-care system by use of the WHO Clinical Progression Scale, which reflects patient trajectory and resource use over the course of clinical illness. We urge investigators to include these key data elements in ongoing and future studies to expedite the pooling of data during this immediate threat, and to hone a tool for future needs."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection continue to rise in the Arabian Peninsula 7 years after it was first described in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV poses a significant risk to public health security because of an absence of currently available effective countermeasures. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the full-length spike surface glycoprotein, ChAdOx1 MERS, in humans.
Methods
This dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, phase 1 trial was done at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (Oxford, UK) and included healthy people aged 18–50 years with negative pre-vaccination tests for HIV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies (and a negative urinary pregnancy test for women). Participants received a single intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 MERS at three different doses: the low-dose group received 5 × 109 viral particles, the intermediate-dose group received 2·5 × 1010 viral particles, and the high-dose group received 5 × 1010 viral particles. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of ChAdOx1 MERS, measured by the occurrence of solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events after vaccination. The secondary objective was to assess the cellular and humoral immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 MERS, measured by interferon-γ-linked enzyme-linked immunospot, ELISA, and virus neutralising assays after vaccination. Participants were followed up for up to 12 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03399578.
Findings
Between March 14 and Aug 15, 2018, 24 participants were enrolled: six were assigned to the low-dose group, nine to the intermediate-dose group, and nine to the high-dose group. All participants were available for follow-up at 6 months, but five (one in the low-dose group, one in the intermediate-dose group, and three in the high-dose group) were lost to follow-up at 12 months. A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS was safe at doses up to 5 × 1010 viral particles with no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported by 12 months. One serious adverse event reported was deemed to be not related to ChAdOx1 MERS. 92 (74% [95% CI 66–81]) of 124 solicited adverse events were mild, 31 (25% [18–33]) were moderate, and all were self-limiting. Unsolicited adverse events in the 28 days following vaccination considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to ChAdOx1 MERS were predominantly mild in nature and resolved within the follow-up period of 12 months. The proportion of moderate and severe adverse events was significantly higher in the high-dose group than in the intermediate-dose group (relative risk 5·83 [95% CI 2·11–17·42], p<0·0001) Laboratory adverse events considered to be at least possibly related to the study intervention were self-limiting and predominantly mild in severity. A significant increase from baseline in T-cell (p<0·003) and IgG (p<0·0001) responses to the MERS-CoV spike antigen was observed at all doses. Neutralising antibodies against live MERS-CoV were observed in four (44% [95% CI 19–73]) of nine participants in the high-dose group 28 days after vaccination, and 19 (79% [58–93]) of 24 participants had antibodies capable of neutralisation in a pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay.
Interpretation
ChAdOx1 MERS was safe and well tolerated at all tested doses. A single dose was able to elicit both humoral and cellular responses against MERS-CoV. The results of this first-in-human clinical trial support clinical development progression into field phase 1b and 2 trials.

Background
Passively collected malaria case data are the foundation for public health decision making. However, because of population-level immunity, infections might not always be sufficiently symptomatic to prompt individuals to seek care. Understanding the proportion of all Plasmodium spp infections expected to be detected by the health system becomes particularly paramount in elimination settings. The aim of this study was to determine the association between the proportion of infections detected and transmission intensity for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in several global endemic settings.
Methods
The proportion of infections detected in routine malaria data, P(Detect), was derived from paired household cross-sectional survey and routinely collected malaria data within health facilities. P(Detect) was estimated using a Bayesian model in 431 clusters spanning the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The association between P(Detect) and malaria prevalence was assessed using log-linear regression models. Changes in P(Detect) over time were evaluated using data from 13 timepoints over 2 years from The Gambia.
Findings
The median estimated P(Detect) across all clusters was 12·5% (IQR 5·3–25·0) for P falciparum and 10·1% (5·0–18·3) for P vivax and decreased as the estimated log-PCR community prevalence increased (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for P falciparum 0·63, 95% CI 0·57–0·69; adjusted OR for P vivax 0·52, 0·47–0·57). Factors associated with increasing P(Detect) included smaller catchment population size, high transmission season, improved care-seeking behaviour by infected individuals, and recent increases (within the previous year) in transmission intensity.
Interpretation
The proportion of all infections detected within health systems increases once transmission intensity is sufficiently low. The likely explanation for P falciparum is that reduced exposure to infection leads to lower levels of protective immunity in the population, increasing the likelihood that infected individuals will become symptomatic and seek care. These factors might also be true for P vivax but a better understanding of the transmission biology is needed to attribute likely reasons for the observed trend. In low transmission and pre-elimination settings, enhancing access to care and improvements in care-seeking behaviour of infected individuals will lead to an increased proportion of infections detected in the community and might contribute to accelerating the interruption of transmission.

abstract = "Summary
Background
During the large 2013–16 Ebola virus outbreak caused by the Zaire Ebola virus, about 20% of cases were reported in children. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to evaluate an Ebola vaccine in children younger than 6 years. We aimed to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a monovalent, recombinant, chimpanzee adenovirus type-3 vectored Zaire Ebola glycoprotein vaccine (ChAd3-EBO-Z) in a paediatric population.
Methods
This phase 2, randomised, observer-blind, controlled trial was done in a vaccine centre in Mali and a university hospital centre in Senegal. Healthy children were randomly assigned through a web-based system (1:1; stratified by age group, gender, and centre) to receive ChAd3-EBO-Z (day 0) and meningococcal serogroups A,C,W-135,Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT; month 6), or MenACWY-TT (day 0) and ChAd3-EBO-Z (month 6). The study was observer-blind from study start until interim day 30 analysis and became single-blind as of interim analysis. Primary outcomes assessed were serious adverse events (up to study end, month 12), solicited local or general adverse events (7 days post-vaccination), unsolicited adverse events (30 days post-vaccination), haematological or biochemical abnormalities, and clinical symptoms of thrombocytopenia (day 0–6). As secondary endpoints, we evaluated anti-glycoprotein Zaire Ebola virus antibody titres (ELISA) pre-vaccination and 30 days post-vaccination. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02548078.
Findings
From Nov 11, 2015, to May 9, 2016, of 776 children screened for eligibility, 600 were randomly assigned (200 [33%] in each age strata: 1–5, 6–12, 13–17 years), 300 (50%) to the ChAd3-EBO-Z/MenACWY-TT group and 300 (50%) to the MenACWY-TT/ChAd3-EBO-Z group; all were included in the total vaccinated cohort. Post-day 0 vaccination, the most common solicited injection site symptom was pain (127 [42%] of 300 in the ChAd3-EBO-Z/MenACWY-TT group vs 60 [20%] of 300 in the MenACWY-TT/ChAd3-EBO-Z group); the most common solicited general adverse event was fever (95 [32%] of 300 in the ChAd3-EBO-Z/MenACWY-TT group vs 28 [9%] of 300 in the MenACWY-TT/ChAd3-EBO-Z group). Unsolicited adverse events post-day 0 vaccination were reported by 41 (14%) of 300 participants in the ChAd3-EBO-Z/MenACWY-TT group and 24 (8%) of 300 MenACWY-TT/ChAd3-EBO-Z recipients. Serious adverse events were reported for two (1%) of 300 children in each group; none were considered vaccination related. No clinical symptoms of thrombocytopenia were reported. At day 30, anti-glycoprotein Ebola virus antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMC) in the ChAd3-EBO-Z/MenACWY-TT group were 1564 (95% CI 1340–1826) for those aged 13–17 years, 1395 (1175–1655) for 6–12 years, and 2406 (1942–2979) for 1–5 years. Anti-glycoprotein Ebola virus IgG antibody responses persisted up to 12 months post-vaccination, with a GMC of 716 (95% CI 619–828) for those aged 13–17 years, 752 (645–876) for 6–12 years, and 1424 (1119–1814) for 1–5 years.
Interpretation
ChAd3-EBO-Z was immunogenic and well tolerated in children aged 1–17 years. This study provides the first ChAd3-EBO-Z data in a paediatric population. Further development should focus on multivalent approaches including Sudan and Marburg strains, and heterologous prime-boost strategies, for instance using modified vaccinia Ankara-based vaccine to boost the immune response.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.
Methods
We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.
Findings
Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37–75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4·1–7·0). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope −0·15, 95% CI −0·19 to −0·11; R2=0·71). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ρ=0·48, 95% CI 0·074–0·75; p=0·020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2>0·9). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.
Interpretation
Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95 333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.
Methods
We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.
Findings
We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.
Interpretation
Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.

abstract = "Summary
Background
As of June 8, 2020, the global reported number of COVID-19 cases had reached more than 7 million with over 400 000 deaths. The household transmissibility of the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains unclear. We aimed to estimate the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 among household and non-household close contacts in Guangzhou, China, using a statistical transmission model.
Methods
In this retrospective cohort study, we used a comprehensive contact tracing dataset from the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate the secondary attack rate of COVID-19 (defined as the probability that an infected individual will transmit the disease to a susceptible individual) among household and non-household contacts, using a statistical transmission model. We considered two alternative definitions of household contacts in the analysis: individuals who were either family members or close relatives, such as parents and parents-in-law, regardless of residential address, and individuals living at the same address regardless of relationship. We assessed the demographic determinants of transmissibility and the infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period.
Findings
Between Jan 7, 2020, and Feb 18, 2020, we traced 195 unrelated close contact groups (215 primary cases, 134 secondary or tertiary cases, and 1964 uninfected close contacts). By identifying households from these groups, assuming a mean incubation period of 5 days, a maximum infectious period of 13 days, and no case isolation, the estimated secondary attack rate among household contacts was 12·4% (95% CI 9·8–15·4) when household contacts were defined on the basis of close relatives and 17·1% (13·3–21·8) when household contacts were defined on the basis of residential address. Compared with the oldest age group (≥60 years), the risk of household infection was lower in the youngest age group (<20 years; odds ratio [OR] 0·23 [95% CI 0·11–0·46]) and among adults aged 20–59 years (OR 0·64 [95% CI 0·43–0·97]). Our results suggest greater infectivity during the incubation period than during the symptomatic period, although differences were not statistically significant (OR 0·61 [95% CI 0·27–1·38]). The estimated local reproductive number (R) based on observed contact frequencies of primary cases was 0·5 (95% CI 0·41–0·62) in Guangzhou. The projected local R, had there been no isolation of cases or quarantine of their contacts, was 0·6 (95% CI 0·49–0·74) when household was defined on the basis of close relatives.
Interpretation
SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Older individuals (aged ≥60 years) are the most susceptible to household transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to case finding and isolation, timely tracing and quarantine of close contacts should be implemented to prevent onward transmission during the viral incubation period.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Norovirus and rotavirus are the dominant pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis in children. To quantify their natural disease burden and transmission, we prospectively monitored households in an endemic setting in the Netherlands, a high-income country that does not have a rotavirus vaccination programme.
Methods
We did a prospective, household survey-based cohort study in the Netherlands. Randomly selected households from the Dutch Population Register were invited to participate if they had at least three household members, including a child younger than 2 years. A member of each household was asked to record the gastrointestinal symptoms of all household members every day for 10 consecutie weeks using an interactive smartphone application. Real-time detection of acute gastroenteritis onset on the basis of entered symptoms activated requests for the case and one other household member to complete disease questionnaires and provide stool samples. Stool samples were analysed by real-time PCR for norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus 40/41, and astrovirus. We calculated the per-pathogen proportion of households with at least one secondary acute gastroenteritis episode (epidemiologically but not microbiologically linked), the probability of a secondary episode in household members at risk (secondary attack rate), and the microbiologically confirmed symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission rates.
Findings
During two seasons (January to March) in 2016 and 2017, 30 660 households were invited to participate, of which 604 households including 2298 individuals were enrolled. 697 acute gastroenteritis episodes were detected in 358 households, with samples obtained from 609 (87%) of 697 episodes. Norovirus (150 [25%] of 609 cases) and rotavirus (91 [15%] cases) were most frequently detected. Astrovirus was detected in 50 (8%) samples and adenovirus 40/41 in 24 (4%) samples. Overall disease severity was higher in patients with rotavirus-positive acute gastroenteritis than those with norovirus-positive acute gastroenteritis. Norovirus led to higher disease burden in adults than did rotavirus. Following an index case, a secondary acute gastroenteritis episode occurred in 34 (35%) of 96 households for norovirus and 26 (46%) of 56 households for rotavirus. Secondary attack rates were 15% (37 of 244 participants) for norovirus and 28% (33 of 120 participants) for rotavirus and asymptomatic transmission rates were 51% (52 of 102 household members) for norovirus and 22% (12 of 55 household members) for rotavirus. The microbiologically confirmed symptomatic transmission rate for norovirus was 10% (25 of 254 household members) and 18% for rotavirus (21 of 119 household members).
Interpretation
In households with young family members in a setting without rotavirus vaccination, norovirus is the dominant acute gastroenteritis pathogen, but rotavirus is associated with more severe disease. There was substantial within-household transmission, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. The study provides key quantities on transmission, which can inform vaccine policy decisions and act as a baseline for impact evaluations in high-income settings.

The currently accepted assumption that most surgical site infections (SSIs) occurring after elective surgery under standard methods of antisepsis are due to an intraoperative contamination event, remains unproven. We examined the available evidence in which microbial cultures of surgical wounds were taken at the conclusion of an operation and determined that such studies provide more evidence to refute that an SSI is due to intraoperative contamination than support it. We propose that alternative mechanisms of SSI development should be considered, such as when a sterile postoperative wound becomes infected by a pathogen originating from a site remote from the operative wound—eg, from the gums or intestinal tract (ie, the Trojan Horse mechanism). We offer a path forward to reduce SSI rates after elective surgery that includes undertaking genomic-based microbial tracking from the built environment (ie, the operating room and hospital bed), to the patient's own microbiome, and then to the surgical site. Finally, we posit that only by generating this dynamic microbial map can the true pathogenesis of SSIs be understood enough to inform novel preventive strategies against infection following elective surgery in the current era of asepsis."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Many immigrants are susceptible to varicella on arrival to Canada because of different transmission dynamics in their countries of origin and scarcity of vaccination. Universal childhood vaccination programmes decrease varicella incidence rates through herd immunity, but the accumulating number of susceptible adult immigrants could remain at risk for severe varicella. Our aim was to describe the epidemiology of varicella among immigrants and non-immigrants before and after childhood varicella vaccination.
Methods
We did a population-based, retrospective cohort study of all varicella cases in Quebec, Canada, diagnosed between 1996 and 2014 in administrative health databases linked to immigration data. Cases of varicella met diagnostic codes in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision Canadian modifications. Cases with a co-occurring zoster diagnostic code and immigrants from Australia, New Zealand, the USA, and western European countries were excluded. Vaccination periods included pre-vaccination (1996–98), private vaccination (1999–2005), and public vaccination (2006–14). Incidence rate and comparative rate ratios were estimated using census data.
Findings
A total of 231 339 varicella cases diagnosed between Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 31, 2014, were linked to 1 115 696 immigrants who arrived between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2014. 1444 herpes zoster cases and 1276 immigrants from Australia, western Europe, New Zealand, and the USA were excluded. Among 228 619 varicella cases, 13 315 (5·8%) occurred in immigrants. In pre-vaccination versus public vaccination periods, varicella incidence declined in immigrants by 87% (95% CI 86·6–87·9; 324·3 cases per 100 000 person-years to 40·9 cases per 100 000 person-years) and in non-immigrants by 93% (92·4–92·7; 484 cases per 100 000 person-years to 36 cases per 100 000 person-years). Mean age at diagnosis increased in both groups (15·1 vs 19·4 years in immigrants and 8·4 vs 12·0 years in non-immigrants). In the public vaccination period, immigrants younger than 50 years had higher varicella rates than non-immigrants, with relative risk ranging from 1·53 (95% CI 1·37–1·72) to 4·64 (3·90–5·53) with the highest risk in adolescents and young adults, and people from Latin America and the Caribbean (age-specific incidence rate ratio [aIRR]I-NI pre-vaccination 2·19 and post-vaccination aIRRI-NI6·07) and south Asia (aIRRI-NI pre-vaccination 3·41 and aIRRI-NI post-vaccination 4·46) and in childbearing women (15–40 years; IRRI-NI 2·48).
Interpretation
Immigrant adolescents, young adults, and women of childbearing age had higher age-standardised rates of varicella than non-immigrants, with increasing disparities following vaccine introduction. Immigrants younger than 50 years of age would benefit from targeted vaccination upon arrival to host countries.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The Butantan Institute has manufactured a lyophilised tetravalent live-attenuated dengue vaccine Butantan-DV, which is analogous to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) TV003 admixture. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of Butantan-DV.
Methods
We did a two-step, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at two clinical sites in São Paulo, Brazil. We recruited healthy volunteers aged 18–59 years; pregnant women, individuals with a history of neurological, heart, lung, liver or kidney disease, diabetes, cancer, or autoimmune diseases, and individuals with HIV or hepatitis C were excluded. Step A was designed as a small bridge-study between Butantan-DV and TV003 in DENV-naive participants. In step A, we planned to randomly assign 50 dengue virus (DENV)-naive individuals to receive two doses of Butantan-DV, TV003, or placebo, given 6 months apart. In step B, we planned to randomly assign 250 participants (DENV-naive and DENV-exposed) to receive one dose of Butantan-DV or placebo. Participants were randomly assigned, by computer-generated block randomisation (block sizes of five); participants in step A were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive Butantan-DV, TV003, or placebo and participants in step B were randomly assigned (4:1) to receive Butantan-DV or placebo. Participants and study staff were unaware of treatment allocation. The primary safety outcome was the frequency of solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse reactions within 21 days of the first vaccination, analysed by intention to treat. The primary immunogenicity outcome was seroconversion rates of the DENV-1-4 serotypes measured 91 days after the first vaccination, analysed in the per-protocol population, which included all participants in step A, and all participants included in step B who completed all study visits with serology sample collection. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01696422.
Findings
Between Nov 5, 2013, and Sept 21, 2015, 300 individuals were enrolled and randomly assigned: 155 (52%) DENV-naive participants and 145 (48%) DENV-exposed participants. Of the 155 DENV-naive participants, 97 (63%) received Butantan-DV, 17 (11%) received TV003, and 41 (27%) received placebo. Of the 145 DENV-exposed participants, 113 (78%) received Butantan-DV, three (2%) received TV003, and 29 (20%) received placebo. Butantan-DV and TV003 were both immunogenic, well-tolerated, and no serious adverse reactions were observed. In step A, rash was the most frequent adverse event (16 [845] of 19 participants in the Butantan-DV group and 13 [76%] of 17 participants in the TV003 group). Viraemia was similar between the Butantan-DV and TV003 groups. Of the 85 DENV-naive participants in the Butantan-DV group who attended all visits for sample collection for seroconversion analysis and thus were included in the per-protocol analysis population, 74 (87%) achieved seroconversion to DENV-1, 78 (92%) to DENV-2, 65 (76%) to DENV-3, and 76 (89%) to DENV-4. Of the 101 DENV-exposed participants in the Butantan-DV group who attended all visits for sample collection for seroconversion analysis, 82 (81%) achieved seroconversion to DENV-1, 79 (78%) to DENV-2, 83 (82%) to DENV-3, and 78 (77%) to DENV-4.
Interpretation
Butantan-DV and TV003 were safe and induced robust, balanced neutralising antibody responses against the four DENV serotypes. Efficacy evaluation of the Butantan-DV vaccine is ongoing.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most common problem after surgery. Although several guidelines have indicated the efficacy of antiseptics, such as chlorhexidine-alcohol and povidone-iodine, in reducing SSI rate, the optimal recommendation is still not established. Olanexidine might have higher bactericidal activity than other antiseptic agents. However, no randomised study has evaluated the efficacy and safety of olanexidine over conventional antiseptics. We compared the effect of aqueous olanexidine and aqueous povidone-iodine on the incidence of SSI following clean-contaminated surgery.
Methods
This was a multicentre, prospective, randomised, blinded-endpoint superiority trial for surgical skin antisepsis in clean-contaminated gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary pancreatic surgeries in four Japanese hospitals. Patients aged 20 years or older who underwent elective clean-contaminated wound surgery were randomly assigned in a 1:1 replacement ratio using a computer-generated block randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned to surgical skin antisepsis with an aqueous formulation of 1·5% olanexidine or surgical skin antisepsis with an aqueous formulation of 10% povidone-iodine before surgery. We used olanexidine in a ready-to-use applicator, and povidone-iodine was administered by a brush or by compression using pliers. Both antiseptics were applied from the papilla with a cranial limit and to the upper thigh with a caudal limit. The antiseptics were allowed to dry for 3 min, and then surgery started. Participants, some investigators, and data analysts were masked to treatment allocation. Participant enrolment was done by non-masked investigators. The primary outcome was 30-day SSI assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The surgical wound site of each participant was observed daily. After discharge, participants underwent at least one outpatient visit within 30 days after surgery. This trial is registered with University hospital Medical Information Network, 000031560.
Findings
Between June 10, 2018, and April 18, 2019, 883 patients were assessed for eligibility. 587 patients were eligible and 294 received olanexidine and 293 received aqueous povidone-iodine before surgery. 30-day SSI occurred in 19 (7%) patients in the olanexidine group and 39 patients (13%) patients in the povidone-iodine group (adjusted risk difference −0·069; 90% CI −0·109 to −0·029; adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0·48, 90% CI 0·30 to 0·74; p=0·002). Five patients (2%) in the olanexidine group and five (2%) in the povidone-iodine group developed adverse skin reactions (adjusted RR 0·99, 95% CI 0·29 to 3·40; p=1·00).
Interpretation
Olanexidine significantly reduced the occurrence of overall SSI and superficial incisional SSI compared with aqueous povidone-iodine in clean-contaminated surgery. Our results indicate that olanexidine might have a role to prevent SSI in patients who undergo clean-contaminated surgeries.

abstract = "Summary
Background
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan city, Hubei province, in December, 2019, and has spread throughout China. Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy.
Methods
We collected individual information from official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020. We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset. We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level.
Findings
We collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces. The median age of cases was 44 years (33–56), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged >64 years) as the epidemic progressed. The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4·4 days (95% CI 0·0–14·0) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2·6 days (0·0–9·0) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period for the entire period was estimated at 5·2 days (1·8–12·4) and the mean serial interval at 5·1 days (1·3–11·6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently included a mixture of case importations and local transmission. We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1·08 (95% CI 0·74–1·54) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1·71 (1·32–2·17) in Shandong province. In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, <1) after Jan 30.
Interpretation
Our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms. Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community. Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Puerto Rico began screening blood donations for Zika virus RNA with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) on April 3, 2016, because of an emerging Zika virus outbreak. We followed up positive donors to assess the dynamics of viral and serological markers during the early stages of Zika virus infection and update the estimate of infection incidence in the Puerto Rican population during the outbreak.
Methods
Blood donations from volunteer donors in Puerto Rico were screened for the presence of Zika virus RNA using the cobas Zika NAAT. Positive donations were further tested to confirm infection, estimate viral load, and identify Zika virus-specific IgM antibodies. Individuals with positive blood donations were invited to attend follow-up visits. Donations with confirmed infection (defined as detection of Zika virus RNA or IgM on additional testing of index or follow-up samples) were assessed for stage of infection according to Zika virus RNA detectability in simulated minipools, viral load, and Zika virus IgM status. A three-step process was used to estimate the mean duration of NAAT reactivity of Zika virus in human plasma from individuals identified pre-seroconversion with at least one follow up visit and to update the 2016 incidence estimate of Zika virus infection.
Findings
Between April 3 and Dec 31, 2016, 53 112 blood donations were screened for Zika virus, of which 351 tested positive, 339 had confirmed infections, and 319 could be staged. Compared with IgM-positive index donations (n=110), IgM-negative index donations (n=209) had higher mean viral loads (1·1 × 106 vs 8·3 × 104 international units per mL) and were more likely to be detected in simulated minipools (93% [n=194] vs 26% [n=29]). The proportions of donations with confirmed infections that had viral RNA detected only in individual-donation NAATs (ie, not in simulated minipools) and were IgM positive increased as the epidemic evolved. The estimated mean duration of NAAT detectability in the 140 donors included in the follow-up study was 11·70 days (95% CI 10·06–14·36). Applying this detection period to the observed proportion of donations that were confirmed NAAT positive yielded a Zika virus seasonal incidence estimate of 21·1% (95% CI 18·1–24·1); 768 101 infections in a population of 3 638 773 in 2016.
Interpretation
Characterisation of early Zika virus infection has implications for blood safety because infectivity of blood donations and utility of screening methods likely correlate with viral load and serological stage of infection. Our findings also have implications for diagnostic testing, public health surveillance, and epidemiology, and we estimate that around 21% of the Puerto Rican population was infected during the 2016 outbreak.

The PALM trial in the Democratic Republic of the Congo identified a statistically significant survival benefit for two monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics in the treatment of acute Ebola virus disease; however, substantial gaps remain in improving the outcomes of acute Ebola virus disease and for the survivors. Ongoing efforts are needed to develop more effective strategies, particularly for individuals with severe disease, for prevention and treatment of viral persistence in immune-privileged sites, for optimisation of post-exposure prophylaxis, and to increase therapeutic breadth. As antibody-based approaches are identified and advanced, promising small-molecule antivirals currently in clinical stage development should continue to be evaluated for filovirus diseases, with consideration of their added value in combination approaches with bundled supportive care, their penetration in tissues of interest, the absence of interaction with glycoprotein-based vaccines, and filoviral breadth."

Measles eradication is biologically and technically feasible, but suboptimal immunisation programme performance, insufficient political commitment, overcautious global agencies, and inadequate prioritisation by important donors are hindering progress towards this noble public health goal. These constraints have given rise to a global resurgence in measles cases and preventable deaths, with re-established transmission in countries that have previously eliminated endemic virus transmission. The ethical, economic, and epidemiological reasons for accelerating progress towards eradication are irrefutable. Measles virus also serves as the most sensitive test of universal health coverage. Where health systems are not reaching all susceptible children and communities, the presence of measles cases will expose and proclaim this failure. The global health community should urgently intensify efforts to eradicate measles."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Malaria in pregnancy affects both the mother and the fetus. However, evidence supporting treatment guidelines for uncomplicated (including asymptomatic) falciparum malaria in pregnant women is scarce and assessed in varied ways. We did a systematic literature review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and tolerability of different artemisinin-based or quinine-based treatments for malaria in pregnant women.
Methods
We did a systematic review of interventional or observational cohort studies assessing the efficacy of artemisinin-based or quinine-based treatments in pregnancy. Seven databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Literatura Latino Americana em Ciencias da Saude) and two clinical trial registries (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched. The final search was done on April 26, 2019. Studies that assessed PCR-corrected treatment efficacy in pregnancy with follow-up of 28 days or more were included. Investigators of identified studies were invited to share data from individual patients. The outcomes assessed included PCR-corrected efficacy, PCR-uncorrected efficacy, parasite clearance, fever clearance, gametocyte development, and acute adverse events. One-stage IPD meta-analysis using Cox and logistic regression with random-effects was done to estimate the risk factors associated with PCR-corrected treatment failure, using artemether-lumefantrine as the reference. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018104013.
Findings
Of the 30 studies assessed, 19 were included, representing 92% of patients in the literature (4968 of 5360 episodes). Risk of PCR-corrected treatment failure was higher for the quinine monotherapy (n=244, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 6·11, 95% CI 2·57–14·54, p<0·0001) but lower for artesunate-amodiaquine (n=840, 0·27, 95% 0·14–0·52, p<0·0001), artesunate-mefloquine (n=1028, 0·56, 95% 0·34–0·94, p=0·03), and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (n=872, 0·35, 95% CI 0·18–0·68, p=0·002) than artemether-lumefantrine (n=1278) after adjustment for baseline asexual parasitaemia and parity. The risk of gametocyte carriage on day 7 was higher after quinine-based therapy than artemisinin-based treatment (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 7·38, 95% CI 2·29–23·82).
Interpretation
Efficacy and tolerability of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in pregnant women are better than quinine. The lower efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine compared with other ACTs might require dose optimisation.

The objective of this Personal View is to compare transmissibility, hospitalisation, and mortality rates for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with those of other epidemic coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and pandemic influenza viruses. The basic reproductive rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 2·5 (range 1·8–3·6) compared with 2·0–3·0 for SARS-CoV and the 1918 influenza pandemic, 0·9 for MERS-CoV, and 1·5 for the 2009 influenza pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 causes mild or asymptomatic disease in most cases; however, severe to critical illness occurs in a small proportion of infected individuals, with the highest rate seen in people older than 70 years. The measured case fatality rate varies between countries, probably because of differences in testing strategies. Population-based mortality estimates vary widely across Europe, ranging from zero to high. Numbers from the first affected region in Italy, Lombardy, show an all age mortality rate of 154 per 100 000 population. Differences are most likely due to varying demographic structures, among other factors. However, this new virus has a focal dissemination; therefore, some areas have a higher disease burden and are affected more than others for reasons that are still not understood. Nevertheless, early introduction of strict physical distancing and hygiene measures have proven effective in sharply reducing R0 and associated mortality and could in part explain the geographical differences."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Chikungunya disease, which results in incapacitating arthralgia, has been reported worldwide. We developed a live-attenuated chikungunya virus (CHIKV) vaccine candidate designed for active immunisation of the general population living in endemic regions, as well as serving as a prophylactic measure for travellers to endemic areas.
Methods
This single-blind, randomised, dose-escalation, phase 1 study investigated as primary outcome safety of a live-attenuated CHIKV vaccine candidate. At two professional clinical trial centres in Illinois and Alabama, USA, healthy volunteers aged 18–45 years were randomly assigned (1:1:2) to one of three escalating dose groups (low dose 3·2 × 103 per 0·1 mL; medium dose 3·2 × 104 per 1 mL; or high dose 3·2 × 105 50% tissue culture infection dose per 1 mL) and received a single-shot immunisation on day 0. Individuals in all groups were revaccinated with the highest dose on either month 6 or 12, and followed up for 28 days after revaccination. The safety analysis included all individuals who received the single vaccination; the immunogenicity analysis, which was a secondary outcome, included all individuals who completed the study without major protocol deviations (per-protocol population). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03382964, and is complete.
Findings
The study was done between March 5, 2018, and Jul 23, 2019, with 120 adults recruited and enrolled between March 5 and June 21, 2018, and assigned to receive a low (n=31), medium (n=30), or high (n=59) dose of the vaccine. The vaccine was safe in the high-dose group and well tolerated in the low-dose and medium-dose groups. Four (7%) of 59 vaccinees in the high-dose group reported any local reaction, and 11 (36%), 12 (40%), and 40 (68%) volunteers in the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively, reported any solicited systemic reaction. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. Data up to month 12 after a single immunisation of the 120 healthy volunteers showed a good immunogenicity profile with 100% seroconversion rates achieved at day 14 (103 [100%] of 103) and sustained for 1 year across all dose groups. Mean peak antibody titres at day 28 ranged from 592·6 to 686·9 geometric mean titres from the low-dose to high-dose groups, respectively. A single vaccination was sufficient to induce sustaining high-titre neutralising antibodies, as shown by the absence of an anamnestic response after any revaccination ranging from 94% to 100% of participants. Following revaccination, vaccinees were protected from vaccine-induced viraemia.
Interpretation
A novel live-attenuated CHIKV vaccine was well tolerated and highly immunogenic in an adult population and could be an effective intervention for prophylaxis of chikungunya disease worldwide.

Influenza is an important public health problem and existing vaccines are not completely protective. New vaccines that protect by alternative mechanisms are needed to improve efficacy of influenza vaccines. In 2015, we did a phase 1 trial of an oral influenza vaccine, VXA-A1.1. A favourable safety profile and robust immunogenicity results in that trial supported progression of the vaccine to the current phase 2 trial. The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy of the vaccine in a human influenza challenge model.
Methods
We did a single-site, placebo-controlled and active-controlled, phase 2 study at WCCT Global, Costa Mesa, CA, USA. Eligible individuals had an initial A/California/H1N1 haemagglutination inhibition titre of less than 20 and were aged 18–49 years and in good health. Individuals were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive a single immunisation of either 1011 infectious units of VXA-A1.1 (a monovalent tablet vaccine) orally, a full human dose of quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) via intramuscular injection, or matched placebo. Randomisation was done by computer-generated assignments with block size of five. An unmasked pharmacist provided the appropriate vaccines and placebos to the administrating nurse. Individuals receiving the treatments, investigators, and staff were all masked to group assignments. 90 days after immunisation, individuals without clinically significant symptoms or signs of influenza, an oral temperature of higher than 37·9°C, a positive result for respiratory viral shedding on a Biofire test, and any investigator-assessed contraindications were challenged intranasally with 0·5 mL wild-type A/CA/like(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus. The primary outcomes were safety, which was assessed in all immunised participants through 365 days, and influenza-positive illness after viral challenge, which was assessed in individuals that received the viral challenge and the required number of assessments post viral challenge. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02918006.
Results
Between Aug 31, 2016, and Jan 23, 2017, 374 individuals were assessed for eligibility, of whom 179 were randomly assigned to receive either VXA-A1.1 (n=71 [one individual did not provide a diary card, thus the solicited events were assessed in 70 individuals]), IIV (n=72), or placebo (n=36). Between Dec 2, 2016, and April 26, 2017, 143 eligible individuals (58 in the VXA-A1.1 group, 54 in the IIV group, and 31 in the placebo group) were challenged with influenza virus. VXA-A1.1 was well tolerated with no serious or medically significant adverse events. The most prevalent solicited adverse events for each of the treatment groups after immunisation were headache in the VXA-A1.1 (in five [7%] of 70 participants) and placebo (in seven [19%] of 36 participants) groups and tenderness at injection site in the IIV group (in 19 [26%] of 72 participants) Influenza-positive illness after challenge was detected in 17 (29%) of 58 individuals in the VXA-A1.1 group, 19 (35%) of 54 in the IIV group, and 15 (48%) of 31 in the placebo group.
Interpretation
Orally administered VXA-A1.1 was well tolerated and generated protective immunity against virus shedding, similar to a licensed intramuscular IIV. These results represent a major step forward in developing a safe and effective oral influenza vaccine.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Ten-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have shown important benefits by decreasing invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes. Belgium had an uncommon situation with sequential use of PCV7, PCV13, and PCV10 in the childhood vaccination programmes between 2007 and 2018. We aimed to analyse the changes in incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease and serotype distribution in children throughout this period.
Methods
Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were obtained from patients with invasive pneumococcal disease in Belgium between 2007 and 2018 by the national laboratory-based surveillance. Paediatric invasive pneumococcal disease incidence, serotype distribution, and antimicrobial susceptibility were analysed in periods during which PCV7 (2009–10), PCV13 (2013–14), both PCV13 and PCV10 (2015–16), and PCV10 (2017–18) were used. Incidence rates and trends were compared. Vaccination status was collected. For a subset of serotype 19A isolates, multilocus sequence type was identified.
Findings
After a decrease in PCV7 serotype invasive pneumococcal disease was observed during the PCV7 period, total paediatric invasive pneumococcal disease incidence significantly declined during the PCV13 period (−2·6% monthly, p<0·0001). During the PCV13–PCV10 period (2015–16), the lowest mean in paediatric invasive pneumococcal disease incidence was achieved, but the incidence increased again during the PCV10 period (2017–18), especially in children younger than 2 years (+1·7% monthly; p=0·028). This increase was mainly due to a significant rise in serotype 19A invasive pneumococcal disease incidence in the PCV10 period compared with the PCV13 period (p<0·0001), making serotype 19A the predominant serotype in paediatric invasive pneumococcal disease in the PCV10 period. Genetic diversity within the 2017–18 serotype 19A collection was seen, with two predominant clones, ST416 and ST994, that were infrequently observed before PCV10 introduction. In 2018, among children younger than 5 years with invasive pneumococcal disease who were correctly vaccinated, 37% (37 of 100) had PCV13 serotype invasive pneumococcal disease, all caused by serotype 19A and serotype 3.
Interpretation
After a significant decrease during the PCV13 period, paediatric invasive pneumococcal disease incidence increased again during the PCV10 period. This observation mainly resulted from a significant increase of serotype 19A cases. During the PCV10 period, dominant serotype 19A clones differed from those detected during previous vaccine periods. Whether changes in epidemiology resulted from the vaccine switch or also from natural evolution remains to be further elucidated.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Evidence from numerous randomised clinical trials suggest that shorter-term antimicrobial therapy is as effective as—and has other advantages over—longer-term antimicrobial regimens at achieving symptomatic cure for acute uncomplicated cystitis. Nevertheless, not all shorter regimens are adopted in clinical guidelines. This study was done to reappraise the treatment duration of each antibiotic in current guidelines for acute uncomplicated cystitis to investigate whether the regimen lengths of guideline approved antibiotics could be reduced.
Methods
We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant publications from inception of the databases until Dec 31, 2019. Only randomised clinical trials of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis that assessed antibiotic therapy and reported clinical or microbial response outcome values were included. A network meta-analysis was done and the quality of evidence of all of the included studies was rated. Clinical response was the primary outcome, defined as the complete disappearance of all baseline symptoms at the test-of-cure visit. Bayesian hierarchical random-effects model for dichotomous outcomes was used to compare the efficacy of each antibiotic treatment regimen directly and indirectly. This systematic review is registered in PROSPERO, CRD42018093529.
Findings
Overall, 61 randomised clinical trials—which included 20 780 patients—were assessed in our systematic review. For the third-generation and fourth-generation fluoroquinolones, a 3-day regimen had similar effect to a single-dose regimen for clinical response (risk ratio [RR] 0·994 [95% credible interval 0·939–1·052] vs 1·024 [0·974–1·083]), with moderate quality of evidence. For pivmecillinam, 5-day and 7-day regimens were similar to a 3-day regimen for clinical response, with moderate quality of evidence (RR 1·041 [0·910–1·193] for the 5-day regimen and 1·095 [0·999–1·203] for the 7-day regimen). Meanwhile, for third-generation cephalosporins and amoxicillin and clavulanate, there was no difference between single-dose and 3-day regimens, but quality of evidence supporting this conclusion was low. For second-generation quinolones and co-trimoxazole, single-dose regimen was less effective than 3-day regimen in clinical response, with moderate quality of evidence.
Interpretation
Treatment duration of the third-generation and fourth-generation quinolones and pivmecillinam could be shorter than the currently recommended regimens for acute uncomplicated cystitis. For other antibiotics, shorter duration of regimens could be considered, but further research is needed because of the low quality of supporting evidence.

Antimicrobial resistance is of growing concern. To encourage development of new treatments, some commentators have suggested regulators exercise increased flexibility on the clinical evidence required for approval. We examined all 1065 new drugs and biologics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration between 1984 and 2018 and recorded each drug's use of the Orphan Drug Act, fast-track, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy programmes, as well as dates of investigational new drug application, new drug application, and new drug approval, which were used to calculate clinical development and review times. There were 178 (17%) antimicrobial products, which were more likely than non-antimicrobial products to benefit from priority review (103 [58%] of 178 vs 402 [45%] of 887, p=0·0023), fast-track designation (58 [37%] of 157 vs 151 [19%] of 814], p<0·001), and accelerated approval (23 [18%] of 129 vs 67 [9%] of 711, p=0·0046), and less likely to have Orphan Drug Act designation (25 [14%] of 178 vs 267 [30%] of 887, p<0·0001). Median time from investigational new drug application to approval was shorter for antimicrobial than for non-antimicrobial drugs (5·9 years [IQR 4·6–7·3] vs 7·6 years [IQR 5·7–10·2], p<0·001). Except for Orphan Drug Act status, expedited clinical testing and review programmes have been used at least as frequently for antimicrobial products as for non-antimicrobial drugs. No evidence supported claims that antimicrobial progress through the regulatory approval process in the USA is more time-consuming than non-antimicrobial development."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Within 4 months of COVID-19 first being reported in the USA, it spread to every state and to more than 90% of all counties. During this period, the US COVID-19 response was highly decentralised, with stay-at-home directives issued by state and local officials, subject to varying levels of enforcement. The absence of a centralised policy and timeline combined with the complex dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission in the USA a challenge.
Methods
We used daily mobility data derived from aggregated and anonymised cell (mobile) phone data, provided by Teralytics (Zürich, Switzerland) from Jan 1 to April 20, 2020, to capture real-time trends in movement patterns for each US county, and used these data to generate a social distancing metric. We used epidemiological data to compute the COVID-19 growth rate ratio for a given county on a given day. Using these metrics, we evaluated how social distancing, measured by the relative change in mobility, affected the rate of new infections in the 25 counties in the USA with the highest number of confirmed cases on April 16, 2020, by fitting a statistical model for each county.
Findings
Our analysis revealed that mobility patterns are strongly correlated with decreased COVID-19 case growth rates for the most affected counties in the USA, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 0·7 for 20 of the 25 counties evaluated. Additionally, the effect of changes in mobility patterns, which dropped by 35–63% relative to the normal conditions, on COVID-19 transmission are not likely to be perceptible for 9–12 days, and potentially up to 3 weeks, which is consistent with the incubation time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 plus additional time for reporting. We also show evidence that behavioural changes were already underway in many US counties days to weeks before state-level or local-level stay-at-home policies were implemented, implying that individuals anticipated public health directives where social distancing was adopted, despite a mixed political message.
Interpretation
This study strongly supports a role of social distancing as an effective way to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the USA. Until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, social distancing will remain one of the primary measures to combat disease spread, and these findings should serve to support more timely policy making around social distancing in the USA in the future.

Tuberculosis represents the leading global cause of death from an infectious agent. Controlling the tuberculosis epidemic thus represents an urgent global public health priority. Epidemiological modelling suggests that, although drug treatments for tuberculosis continue to improve, WHO timelines to control the spread of the disease require a new vaccine capable of preventing tuberculosis, particularly in adolescents and adults. The spread of strains resistant to multiple drugs adds additional urgency to the vaccine development effort yet attempts to develop new vaccines with wider applicability and better, longer-lasting efficacy than BCG—the only tuberculosis vaccine licensed for use globally—have proven challenging. Results from clinical efficacy trials, particularly a completed, phase 2b trial for preventing tuberculosis disease in people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis using the adjuvanted protein subunit vaccine M72/AS01E give hope. We review the current status of tuberculosis vaccine candidates and outline the diversified vaccine development that are underway."

abstract = "Summary
Although preventive chemotherapy has been instrumental in reducing schistosomiasis incidence worldwide, serious challenges remain. These problems include the omission of certain groups from campaigns of mass drug administration, the existence of persistent disease hotspots, and the risk of recrudescent infections. Central to these challenges is the fact that the diagnostic tools currently used to establish the burden of infection are not sensitive enough, especially in low-endemic settings, which results in underestimation of the true prevalence of active Schistosoma spp infections. This central issue necessitates that the current schistosomiasis control strategies recommended by WHO are re-evaluated and, possibly, adapted. More targeted interventions and novel approaches have been used to estimate the prevalence of schistosomiasis, such as establishing infection burden by use of precision mapping, which provides high resolution spatial information that delineates variations in prevalence within a defined geographical area. Such information is instrumental in guiding targeted intervention campaigns. However, the need for highly accurate diagnostic tools in such strategies is a crucial factor that is often neglected. The availability of highly sensitive diagnostic tests also opens up the possibility of applying strategies of sample pooling to reduce the cost of control programmes. To interrupt the transmission of, and eventually eliminate, schistosomiasis, better local targeting of preventive chemotherapy, in combination with highly sensitive diagnostic tools, is crucial."

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 resulted in more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths. SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths. Exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if countries have the political will to rapidly implement countermeasures."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In April 2019, an HIV screening camp for all ages was established in response to a report of an unusually large number of paediatric HIV diagnoses in Larkana, Pakistan. We aimed to understand the clinical profile of the children who registered for HIV care.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, we review the outbreak response from the government, academia, and UN agencies in Larkana, Sindh, Pakistan. We report age-stratified and sex-stratified HIV prevalence estimated among individuals screened. For children who registered for HIV care, clinical history of previous injections and blood transfusions, HIV disease stage, hepatitis B and hepatitis C status, and CD4 count was abstracted from clinical records from Sindh AIDS Control Program HIV Clinic (Shaikh Zayed Childrens Hospital, Larkana, Pakistan) and analysed using percentages, χ2 tests, and weight-for-age Z scores. We also analysed data for parents who were tested for HIV.
Findings
Between April 24, and July 15, 2019, 31 239 individuals underwent HIV testing, of whom 930 (3%) tested positive for HIV. Of these, 763 (82%) were younger than 16 years and 604 (79%) of these were aged 5 years and below. Estimated HIV prevalence was 3% overall; 7% (283 of 3803) in children aged 0–2 years, 6% (321 of 5412) in children aged 3–5 years, and 1% (148 of 11 251) in adults aged 16–49 years. Of the 591 children who registered for HIV care, 478 (81%) were 5 years or younger, 379 (64%) were boys, and 315 (53%) of 590 had a weight-for-age Z score of −3·2. Prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen was 8% (48 of 574) and hepatitis C antibody positivity was 3% (15 of 574). Of children whose mothers tested for HIV, only 39 (11%) of 371 had HIV-positive mothers. Most children (404 [89%] of 453) reported multiple previous injections and 40 (9%) of 453 reported blood transfusions.
Interpretation
This HIV outbreak is unprecedented among children in Pakistan: a 54% increase in paediatric HIV diagnoses over the past 13 years. The outbreak was heavily skewed towards young children younger than 5 years, with a predominance of boys. Epidemiological and molecular studies are needed to understand the full extent of the outbreak and its drivers to guide HIV control strategies.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Characterising sexual networks with transmission of sexually transmitted infections might allow identification of individuals at increased risk of infection. We aimed to investigate sexual mixing in Neisseria gonorrhoeae transmission networks between women, heterosexual men, and men who report sex with men (MSM), and between people with and without HIV.
Methods
In this cross-sectional observational study, we whole-genome sequenced N gonorrhoeae isolates from the archive of the Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme (GRASP).w Isolates that varied by five single nucleotide polymorphisms or fewer were grouped into clusters that represented sexual networks with N gonorrhoeae transmission. Clusters were described by gender, sexual risk group, and HIV status.
Findings
We sequenced 1277 N gonorrhoeae isolates with linked clinical and sociodemographic data that were collected in five clinics in England during 2013–16 (July 1 to Sept 30 in 2013–15; July 1 to Sept 9 in 2016). The isolates grouped into 213 clusters. 30 (14%) clusters contained isolates from heterosexual men and MSM but no women and three (1%) clusters contained isolates from only women and MSM. 146 (69%) clusters comprised solely people with negative or unknown HIV status and seven (3%) comprised only HIV-positive people. 60 (28%) clusters comprised MSM with positive and negative or unknown HIV status.
Interpretation
N gonorrhoeae molecular data can provide information indicating risk of HIV or other sexually transmitted infections for some individuals for whom such risk might not be known from clinical history. These findings have implications for sexual health care, including offering testing, prevention advice, and preventive treatment, such as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis.

Background
Congenital viral infections cause substantial long-term morbidity but population-based data about diagnosis rates are scarce. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term trends in congenital viral infections in England and to report on how the rates of these infections might have changed with improved methods for detection, the introduction of the two-dose measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccine in 1996, and the implementation of the Newborn Hearing Screening Programme (NHSP) in 2006.
Methods
For this population-based, observational cohort study, we used national and regional hospitalisation data from 1968 to 2016 in England (Hospital In-Patient Enquiry, Hospital Episode Statistics, and Oxford Record Linkage Study) to calculate annual rates of hospital discharges coded with—and individuals aged younger than 1 month diagnosed with—congenital cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and rubella. We investigated associations of congenital cytomegalovirus, HSV, and VZV with perinatal and maternal factors (sex, mother's ethnicity, mode of delivery, gestational age, birthweight, mother's age, mother's index of multiple deprivation, and number of previous pregnancies).
Findings
In 2016, discharge rates per 100 000 infant population were 22·3 (95% CI 18·8–26·1) for congenital cytomegalovirus, 17·6 (14·6–21·1) for HSV, 32·6 (28·4–37·2) for VZV, and 0·15 (0·0–0·8) for rubella. Compared with earlier years of the study, the discharge rate in 2016 was higher for congenital cytomegalovirus, HSV, and VZV, whereas it was lower for rubella. For congenital cytomegalovirus, there was a significant step-increase between 2006 and 2007 following implementation of the NHSP (rate ratio comparing the trend line post-NHSP with that pre-NHSP 1·55 [95% CI 1·12–2·14], p=0·0072). Congenital cytomegalovirus infection was associated with birthweight less than 1 kg, maternal age younger than 25 years, socioeconomically deprived households, casearean section, and mothers of black ethnicity. Congenital HSV infection was associated with maternal age younger than 20 years, gestational age less than 32 weeks, and vaginal and emergency caesarean section deliveries, while VZV infection was associated with increased parity and black and south Asian ethnicities.
Interpretation
The increase in hospital discharges coded with congenital cytomegalovirus is most likely due to the introduction of sensitive diagnostic techniques and retrospective diagnoses made in infants after implementation of the NHSP. Public health strategies to improve prevention and treatment of congenital viral infections are urgently warranted. The decrease in discharges for rubella is most likely due to the MMR vaccine.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Devising effective, targeted approaches to prevent recurrent meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin and soft tissue infection requires an understanding of factors driving MRSA acquisition. We comprehensively defined household longitudinal, strain-level S aureus transmission dynamics in households of children with community-associated MRSA skin and soft tissue infection.
Methods
From 2012–15, otherwise healthy paediatric patients with culture-confirmed, community-onset MRSA infections were recruited for the Household Observation of MRSA in the Environment (HOME) prospective cohort study from hospitals and community practices in metropolitan St Louis (MO, USA). Children with health-care-related risk factors were excluded, as determined by evidence of recent hospital admission, an invasive medical device, or residence in a long-term care facility. Household contacts (individuals sleeping in the home ≥four nights per week) and indoor dogs and cats were also enrolled. A baseline visit took place at the index patient's primary home, followed by four quarterly visits over 12 months. At each visit, interviews were done and serial cultures were collected, to detect S aureus from three anatomic sites of household members, two anatomic sites on dogs and cats, and 21 environmental surfaces. Molecular typing was done by repetitive-sequence PCR to define distinct S aureus strains within each household. Longitudinal, multivariable generalised mixed-effects logistic regression models identified factors associated with S aureus acquisition.
Findings
Across household members, pets, and environmental surfaces, 1267 strain acquisition events were observed. Acquisitions were driven equally by 510 introductions of novel strains into households and 602 transmissions within households, each associated with distinct factors. Frequent handwashing decreased the likelihood of novel strain introduction into the household (odds ratio [OR] 0·86, credible interval [CrI] 0·74–1·01). Transmission recipients were less likely to own their homes (OR 0·77, CrI 0·63–0·94) and were more likely to share bedrooms with strain-colonised individuals (OR 1·33, CrI 1·12–1·58), live in homes with higher environmental S aureus contamination burden (OR 3·97, CrI 1·96–8·20), and report interval skin and soft tissue infection (OR 1·32, CrI 1·07–1·64). Transmission sources were more likely to share bath towels (OR 1·25, CrI 1·01–1·57). Pets were often transmission recipients, but rarely the sole transmission source.
Interpretation
The household environment plays a key role in transmission, a factor associated with skin and soft tissue infection. Future interventions should inclusively target household members and the environment, focusing on straightforward changes in hand hygiene and household sharing behaviours.

abstract = "Summary
Background
A test-and-not-treat (TaNT) strategy has been developed to prevent people with high concentrations of circulating Loa loa microfilariae (>20 000 microfilariae per mL) developing serious adverse events after ivermectin treatment during mass drug administration to eliminate onchocerciasis. An important question related to cost and programmatic issues is whether annual retesting is required for everyone. We therefore aimed to investigate changes in L loa microfilarial densities during TaNT campaigns run 18 months apart.
Methods
In this observational cohort study, we assessed the participants of two TaNT campaigns for onchocerciasis. These campaigns, which were run by a research team, together with personnel from the Ministry of Health and community health workers, were done in six health areas (in 89 communities) in Okola health district (Cameroon); the first campaign was run between Aug 10, and Oct 29, 2015, and the second was run between March 7, and May 26, 2017. All individuals aged 5 years and older were invited to be screened for Loa loa microfilaraemia before being offered ivermectin (unless contraindicated). L loa microfilarial density was measured at the point of care using the LoaScope. All those with a L loa microfilarial density of 20 000 microfilariae per mL or less were offered treatment; in the first 2 weeks of the 2015 campaign, a higher exclusion threshold of 26 000 microfilariae per mL or less was used. At both rounds of the intervention, participants were registered with a paper form, in which personal information were collected. In 2017, we also recorded whether each individual reported participation in the 2015 campaign. The primary outcome, assessed in all participants, was whether L loa microfilarial density was above or below the exclusion threshold (ie, the criteria that guided the decision to treat).
Findings
In the 2015 TaNT campaign, 26 415 people were censused versus 29 587 people in the 2017 TaNT campaign. All individuals aged 5 years and older without other contraindications to treatment (22 842 people in 2015 and 25 421 people in 2017) were invited to be screened for L loa microfilaraemia before being offered ivermectin. In 2015, 16 182 individuals were examined with the LoaScope, versus 18 697 individuals in the same communities in 2017. 344 (2·1%) individuals were excluded from ivermectin treatment because of a high L loa microfilarial density in 2015, versus 283 (1·5%) individuals in 2017 (p<0·0001). Records from 2017 could be matched to those from 2015 for 6983 individuals (43·2% of the 2015 participants). In this cohort, in 2017, 6981 (>99·9%) of 6983 individuals treated with ivermectin in 2015 had L loa microfilariae density below the level associated with neurological serious adverse events.
Interpretation
Individuals treated with ivermectin do not need to be retested for L loa microfilaraemia before the next treatment, provided that they can be re-identified. This adjusted approach will enable substantial cost savings and facilitate reaching programmatic goals for elimination of onchocerciasis in areas that are co-endemic for loiasis.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Enteroviruses can cause severe infections, especially in young children. Non-polio enterovirus infections are not notifiable in most countries in the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) region, and surveillance varies substantially between countries. We collected and analysed available enterovirus data across EU and EEA countries to assess the current epidemiological situation and need for standardising surveillance.
Methods
Aggregated data on any enterovirus detected between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2017, through national enterovirus reference laboratories were requested from representatives in all 31 EU and EEA countries. Information collected included enterovirus types detected by month, patient age group, symptom, and specimen type. We also collected sequence data on viral capsid sequences for the three most clinically relevant enterovirus types, as identified from the data.
Findings
Aggregated data were provided by representatives from 24 (77%) of 31 countries. 9914 (66%) of 14 999 enterovirus infections with information about age were in children younger than 5 years, and 3197 (45%) of 7139 individuals for whom symptoms were reported had neurological symptoms. Other symptoms were non-specific fever (in 1607 [23%] patients), respiratory symptoms (in 1197 [17%] patients), hand, foot, and mouth disease (in 528 [7% patients), and myocarditis (in 39 [1%] patients). 68 deaths were temporally associated with enterovirus infection. Typing for 11 559 (67%) of 17 136 specimens revealed 66 enterovirus types. Coxsackievirus A6 was the most frequently detected enterovirus type (in 1556 [13%] of 11 559 typed enteroviruses), and 292 (65%) of 448 patients with coxsackievirus A6 infection with available clinical data presented with hand, foot, and mouth disease. Echovirus 30 was the second most frequently detected enterovirus type, representing 1412 (12%) of 11 559 typed enteroviruses, and 384 (82%) of 467 individuals with echovirus 30 infection with available clinical data had neurological symptoms. Sequences available from 18 countries showed circulation of newly emerging strains of enterovirus A71 and enterovirus D68.
Interpretation
To our knowledge, this study is the largest investigation of enterovirus circulation in EU and EEA countries and confirms the availability of non-polio enterovirus data in the region. Our study highlights the wide circulation of non-polio enteroviruses in Europe, mostly affecting young children and leading to neurological symptoms. Collecting data on morbidity and mortality related to enterovirus infections, as well as harmonising case definition for surveillance, should be encouraged.

Background
Serological non-response can be present after hepatitis B vaccination in healthy adults. We aimed to establish which of three revaccination regimens is most effective at inducing protective immunity
Methods
Healthy adults (aged 18–80 years) from 16 Dutch centres (13 public health services, two university hospitals, and one travel clinic) were included in this multicentre, parallel group, randomised, controlled, superiority trial. The inclusion criterion was vaccine non-response (hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] titre <10 IU/L) after a primary series with three doses of one type of recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B virus (either HBVaxPro-10 or Engerix-B at months 0, 1, and 6). Participants were individually randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to a vaccination series of repeated initial vaccination (HBVaxPro 10 μg or Engerix-B 20 μg) as the control, or to Twinrix 20 μg, Fendrix 20 μg, or HBVaxPro 40 μg. We used a web-based randomisation programme, stratified by centre, with a block size of four. Participants and centres were unmasked to assignment after randomisation. Laboratory staff and investigators were masked to vaccine-group assignment. All revaccination schedules were identical, with intramuscular vaccinations at 0, 1, and 2 months. Anti-HBs was measured at 0, 1, 2, and 3 months. The primary outcome was the percentage of responders (anti-HBs titres ≥10 IU/L) at 3 months. Immunogenicity and safety analyses were based on an intention-to-vaccinate analysis, the immunogenicity analysis with last observation carried forward for missing data, and the Bonferroni and the Benjamini–Hochberg method were applied to correct for multiple testing. The trial was registered in the Dutch National Trial Register and inclusion has been stopped (identifier NL3011; EudraCT-number 2011-005627-40).
Findings
The participants were recruited between Nov 1, 2012, and Sept 1, 2017. 480 participants were randomly assigned and included in intention-to-vaccinate analyses: 124 (26%) to control, 118 (25%) to Twinrix, 114 (24%) to HBVaxPro-40, and 124 (26%) to Fendrix. At month 3 the percentage of responders was 83 (67%) of 124 (95% CI 57·9–75·1 in the control group, 94 (80%) of the 118 (71·3–86·5) in the Twinrix group, 95 (83%) of 114 (75·2–89·7) in the HBVaxPro-40 group, and 108 (87%) of 124 (79·9–92·4) in the Fendrix group. Compared with the control group, the percentage of responders was superior for the HBVaxPro-40 group (adjusted difference 21·6% [95% CI 10·4–32·7], p=0·0204 [Bonferroni corrected p value]) and the Fendrix group (26·3% [15·4–37·3], p=0·0006), but not the Twinrix group (25·0% [13·0–37·0]; p=0·0846). One serious adverse event occurred (herpes zoster ophthalmicus) in the Fendrix group, which was not attributed to the vaccine.
Interpretation
Revaccinating healthy non-responders with Fendrix or HBVaxPro-40 resulted in significantly higher proportions of responders and therefore indication for these vaccines should be expanded to enable revaccination of non-responders.

abstract = "Summary
Introduction
Tuberculous meningitis accounts for 1–5% of tuberculosis cases. Diagnostic delay contributes to poor outcomes. We evaluated the performance of the new Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) for tuberculous meningitis diagnosis.
Methods
In this prospective validation study, we tested the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of adults presenting with suspected meningitis (ie, headache or altered mental status with clinical signs of meningism) to the Mulago National Referral Hospital and Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda. We centrifuged the CSF, resuspended the cell pellet in 2 mL CSF, and tested 0·5 mL aliquots with Xpert Ultra, Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), and mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) culture. We quantified diagnostic performance against the uniform case definition of probable or definite tuberculous meningitis and a composite microbiological reference standard.
Findings
From Nov 25, 2016, to Jan 24, 2019, we screened 466 adults with suspected meningitis and tested 204 for tuberculous meningitis. Uniform clinical case definition classified 51 participants as having probable or definite tuberculous meningitis. Against this uniform case definition, Xpert Ultra had 76·5% sensitivity (95% CI 62·5–87·2; 39 of 51 patients) and a negative predictive value of 92·7% (87·6–96·2; 153 of 165), compared with 55·6% sensitivity (44·0–70·4; 25 of 45; p=0·0010) and a negative predictive value of 85·8% (78·9–91·1; 121 of 141) for Xpert and 61·4% sensitivity (45·5–75·6; 27 of 44; p=0·020) and negative predictive value of 85·2% (77·4–91·1; 98 of 115) for MGIT culture. Against the composite microbiological reference standard, Xpert Ultra had sensitivity of 92·9% (80·5–98·5; 39 of 42), higher than Xpert at 65·8% (48·6–80·4; 25 of 38; p=0·0063) and MGIT culture at 72·2% (55·9–86·2; 27 of 37; p=0·092). Xpert Ultra detected nine tuberculous meningitis cases missed by Xpert and MGIT culture.
Interpretation
Xpert Ultra detected tuberculous meningitis with higher sensitivity than Xpert and MGIT culture in this HIV-positive population. However, with a negative predictive value of 93%, Xpert Ultra cannot be used as a rule-out test. Clinical judgment and novel highly sensitive point-of-care tests are still required.

abstract = "Summary
Malaria drug trials conducted in endemic areas face a major challenge in their analysis because it is difficult to establish whether parasitaemia in blood samples collected after treatment indicate drug failure or a new infection acquired after treatment. It is therefore vital to reliably distinguish drug failures from new infections in order to obtain accurate estimates of drug failure rates. This distinction can be achieved for Plasmodium falciparum by comparing parasite genotypes obtained at the time of treatment (the baseline) and on the day of recurring parasitaemia. Such PCR correction is required to obtain accurate failure rates, even for new effective drugs. Despite the routine use of PCR correction in surveillance of drug resistance and in clinical drug trials, limitations inherent to the molecular genotyping methods have led some researchers to question the validity of current PCR correction strategies. Here we describe and discuss recent developments in these genotyping approaches, with a particular focus on method validation and limitations of the genotyping strategies. Our aim is to update scientists from public and private bodies who are working on the development, deployment, and surveillance of new malaria drugs. We aim to promote discussion around these issues and argue for the adoption of improved standardised PCR correction methodologies."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of 55 prospective studies found the adjusted risk of HIV acquisition to be at least tripled in individuals with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection. We aimed to assess the potential contribution of HSV-2 infection to HIV incidence, given an effect of HSV-2 on HIV acquisition.
Methods
We used a classic epidemiological formula to estimate the global and regional (WHO regional) population attributable fraction (PAF) and number of incident HIV infections attributable to HSV-2 infection by age (15–24 years, 25–49 years, and 15–49 years), sex, and timing of HSV-2 infection (established vs recently acquired). Estimates were calculated by incorporating HSV-2 and HIV infection data with pooled relative risk (RR) estimates for the effect of HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition from a systematic review and meta-analysis. Because HSV-2 and HIV have shared sexual and other risk factors, in addition to HSV-related biological factors that increase HIV risk, we only used RR estimates that were adjusted for potential confounders.
Findings
An estimated 420 000 (95% uncertainty interval 317 000–546 000; PAF 29·6% [22·9–37·1]) of 1·4 million sexually acquired incident HIV infections in individuals aged 15–49 years in 2016 were attributable to HSV-2 infection. The contribution of HSV-2 to HIV was largest for the WHO African region (PAF 37·1% [28·7–46·3]), women (34·8% [23·5–45·0]), individuals aged 25–49 years (32·4% [25·4–40·2]), and established HSV-2 infection (26·8% [19·7–34·5]).
Interpretation
A large burden of HIV is likely to be attributable to HSV-2 infection, even if the effect of HSV-2 infection on HIV had been imperfectly measured in studies providing adjusted RR estimates, potentially because of residual confounding. The contribution is likely to be greatest in areas where HSV-2 is highly prevalent, particularly Africa. New preventive interventions against HSV-2 infection could not only improve the quality of life of millions of people by reducing the prevalence of herpetic genital ulcer disease, but could also have an additional, indirect effect on HIV transmission.

abstract = "Summary
Background
An important problem limiting treatment of latent tuberculosis infection is the occurrence of adverse events with isoniazid. We combined populations from phase 2 and phase 3 open-label, randomised controlled trials, to establish risk factors for adverse events during latent tuberculosis infection treatment.
Methods
We did a post-hoc safety analysis based on data from two open-label, randomised controlled trials done in health-care facilities in Australia, Benin, Brazil, Canada, Ghana, Guinea, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea. Participants were consenting adults (aged ≥18 years) with a positive latent tuberculosis infection diagnostic test, indication for treatment, and without contraindications to rifampicin or isoniazid. Patients were centrally randomly assigned 1:1 to 4 months of daily 10 mg/kg rifampicin or 9 months of daily 5 mg/kg isoniazid. The primary outcome evaluated was adverse events (including grade 1–2 rash and all events of grade 3–5) resulting in permanent discontinuation of study medication and judged possibly or probably related to study drug by a masked, independent, three-member adjudication panel (trial registration: NCT00170209; NCT00931736).
Findings
Participants were recruited from April 27, 2004, up until Jan 31, 2007 (phase 2), and Oct 1, 2009, up until Dec 31, 2014 (phase 3). The safety populations for each group comprised 3205 individuals receiving isoniazid and 3280 receiving rifampicin. Among those receiving isoniazid, 86 (2·7%) of 3205 had grade 1–2 rash or any grade 3–5 adverse events, more than the 50 (1·5%) of 3280 who had these events with rifampicin (risk difference −1·2%, 95% CI −1·9 to −0·5). Age was associated with adverse events in adults receiving isoniazid. Compared with individuals aged 18–34 years, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for adverse events was 1·8 (95% CI 1·1–3·0) for individuals aged 35–64 years and 3·0 (1·2–6·8) for individuals aged 65–90 years. With rifampicin, adverse events were associated with inconsistent medication adherence (adjusted OR 2·0, 1·1–3·6) and concomitant medication use (2·8, 1·5–5·2), but not age, with an adjusted OR of 1·1 (0·6–2·1) for individuals aged 35–64 years and 1·7 (0·5–4·7) for individuals aged 65–90 years. One treatment-related death occurred in the isoniazid group.
Interpretation
In patients without a contraindication, rifampicin is likely to be the safest latent tuberculosis infection treatment option. With more widespread use of rifampicin, rare, but serious adverse events might be seen. However, within these randomised trials, rifampicin was safer than isoniazid and adverse events were not associated with older age. Therefore, rifampicin should become a primary treatment option for latent tuberculosis infection based on its safety.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a human retrovirus that causes a lifelong infection. Several diseases, including an aggressive form of leukaemia, have been designated as associated with HTLV-1, whereby having HTLV-1 is a necessary condition for diagnosis. Beyond these diseases, there is uncertainty about other health effects of HTLV-1. We aimed to synthesise evidence from epidemiological studies on associations between health outcomes and HTLV-1.
Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, and Global Health for publications from their inception to July, 2018. We included cohort, case-control, and controlled cross-sectional studies that compared mortality or morbidity between people with and without HTLV-1. We excluded studies of psychiatric conditions, of symptoms or clinical findings only, of people who had undergone blood transfusion or organ transplant, and of population groups defined by a behavioural characteristic putting them at increased risk of co-infection with another virus. We extracted the risk estimates (relative risks [RRs] or odds ratios [ORs]) that reflected the greatest degree of control for potential confounders. We did a random-effects meta-analysis for groups of effect estimates where case ascertainment methods, age groups, and confounders were similar, presenting pooled estimates with 95% CIs and prediction intervals.
Findings
Of the 3318 identified studies, 39 met the inclusion criteria, examining 42 clinical conditions between them. The adjusted risk of death due to any cause was higher in people with HTLV-1 when compared with HTLV-1-negative counterparts (RR 1·57, 95% CI 1·37–1·80). From meta-analysis, HTLV-1 was associated with increased odds of seborrheic dermatitis (OR 3·95, 95% CI 1·99–7·81), Sjogren's syndrome (3·25, 1·85–5·70), and, inversely, with lower relative risk of gastric cancer (RR 0·45, 0·28–0·71). There were a further 14 diseases with significant associations or substantially elevated risk with HTLV-1 from single studies (eczema [children]; bronchiectasis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis [analysed together]; asthma [males]; fibromyalgia; rheumatoid arthritis; arthritis; tuberculosis; kidney and bladder infections; dermatophytosis; community acquired pneumonia; strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome; liver cancer; lymphoma other than adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma; and cervical cancer).
Interpretation
There is a broad range of diseases studied in association with HTLV-1. However, the elevated risk for death among people with HTLV-1 is not explained by available studies of morbidity. Many of the diseases shown to be associated with HTLV-1 are not fatal, and those that are (eg, leukaemia) occur too rarely to account for the observed mortality effect. There are substantial research gaps in relation to HTLV-1 and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and metabolic disease. The burden of disease associated with the virus might be broader than generally recognised.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In May, 2018, Children's Hospital Colorado noted an outbreak of enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) neurological disease. We aimed to characterise the clinical features of EV-A71 neurological disease during this outbreak.
Methods
In this retrospective observational cohort study, children (younger than 18 years) who presented to Children's Hospital Colorado (Aurora, CO, USA) between March 1 and November 30, 2018, with neurological disease (defined by non-mutually exclusive criteria, including meningitis, encephalitis, acute flaccid myelitis, and seizures) and enterovirus detected from any biological specimen were eligible for study inclusion. The clinical characteristics of children with neurological disease associated with EV-A71 were compared with those of children with neurological disease associated with other enteroviruses during the same period. To explore the differences in clinical presentation of acute flaccid myelitis, we also used a subgroup analysis to compare clinical findings in children with EV-A71-associated acute flaccid myelitis during the study period with these findings in those with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68)-associated acute flaccid myelitis at the same hospital between 2013 and 2018.
Findings
Between March 10 and Nov 10, 2018, 74 children presenting to Children's Hospital Colorado were found to have enterovirus neurological disease; EV-A71 was identified in 43 (58%) of these children. The median age of the children with EV-A71 neurological disease was 22·7 months (IQR 4·0–31·9), and most of these children were male (34 [79%] children). 40 (93%) children with EV-A71 neurological disease had findings suggestive of meningitis, 31 (72%) children showed evidence of encephalitis, and ten (23%) children met our case definition of acute flaccid myelitis. All children with EV-A71 disease had fever and 18 (42%) children had hand, foot, or mouth lesions at or before neurological onset. Children with EV-A71 disease were best differentiated from those with other enteroviruses (n=31) by the neurological findings of myoclonus, ataxia, weakness, and autonomic instability. Of the specimens collected from children with EV-A71, this enterovirus was detected in 94% of rectal, 79% of oropharyngeal, 56% of nasopharyngeal, and 20% of cerebrospinal fluid specimens. 39 (93%) of 42 children with EV-A71 neurological disease who could be followed up showed complete recovery by 1–2 months. Compared with children with EV-D68-associated acute flaccid myelitis, children with EV-A71-associated acute flaccid myelitis were younger, showed neurological onset earlier after prodromal symptom onset, had milder weakness, showed more rapid improvement, and were more likely to completely recover.
Interpretation
This outbreak of EV-A71 neurological disease, the largest reported in the Americas, was characterised by fever, myoclonus, ataxia, weakness, autonomic instability, and full recovery in most patients. Because EV-A71 epidemiology outside of Asia remains difficult to predict, identification of future outbreaks will be aided by prompt recognition of these distinct clinical findings, testing of non-sterile and sterile site specimens, and enhanced enterovirus surveillance.

abstract = "Summary
Globally, high rates (and in the WHO European region an increasing prevalence) of co-infection with tuberculosis and HIV and HIV and hepatitis C virus exist. In eastern European and central Asian countries, the tuberculosis, HIV, and viral hepatitis programmes, including diagnostic services, are separate vertical structures. In this Personal View, we consider underlying reasons for the poor integration for these diseases, particularly in the WHO European region, and how to address this with an initial focus on diagnostic services. In part, this low integration has reflected different diagnostic development histories, global funding sources, and sample types used for diagnosis (eg, typically sputum for tuberculosis and blood for HIV and hepatitis C). Cooperation between services improved as patients with tuberculosis needed routine testing for HIV and vice versa, but financial, infection control, and logistical barriers remain. Multidisease diagnostic platforms exist, but to be used optimally, appropriate staff training and sensible understanding of different laboratory and infection control risks needs rapid implementation. Technically these ideas are all feasible. Poor coordination between these vertical systems remains unhelpful. There is a need to increase political and operational integration of diagnostic and treatment services and bring them closer to patients."

From January, 2016 to February, 2017, encompassing the major 2016 Zika epidemic, participants in the Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study (PDCS) in Managua, Nicaragua, were encouraged to visit the study health centre at first indication of any illness. PDCS participants were aged 2–14 years, healthy at enrolment, and recruited before the initiation of the present study. Molecular and serological assays were used to test participants exhibiting any of four broad clinical profiles suspected of resulting from a symptomatic Zika virus infection. These clinical profiles were: fever and at least two of headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, haemorrhagic manifestations, and leukopenia; fever and at least two of nausea or vomiting, rash, aches and pains, positive tourniquet test, leukopenia, and any dengue warning sign; undifferentiated fever without evident cause, with or without any other clinical finding; and afebrile rash with or without any other clinical finding. We characterised acute clinical findings (signs, symptoms, and complete blood counts) in both Zika cases and non-Zika cases.
Findings
We prospectively followed a cohort of about 3700 children, of which 1110 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Four participants with laboratory-confirmed Zika (three co-infections with dengue virus, one missing complete blood count data) and two participants who were non-Zika cases (missing complete blood count data) were excluded from analysis. We analysed 556 laboratory-confirmed Zika and 548 non-Zika cases. The WHO case definition captured 176 confirmed Zika cases, and the PAHO definition 109 confirmed Zika cases, who presented with the most clinical findings and a dengue-like clinical profile. The remaining two thirds of Zika cases, principally characterised by undifferentiated fever or afebrile rash, were missed. Among Zika cases, rash (n=440)—particularly generalised erythematous rash (n=334)—fever (n=333), leukopenia (n=217), and headache (n=203) were most common and peaked within 3 days of illness onset. The most common Zika presentation over the first week of illness was rash only (n=80). The sensitivity of Zika case definitions increased across paediatric age (from 11·3% to 56·1% for the WHO case definition and from 6·0% to 36·6% for the PAHO case definition), as the prevalence of most clinical findings (particularly arthralgia) increased with age, irrespective of previous dengue virus infection. Consequently, Zika manifested differently across paediatric age; older Zika cases presented with a dengue-like clinical profile while younger Zika cases presented with undifferentiated fever or afebrile rash.
Interpretation
We provide the most thorough description of paediatric Zika to date. Most paediatric Zika cases go undetected under the WHO and PAHO case definitions, suggesting that current standards for Zika case ascertainment require revision. Zika manifests with mild but differing clinical profiles across paediatric age, presenting major challenges to diagnosis, surveillance, and efforts to control future Zika epidemics.

In this Personal View, we critically examine the wider context of international efforts to stimulate commercial antibiotic research and development via public–private initiatives. Despite these efforts, antibiotics remain a global resource without an international support structure that is commensurate to the risks from antibiotic-resistant infections and the long-term nature of required solutions. To protect this resource, we propose a two-pronged antibiotic research and development strategy based on a short-term strengthening of incentives (such as market entry rewards) to maximise the delivery of existing opportunities in the pipeline, and on a concurrent medium-term to long-term establishment of a global, publicly funded antibiotic research and development institute. Designed sustainably to deliver novel and first-in-class antibiotics targeting key human health gaps, the institute and its staff would become a global resource that, unlike the private pharmaceutical sector, would be managed as an open science platform. Our model of internationalised public research and development would maximise scientific synergy and cross-fertilisation, minimise replication of effort, acquire and preserve existing know-how, and ensure equitable and sustainable access to novel and effective antibiotics. Its genuinely global focus would also help counteract tendencies to equate donor with global health priorities. Our proposal is not radical. Historical precedent and developments in other research areas show that sustained international funding of publicly owned research can hasten the delivery of critically needed drugs and lower barriers to access."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Ivermectin is a potential new vector control tool to reduce malaria transmission. Mosquitoes feeding on a bloodmeal containing ivermectin have a reduced lifespan, meaning they are less likely to live long enough to complete sporogony and become infectious. We aimed to estimate the effect of ivermectin on malaria transmission in various scenarios of use.
Methods
We validated an existing population-level mathematical model of the effect of ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA) on the mosquito population and malaria transmission against two datasets: clinical data from a cluster- randomised trial done in Burkina Faso in 2015 wherein ivermectin was given to individuals taller than 90 cm and entomological data from a study of mosquito outcomes after ivermectin MDA for onchocerciasis or lymphatic filariasis in Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Liberia between 2008 and 2013. We extended the existing model to include a range of complementary malaria interventions (seasonal malaria chemoprevention and MDA with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine) and to incorporate new data on higher doses of ivermectin with a longer mosquitocidal effect. We consider two ivermectin regimens: a single dose of 400 μg/kg (1 × 400 μg/kg) and three consecutive daily doses of 300 μg/kg per day (3 × 300 μg/kg). We simulated the effect of these two doses in a range of usage scenarios in different transmission settings (highly seasonal, seasonal, and perennial). We report percentage reductions in clinical incidence and slide prevalence.
Findings
We estimate that MDA with ivermectin will reduce prevalence and incidence and is most effective in areas with highly seasonal transmission. In a highly seasonal moderate transmission setting, three rounds of ivermectin only MDA at 3 × 300 μg/kg (rounds spaced 1 month apart) and 70% coverage is predicted to reduce clinical incidence by 71% and prevalence by 34%. We predict that adding ivermectin MDA to seasonal malaria chemoprevention in this setting would reduce clinical incidence by an additional 77% in children younger than 5 years compared with seasonal malaria chemoprevention alone; adding ivermectin MDA to MDA with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine in this setting would reduce incidence by an additional 75% and prevalence by an additional 64% (all ages) compared with MDA with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine alone.
Interpretation
Our modelling predictions suggest that ivermectin could be a valuable addition to the malaria control toolbox, both in areas with persistently high transmission where existing interventions are insufficient and in areas approaching elimination to prevent resurgence.

The WHO international standard for anti-rubella was first established in the 1960s when clinical diagnostics were in their infancy. Since the endorsement of the first international standard for anti-rubella IgG (RUBI-1-94), new rubella vaccines have been developed and global coverage of rubella vaccination has increased. Methods used to measure concentrations of anti-rubella IgG have also evolved to rapid, high-throughput binding assays, which have replaced often cumbersome and highly technical functional assays. During this timeframe, the protective concentration of antibody was set at 10 IU/mL by extrapolation of functional assay correlates; however, the subpopulation of antibodies within a polyclonal serum that confer protection remained undefined. Anti-rubella assays have variable formats, including antigens used, such that the same clinical sample tested on different assays can report different values with potentially devastating consequences, such as recommending to terminate pregnancy. WHO convened a meeting of experts in the rubella field to discuss the use of RUBI-1-94 and the potential future role of this international standard. The main conclusions of this meeting questioned the appropriateness of 10 IU/mL as the cutoff for protection and acknowledged the continuing role of RUBI-1-94 as a reference preparation to address analytical sensitivity and assay variation."

Faecal microbiota transplantation is an effective therapy for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, with potential therapeutic applications in other health conditions. As research uncovers potential associations between the intestinal microbiome and various disease states, stool donor screening has become increasingly stringent, leading to low donor acceptance. Many stool banks have opted to recruit universal stool donors, who are encouraged to donate frequently over a prolonged period and whose stool is used to treat multiple patients. However, various ethical concerns arise when recruiting universal stool donors, which need to be addressed to mitigate harm to donors. In this Personal View, we describe the major ethical issues with universal stool banks across six domains: informed consent, privacy, the imposing of restrictions on autonomy, stewardship of microbiome information, financial incentives, and preventing a sense of obligation. We also suggest several priorities for future research that should be pursued to address these crucial issues and develop more donor-centric stool banks."

abstract = "Summary
Background
There is little evidence on the ecological effect and sustainability of antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) in primary-care settings. We aimed to determine whether a multimodal, educational ASP would be sustainable in the long-term and reduce the incidence of infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli in the community by optimising antibiotic use.
Methods
We did this quasi-experimental intervention study in 214 primary health centres of four primary health-care districts in Andalusia, Spain. Local multidisciplinary teams, comprised of general practitioners, paediatricians, primary-care pharmacists, and epidemiologists, were created in each district and implemented a multimodal, education-based ASP. The core activity of the programme consisted of regular one-to-one educational interviews between a reference interviewing physician and prescribing physicians from each centre on the appropriateness of their most recent (same or preceding day) antibiotic prescriptions based on a structured questionnaire. Appropriate prescribing was defined as compliance of all checklist items with the reference guidelines. An average of five educational interviews were scheduled per prescriber per study year. We did an interrupted time-series analysis to assess the effect of the intervention on quarterly antibiotic use (prescription and collection by the patient) and quality of prescriptions (as defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day) and incidence per 1000 inhabitants of E coli producing extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) isolated from urine samples.
Findings
The study was done between January, 2012, and December, 2017, in a pre-intervention period of 2012–13 and an intervention period of 2014–17. Throughout the study period, there were 1387 physicians (1116 general practicioners and 271 paediatricians) in the included health centres serving a mean population of 1 937 512 people (299 331 children and 1 638 181 adults). 24 150 educational interviews were done over the 4 years. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing was identified in 1794 (36·5%) of 4917 educational interviews in 2014 compared with 1793 (26·9%) of 6665 in 2017 (p<0·0001). The intervention was associated with a sustained reduction in the use of ciprofloxacin (relative effect −15·9%, 95% CI −23·9 to −8·0) and cephalosporins (−22·6%, −35·9 to −9·2), and a sustained increase in the use of amoxicillin (22·2%, 6·4 to 38·0) and fosfomycin trometamol (6·1%, 2·6 to 9·6). The incidence density of ESBL-producing E coli decreased by −0·028 cases per 1000 inhabitants (95% CI −0·034 to −0·021) after the start of the programme, reversing the pre-intervention increase and leading to a relative reduction of −65·6% (−68·2 to −63·0) 4 years later.
Interpretation
Our data suggest that implementation of a multimodal ASP in primary care that is based on individual educational interviews improves the use of antibiotics and results in a sustained significant reduction of infections by ESBL-producing E coli in the community. This information should encourage the implementation of ASPs in primary care.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a fatal disease presenting with rapidly progressive dementia, and most patients die within a year of clinical onset. CJD poses a potential risk of iatrogenic transmission, as it can incubate asymptomatically in humans for decades before becoming clinically apparent. In this Review, we sought evidence to understand the current iatrogenic risk of CJD to public health by examining global evidence on all forms of CJD, including clinical incidence and prevalence of subclinical disease. We found that although CJD, particularly iatrogenic CJD, is rare, the incidence of sporadic CJD is increasing. Incubation periods as long as 40 years have been observed, and all genotypes have now been shown to be susceptible to CJD. Clinicians and surveillance programmes should maintain awareness of CJD to mitigate future incidences of its transmission. Awareness is particularly relevant for sporadic CJD, which occurs in older people in whom clinical presentation could resemble rapidly developing dementia."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Long-term survival and cause-specific mortality of patients who start tuberculosis treatment is rarely described. We aimed to assess the long-term survival of these patients and evaluate the association between vulnerable conditions (social, health behaviours, and comorbidities) and cause-specific mortality in a country with a high burden of tuberculosis.
Methods
In this population-based, longitudinal study in São Paulo state, Brazil, we described the 5-year survival of patients who were newly diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2010. We included patients with newly-diagnosed tuberculosis, aged 15 years or older, and notified to the São Paulo State Tuberculosis Program in 2010. We excluded patients whose diagnosis had changed during follow-up (ie, they did not have tuberculosis) and patients who had multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. We selected our population with tuberculosis from the dedicated electronic system TBweb. Our primary objective was to estimate the excess mortality over 5 years and within the group who survived the first year, compared with the general São Paulo state population. We also estimated the association between social vulnerability (imprisonment and homelessness), health behaviours (alcohol and drug use), and comorbidities (diabetes and mental disorders) with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We used the competing risk analysis framework, estimating cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for potential confounding factors.
Findings
In 2010, there were 19 252 notifications of tuberculosis cases. We excluded 550 cases as patients were younger than 15 years, 556 cases that were not tuberculosis, 2597 retreatments, and 48 cases of MDR tuberculosis, resulting in a final cohort of 15 501 patients with tuberculosis. Over a period of 5 years from tuberculosis diagnosis, 2660 (17%) of 15 501 patients died. Compared with the source population, matched by age, sex, and calendar year, the standardised mortality ratio was 6·47 (95% CI 6·22–6·73) over 5 years and 3·93 (3·71–4·17) among those who survived the first year. 1197 (45%) of 2660 deaths were due to infection. Homelessness and alcohol and drug use were associated with death from infection (adjusted cause-specific HR 1·60, 95% CI 1·39–1·85), cardiovascular (1·43, 1·06–1·95), and external or ill-defined causes of death (1·80, 1·37–2·36). Diabetes was associated with deaths from cardiovascular causes (1·70, 1·23–2·35).
Interpretation
Patients newly diagnosed with tuberculosis were at a higher risk of death than were the source population, even after tuberculosis treatment. Post-tuberculosis sequelae and vulnerability are associated with excess mortality and must be addressed to mitigate the tuberculosis burden worldwide.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Treatment of ventilated pneumonia is often unsuccessful, even when patients are treated according to established guidelines. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of the combination drug device Amikacin Inhale as an adjunctive therapy to intravenous standard-of-care antibiotics for pneumonia caused by Gram-negative pathogens in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.
Methods
INHALE was a prospective, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study comprising two trials (INHALE 1 and INHALE 2) done in 153 hospital intensive-care units in 25 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older; had pneumonia that had been diagnosed by chest radiography and that was documented as being caused by or showing two risk factors for a Gram-negative, multidrug-resistant pathogen; were intubated and mechanically ventilated; had impaired oxygenation within 48 h before screening; and had a modified Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score of at least 6. Patients were stratified by region and disease severity (according to their Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II score) and randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice-recognition system to receive 400 mg amikacin (Amikacin Inhale) or saline placebo, both of which were aerosolised, administered every 12 h for 10 days via the same synchronised inhalation system, and given alongside standard-of-care intravenous antibiotics. All patients and all staff involved in administering devices and monitoring outcomes were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint, survival at days 28–32, was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug, were infected with a Gram-negative pathogen, and had an APACHE II score of at least 10 at diagnosis. Safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01799993 and NCT00805168.
Findings
Between April 13, 2013, and April 7, 2017, 807 patients were assessed for eligibility and 725 were randomly assigned to Amikacin Inhale (362 patients) or aerosolised placebo (363 patients). 712 patients received at least one dose of study drug (354 in the Amikacin Inhale group and 358 in the placebo group), although one patient assigned to Amikacin Inhale received placebo in error and was included in the placebo group for safety analyses. 508 patients (255 in the Amikacin Inhale group and 253 in the placebo group) were assessed for the primary endpoint. We found no between-group difference in survival: 191 (75%) patients in the Amikacin Inhale group versus 196 (77%) patients in the placebo group survived until days 28–32 (odds ratio 0·841, 95% CI 0·554–1·277; p=0·43). Similar proportions of patients in the two treatment groups had a treatment-emergent adverse event (295 [84%] of 353 patients in the Amikacin Inhale group vs 303 [84%] of 359 patients in the placebo group) or a serious treatment-emergent adverse event (101 [29%] patients vs 97 [27%] patients).
Interpretation
Our findings do not support use of inhaled amikacin adjunctive to standard-of-care intravenous therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with Gram-negative pneumonia.

abstract = "Summary
Background
In 2018–19, Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), the causative agent of Borna disease in horses, sheep, and other domestic mammals, was reported in five human patients with severe to fatal encephalitis in Germany. However, information on case frequencies, clinical courses, and detailed epidemiological analyses are still lacking. We report the occurrence of BoDV-1-associated encephalitis in cases submitted to the Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Hygiene, Regensburg University Hospital, Regensburg, Germany, and provide a detailed description of newly identified cases of BoDV-1-induced encephalitis.
Methods
All brain tissues from 56 encephalitis cases from Bavaria, Germany, of putative viral origin (1999–2019), which had been submitted for virological testing upon request of the attending clinician and stored for stepwise diagnostic procedure, were systematically screened for BoDV-1 RNA. Two additional BoDV-1-positive cases were contributed by other diagnostic centres. Positive results were confirmed by deep sequencing, antigen detection, and determination of BoDV-1-reactive antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Clinical and epidemiological data from infected patients were collected and analysed.
Findings
BoDV-1 RNA and bornavirus-reactive antibodies were detected in eight newly analysed encephalitis cases and the first human BoDV-1 isolate was obtained from an unequivocally confirmed human BoDV-1 infection from the endemic area. Six of the eight BoDV-1-positive patients had no record of immunosuppression before the onset of fatal disease, whereas two were immunocompromised after solid organ transplantation. Typical initial symptoms were headache, fever, and confusion, followed by various neurological signs, deep coma, and severe brainstem involvement. Seven of nine patients with fatal encephalitis of unclear cause were BoDV-1 positive within one diagnostic centre. BoDV-1 sequence information and epidemiological analyses indicated independent spillover transmissions most likely from the local wild animal reservoir.
Interpretation
BoDV-1 infection has to be considered as a potentially lethal zoonosis in endemic regions with reported spillover infections in horses and sheep. BoDV-1 infection can result in fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised and apparently healthy people. Consequently, all severe encephalitis cases of unclear cause should be tested for bornaviruses especially in endemic regions.

Vaccination is one of public health's greatest achievements, responsible for saving billions of lives. Yet, 20% of children worldwide are not fully protected, leading to 1·5 million child deaths annually from vaccine-preventable diseases. Millions more people have severe disabling illnesses, cancers, and disabilities stemming from underimmunisation. Reasons for falling vaccination rates globally include low public trust in vaccines, constraints on affordability or access, and insufficient governmental vaccine investments. Consequently, an emerging crisis in vaccine hesitancy ranges from hyperlocal to national and worldwide. Outbreaks often originate in small, insular communities with low immunisation rates. Local outbreaks can spread rapidly, however, transcending borders. Following an assessment of underlying determinants of low vaccination rates, we offer an action based on scientific evidence, ethics, and human rights that spans multiple governments, organisations, disciplines, and sectors."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Many countries have shown marked declines in diarrhoeal disease mortality among children younger than 5 years. With this analysis, we provide updated results on diarrhoeal disease mortality among children younger than 5 years from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) and use the study's comparative risk assessment to quantify trends and effects of risk factors, interventions, and broader sociodemographic development on mortality changes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017.
Methods
This analysis for GBD 2017 had three main components. Diarrhoea mortality was modelled using vital registration data, demographic surveillance data, and verbal autopsy data in a predictive, Bayesian, ensemble modelling tool; and the attribution of risk factors and interventions for diarrhoea were modelled in a counterfactual framework that combines modelled population-level prevalence of the exposure to each risk or intervention with the relative risk of diarrhoea given exposure to that factor. We assessed the relative and absolute change in diarrhoea mortality rate between 1990 and 2017, and used the change in risk factor exposure and sociodemographic status to explain differences in the trends of diarrhoea mortality among children younger than 5 years.
Findings
Diarrhoea was responsible for an estimated 533 768 deaths (95% uncertainty interval 477 162–593 145) among children younger than 5 years globally in 2017, a rate of 78·4 deaths (70·1–87·1) per 100 000 children. The diarrhoea mortality rate ranged between countries by over 685 deaths per 100 000 children. Diarrhoea mortality per 100 000 globally decreased by 69·6% (63·1–74·6) between 1990 and 2017. Among the risk factors considered in this study, those responsible for the largest declines in the diarrhoea mortality rate were reduction in exposure to unsafe sanitation (13·3% decrease, 11·2–15·5), childhood wasting (9·9% decrease, 9·6–10·2), and low use of oral rehydration solution (6·9% decrease, 4·8–8·4).
Interpretation
Diarrhoea mortality has declined substantially since 1990, although there are variations by country. Improvements in sociodemographic indicators might explain some of these trends, but changes in exposure to risk factors—particularly unsafe sanitation, childhood growth failure, and low use of oral rehydration solution—appear to be related to the relative and absolute rates of decline in diarrhoea mortality. Although the most effective interventions might vary by country or region, identifying and scaling up the interventions aimed at preventing and protecting against diarrhoea that have already reduced diarrhoea mortality could further avert many thousands of deaths due to this illness.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli causes diarrhoea, leading to substantial mortality and morbidity in children, but no specific vaccine exists. This trial tested an oral, inactivated, enterotoxigenic E coli vaccine (ETVAX), which has been previously shown to be safe and highly immuongenic in Swedish and Bangladeshi adults. We tested the safety and immunogenicity of ETVAX, consisting of four E coli strains overexpressing the most prevalent colonisation factors (CFA/I, CS3, CS5, and CS6) and a toxoid (LCTBA) administered with or without a double-mutant heat-labile enterotoxin (dmLT) as an adjuvant, in Bangladeshi children.
Methods
We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, age-descending, phase 1/2 trial in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Healthy children in one of three age groups (24–59 months, 12–23 months, and 6–11 months) were eligible. Children were randomly assigned with block randomisation to receive either ETVAX, with or without dmLT, or placebo. ETVAX (half [5·5 × 1010 cells], quarter [2·5 × 1010 cells], or eighth [1·25 × 1010 cells] adult dose), with or without dmLT adjuvant (2·5 μg, 5·0 μg, or 10·0 μg), or placebo were administered orally in two doses 2 weeks apart. Investigators and participants were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability, assessed in all children who received at least one dose of vaccine. Antibody responses to vaccine antigens, defined as at least a two-times increase in antibody levels between baseline and post-immunisation, were assessed as secondary endpoints. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02531802.
Findings
Between Dec 7, 2015, and Jan 10, 2017, we screened 1500 children across the three age groups, of whom 430 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the different treatment groups (130 aged 24–59 months, 100 aged 12–23 months, and 200 aged 6–11 months). All participants received at least one dose of vaccine. No solicited adverse events occurred that were greater than moderate in severity, and most were mild. The most common solicited event was vomiting (ten [8%] of 130 patients aged 24–59 months, 13 [13%] of 100 aged 12–23 months, and 29 [15%] of 200 aged 6–11 months; mostly of mild severity), which appeared related to dose and age. The addition of dmLT did not modify the safety profile. Three serious adverse events occurred but they were not considered related to the study drug. Mucosal IgA antibody responses in lymphocyte secretions were detected against all primary vaccine antigens (CFA/I, CS3, CS5, CS6, and the LCTBA toxoid) in most participants in the two older age groups, whereas such responses to four of the five antigens were less frequent and of lower magnitude in infants aged 6–11 months than in older children. Faecal secretory IgA immune responses were recorded against all vaccine antigens in infants aged 6–11 months. 78 (56%) of 139 infants aged 6–11 months who were vaccinated developed mucosal responses against at least three of the vaccine antigens versus 14 (29%) of 49 of the infants given placebo. Addition of the adjuvant dmLT enhanced the magnitude, breadth, and kinetics (based on number of responders after the first dose of vaccine) of immune responses in infants.
Interpretation
The encouraging safety and immunogenicity of ETVAX and benefit of dmLT adjuvant in young children support its further assessment for protective efficacy in children in enterotoxigenic E coli-endemic areas.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Influenza viruses cause substantial annual morbidity and mortality globally. Current vaccines protect against influenza only when well matched to the circulating strains. However, antigenic drift can cause considerable mismatches between vaccine and circulating strains, substantially reducing vaccine effectiveness. Moreover, current seasonal vaccines are ineffective against pandemic influenza, and production of a vaccine matched to a newly emerging virus strain takes months. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for a broadly protective influenza virus vaccine. We aimed to test the ability of chimeric H1 haemagglutinin-based universal influenza virus vaccine candidates to induce broadly cross-reactive antibodies targeting the stalk domain of group 1 haemagglutinin-expressing influenza viruses.
Methods
We did a randomised, observer-blinded, phase 1 study in healthy adults in two centres in the USA. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three prime–boost, chimeric haemagglutinin-based vaccine regimens or one of two placebo groups. The vaccine regimens included a chimeric H8/1, intranasal, live-attenuated vaccine on day 1 followed by a non-adjuvanted, chimeric H5/1, intramuscular, inactivated vaccine on day 85; the same regimen but with the inactivated vaccine being adjuvanted with AS03; and an AS03-adjuvanted, chimeric H8/1, intramuscular, inactivated vaccine followed by an AS03-adjuvanted, chimeric H5/1, intramuscular, inactivated vaccine. In this planned interim analysis, the primary endpoints of reactogenicity and safety were assessed by blinded study group. We also assessed anti-H1 haemagglutinin stalk, anti-H2, anti-H9, and anti-H18 IgG antibody titres and plasmablast and memory B-cell responses in peripheral blood. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03300050.
Findings
Between Oct 10, 2017, and Nov 27, 2017, 65 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned. The adjuvanted inactivated vaccine, but not the live-attenuated vaccine, induced a substantial serum IgG antibody response after the prime immunisation, with a seven times increase in anti-H1 stalk antibody titres on day 29. After boost immunisation, all vaccine regimens induced detectable anti-H1 stalk antibody (2·2–5·6 times induction over baseline), cross-reactive serum IgG antibody, and peripheral blood plasmablast responses. An unsolicited adverse event was reported for 29 (48%) of 61 participants. Solicited local adverse events were reported in 12 (48%) of 25 participants following prime vaccination with intramuscular study product or placebo, in 12 (33%) of 36 after prime immunisation with intranasal study product or placebo, and in 18 (32%) of 56 following booster doses of study product or placebo. Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 14 (56%) of 25 after prime immunisation with intramuscular study product or placebo, in 22 (61%) of 36 after immunisation with intranasal study product or placebo, and in 21 (38%) of 56 after booster doses of study product or placebo. Disaggregated safety data were not available at the time of this interim analysis.
Interpretation
The tested chimeric haemagglutinin-based, universal influenza virus vaccine regimens elicited cross-reactive serum IgG antibodies that targeted the conserved haemagglutinin stalk domain. This is the first proof-of-principle study to show that high anti-stalk titres can be induced by a rationally designed vaccine in humans and opens up avenues for further development of universal influenza virus vaccines. On the basis of the blinded study group, the vaccine regimens were tolerable and no safety concerns were observed.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Despite large reductions in under-5 lower respiratory infection (LRI) mortality in many locations, the pace of progress for LRIs has generally lagged behind that of other childhood infectious diseases. To better inform programmes and policies focused on preventing and treating LRIs, we assessed the contributions and patterns of risk factor attribution, intervention coverage, and sociodemographic development in 195 countries and territories by drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) LRI estimates.
Methods
We used four strategies to model LRI burden: the mortality due to LRIs was modelled using vital registration data, demographic surveillance data, and verbal autopsy data in a predictive ensemble modelling tool; the incidence of LRIs was modelled using population representative surveys, health-care utilisation data, and scientific literature in a compartmental meta-regression tool; the attribution of risk factors for LRI mortality was modelled in a counterfactual framework; and trends in LRI mortality were analysed applying changes in exposure to risk factors over time. In GBD, infectious disease mortality, including that due to LRI, is among HIV-negative individuals. We categorised locations based on their burden in 1990 to make comparisons in the changing burden between 1990 and 2017 and evaluate the relative percent change in mortality rate, incidence, and risk factor exposure to explain differences in the health loss associated with LRIs among children younger than 5 years.
Findings
In 2017, LRIs caused 808 920 deaths (95% uncertainty interval 747 286–873 591) in children younger than 5 years. Since 1990, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of deaths (from 2 337 538 to 808 920 deaths; 65·4% decrease, 61·5–68·5) and in mortality rate (from 362·7 deaths [330·1–392·0] per 100 000 children to 118·9 deaths [109·8–128·3] per 100 000 children; 67·2% decrease, 63·5–70·1). LRI incidence declined globally (32·4% decrease, 27·2–37·5). The percent change in under-5 mortality rate and incidence has varied across locations. Among the risk factors assessed in this study, those responsible for the greatest decrease in under-5 LRI mortality between 1990 and 2017 were increased coverage of vaccination against Haemophilus influenza type b (11·4% decrease, 0·0–24·5), increased pneumococcal vaccine coverage (6·3% decrease, 6·1–6·3), and reductions in household air pollution (8·4%, 6·8–9·2).
Interpretation
Our findings show that there have been substantial but uneven declines in LRI mortality among countries between 1990 and 2017. Although improvements in indicators of sociodemographic development could explain some of these trends, changes in exposure to modifiable risk factors are related to the rates of decline in LRI mortality. No single intervention would universally accelerate reductions in health loss associated with LRIs in all settings, but emphasising the most dominant risk factors, particularly in countries with high case fatality, can contribute to the reduction of preventable deaths.

abstract = "Summary
Human African trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense is a parasitic infection that usually progresses to coma and death unless treated. WHO has updated its guidelines for the treatment of this infection on the basis of independent literature reviews and using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. The first-line treatment options, pentamidine and nifurtimox–eflornithine combination therapy, have been expanded to include fexinidazole, an oral monotherapy given a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency. Fexinidazole is recommended for individuals who are aged 6 years and older with a bodyweight of 20 kg or more, who have first-stage or second-stage gambiense human African trypanosomiasis and a cerebrospinal fluid leucocyte count less than 100 per μL. Nifurtimox–eflornithine combination therapy remains recommended for patients with 100 leucocytes per μL or more. Without clinical suspicion of severe second-stage disease, lumbar puncture can be avoided and fexinidazole can be given. Fexinidazole should only be administered under supervision of trained health staff. Because these recommendations are expected to change clinical practice considerably, health professionals should consult the detailed WHO guidelines. These guidelines will be updated as evidence accrues."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The short-term and long-term consequences of septic arthritis are uncertain. We aimed to determine risk of mortality and adverse joint outcomes following septic arthritis of the native knee.
Methods
We did a retrospective cohort study in patients who received arthroscopic knee washout for septic arthritis in England between April 1, 1997, and March 31, 2017, using data in the national Hospital Episode Statistics database. Patients with previous knee surgery to the same knee were excluded. Mortality within 90 days, adverse joint outcomes (arthrodesis, amputation, arthroplasty) within 1 year, and arthroplasty within 15 years were determined. Mortality in patients with a primary admitting diagnosis of septic arthritis (ICD-10) was compared with that in patients in whom septic arthritis was a secondary diagnosis.
Findings
12 132 patients were included (mean age 56·6 years [SD 24·9]) of whom 4307 (36%) were female. In 10 195 (84%) patients with septic arthritis as the primary admitting diagnosis, 90-day mortality was 7·05% (95% CI 6·56–7·57; 719 patients), rising to 22·69% (20·80–24·68; 418 patients) in 1842 patients older than 79 years. Secondary septic arthritis diagnosis versus primary diagnosis was associated with an adjusted odds ratio for mortality of 2·10 (95% CI 1·79–2·46; p<0·0001). In 11 393 patients with at least 1 year follow-up, the 1 year rates were 0·13% (95% CI 0·07–0·22; 15 patients) for arthrodesis, 0·40% (0·30–0·54; 46 patients) for amputation, and 1·33%; (1·13–1·56; 152 patients) for arthroplasty. Within 15 years, 159 (8·76%; 95% CI 7·50–10·15) of 1816 patients had received arthroplasty, corresponding to an annual risk of arthroplasty that was about six times that of the general population (risk ratio 6·14, 95% CI 4·95–7·62; p<0·0001).
Interpretation
The consequences of septic knee arthritis in patients undergoing arthroscopic knee washout are serious. These findings highlight the potentially devastating outcomes associated with sepsis from musculoskeletal joint infection.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to global health. Although detailed information about antibiotic use in high-income countries is available, little is known regarding the use of antibiotics and cumulative exposure to antibiotics in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to quantify antibiotic exposure in children younger than 5 years in LMICs.
Methods
We did a cross-sectional study in sick children younger than 5 years who attended a health-care facility in eight LMICs (Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nepal, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda) between May, 2006, and December, 2016. Demographic and Health Surveys were used to estimate the cumulative number of illnesses related to a fever or cough and the cumulative number of visits to a health-care facility because of these illnesses for each country. We also used clinical observation data from nationally representative health-care facility-based Service Provision Assessment (SPA) surveys to estimate the proportion of children who were prescribed an antibiotic during a visit to a health-care facility and the number of antibiotic prescriptions issued that were unrelated to fever or respiratory problems. By combining these estimates, and using bootstrap analysis to compute uncertainty intervals, we estimated cumulative antibiotic exposure in children from birth up to age 5 years in each LMIC.
Findings
From SPA surveys, we identified 22 519 clinical observations of children younger than 5 years who visited a health-care facility because of an illness between July, 2007, and December, 2016. From DHS surveys, we identified 68 826 children younger than 5 years who visited a health-care facility between May, 2006, and November, 2016. 85·4% of health-care facility visits were related to either a fever or cough. Antibiotics were prescribed to 80·5% of children diagnosed with respiratory illness, 50·1% with diarrhoea, and 28·3% with malaria. The mean number of antibiotic prescriptions issued to children between birth and age 5 years across the eight LMICs was 24·5 (95% CI 22·6–26·7), ranging from 7·1 (6·3–7·9) in Senegal to 59·1 (54·1–64·6) in Uganda.
Interpretation
Between birth and age 5 years, children in LMICs are prescribed a remarkably high number of antibiotics. A large proportion of these prescriptions appear to be unnecessary. National and local efforts to reduce unnecessary prescription of antibiotics to children would likely improve both patient wellbeing (in terms of preventing side-effects) and reduce the global threat of antimicrobial resistance.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Among all WHO regions, the WHO European Region has the highest proportion of drug-resistant tuberculosis among new and retreated cases. The 18 high-priority countries in eastern Europe and central Asia account for 85% of the tuberculosis incidence and more than 90% of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases emerging in the region. We aimed to analyse time-series trends in notification rates of drug-resistant tuberculosis among new tuberculosis cases in the 18 high-priority countries in the WHO European Region.
Methods
We used country data stored in WHO's global tuberculosis database. For each country, we calculated annual notification rates per 100 000 population of new tuberculosis cases and of drug-resistant tuberculosis among new cases reported from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2017. We computed annual percentage changes of notification rates and identified time-points of significant change in trends using the joinpoint regression method.
Findings
All 17 countries with data (no data available from Turkmenistan) showed a significant decline in new tuberculosis notification rates in the most recent years since the last joinpoint if one was identified. Notification rates of drug-resistant tuberculosis showed diverse trends, with substantial year-to-year variation. In the most recent years, notification rates of drug-resistant tuberculosis among new tuberculosis cases were decreasing in two countries (Estonia and Latvia), increasing in eight countries (Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova [Republic of Moldova], Romania, Russia [Russian Federation], Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan), and stable in seven countries (Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, and Turkey).
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that countries in the WHO European Region are more successful in controlling drug-susceptible tuberculosis than drug-resistant forms, and as a result, the proportion of drug-resistant strains among newly notified patients with tuberculosis is increasing in many settings. Two countries showed that it is possible to decrease incidence of both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis. If no additional efforts are made in prevention and care of patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis, further decline of the tuberculosis burden will be halted. Further studies are needed to investigate the success stories and document the most effective interventions to reach the target to end tuberculosis by 2030.

Background
The epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of social protection and biomedical interventions for tuberculosis-affected households might be improved by risk stratification. We therefore derived and externally validated a household-level risk score to predict tuberculosis among contacts of patients with tuberculosis.
Methods
In this prospective cohort study, we recruited tuberculosis-affected households from 15 desert shanty towns in Ventanilla and 17 urban communities in Callao, Lima, Peru. Tuberculosis-affected households included index patients with a new diagnosis of tuberculosis and their contacts who reported being in the same house as the index patient for more than 6 h per week in the 2 weeks preceding index patient diagnosis. Tuberculosis-affected households were not included if the index patient had no eligible contacts or lived alone. We followed contacts until 2018 and defined household tuberculosis, the primary outcome, as any contact having any form of tuberculosis within 3 years. We used logistic regression to identify characteristics of index patients, contacts, and households that were predictive of household tuberculosis, and used these to derive and externally validate a household-level score.
Findings
Between Dec 12, 2007, and Dec 31, 2015, 16 505 contacts from 3 301 households in Ventanilla were included in a derivation cohort. During the 3-year follow-up, tuberculosis occurred in contacts of index patients in 430 (13%, 95% CI 12–14) households. Index patient predictors were pulmonary tuberculosis and sputum smear grade, age, and the maximum number of hours any contact had spent with the index patient while they had any cough. Household predictors were drug use, schooling of the female head of a household, and lower food spending. Contact predictors were if any of the contacts were children, number of lower-weight (body-mass index [BMI] <20·0 kg/m2) adult contacts, number of normal-weight (BMI 20·0–24·9 kg/m2) adult contacts, and number of past or present household members who previously had tuberculosis. In this derivation cohort, the score c statistic was 0·77 and the risk of household tuberculosis in the highest scoring quintile was 31% (95% CI 25–38; 65 of 211) versus 2% (95% CI 0–4; four of 231) in the lowest scoring quintile. We externally validated the risk score in a cohort of 4248 contacts from 924 households in Callao recruited between April 23, 2014, and Dec 31, 2015. During follow-up, tuberculosis occurred in contacts of index patients in 120 (13%, 95% CI 11–15) households. The score c statistic in this cohort was 0·75 and the risk of household tuberculosis in the highest scoring quintile was 28% (95% CI 21–36; 43 of 154) versus 1% (95% CI 0–5; two of 148) in the lowest scoring quintile. The highest-scoring third of households captured around 70% of all tuberculosis among contacts. A simplified risk score including only five variables performed similarly, with only a small reduction in performance.
Interpretation
This externally validated score will enable comprehensive biosocial, household-level interventions to be targeted to tuberculosis-affected households that are most likely to benefit.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) might have higher sensitivity than its predecessor, Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), but its role in tuberculous meningitis diagnosis is uncertain. We aimed to compare Xpert Ultra with Xpert for the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected adults.
Methods
In this prospective, randomised, diagnostic accuracy study, adults (≥16 years) with suspected tuberculous meningitis from a single centre in Vietnam were randomly assigned to cerebrospinal fluid testing by either Xpert Ultra or Xpert at baseline and, if treated for tuberculous meningitis, after 3–4 weeks of treatment. Test performance (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values) was calculated for Xpert Ultra and Xpert and compared against clinical and mycobacterial culture reference standards. Analyses were done for all patients and by HIV status.
Findings
Between Oct 16, 2017, and Feb 10, 2019, 205 patients were randomly assigned to Xpert Ultra (n=103) or Xpert (n=102). The sensitivities of Xpert Ultra and Xpert for tuberculous meningitis diagnosis against a reference standard of definite, probable, and possible tuberculous meningitis were 47·2% (95% CI 34·4–60·3; 25 of 53 patients) for Xpert Ultra and 39·6% (27·6–53·1; 21 of 53) for Xpert (p=0·56); specificities were 100·0% (95% CI 92·0–100·0; 44 of 44) and 100·0% (92·6–100·0; 48 of 48), respectively. In HIV-negative patients, the sensitivity of Xpert Ultra was 38·9% (24·8–55·1; 14 of 36) versus 22·9% (12·1–39·0; eight of 35) by Xpert (p=0·23). In HIV co-infected patients, the sensitivities were 64·3% (38·8–83·7; nine of 14) for Xpert Ultra and 76·9% (49·7–91·8; ten of 13) for Xpert (p=0·77). Negative predictive values were 61·1% (49·6–71·5) for Xpert Ultra and 60·0% (49·0–70·0) for Xpert. Against a reference standard of mycobacterial culture, sensitivities were 90·9% (72·2–97·5; 20 of 22 patients) for Xpert Ultra and 81·8% (61·5–92·7; 18 of 22) for Xpert (p=0·66); specificities were 93·9% (85·4–97·6; 62 of 66) and 96·9% (89·5–91·2; 63 of 65), respectively. Six (22%) of 27 patients had a positive test by Xpert Ultra after 4 weeks of treatment versus two (9%) of 22 patients by Xpert.
Interpretation
Xpert Ultra was not statistically superior to Xpert for the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected adults. A negative Xpert Ultra or Xpert test does not rule out tuberculous meningitis. New diagnostic strategies are urgently required.
