Lack of awareness of the disease, its complications, combined with lack of financial resources among the underprivileged, often results in late detection and more complications in them. To combat this, healthcare delivered at the doorstep through the use of a customised mobile medical van is a potentially attractive option. We used a customized mobile van (included trained personnel, glucose meters, fundus evaluation camera, apparatus for detection of neuropathy and foot circulation and net enabled Skype calling for remote consultation) for educating general population regarding healthy lifestyle and screening, management and intervention in patients with diabetes. The project covered 10 underprivileged areas (n, 2,31,000 people) in Delhi. Total of 24,072 individuals (10.9% of total population) attended 352 awareness sessions. A total 3,12,347 visits (included repeat visits) were carried out for screening, education and management for obesity and diabetes. During screening (n, 16,834), 2933 subjects (18.7%) had high random blood glucose levels (>200 mg/dL) and had a blood pressure averaging 127.1 ± 23.6/81.3 ± 16.6 mm of mercury (n, 16,339). A pre-post intensive lifestyle counselling for 6 months in a subset of 352 diabetic patients (of which 77.8% i.e. n, 274 were overweight/obese) showed a significant lowering in weight (p < 0.001). In addition, 292 frontline workers and 256 paramedical workers were given training regarding lifestyle and diabetes, over 20 sessions. Based on achievements of this project of spreading awareness, screening, and management of diabetes and obesity in the large number of individuals in urban underprivileged colony, we believe this project could be extended to other cities and rural areas of India, and to other developing countries as well."

To evaluate the association between elevated body fat percent (BF%) and the prevalence of insulin resistance (IR) in the adult population with body mass index (BMI) in the normal values.
Methods
We carry out an analytical cross-sectional study. The participants attended outpatient from 2012 to 2016 in a private clinic in Lima-Peru between 18 and 60 years with a BMI between 19 and 24.9/Kg/m2. We defined elevated BF% if the values were greater than 25% in men and 30% in women and IR with a cut-off point of HOMA-IR based in the 75th percentile. We performed a generalized linear model from family Poisson (crude and adjusted) with robust standard errors to evaluate the association between BF% and the IR. We reported as association measure the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Results
We included 284 participants, the average age was 33.77 ± 10.86 (SD) years and the percentage of women was 88.1%. The prevalence of elevated BF% was 71.13% and the prevalence of IR was 25%. We found an association between the elevated BF% and IR, PR = 3.17; 95% CI: 1.46–6.91.
Conclusions
Body fat percentage seems to be a good indicator of IR in patients with normal BMI and without endocrine comorbidities. Longitudinal prospective studies are recommended to corroborate our findings."

This study investigates the association of two potential Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) gene polymorphisms (rs9939609 and rs918031) as potential predictors of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in obese Iraqi population and their metabolic effects on hyperglycemia and insulin sensitivity.
Materials & methods
The study included 400 participants with obesity & T2D, with a matching 400 obese non-diabetic cohort. Venous blood samples were collected for DNA extraction. Using specific primers and restriction enzymes, genotyping was performed to identify the various alleles for each gene. The genotype and allele frequencies determined by multinomial logistic regression analysis for FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs9939609) among all the study groups.
Results
There is a two-fold increase in the risk of T2D within the homozygous genotype (TT) group (OR = 2.43, CI 95% 3.57–11.2, P ≤ 0.001) as compared to the wild type (TA). In addition, there was a significantly higher level of the minor allele genotype (T) in T2D patients when compared to the control group, (P ≤ 0.001).
Conclusion
We conclude that the FTO rs9939609 genotype significantly affect the development of insulin resistance, therefore the future occurrence of T2D, in obese individuals."

To identify the prevalence of micro- and macro-vascular complications and their associated factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus in Bangladesh.
Methods
This retrospective and cross-sectional study was conducted in six diabetes hospitals, covered urban and rural population. From April to September in 2017, a total of 1253 type 2 diabetes patients aged ≥18 years were recruited. Participants answered a pre-tested electronic questionnaire, and their medical records were reviewed for documented diabetes complications.
Results
Mean age was 55.1 (±12.6) years. Among macrovascular complications, the prevalence of coronary artery disease was found to be 30.5%, 10.1% for stroke and 12.0% for diabetic foot. Among microvascular complications, nephropathy was prevalent among 34.2%, retinopathy among 25.1% and neuropathy among 5.8% of patients. Risk factors found to be associated with one or more of the complications were female gender, higher age, lower education level, an urban area of residence, higher household income, smoking, physical inactivity, hypertension, poor glycaemic control, poor adherence to treatment, longer duration of diabetes, and insulin use.
Conclusion
Diabetes complications are highly prevalent among type 2 diabetes population in Bangladesh. Prevention strategies should focus on increasing physical activity, weight loss, smoking cessation, and more strict control of hypertension and glycaemic level."

Oxidative stress (OS) plays a major role in pathogenic mechanisms associated with metabolic syndrome (Mets) yet the main component of Mets contributing most to OS is not well elucidated. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the oxidative-antioxidative status in Mets subjects and to determine the main predicting component of OS.
Methods
Anthropometric measures, fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, antioxidant enzymes [catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)], reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl were assessed in 172 adult UAE residents. International Diabetes Federation criteria were used for Mets diagnosis. Mets Scores (0–5) were calculated and assigned per subject based on number of components.
Results
Of all participants, 22.1% had Mets and 49.4% had large waist circumference (WC). Significant lower levels of catalase, SOD, GPx and GSH, and higher levels of MDA and protein carbonyl were observed in subjects with Mets. In addition, catalase, SOD, GPx, and GSH correlated negatively, while MDA and protein carbonyl correlated positively with almost all Mets components. Similar trend of correlations was noticed with Mets Scores. When adjusted for age and gender, linear regression analysis revealed that subjects with large WC demonstrated significantly lower levels of antioxidative enzymes and GSH, and higher levels of MDA and protein carbonyl. Consequently, WC emerged as the best predictor of OS.
Conclusions
The degree of OS is dependent on the Mets Scores, and WC contributes independently to increased OS among adults in UAE."

abstract = "Aim
Diabetic patients predispose to vascular diseases such as nephropathy, and retinopathy. Poor adherence to medical treatment and dietary recommendations in uncontrolled diabetes leads to vascular damages. Vitamin D has been extensively studied and found to be protective against diabetes mellitus. YKL-40 and Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) are considered to exert crucial role in diabetes and its complications. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate effects of vitamin D supplementation on serum levels of YKL-40 and MCP-1 involved in the development of diabetic complications.
Methods
For 12 weeks, 48 type 2 diabetic patients enrolled in the trial and randomly were divided into two groups (n = 24 per group), receiving one of the following: 100 μg (4000 IU) vitamin D or placebo. Before and after intervention, serumYKL-40, MCP-1, insulin, IL-6, TNF-α, 25- (OH) vitamin D and HbA1c were measured.
Results
Our results revealed that serum levels of 25 (OH) vitamin D significantly increased in vitamin D group (p < 0.001). Vitamin D supplementation also significantly reduced serum YKL-40 levels (−22.7 vs. −2.4 ng/ml; (p-value = 0.003)). There was a significant decline in MCP-1 concentration in intervention group at the end of the study (−45.7 vs. −0.9 pg/ml; (p = 0.001)). Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in IL-6, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR in intervention group after 3 months supplementation.
Conclusions
Daily vitamin D supplementation effectively reduced circulatory YKL-40 and MCP-1 levels in patients with type-2 diabetes and vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D might contribute in reducing diabetic complications via modulating YKL-40 and MCP-1 signaling pathways."

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among Iranian patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) through meta-analysis.
Methods
This is a systematic review article based on MOOSE and PRISMA guidelines. Review of the literature was done using databases including Magiran, Barakat Knowledge Network System, SID, RICST, IranDoc, PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and the Google Scholar search engine without time limit until December, 2018. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test and I2 index. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 2 according to a random-effects model. P-values less than 0.05 were considered as the significance level.
Results
The analysis consisted of 44 studies including 10,349 Iranian patients with DM. The prevalence of depression was estimated to be 61.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 56.6–66.7). The lowest and highest prevalence of depression based on regions was in the North (56.7% [95%CI: 44.9–67.8]) and the East (64.2% [95%CI: 30.7–87.9]), respectively. The depression prevalence in females and males was 63.9% (95%CI: 54.0–72.8) and 46.3% (95%CI: 36.4–56.4), respectively, The prevalence of mild, moderate, severe and highly severe depression was estimated to be 24.4% (95%CI: 21.0–28.2), 19.1% (95%CI: 15.2–23.9), 11.4% (95%CI: 8.6–14.9), and 4.6% (95%CI: 3.4–6.1), respectively. In eight studies, the prevalence of anxiety in Iranian patients with DM was estimated to be 64.5% (95%CI: 42.0–82.1).
Conclusions
Depression and anxiety are more prevalent among Iranian patients with DM compared with developed countries. Therefore, regular psychiatric consultation is required for the early diagnosis and treatment of depression and anxiety in these patients."

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common female endocrinopathy among premenopausal women associated with hyperandrogenism, obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and inflammation. Oxidative stress is an important component of cardio-metabolic risk seen in PCOS.
Material and methods
A total of 95 women with PCOS and 95 healthy controls were included in this observational study. Serum PON1 activity and stress markers were measured by spectrophotometric methods. Circulating TF level was measured by ELISA.
Results
We found decreased PON1 activity and increased TF levels in women with PCOS compared to healthy controls. Fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, testosterone, LDL-C, MDA, PC and SOD activity were significantly increased whereas FGIR, QUICKI, HDLC, CAT and TAC were significantly decreased in PCOS women than controls. We observed a positive association of PON1 activity with FGIR, QUICKI, HDL-C and TAC, and its negative association was observed with LH, testosterone, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR in PCOS women. We further observed a positive association of TF with waist, waist to hip ratio, BMI, glucose 1hr, cholesterol, LDL-C, SGPT, uric acid and SOD activity in PCOS women.
Conclusions
Decreased PON1 activity and raised circulating TF levels are respective indicators of pro-inflammatory and procoagulant status in PCOS women. The imbalanced oxidant/antioxidant status further supports the evidences that PCOS is an oxidant state. Further, the association of PON1 activity and TF levels with the clinical, laboratory findings and stress marker levels suggest that these factors taken together are involved in aggravating the pro-inflammatory status in PCOS women."

Following T2DM, dyslipidemia is known well for the main reason of vascular complication leading to atherosclerosis and impaired life expectancy in diabetes. Thus, a new prediction marker in T2DM could help prevent the progression disease despite of metabolic control. Signal peptide–CUB-EGF like containing protein 2 (SCUBE2), has been detected in vascular endothelium and was affected by cytokines. Recently, SCUBE2 was reported to increase in atherosclerotic human coronary artery, involving vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and macrophages. The aims of this study were to examine the expression level of SCUBE2 in T2DM patients with dyslipidemia and its correlation with endothelial dysfunction marker, endothelin-1 (ET-1) in this group. This study design was cross sectional control study, recruited 28 patients diagnosed as T2DM who were found with dyslipidemia and 15 healthy control subjects. Our results showed that T2DM patients showed higher LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and ET-1 expression level compared to healthy subjects. Further, we found that SCUBE2 had strong correlation with ET-1 in these dyslipidemic T2DM patients. In conclusion, our study confirmed first that SCUBE2 was upregulated in T2DM with dyslipidemia. Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis of ET-1 and SCUBE2 in this group showed high correlation r = 0.797, P < 0.001, suggesting that SCUBE2 may plausible target in vascular function changes in dyslipidemic T2DM.

A total of 480 overweight and obese patients were included in this study, referred to hospital Duc Tovar of Tangier during a period of 12 months. The collection of data has been done through a questionnaire which included anthropometric, clinical and biochemical characteristics of each patient. Statistical analyses included chi2 test, student's t-test, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression analyses.
Results
The mean age of our patients was 45.56 ± 12.23 years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 33.97 ± 5.84 Kg/m2 and the average waist circumference (WC) was 109.78 ± 15.42 cm. Overweight affected 25.2% and obesity 74.8%, whose 88.8% of subjects had abdominal obesity. All the metabolic abnormalities were significantly associated with abdominal obesity (measured by WC). However, only total cholesterol (p₌0.001) and triglycerides (p₌0.000) were significantly associated with different classes of obesity (measured by BMI). The most common complications of obesity and overweight were: type 2 diabetes (56.8%), arterial hypertension (52%), dyslipidaemia (43.9%), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (24.3%). Hypertension and hyperglycaemia were the major risk factors for developing CVD with OR = 3.81 (95% CI:1.363–10.698; p < 0.05) and OR = 2.610 (95% CI:1.648–4.133; p < 0.001) respectively.
Conclusion
Obesity exposes to several chronic complications, the most important in our study were type 2 diabetes and hypertension; these complications increased significantly with abdominal obesity that has constituted important risk factors of CVD."

Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of curcumin on serum adiponectin concentration.
Methods
We searched PubMed/Medline, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google scholar databases up to April 2019. RCTs conducted among human adults studied the effects of curcumin on serum adiponectin concentrations as an outcome variable was included. The weighted mean differences (WMD) and standard deviations (SD) of change in serum adiponectin levels were calculated. The random effects model was used for deriving a summary of mean estimates with their corresponding SDs.
Results
Out of 313 records, 6 trials that enrolled 652 subjects were included. The pooled results showed that curcumin supplementation significantly increased adiponectin concentrations in comparison with placebo (WMD: 0.82 Hedges' g; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.33 to 1.30, P˂0.001). Greater effects on adiponectin were observed in trials lasting ≤10 weeks (WMD: 1.05 Hedges’ g; 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.45, P˂0.001).
Conclusion
Curcumin significantly improves adiponectin concentrations. However, due to some limitations in this study, further studies are needed to reach a definitive conclusion about the effect of curcumin on the levels of adiponectin."

Recently, youth intake of added sugar has been growing. The incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) has risen dramatically in parallel with these changes. Excess added sugar is a key risk factor for weight gain and T2DM in many cohort studies. The current study was implemented to examine the nutritional knowledge, attitude and practice pattern among UAE undergraduates.
Method
Random sampling was used to approach 400 undergraduate students from UAE. The data analysis was performed by using SPSS version 24. A correlation analysis was performed using Pearson and Spearman correlation tests. Statistical analysis was conducted using Chi-square test, T-test, and Kruskal Wallis test.
Results
Added sugar consumption is widely prevalent among university students in UAE. Only 19% of the enrolled sample scored high nutritional knowledge level and 56% of the students were considered heavy consumers. White sugar was the preferred added sweeteners among 90% of the sample.
Conclusion
Our study outcomes recommend that strategies that can successfully reduce added sugar might be a significant stage concerning reversing the devastating escalating trends in diabetes, obesity, and promoting health of all populations in UAE."

Noteworthily, diabetes mellitus (DM) and poorly controlled blood glucose increase the risk of mortality and severity of COVID-19. Intravenous (IV) insulin administration with hourly monitoring of blood glucose is the ideal approach in managing patients with hyperglycemic crisis, but it is not judicious to be applied in developing countries where shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) is a major issue. Furthermore, increasing the probability of “already greater risks” for doctors or other healthcare workers contracting COVID-19 seems inappropriate. Thus, an alternative administration strategy and more moderate glucose monitoring to reduce the contact exposure of healthcare workers with COVID-19 patients, by ensuring appropriate blood glucose levels, needs to be performed in this critical pandemic era. Subcutaneous (SC) rapid-acting insulin analog administration could presumably be a solution to this contentious issue."

Diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease are two common and chronic diseases with bidirectional relationship influence public health and quality of life. The aims of this study was to study the impact of resveratrol supplementation in adjunct with non-surgical periodontal therapy on inflammatory, antioxidant, and periodontal markers in patients with type 2 diabetes with periodontal disease.
Materials and methods
In this randomized clinical trial, 43 patients with diabetes and chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated into two intervention and control groups receiving either resveratrol supplements or placebo for 4 weeks. Serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and clinical attachment loss (CAL) as the main index of periodontal marker were measured pre-intervention and post-intervention.
Results
In the intervention group, the mean serum level of IL6 was reduced significantly (P = 0.039) post-intervention (2.19 ± 1.09 and 1.58 ± 1.06). No significant differences were seen in the mean levels of IL6, TNFα, TAC and CAL between two groups post-intervention.
Conclusions
It is suggested that daily consumption of resveratrol supplement may not change TNFα, TAC and CAL, but it would be beneficial in reducing serum levels of IL6. Therefore, further studies are suggested to investigate the effects of resveratrol supplementation along with NST on periodontal status."

However, the effect of both rotating and extended night shift work (12-hr rotating night) on MetS has not well-known. We aimed to examine and clarify the association among petrochemical workers.
Methods
We recruited 1575 eligible workers in this study. According to shift work schedules the participants were divided into following groups: 12-hr fixed day and 12-hr rotating night. Biochemical data, including fasting blood sugar and lipid panel (TC, TG, LDL, and HDL) were determined by blood tests. Demographic data was obtained by interview at the time of blood pressure and anthropometric indices measurements. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) was applied to identify subjects with MetS. The Logistic regression models were used to predict risk of MetS and its components between study groups.
Results
The prevalence of MetS was showed 18.4% (290/1575). We found a significant difference between study groups in the prevalence of MetS (p < 0.05). The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in the 12-hr rotating night group in comparison to the 12-hr fixed day shift group according to unadjusted and full adjusted logistic regression models were estimated 1.26 (0.96, 1.65) and 1.34 (1.01, 1.76), respectively. Among MetS components, we observed the significant higher risk in TG and HDL (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
This study suggests 12-hr rotating night shift as the high-risk group for MetS. More studies needed to confirm our findings."

Cross-sectional study was conducted on T2DM adults of both sexes who attended the outpatient service of Al-Karak Teaching Hospital, Jordan during the period from June 2017 to August 2018. Participants were categorized in two groups according to their glycemic control and the presence of reno-vascular complications. Twenty healthy subjects were recruited as control group. Blood sample was obtained from all participants and used for the assessment of FBG, HbA1c, serum AGEs and sRAGE, serum urea and creatinine; 24 h urine was also collected for the determination of urinary albumin.
Results
Diabetic subjects with vascular complication had a significantly higher serum AGEs 50.3 ± 13 vs. 28.9 ± 8 pg/ml) and AGEs/sRAGE ratio (0.058 ± 0.02 vs. 0.037 ± 0.02) associated with significantly lower serum sRAGE (868.7 ± 50.8 vs. 912.8 ± 294.3) compared to those with no complications.

In addition, we also looked to see what role BMI (Body Mass Index) plays among subjects used for the study. 152 subjects were used for the study: 101 diabetic subjects and 51 non-diabetic control subjects. 5 mL of blood sample was collected from each of the subjects after about 8–10 h of overnight fasting. 3–4 mL of the sample was centrifuged and the serum analysed for glucose. The remaining 1–2 ml was transferred into EDTA bottles and analysed immediately for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C). The BMI (kg/m2) was calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms (kg) by the square of the height in metres (m2). For the BMI, no significant difference was observed between the diabetic subjects (mean = 25.75 kg/m2) and the non-diabetic control subjects (mean = 25.09 kg/m2). Thirty-seven (37) of the diabetic subjects and twenty-three (23) of the non-diabetic subjects had HbA1C levels (mean = 6.96% and 6.29% respectively) that would imply either prediabetes or diabetes but were actually normal going by their fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels. A new chart for the interconversions between FBG and HbA1c and for predicting their expected values from each other was realized, drawn up and recommended for consideration in the management of diabetic patients along with the WHO recommended chart. There are a lot of normal individuals with HbA1c level that does not conform to (or that are simply higher than) what is regarded as the threshold for the onset of diabetes or prediabetes. Generally, the local (Nigerian) glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level can therefore be said to be distinctly higher for a given blood glucose range and should be taken as such in the management of diabetes in this environment. Being overweight or obese is not prerequisite to the development of diabetes or abnormal glycated haemoglobin level."

To compare conversion rates of diabetes in subjects with elevated 1 h plasma glucose (1hrPG) during an OGTT with normal glucose tolerance(NGT) subjects over a period of 11 years.
Methods
4023 subjects were selected from electronic data base of medical records.233 subjects who were followed up for a period of 11 years were included.160 with isolated prediabetes and their combinations were excluded.The remaining 73 were categorized into group1 NGT (n = 37) and group-2 (n = 36) with elevated 1hrPG.Kaplan Meier curves for incident diabetes and Cox proportional hazard model were compared between groups.
Results
During follow up, 10.8% and 44.4% converted to DM in group1 and group2 (p = 0.003). Elevated 1hrPG was associated with incident diabetes(HR 7.9[95%CI 2.2–28.1](p = 0.001)provided better risk assessment.The adjusted risk of event in subjects with elevated 1hrPG is likely to be 7 times more when compared to NGT.Subjects with elevated1hrPG remained free of diabetes for a median period of 7.6 years (95% CI 5.8–7.8) whereas NGT subjects remained free for 10 years (95% CI 8.5–10.0) (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
In conclusion, conversion to DM was higher and risk was 7 times more in subjects with elevated 1hrPG. Elevated 1hrPG during OGTT has to be considered as a distinct entity."

abstract = "Aims
To determine beta cell reserves of patients with type 2 diabetes who are treated with insulin by using fasting C-peptide concentrations and to investigate the clinical features related to C-peptide concentrations.
Materials and methods
Patients with type 2 diabetes, who were using insulin as monotherapy or in combination therapy, were divided into three groups; those with an insufficient beta cell reserve (C-peptide: <0.5 ng/mL), borderline reserve (C-peptide: 0.5–2 ng/mL) and sufficient reserve (C-peptide:> 2 ng/mL).
Results
In the 249 patients (mean age, 61.77 ± 9.34 years; 40.6% male), the mean duration of diabetes was 13.9 ± 8.43 years. The mean HbA1c concentrations, fasting glucose and C-peptide concentrations were 8.88 ± 1.87%, 184.29 ± 77.88 mg/dL and 1.95 ± 1.37 ng/mL, respectively. Fifty-seven percent of patients (n = 142) had a borderline beta cell reserve and 37% (n = 92) had high C-peptide concentrations. Only 6% of patients (n = 15) had an insufficient beta cell reserve. C-peptide levels were positively correlated with waist circumference (r: 0.282; p = 0.001), hip circumference (r: 0.251; p = 0.001), body mass index (r: 0.279; p = 0.001), fasting glucose concentrations (r: 0.309; p = 0.001) and triglyceride concentrations (r: 0.358; p = 0.001).
Conclusion
In this study, almost all patients with type 2 diabetes using insulin were found to have sufficient or borderline beta cell reserves and insulin resistance-related parameters were prominent in those with adequate beta cell reserve.

Both screen time and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are associated with health outcomes. However, limited data exist on the association between screen time and MetS among expatriate adolescents living in United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional school-based study on 473 expatriate adolescents (47% girls) aged 12–18 years in Al-Ain district of Abu Dhabi Emirates in the UAE. Data was collected with the expertise of trained nurses & IDF criteria was used to define MetS. Information on screen time (computer, television, and video game use combined) during a regular day was self-reported, and divided into two categories: <2, or ≥2 h per day. Using logistic regression analyses, adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for the association between screen time and MetS.
Results
A high proportion of adolescents (75.3%) spent ≥2 h daily on screen. The prevalence of MetS was 8.5% in those with <2 h per day of screen time compared with 13.5% in those who reported ≥2 h per day. There was a graded positive association between screen time and MetS (P-trend = 0.01). Each hour increase in screen time was associated with 21% (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08–1.35) greater likelihood of having MetS. The adjusted OR value associated with ≥2 h of daily screen time was 2.20 (95% CI, 1.04–4.67), compared with adolescents who spent less than 2 h of daily screen time.
Conclusion
Higher screen time by expatriate adolescents was associated with increased likelihood of having MetS."

To identify mobile health applications with features for improving the lifestyle of patients with chronic diseases.
Methods
We performed a systematic literature review between November 2017 and May 2018 on the Virtual Health Library's interface. A total of 816 records were identified. In the selection process, 24 studies met inclusion criteria for analysis. Study characteristics were extracted and synthesized.
Results
We identified applications with similar functionalities, such as the use of reminders and medical monitoring. Most of them addressed the treatment of conditions related to an already diagnosed chronic disease, including Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Cardiovascular Diseases, Asthma, Neoplasms, and chronic conditions in general. The main lifestyle changes were the reduction of body weight, promotion of healthy eating, and adherence to the regular practice of physical exercises.
Conclusions
Technology can facilitate health care with simple messages and alerts that aid in adherence to treatment. Changes in lifestyle with the use of applications are remarkable. Benefits may be even greater if more applications address the importance of prevention and not just treatment."

abstract = "Objective
It is usually difficult to clinically identify thyroid abnormalities in diabetics as features of thyroid dysfunction may simulate diabetes symptoms or complications. So, assessing thyroid dysfunction prevalence in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) would help better control of DM and its complications. Several studies reported this prevalence, however, some included small sample size or lacked a control group. We aimed to determine thyroid dysfunction prevalence in diabetic patients as well as its relation to glycemic control.
Methods
A cross-sectional study included 200 patients having type 2 DM and 200 apparently healthy controls. Each participant was tested for fasting and 2-h post-prandial blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C), thyroid function tests: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free tri-iodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), serum total cholesterol and triglycerides and thyroid antibodies; anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) for hypothyroidism only.
Results
There was a significant increase in serum TSH and T3 levels in diabetics when compared with the controls, (P < 0.001, P = 0.001), respectively. Thyroid dysfunction was significantly more prevalent in patients with HbA1c ≥ 8%, (P = 0.0001), and in those having longer diabetes duration, (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
There was a higher prevalence of thyroid dysfunction among patients with type 2 DM. This dysfunction increased with the rise of HbA1c. This could suggest that poor glycemic control may have a role in the development of thyroid dysfunction in type 2 DM patients. Subclinical hypothyroidism was the most prevalent type of thyroid dysfunction in diabetic patients."

Methodology
This was a cross-sectional, observational study conducted in a tertiary hospital and medical research centre of Karnataka, India in which males aged 35 years or more and suffering with T2DM for at-least 10years were enrolled. UI was assessed using International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire – Short Form (ICIQ-SF).
Results
Out of 123 male subjects having T2DM screened for the prevalence of UI, 19 subjects were diagnosed to be having UI as per ICIQ-SF questionnaire, accounting to 15.4% of the total sample. The mean ICIQ score of the 19 subjects having UI was 9.2 ± 1.54 showing that the mean severity of UI was moderate in nature. Study also found that the duration of diabetes was significantly high (mean = 18 ± 4.6 years) and glycemic control was significantly poor (Mean FBS = 210 ± 64.21 mg/dL) in subjects with UI than in subjects without UI.
Conclusions
Prevalence of UI among adult patients with T2DM was 15.4% and is of moderate severity, as assessed by ICIQ-SF. Long duration of Diabetes and poor glycemic control could possibly increase the risk of UI among T2DM patients."

The risks of hypoglycemia, dehydration and kidney injury may theoretically be aggravated by people with type 2 diabetes treated with Insulin and SGLT2 inhibitors during Ramadan. Data on safety and efficacy of SGLT2-I in people with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin is scanty. We aimed to assess the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors during Ramadan in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin, on hypoglycemia, glycemic control and kidney function.
Methods
This is a prospective interventional study on high-risk diabetes patients who insisted on fasting. All patients were treated with insulin ± SGLT2I. All patients received a FGMS and Ramadan focused education. All patients attended clinic before and post Ramadan where they were advised on treatment modification as well as biometric and biochemical measurements.
Results
95 patients enrolled in the study and 49 of them were on SGLT2i. There was a no significant change in creatinine in both groups. FGMS showed an improvement in the sensor-calculated HbA1c from 7.3 ± 1.5 to 6.8 ± 1.1 and from 8 ± 1.6 to 7.7 ± 1.5 in the SGLT2 group and the non-SGT2i groups, respectively. The hypoglycemia was predominantly reported during Ramadan between 12:00 to 18:00 h, while in pre-Ramadan readings was during 2400–0600 and 1200–1800 slots.
Conclusions
This is the first study that assesses the use of SGLT2i along with insulin during Ramadan, using FGMS in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes under optimal care. There was minimal interruption of fasting, significant improvement in glycemic control, and no significant change in the kidney function after Ramadan."

The interest regarding the potential role of dairy products in the prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has emerged. Although results remain mixed, numerous cohort studies have shown that increased dairy consumption is inversely associated with T2D risk. This narrative review evaluates the recent evidence of dairy products intake on T2D risk factors for the prevention of T2D.
Material and method
The review is framed within the systematic review and meta-analyses of cohort studies and the individual randomized controlled trials evidence. We searched for existing meta-analyses of cohort studies that addressed the association of dairy intake with incidence of T2D in adults using the MEDLINE (via PubMed) database. For the interventional studies, the literature searched was conducted using MEDLINE (via PubMed) with the following Medical Subjects Heading (MeSH) terms i.e. dairy OR milk OR cheese OR yogurt AND glucose OR diabetes OR insulin resistance OR insulin sensitivity OR pre-diabetes.
Results
Most of the meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the cohort studies point to a reduced risk of T2D with dairy intake of 3 servings per day. This effect was mainly attributed to low-fat dairy, particularly yogurt and cheese. However, there is no evidence in cohort studies that high-fat dairy intake poses any harm.
Conclusion
Dairy products, when incorporated into a healthy diet, likely do not have detrimental effects on glucose-related outcomes. The potential impact of dairy consumption on glucose tolerance tests, insulin levels, insulin sensitivity measures, and plasma glucose levels warrant future investigation."

abstract = "Objective
The effect of total antioxidant capacity on resting metabolic rate (RMR) and respiratory quotient (RQ) of overweight and obese woman has been debated globally. Total Antioxidant Capacity may have an independent effect on resting metabolic rate and respiratory quotient.
Methods and materials
A study population of 263 aged 18–50 years participated in this cross-sectional study from the communities of Tehran based on cluster sampling. Dietary intake assessed by using a semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) Demographic questions. Anthropometrics measurements for each participant were done. Dietary total antioxidant capacity (DTAC) was calculated by the 147-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and FRAP assay. Resting metabolic rate and respiratory quotient was measured by Indirect calorimetry.
Results
The mean DTAC of the study participants was 1251.8 (SD 893.60). There was a statistically significant relationship between dietary total antioxidant capacity (DTAC) and respiratory quotient (P > 0.013). People with high dietary total antioxidant capacity have tended to show a lower RQ than those with a lower one. There was a significant correlation between DTAC and RQ for both the adjusted model for age, total energy intake, BMI, physical activity, higher DTAC diet and the crude model which were (β = 0.011; SE = 0.005; CI = −0.021_0) and (β = −3.143E-6; SE = 0; CI = 0), respectively. However, we found no correlation between the DTAC and RMR/FFM-RES (P < 0.49). Also, a significantly higher relationship was demonstrated between dietary total antioxidant capacity and intake vegetables (P ≤ 0.006), fruits (P ≤ 0.009), white meet (P ≤ 0.03) and dairy products (P ≤ 0.005).
Conclusion
RQ is correlated with total antioxidant capacity. Increased intake of high DTAC foods may result in weight loss maintenance. This result may suggest a beneficial role of higher-DTAC diets in the prevention of obesity."

abstract = "Aim
Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a complex disease. Interactions between genetic susceptible variants and environmental cues results in the development of this heterogenous disease. Having an understanding of the genetics of T2DM may lead to a better perspective and management of the pathogenesis contributing to T2DM.
Materials and methods
Published primary and secondary sources were reviewed covering the keywords “genetics + type 2 diabetes” using PubMed and Google Scholar as the main databases. Full articles were considered when the title and the abstract was found to be sufficiently related to the review's aim.
Results
Various genetic aspects of T2DM were summarised including a general understanding of the heritability and heterogeneity of T2DM. Furthermore, an explanation of the different genetic modalities that can be used to identify T2DM susceptible genes was provided.
Conclusion
In this day and era, researchers and healthcare professionals working in the field of metabolic disorders should have an understanding of T2DM genetics. The future lies in preventive and management action plans targeting the combination of genetics and environmental risk factors for a better health outcome."

In 2017 the UK's Association of Children's Diabetes Clinicians (ACDC) launched a national educational package to provide training in the use of Freestyle Flash glucose monitoring (GM) to healthcare professionals.
Objective
To evaluate metabolic outcomes and quality of life (QoL) of children with T1DM trained in the use of the Freestyle Flash GM system adopting the ACDC guidelines.
Methods
Prospective study conducted at a single UK children's diabetes unit from 2017 to 2018.52 children with T1DM (age 5–18 yrs) were commenced on the Freestyle Flash GM system, received education and were followed up for 12 months. The Peds QL 3.2 diabetes questionnaire was used to assess QoL before and after the use of the system. HbA1c was measured at 3, 6 and 12 months pre and post use of Freestyle.
Results
52 children (33 M,19 F) with a mean age of 11.6 yrs (range 4 m–17.2 yrs) were evaluated. Mean HbA1c 3 months post Freestyle Flash GM showed a significant improvement when compared with HbA1c values at 12, 6 and 3 months pre Freestyle (p-value 0.040, 0.040, 0.012 respectively). This improvement was not sustained at 6 and 12 months (p-value 0.15, 0.50). The PedsQL3.2 diabetes scores demonstrated significant improvement in patient QoL, reduction of diabetes symptoms and treatment barriers following the use of the new technology (p-values 0.014; 0.018; 0.035 respectively).
Conclusions
Freestyle Flash GM technology associated with appropriate education and regular support by healthcare professionals improves patient quality of life measures in children with T1DM."

Various studies have evaluated the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with diabetes but few studies on prevalence of NAFLD in prediabetes have been performed so far. The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of NAFLD in prediabetics.
Material and methods
In this cross-sectional study, 100 diagnosed cases of Prediabetes were compared with 100 normoglycemic people after random selection from OPD for NAFLD by using various biochemical parameters and ultrasonography.
Results
Among 100 prediabetic cases, IFG was present in 28%, IGT in 26% and both were impaired in 46%. FPG, 2 Hour glucose post OGTT, diastolic blood pressure, weight, BMI, waist circumference, waist hip ratio, waist height ratio was significantly more in prediabetics as compared to controls. On USG, prevalence of NAFLD was more in prediabetics (59%) as compared to controls (26%) with p value =<0.001. Grade 1 fatty liver was present in 37% (n = 37) prediabetics as compare to 22% (n = 22) controls and Grade 2 fatty liver was present in 22% (n = 22) cases as compare to 4% (n = 4) controls with p value < 0.001. SGOT, SGPT, GGT, ALP, UA, TG were significantly higher in prediabetics as compared to controls. GGT and WC are best predictor of NAFLD in pre-diabetes with adjusted odd's ratio of 6.604 and 6.589 respectively.
Conclusion
To conclude with, prevalence of NAFLD is substantially more in prediabetic patients as compared to normoglycemic individuals and elevated WC and GGT were the best predictor of underlying NAFLD among prediabetic individuals."

The global operation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has averted 30 million new infections and nearly 8 million deaths; however, it has an impact on metabolic syndrome (MS) acquisition. As a result, there is growing concern about MS; but strangely the magnitude of MS in HIV-infected cohort, and its differential contribution ART status in Ethiopia has yet to be abundantly studied. Hence, the aim of this study was to estimate and evaluate the difference of the overall magnitude of MS among ART exposed and ART naïve people living with HIV (PLWH).
Materials and methods
An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted at the randomly chosen two hospitals and health centers, in Gedio zone, southern Ethiopia between December 29th, 2017 and January 22nd, 2019. Data were collected using the WHO three step tools. The collected data were fed into Epidata version.3.1 and exported to SPSS version 22 for analysis. The descriptive complex sample analysis method was employed, and the prevalence and differences between groups were computed with a 95% CI.
Result
A total of 633 (n = 422 ART and n = 211 ART naive) PLWH was involved, with the response rate of 92.1%. Of whom, 22.0% (95% CI: 19.0–25.4) of PLWH had MS. It was slightly higher in the ART-exposed (22.5%, 95% CI: 18.7–26.8) than ART naïve (20.9%, 95% CI: 15.2–27.1) group.
Conclusion
The global magnitude of MS in the ART-exposed was relatively higher than ART naïve groups. This dictates the existence of HIV associated MS that necessitates immediate prevention and management strategies."

sustained virologic response (SVR) can be achieved in high percentage of HCV patients with the availability of direct acting antiviral agents DAAs. However, the effect of DAAs on insulin resistance and T2DM has yet to be clearly documented in spite of higher prevalence of T2DM in chronic HCV patients. This study tested the hypothesis that eradication of HCV is associated with either complete recovery or improvement of the symptoms of IR and T2DM.
Patients and methods
In our study 240 Chronic HCV patients candidate to centers of NCCVH with Coordination to departments of internal medicine and clinical pathology, Zagzig University for treatment with DAAs. Measurement of HbA1c, FPG and fasting insulin hormone and calculation of HOMA-IR before and 3 months after DDAs therapy is done. Statistical analysis was done for these data.
Results
After SVR; HbA1c decreased from 7.6 ± 0.69 to 6.7 ± 0.78 in diabetic group and from 5.8 ± 0.5 to 5.1 ± 0.3 in non-diabetic group, with decreased in the percentage of uncontrolled T2DM patients from 22.4% to 5.2% after treatment. HOMA-IR decreased in diabetic group from 4.9 ± 0.7 to 3.7 ± 0.75 and in non-diabetic group from 3.1 ± 0.56 to 2.3 ± 0.4 with complete improvement of IR to ≤2.5 in 20.7% of diabetic patients. 20% of diabetic patient needed to decrease oral hypoglycemic dose and 13.3% of them needed to decrease insulin dose.
Conclusions
This study shows that eradication of HCV by DAAs will result in a parallel decrease in IR and improve clinical outcomes in patients with established T2DM."

Results
The patients presented lower impact in QoL domains was: pain (x¯=29.07, SD = 3.04) and negative feelings (x¯=28.70, SD = 3.33). We found there is a negative correlation between the psychological domains and the fasting glycemia (rho = −0.192, p < 0.05), also between the summary of all domains of QoL and metabolic control, HbA1C (rho = −0.205, p < 0.05), and fasting glycaemia (rho = −0.214, p < 0.05). There was a significant difference in the physical domains F (1, 131) = 9.73, p = 0.002, η2 = 0.069, indicating that men (M = 14.81) have a higher physical QoL than women (M = 13.72).

this study aimed to investigate stages of weight change in type 2 diabetics and its associations with diet knowledge and skills, diet decision making, diet and exercise barriers.
Materials and methods
This was a cross-sectional study of 1139 patients with type 2 diabetes aged>18 years in East Azerbaijan, Iran. Data were collected using the Personal Diabetes Questionnaire (PDQ) and were analyzed using SPSS software (version 22) and descriptive statistics, Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests.
Results
48.1% of the patients were in the pre-contemplation stage. 7.5%, 14.6% and 29.8% of patients were in the stages of contemplation, preparation and action, respectively. Patients with a higher score in diet knowledge and skills and diet decision making were more likely to be involved in the action stage of weight loss process, while those who had more eating problems and exercise barriers were less likely to be involved in the action stage of weight loss.
Conclusion
The results of this study showed that a substantial percentage of patients are at the pre-contemplation stage, so proper measures are needed to inform patients about the consequences of obesity and overweight. It is also necessary to focus on people with poor incomes and education status and those living in rural areas. Improve diet knowledge and skills and diet decision making and the reduction of barriers to exercise can help patients to take action to lose weight."

Results
A predominant number (94.1%) knew what constitutes MS. However, merely more than a quarter of the participant (28%) knew correctly the serum LDL cutoff value for the diagnosis of MS according to IDF criteria. The aim of lipid lowering treatment was known by slightly more than three fourth (78%) of the participants. Two third also knew the target of antihypertensive therapy. More than two third (69.5%) were also aware that waist circumference is one of the criteria for diagnosis of Metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
There is a need to increase the awareness of MS among the PHC Physicians. More training programs need to be planned. A better awareness among primary care physician is warranted for an early diagnosis and effective management of MS in Saudi Arabia."

Illness perceptions (IP) involve coping strategies and behavioural responses that can influence glycaemic control. Despite the importance of good glycaemic control, the majority of patients in Asia are not achieving glycaemic targets. An evaluation of IP in association with glycaemic control, medication adherence and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (T2DM) was carried out in an outpatient setting in Malaysia
Method
A cross-sectional study was conducted using the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire in a purposive sample of 384 T2DM patients.
Results
There were 55.7% females, median age was 58.2 years and median duration of diabetes was 13 years. The majority (79.4%) of patients had poor diabetes control (HbA1c ≥ 7.0%) and 39.6% of patients had low medication adherence. Patients with good glycaemic control had a higher Timeline Acute/Chronic and Emotional Representations score, hence they held the correct belief that diabetes is chronic and experienced negative emotions. Highly adherent patients had a higher Illness Coherence (χ2 = 21.385, p < 0.001) score but a lower Consequences (χ2 = 17.592, p < 0.001) and Emotional Representations (χ2 = 16.849, p < 0.001) score indicating good understanding and less negative perceptions of disease burden. Patients in a more advanced stage of CKD had a significantly higher Timeline Cyclical score (χ2 = 18.718, p = 0.001), believing that diabetes was unpredictable.
Conclusion
Dimensions of IP have been shown to be significantly associated with the assessed variables, therefore intervention studies with education, support and counselling should be conducted in Asia with the ultimate aim of empowering patients through IP-targeted management."

Simple surrogate indices of insulin sensitivity have been conceived to deal with costly and complicated approaches, such as the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp; however, their use has not been widespread given their variabilities in different populations. In this paper, we present two simple surrogate indices, one that uses fasting glucose and insulin values and the other based on the values from the oral glucose tolerance test.
Materials and methods
The proposed methods integrate easy-to-obtain anthropometric measures. Evolutionary algorithms were used to optimize the proposed methods by maximizing its correlation with the Stumvoll MCR method.
Results and conclusion
When the proposed indices were applied to three study groups (control subjects, metabolic syndrome, marathon runners), a reduction in the intergroup variability of the insulin sensitivity was obtained. Moreover, the proposed index based on the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which considers the glucose metabolism process and the hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity, showed stronger correlations with the Stumvoll method and lower intergroup variability than the fasting one."

abstract = "Background and objective
Although obesity is a heterogeneous disease, little is known regarding chronic medical conditions (CMCs) that defines variability in obese populations. The characterization of obese populations using CMCs rather than categorization using BMI alone can advance understanding of obesity. The aims of this study are to phenotype obesity in a large representative sample of non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Mexican American (MA) obese adults using CMCs, and assess relationship between resulting phenotypes and self-rated health (SRH).
Methods
Sex-specific two-step cluster analysis was used to phenotype obese participants (n = 12,547) to CMC-based clusters. The prevalence of CMCs and lifestyle risk factors in each cluster was assessed. Sex and race/ethnic specific association between cluster membership and SRH was determined using odds ratio (OR) from logistic regression analysis.
Results
Distinct subgroups of obese men and women were observed: moderate dyslipidemic healthy young obese men, hypertensive-dyslipidemic middle-age obese men, hypertensive young obese men, hypertensive-dyslipidemic-asthmatic middle-age obese men, and syndemic elderly obese men, healthy young obese women, hypertensive-dyslipidemic middle-age obese women, dyslipidemic young adult obese women, syndemic middle-age obese women, and syndemic elderly obese women. Participants in the more CMCs symptomatic clusters reported high rates of behavioral risk factors and showed significantly greater odds of poor SRH than participants in the less symptomatic clusters. Compared to obese persons who are asymptomatic for CMCs, syndemic elderly obese and women men had much higher increased ORs for poor SRH with values of 3.88 [95% CI = 2.41–6.26], 3.96 [95% CI = 1.86–8.30] and 7.25 [95% CI = 2.41–9.6] for NHW, NHB and MA men, respectively. The corresponding ORs for women are 4.08 [95% CI = 2.71–6.14], 4.01 [95% CI = 2.40–6.69], and 2.62 [95% CI = 1.32–5.19], respectively.
Conclusion
Obesity treatment and intervention should consider heterogeneity within obese persons and pay greater attention to obesity related co-morbidities and metabolic manifestations."

Although there were data received in clinical studies, which confirmed a causative role of altered function of FGF-23/Klotho protein axis in manifestation of CV disease in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the target therapy of these diseases directing on improvement of metabolic profiles, systemic and adipokine-relating inflammation by beneficial restoring of dysregulation in FGF-23/Klotho protein axis remain to be not fully clear. The aim of the review was to summarize findings regarding the role of impaired FGF-23/Klotho protein axis in developing CV complications in patients with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has been elucidated that elevated levels of FGF-23 and deficiency of Klotho protein in peripheral blood are predictors of CV disease and CV outcomes in patients with (pre) diabetes, while predictive values of dynamic changes of the concentrations of these biomarkers require to be elucidated in detail in the future."

It indicates that immediate health policy restructuring and investment will be needed if the best use is to be made of scarce health care resources with accompanying economic constraints. The costs of treatment of diabetes exists among the patients of all socioeconomic groups.A recent study showed that, in India, the total annual expenditure by patients on diabetes care was, on average, Rs. 10,000 in urban areas and Rs. 6260 in rural areas. The studies related to diabetes indicate that the direct and indirect cost implications of diabetes are multifold worldwide. The direct costs are related to the medical and non-medical cost of people with diabetes, mostly the burden on individual and at the family level. The indirect costs are related to the society and government, which are associated to loss of productivity. The review also finds that the annual direct and indirect medical costs per patient increase with the number of microvascular and macrovascular complications. A study in India during the years 2008 and 2009 found that total costs for patients without complications were Rs. 4493 compared to Rs. 14,692for patients with complications.The review reveals that it is imperative to work effectively towards implementing a holistic programme for diabetes prevention and reduce diabetic expenditure burden in the community."

To describe real-life experience with sensor-augmented pump therapy with predictive low-glucose management (SAPT-PLGM), in terms of hypoglycemia and glycemic control after one year of follow-up in T1D patients with hypoglycemia as the main indication of therapy.
Methods
Retrospective cohort study under real life conditions. Baseline and one-year follow-up variables of glycemic control, hypoglycemia and glycemic variability were compared.
Results
Fifty patients were included, 31 on prior treatment with SAPT with low-glucose suspend (LGS) feature and 19 on multiple dose insulin injections (MDI). Mean HbA1c decreased in the MDI group (8.24%–7.08%; p = 0.0001). HbA1c change was not significant in the SAPT-LGS group. Area under the curve (AUC) below 70 mg/dl improved in both SAPT-LGS and MDI groups while AUC, %time and events below 54 mg/dl decreased in SAPT-LGS group. Glycemic variability improved in the MDI group. Less patients presented severe hypoglycemia with SAPT-PLGM in both groups, however the change was non-significant.
Conclusions
Under real life conditions, SAPT-PLGM reduced metrics of hypoglycemia in patients previously treaded with MDI and SAPT-LGS without deteriorating glycemic control in SAPT-LGS patients, while improving it in patients treated with MDI."

Podocyte injury and subsequent excretion in urine play a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Quantification of messenger RNA expression in urinary sediment by real-time PCR is emerging as a noninvasive method of screening DN-associated biomarkers. We aimed to study the expression of podocyte-associated genes in urinary sediment and their relation to disease severity in type 2 diabetic Egyptian patients with diabetic nephropathy.
Method
ology: Sixty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited in addition to twenty non diabetic healthy volunteers. Relative mRNA abundance of nephrin, podocalyxin, and podocin were quantified, and correlations between target mRNAs and clinical parameters were examined.
Results
The urinary mRNA levels of all genes studied were significantly higher in diabetics compared with controls (p < 0.001), and mRNA levels increased with DN progression. Urinary mRNA levels of all target genes positively correlated with both UAE and HbA1c. The expression of nephrin, podocalyxin, and podocin mRNA correlated with serum creatinine {(r = 0.397, p value = 0.002), (r = 0.431, p value = 0.001), (r = 0.433, p value = 0.001) respectively}.
Conclusion
The urinary mRNA profiles of nephrin, podocalyxin, and podocin were found to increase with the progression of DN, which suggested that quantification of podocyte-associated molecules will be useful biomarkers of DN."

The objectives of this study were to assess the profile of lifestyle habits among children exposed (GDM+) or unexposed (GDM-) to GDM and to assess whether a healthy lifestyle profile is associated with lower adiposity values among these children.
Methods
A total of 105 GDM+ and 38 GDM- children aged 2–14 years were included. Vegetables and fruit intakes were collected using two 24-h dietary recalls. Physical activity and sedentary time were measured with accelerometers. Screen and sleep time were assessed using questionnaires. Weight, height and waist circumference were measured. Body composition was assessed by absorptiometry.
Results
GDM+ children had lower moderate-to-vigorous physical activity practice (p = 0.043) and fruit intake (p = 0.020) than GDM- children. Among children with an unhealthy lifestyle (meeting 0–2 lifestyle recommendations), GDM+ children had greater percentage of fat mass (p = 0.021) and android fat mass (p = 0.020) than GDM- children. Moreover, among GDM+ children, children with a healthy lifestyle (meeting 3–4 lifestyle recommendations) tended to have lower percentage of fat mass (p = 0.053) and android fat mass (p = 0.071) than those with an unhealthy lifestyle.
Conclusion
Improving lifestyle habits among GDM+ children could represent a promising approach to prevent deteriorated adiposity values."

Results
A total of (n = 22) publications comprising sixteen peer-reviewed studies and six professional-organisations (grey literature) were selected for review, as they listed the core competencies of DEs. The most common core competencies were related to knowledge and skills in diabetes self-management education, knowledge of pathophysiology and epidemiology, teaching skills, clinical skills and cultural competency. Evidently, an appropriate tool for assessing DEs’ competencies is currently unavailable.
Conclusions
Given the importance of diabetes education in the care of people living with diabetes, it is imperative that DEs possess competencies in diabetes education and management. The review also identified the need to develop a globally applicable core competency assessment tool for DEs."

abstract = "Introduction
Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a peptide that shares sequence homology with insulin and has endocrine, paracrine and autocrine functions, acts on endothelial cells, and stimulates angiogenesis. IGF1 also affects renal hemodynamics both directly and indirectly by interacting with the renin-angiotensin system.
Objective
The study aimed at detecting a relation between age-adjusted IGF1 (AAIGF1) and cardiovascular risk score in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease.
Design
Patients were 90 females and 42 males with different stages of CKD ranging from 0 to 4. After taking a consent, serum IGF1 was recorded and adjusted for the age of the patient using the IGF1 score equation: {[(log IGF-1 + 0.00625xage)-2.555]/0.104}. Both univariate and multivariate regression analyses of AAIGF1 to different metabolic parameters and microvascular complications of type 2 DM were done. A ROC curve for CV risk score was issued.
Results
AAIGF1 showed a significant bidirectional change with the stage of CKD. Univariate analysis was done including cardiovascular parameters in relations to AAIGF1. A significant positive correlation was found between AAIGF1 and CV risk score (B = 0.036, p = 0.003), SBP (B = 0.030, P = 0.004) and DBP (B = 0.071, P = 0.000), with a reciprocal relation to EF (B = -0.050, P = 0.016). Multivariate regression showed a significant correlation between AAIGF1 and age, HOMAIR, HOMAB, Uric acid. A ROC curve with AUC of 0.675, P = 0.003, showed that AAIGF1 of approximately −1.7 is a cut off for intermediate CV risk (10 year risk score >7.5%).
Conclusion
AAIGF1 shows a bidirectional relation to the grade of chronic kidney disease in adults with type 2 DM. A cut off point for AAIGF1 was set to indicate intermediate CV risk score, which can encourage using AAIGF1 as a prognostic marker for higher CV risk score. Medications that modulate IGF1 level can affect CV risk."

Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease with increasing prevalence world wide; it leads to devastating human, social and economic impact.
Aims
this study were to determine the level of diabetes-related knowledge, attitude, and practice among adult diabetic patients in central region and finding correlation between knowledge, attitude and practice regarding diabetes.
Method
A descriptive study was conducted on 300 diabetic patients on internet using Monkey Survey from 7th to 24th April 2015. A questionnaire was filled out. SPSS version 22 was used for data analysis. Descriptive statistics were comprising percentages, and frequency in order to describe knowledge, attitude, and practice. Correlations between main outcomes variables were calculated by means of Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r) that measures the linear relationship between two variables. P-value ≤0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.
Results
In the studied sample, 47% were age more than 45 years. About 71.4% of cases were females. The level of knowledge and attitude had ‘good’ in 73.6%, and 87.7% respectively but level of practice had poor in 45% of patients. There were good correlations between knowledge, attitude and practice. Significant positive linear correlation between knowledge and attitude (r = 0.503, P < 0.001), knowledge and practice (r = 0.337, P < 0.001), and statistically significant linear correlation between attitude and practice (r = 0.235, P < 0.001).
Conclusions
The overall knowledge and attitude were good, while diabetes-related practice were poor. However results indicate that an increase in knowledge will increase attitude, and practice.

The study examined the prevalence of underweight and overweight or obesity and its correlates among in-school adolescents in five ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand and Timor-Leste) in 2015.
Methods
Cross-sectional data were analysed from 30145 school-going adolescents (median age 14 years, interquartile range = 2) from Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand and Timor-Leste that took part in the “Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS)” in 2015. Body weight was examined by self-reported weight and height and the “international child body mass index standards”. Associations with underweight and overweight or obesity were assessed using multinomial logistic regression analyses.
Results
The prevalence of underweight was 8.7% and overweight or obesity 14.0%. In adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis, students residing in Timor-Leste, older age, male sex, bullying victimization and parental supervision were positively associated with underweight, while residing in Laos, current alcohol use and peer support were negatively associated with underweight. Coming from the Philippines and Timor-Leste, older age, experiencing hunger, current alcohol use, and in a physical fight decreased the odds for overweight or obesity, while male sex, fruit consumption, sedentary behaviour, physically attacked and parental bonding increased the odds for overweight or obesity.
Conclusion
High prevalences of underweight and overweight/obesity were identified in ASEAN countries and several correlates were identified which can help to tailor interventions."

The present study analysed the regular salt and macronutrients consumption of South Indian population with diabetes, hypertension and renal dysfunction.
Methods
The cross sectional study was performed among 200 subjects, divided into four different groups consisted of control, subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) without any other complications, T2DM subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and T2DM subjects with hypertension (HTN). The dietary salt intake was estimated from 24-h urinary sodium excretion and the amount of macronutrients was calculated using 24-h dietary recall method.
Results
Out of 200 study subjects, only 28 (14%) were consuming salt as per the recommended levels by WHO (i.e., 5–6 g/day). Thirty-eight (19%) subjects were consuming more than 18 g of salt per day, 67 (33.5%) were consuming 12–18 g of salt per day and another 67 (33.5%) were found to be consuming salt in a range of 6–12 g/day. Calorie contribution from the carbohydrates was significantly high compared to the calories from the proteins. Fat consumption and its corresponding energy contribution were also high among HTN group subjects.
Conclusion

abstract = "Aim
A large percentage of gestational diabetes (GDM) are undiagnosed, and prevalence of postpartum type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is unknown, especially in developing countries. This study assessed barriers to GDM diagnosis and postpartum follow-up; to determine educational needs.
Materials and methods
This was a clinical observational study of records and procedures of antenatal services at two hospitals. Laboratory and medical records were reviewed for availability of data on anthropometrics, blood glucose, gestational age, urinalysis, and lipid profile for GDM register. Antenatal clinic protocol was observed for GDM diagnosis. BMI was derived and data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.
Results
Critical barriers attributable to health systems included lack of screening for blood sugar as part of routine antenatal protocol, and lack of GDM registers at both facilities. There was 6.5% registration of pregnancies in first trimester, 22% pre-pregnancy obesity, and 2.6% high blood pressure. Positive glucosuria cases were not followed-up for GDM diagnosis.
Conclusions
There is neither concerted effort to diagnose GDM, nor systematic records of screening and postpartum follow-up. The gap in diabetology knowledge and practice calls for re-training of antenatal healthcare professionals. GDM screening checklist needs to be established and positive results entered into GDM registers for proper management during and after delivery."

There was significantly greater expression of IL-6 and MCP-1 inflammatory genes in SAT (p = 0.013 and p = 0.005 respectively) and VAT (p = 0.000 and p = 0.001 respectively) of obese patients compared to the control group. IL-1β (p = 0.015) and TNF-α (p = 0.014) expressions significantly increased in VAT from obese patients compared to the control group. Spearman correlation analysis showed that CTRP12 expression significantly correlated with obesity indices. Our findings showed that CTRP12 significantly increased in both VAT and SAT of obese group. More importantly, we observed a positive correlation between CTRP12 with inflammatory parameters.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an inpatient diabetes care education during the first year of internal medicine residency training on inpatient glycemic control.
Methods
The program was comprised of 1-hr small group teaching per 4-week rotation and twice-a-week morning insulin round by an endocrinologist. Inpatient insulin management guideline leaflet was provided to all internal medicine residents. We retrospectively collected the point-of-care testing for glucose (POCT-glu) data in patients admitted to the general medicine wards and compared the mean of blood glucose (BG) before and after the education program. A total of 134438 POCT-glu values from 7055 patients were analyzed.
Results
After the initiation of the education program, mean BG levels significantly decreased during the first year and were lowest during the second year after education (Mean BG at baseline was 161.38 ± 64.10 mg/dL; 1st year, 159.48 ± 62.53 mg/dL and 2nd year, 155.60 ± 64.94 mg/dL, p-value < 0.0001). The reduction of BG levels was more pronounced in the patients with previously undiagnosed diabetes mellitus than patients with underlying diabetes mellitus. The rates of severe hypoglycemia (defined by BG < 40 mg/dL or 2.2 mmol/L) were not significantly different before and after education (baseline 0.12%, 1st year 0.14%, and 2nd year 0.14%, p-value = 0.632).
Conclusions
Lack of confidence and inadequate knowledge of insulin treatment in physicians were important barriers to glycemic management. Consistent education in internal medicine residents led to a significant improvement in inpatient glycemic control."

We aimed to measure the MPV in patients with type 2 DM and its correlation with albuminuria, body mass index (BMI), duration of DM, hypertension (HTN), stroke, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and HbA1c level.
Methods
A cross sectional study included 100 patients with type 2 DM ≥ 18 y of both genders who were randomly selected from the medical units of Baghdad Teaching Hospital. After taking verbal consents; MPV was measured&correlated with aimed variables. Diabetics with HbA1c ≤ 7% were considered as having adequate control while those with (HbA1c) > 7% as having poor control. Albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) in urine was measured and classified into normal, moderately and severely increased. Odds ratios with 95% CI were calculated and P ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results
The mean MPV was 7.7 fl ± 1.2. Regarding ACR, 42% had normal level, 37% with moderately increased and 21% had severely increased level. Regarding HbA1c, 68% were having poorly controlled DM. Mean platelets’ count and MPV were higher in the uncontrolled group with a statistically significant association. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between MPV and albuminuria, duration of DM, HTN, IHD, Stroke, BMI, HbA1c, and platelets count.
Conclusions
The mean MPV was statistically significantly higher in the uncontrolled DM group and there was a statistically significant positive correlation between MPV and albuminuria."

This was a cross-sectional study which was conducted on 1139 diabetics aged>18 years in East Azerbaijan, Iran. Data were collected through a Personal Diabetes Questionnaire (PDQ) and analyzed through SPSS version 22 software using descriptive statistics, Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests. Tukey's HSD post hoc tests were applied to illustrate ANOVA findings.
Results
59.3% of patients do not follow a diet plan to control their blood glucose. 44.7%, 5.5%, 13%, and 36.8% of patients, respectively, were in the stages of pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation and action. Patients who had shorter disease duration and those whose current treatment was lifestyle change were more likely within the action stage. Also, patients who had a higher score in diet knowledge and skills and diet decision making and those who had a lower score in diet barriers were more likely in the action stage of change.
Conclusion
Based on the results of this study, a considerable proportion of diabetic patients were in the pre-contemplation stage. Diet knowledge and skills, diet decision making and diet barriers were factors contributing to diet readiness to change. Therefore, taking necessary measures to increase diet knowledge, skills and diet decision-making and a reduction in diet barriers can help people with type 2 diabetes to change diet."

Higher RETN levels were found in patients with T2D independently of their glycemic control status. There were positive correlations between: TNFA, LEP and RETN with worse periodontal parameters; IL6, TNFA, ADIPOR1, LEP and RETN with waist-to-hip ratio; glycemic parameters with RETN; total cholesterol and triglycerides with LEP expression.

The association of individuals’ anthropometric indices with their development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been investigated in several studies. Taking into account the ethnic differences, this study aimed to determine the most appropriate cut-off points of anthropometric indices in predicting the incidence of MetS and its components in Ahvaz.
Methods
This study is part of a cohort study conducted at the Diabetes Research Center of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences on a population of over 20 in Ahvaz during 2009–2014. Of the 592 patients, 505 patients who were not diagnosed with MetS in 2009, were entered into this study. The data analyzed involved demographic information including age and sex, anthropometric information including height, weight, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC) and the ratios between them, laboratory data including blood levels of Triglyceride (TG), Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and clinical data including systolic(S) and diastolic(D)blood pressure(BP). After 5 years, the subjects were re-evaluated for MetS based on the National Cholesterol Education Program – Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria and the most appropriate cut-off points of anthropometric indices for the prediction of the incidence of MetS using the Receiver Operative Characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained.
Results
Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) index with a cut-off point of 0.53 followed by WC with a cut-off point of 87.5 cm had the highest power to predict the incidence of MetS. The cut-off points of WC and Body mass index (BMI) were respectively 89.5 cm and 26 kg/m2 for men, and 83.5 cm and 27.5 kg/m2 for women. All anthropometric indices were able to predict the components of this syndrome (with the exception of low HDL-C). The cut-off point of WC in predicting High FBS, High TG and High BP was 84.5, 84.8, and 86.5 cm, respectively.
Conclusion
Overall, it seems that given its ease of measurement, the WC index is preferred to other indices for predicting the incidence of MetS and its components in clinical screening."
