The objective of the study is to investigate the effects of transmission control efforts of the Philippine Government through implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) on curtailing the exponential growth of the Corona Virus (Covid-19). Also, this study provides forecast of transmission rate of Covid-19 incorporating the heterogeneous characteristics of the group of population according to age.
Methods
The heterogeneous-mixing model was used to forecast the transmission rate of Covid-19 and effect of Enhanced Community Quarantine in various Local Government Units (LGUs) in the National Capital Region (NCR), Philippines.
Results
The result of the study revealed that the mobility of people has significant contribution to the transmission rate of Covid-19. The result of the study revealed that the mobilization of workers, who are exempted in ECQ, would greatly affect the transmission of disease to those who are in the senior citizen group. The increase in the confirmed cases of Covid-19 is associated with the transmission from those workers, who are exempted from ECQ to senior citizens and the young age group. LGUs in the NCR, Philippines will experience a different pattern of peak periods ranging from the third week of April to the last week of May.
Conclusions
This study concluded that in order to achieve the containment of the spread of Covid-19 in the Philippines, the government should be stricter in implementation of the ECQ and incorporate the different pattern of transmission of Covid-19 in deciding whether to extend or to lift the ECQ."

abstract = "Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. There is sudden need of statistical modeling due to onset of COVID-19 pandemic across the world. But health planning and policy requirements need the estimates of disease problem from clinical data.
Objective
The present study aimed to predict the declination of COVID-19 using recovery rate and case load rate on basis of available data from India.
Methods
The reported COVID-19 cases in the country were obtained from website (https://datahub.io/core/covid-19#resource-covid-19_zip/). The confirmed cases, recovered cases and deaths were used for estimating recovery rate, case load rate and death rate till June 04, 2020.
Results
A total of 216919 confirmed cases were reported nationwide in India on June 04, 2020. It is found that the recovery rate increased to 47.99% and case load rate decreased to 49.21%. Death rate is found to be very low 2.80%. Accordingly, coincidence of the difference of case load rate and recovery rate (delta) will reveal a declination in expected COVID-19 cases.
Conclusion
The epidemic in the country was mainly caused by the movement of people from various foreign countries to India. Lockdown as restricting the migration of population and decision taken by the government to quarantine the population may greatly reduce the risk of continued spread of the epidemic in India. This study predicts that when the case load rate gets lesser than recovery rate, there after COVID-19 patients would be started to decline."

Ever since the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak emerged in China, there has been several attempts to predict the epidemic across the world with varying degrees of accuracy and reliability. This paper aims to carry out a short-term projection of new cases; forecast the maximum number of active cases for India and selected high-incidence states; and evaluate the impact of three weeks lock down period using different models.
Methods
We used Logistic growth curve model for short term prediction; SIR models to forecast the maximum number of active cases and peak time; and Time Interrupted Regression model to evaluate the impact of lockdown and other interventions.
Results
The predicted cumulative number of cases for India was 58,912 (95% CI: 57,960, 59,853) by May 08, 2020 and the observed number of cases was 59,695. The model predicts a cumulative number of 1,02,974 (95% CI: 1,01,987, 1,03,904) cases by May 22, 2020. As per SIR model, the maximum number of active cases is projected to be 57,449 on May 18, 2020. The time interrupted regression model indicates a decrease of about 149 daily new cases after the lock down period, which is statistically not significant.
Conclusion
The Logistic growth curve model predicts accurately the short-term scenario for India and high incidence states. The prediction through SIR model may be used for planning and prepare the health systems. The study also suggests that there is no evidence to conclude that there is a positive impact of lockdown in terms of reduction in new cases."

Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) pandemic is recognized as a major threat to human health in 2020. As the disease is new and spreading quickly, the scientific community is reporting new information daily to address this issue. The public is well informed and is ready to adopt the protective and preventive measures suggested by the authorities.
Aim & objective
This study is aimed at understanding the perception towards the pandemic using the Health Belief Model (HBM) approach, preparedness measures adopted, opinion and confidence towards various Governmental activities and control measures.
Methods and material
A Cross-sectional survey was conducted among adults across the Kerala state using modified WHO Cosmo protocol and questionnaires implemented through google forms in late April during the preparedness phase of the disease.
Statistical analysis
The results were explained using descriptive and Binary Logistic Regression analysis using SPSS version 22.
Results
Among the 680 participants, 675 (99.3%) were aware about COVID-19 and 598 (88%) had good knowledge. Behavioural change was observed in 638 (93.8%) and variables in Health Belief Model showed a significant association with behavioural change.
Conclusions
Most people living across Kerala approached the COVID-19 pandemic in a similar manner, irrespective of age, education, or relation to the healthcare field. Perceptions of the community as explained by Health Belief Model was greatly influenced by the primary health care approach by the government and for the subsequent behavioural change."

abstract = "Background
Coronavirus disease - 19 (COVID-19) spread throughout the world and become pandemic. To stop and control the rapid infection of COVID-19 lockdown is the best option. Sudden lockdown implies change in entire lifestyle of the population. Social isolation affects individual's lives by greater reduction in their physical activity, which might increase the chance of infection by reducing immunity. To what extent, the physical activity is reduced during this lockdown period among physiotherapy professionals, and students who propagate physical activity is not known. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on physical activity level and energy expenditure among physiotherapy professionals and students.
Material and methods
One hundred and forty three volunteered physiotherapy professionals and students participated in web-based open E-survey. The survey was carried out by sending the Google Forms link for International Physical activity questionnaire-short form (IPAQ-SF) through social networking sites using Google Forms to gather the amount of PA before and during COVID-19 lockdown period and analysed using Wilcoxon signed rank test.
Results
Among identified 261 potential survey participants, 143 responded, reaching a response rate of 54.8%. Total physical activity before and during COVID–19 lockdown period were 7809.7 (3849.7–11769.8) MET-min/week and 4135.7 (867.2–7404.1) MET-min/week; p < 0.0001. While energy expenditure before and during COVID–19 lockdown period were 8189.8 (4242.1–12137.6) kcal/wk and 4221.7 (1004.6–7438.8) kcal/wk; p < 0.0001.
Conclusion
A significant reduction in self-report physical activity and energy expenditure levels were observed among physiotherapy professionals and students during the COVID–19 lockdown period."

abstract = "Background
Since the onset of the COVID-19 in China, forecasting and projections of the epidemic based on epidemiological models have been in the centre stage. Researchers have used various models to predict the maximum extent of the number of cases and the time of peak. This yielded varying numbers. This paper aims to estimate the effective reproduction number (R) for COVID-19 over time using incident number of cases that are reported by the government.
Methods
Exponential Growth method to estimate basic reproduction rate R0, and Time dependent method to calculate the effective reproduction number (dynamic) were used. “R0” package in R software was used to estimate these statistics.
Results
The basic reproduction number (R0) for India was estimated at 1.379 (95% CI: 1.375, 1.384). This was 1.450 (1.441, 1.460) for Maharashtra, 1.444 (1.430, 1.460) for Gujarat, 1.297 (1.284, 1.310) for Delhi and 1.405 (1.389, 1.421) for Tamil Nadu. In India, the R at the first week from March 2–8, 2020 was 3.2. It remained around 2 units for three weeks, from March 9–29, 2020. After March 2020, it started declining and reached around 1.3 in the following week suggesting a stabilisation of the transmissibility rate.
Conclusion
The study estimated a baseline R0 of 1.379 for India. It also showed that the R was getting stabilised from first week of April (with an average R of 1.29), despite the increase in March. This suggested that in due course there will be a reversal of epidemic. However, these analyses should be revised periodically."

abstract = "Background
Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the most common illnesses affecting people of all ages worldwide. Viruses contribute to 30–70% of acute respiratory infections. Identification of these respiratory viruses is not given high priority except influenza; however, the knowledge about prevalence of non-influenza viruses, their seasonal pattern and genetic evolution have significant epidemiological value.
Methods
As a part of National Influenza-like illness surveillance programme, respiratory specimens were collected children and adults with symptoms of ILI or ARI, between January 2012 and March 2015 (including SARI cases). Real-time PCR was done to identify 13 respiratory viruses. Sequencing was done for representative isolates of each virus using ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer.
Results
During the study period between January 2012 and March 2015, a total of 648 patients with symptoms of ARI were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 20.2 years (SD = 19.13, median = 18); 292 (45.1%) were children (≤13 years) and 356 (54.9%) were adults. Respiratory viruses were identified in 44% (287/648) of all patients. Influenza accounted for the maximum number of cases- 179/648 (27.6%). Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated with 34 cases (5.2%), followed by HMPV 24 (3.7%) and PIV-3 20 (3%). Four patients died due to INF A/H1N1 (2012-2, 2015-2) as a result of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (CFR 3.7%). Among the non-influenza viruses, no particular seasonality pattern was observed over the different months of the study period.
Conclusion
Antibiotic usage in treating acute respiratory infections empirically is not justified as nearly half of ARI are due to viruses; nearly 28% of them were due to influenza viruses. Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated, followed by HMPV. This study is based on an active influenza surveillance initiated after 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, in the Union territory of Puducherry which has contributed significantly to the knowledge of the burden of influenza and non-influenza viruses among children and adults. Such surveillance network has paved the way for better diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions."
