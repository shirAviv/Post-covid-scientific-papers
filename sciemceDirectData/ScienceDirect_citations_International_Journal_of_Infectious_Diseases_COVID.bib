abstract = "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in other countries in December 2019. The infected patients presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, sometimes with digestive and other systemic manifestations, and some progressed with a severe acute respiratory syndrome or even death. Associated digestive symptoms were frequently observed in the patients, with an unknown significance and mechanism. ACE2, as the major known functional receptor of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) attracted our attention. We collected the clinical data of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients from published studies and extracted the data about the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, we used online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs, especially in the small intestine, to explore the relationship between ACE2 expression patterns and clinical symptoms. We found that diarrhea accounted for a notable proportion of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 8.0% to 12.9%. The results reveal that ACE2 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the small intestinal enterocytes but not in the goblet cells or intestinal immune cells. High expression of ACE2 on the surface cells in the digestive tract may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation susceptibility. Overall, digestive symptoms were common in the COVID-19 patients. ACE2 expression on surface cells of the small intestine may mediate the invasion and amplification of the virus and activation of gastrointestinal inflammation. It is a possible mechanism of digestive symptoms in the COVID-19 patients and explains the presence of the virus in patients’ stool samples. The study also highlights the necessity of taking stool samples for suspected patients to help in early diagnosis and assessment of disease status."

Till date, the most commonly used method for the identification and confirmation of the virus is the laboratory-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Unfortunately, testing capacities have been limited in many parts of Africa because of inadequate test kits which have restricted scaling up beyond the few public health laboratories at designated locations. We present in this mini-review Africa’s preparedness and readiness toward testing, why testing is crucial, the need to immediately strengthen existing facilities and what it involves as combined approaches for managing the COVID-19 crisis. The review highlights the urgent need for speedy expansion and distribution of several laboratory testing platforms to public health facilities and fully accredited private clinical laboratories, including real-time PCR and serological assays."

Methods
This study included adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 form Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China), with or without influenza, and compared their clinical characteristics.
Results
Among 93 patients, 44 died and 49 were discharged. Forty-four (47.3%) were infected with influenza virus A and two (2.2%) with influenza virus B. Twenty-two (50.0%) of the non-survivors and 24 (49.0%) of the survivors were infected with the influenza virus. Critically ill COVID-19 patients with influenza were more prone to cardiac injury than those without influenza. For the laboratory indicators at admission the following were higher in non-survivors with influenza than in those without influenza: white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, D-dimer value, and proportion of elevated creatinine.
Conclusion
The results showed that a high proportion of COVID-19 patients were co-infected with influenza in Tongji Hospital, with no significant difference in the proportion of co-infection between survivors and non-survivors. The critically ill COVID-19 patients with influenza exhibited more severe inflammation and organ injury, indicating that co-infection with the influenza virus may induce an earlier and more frequently occurring cytokine storm."

204 elderly patients (≥60 years old) diagnosed with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 31st to February 20th, 2020 were included in this study. Clinical endpoint was in-hospital death.
Results
Of the 204 patients, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were the most common coexisting conditions. 76 patients died in the hospital. Multivariate analysis showed that dyspnea (hazards ratio (HR) 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.414–3.517; p < 0.001), older age (HR 1.1, 95% CI 1.070–1.123; p < 0.001), neutrophilia (HR 4.4, 95% CI 1.310–15.061; p = 0.017) and elevated ultrasensitive cardiac troponin I (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.471–10.433; p = 0.006) were independently associated with death.
Conclusion
Although so far the overall mortality of COVID-19 is relatively low, the mortality of elderly patients is much higher. Early diagnosis and supportive care are of great importance for the elderly patients of COVID-19."

abstract = "Objectives
A major open question, affecting the decisions of policy makers, is the estimation of the true number of Covid-19 infections. Most of them are undetected, because of a large number of asymptomatic cases. We provide an efficient, easy to compute and robust lower bound estimator for the number of undetected cases.
Methods
A modified version of the Chao estimator is proposed, based on the cumulative time-series distributions of cases and deaths. Heterogeneity has been addressed by assuming a geometrical distribution underlying the data generation process. An (approximated) analytical variance of the estimator has been derived to compute reliable confidence intervals at 95% level.
Results
A motivating application to the Austrian situation is provided and compared with an independent and representative study on prevalence of Covid-19 infection. Our estimates match well with the results from the independent prevalence study, but the capture–recapture estimate has less uncertainty involved as it is based on a larger sample size. Results from other European countries are mentioned in the discussion. The estimated ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases is around the value of 2.3 for all the analyzed countries.
Conclusions
The proposed method answers to a fundamental open question: “How many undetected cases are going around?”. CR methods provide a straightforward solution to shed light on undetected cases, incorporating heterogeneity that may arise in the probability of being detected."

abstract = "Objectives
The aim of this paper was to monitor the presence of SARS-Cov-2 among hospital environment surfaces, sewage, and personal protective equipment (PPE) of staffs in isolation wards in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, China.
Methods
Surfaces of objects were routinely wiped with 1000mg/L chlorine containing disinfectant. Air and sewage disinfection was proceeded routinely and strictly. Hospital environmental surfaces and PPE of staffs in isolation wards were sampled using swabs. The sewage from various inlet and outlets were sampled. The respiratory and stool specimens of patients were collected. The respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were also sampled once a week. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) methods were used to confirm the existence of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Viral culture was done for the samples positive for SARS-Cov-2 RNA.
Results
During the study period, 33 laboratory-confirmed patients were hospitalized in isolation wards in the hospital. None of SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected among the 36 objects surface samples and 9 staffs PPE samples in isolation wards. Though the 3 sewage samples from the inlet of preprocessing disinfection pool were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the sample from the outlet of preprocessing disinfection pool was weakly positive, the sewage sample from the outlet of the last disinfection pool was negative. All of the 5 sewage samples from various points were negative by viral culture of SARS-Cov-2. None of the respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were positive.
Conclusions
Though SARS-Cov-2 RNA of the sewage samples were positive from inlets of the sewage disinfection pool and negative from the outlet of the last sewage disinfection pool, no viable virus was detected by culture. The monitoring data in this study suggested that the strict disinfection and hand hygiene could decrease the hospital-associated COVID-19 infection risk of the staffs in isolation wards."

No specific treatments for reducing mortality or morbidity are yet available. Deaths from COVID-19 will continue to rise globally until effective and appropriate treatments and/or vaccines are found. In search of effective treatments, the global medical, scientific, pharma and funding communities have rapidly initiated over 500 COVID-19 clinical trials on a range of antiviral drug regimens and repurposed drugs in various combinations. A paradigm shift is underway from the current focus of drug development targeting the pathogen, to advancing cellular Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs) for tackling the aberrant host immune and inflammatory responses which underlie the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and high COVID-19 mortality rates. We focus this editorial specifically on the background to, and the rationale for, the use and evaluation of mesenchymal stromal (Stem) cells (MSCs) in treatment trials of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Currently, the ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) report a combined 28 trials exploring the potential of MSCs or their products for treatment of COVID-19. MSCs should also be trialed for treatment of other circulating WHO priority Blueprint pathogens such as MERS-CoV which causes upto 34% mortality rates. It’s about time funding agencies invested more into development MSCs per se, and also for a range of other HDTs, in combination with other therapeutic interventions. MSC therapy could turn out to be an important contribution to bringing an end to the high COVID-19 death rates and preventing long-term functional disability in those who survive disease."

This was a cross-sectional study based on internet-based survey. A total of 2400 people (50% male: 20–79 years) were selected between February 25 and 27, 2020, from registrants of an Internet research company, to complete a questionnaire. Participants were asked to indicate how often they implemented the following five personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (hand hygiene, social distancing measures, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, respiratory etiquette, and self-isolation). In addition, the participants responded to questions regarding the daily frequency of hand hygiene events.
Results
The prevalence of the five personal protective measures ranged from 59.8% to 83.8%, with the lowest being avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. In total, 34.7% implemented all personal protective measures. The median daily hand hygiene events were 5 per day (25th percentile, 75th percentile: 3,8).

COVID-19 disease is becoming a global pandemic and more than 200 countries were affected because of this disease. Italy is one of the countries is largely suffered with this virus outbreak, and about 180,000 cases (as of 20 April 2020) were registered which explains the large transmissibility and reproduction case numbers.
Objective
In this study, we considered the Marche region of Italy to compute different daily transmission rates (Rt) including five provinces in it. We also present forecasting of daily and cumulative incidences associated after the next thirty days. The Marche region is the 8th in terms of number of people infected in Italy and the first in terms of diffusion of the infection among the 4 regions of the center of Italy.
Methods
Epidemic statistics were extracted from the national Italian Health Ministry website. We considered outbreak information where the first case registered in Marche with onset symptoms (26 February 2020) to the present date (20 April 2020). Adoption of incidence and projections with R statistics was done.
Results
The median values of Rt for the five provinces of Pesaro and Urbano, Ancona, Fermo, Ascoli Piceno, and Macerata, was 2.492 (1.1–4.5), 2.162 (1.0–4.0), 1.512 (0.75–2.75), 1.141 (1.0–1.6), and 1.792 (1.0–3.5) with 95% of CI achieved. The projections at end of 30th day of the cumulative incidences 323 (95% CI), and daily incidences 45 (95% CI) could be possible.
Conclusions
This study highlights the knowledge of essential insights into the Marche region in particular to virus transmission dynamics, geographical characteristics of positive incidences, and the necessity of implementing mitigation procedures to fight against the COVID-19 outbreak."

In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the development and validation of rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic methods are of high priority. We evaluated a novel rapid antigen detection test (RDT) for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples.
Methods
The fluorescence immunochromatographic SARS-CoV-2 antigen test (Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., Shenzhen, China) was evaluated using universal transport medium with nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs from suspected Covid-19 cases. Diagnostic accuracy was determined in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 real time (RT)-PCR.
Results
A total of 127 samples were included; 82 were RT-PCR positive. Median patients’ age was 38 years, 53.5% were male, and 93.7% were from the first week after symptom onset. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 93.9% (CI95% 86.5–97.4) and 100% (CI95% 92.1–100), respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 96.1% and Kappa coefficient of 0.9. Sensitivity was significantly higher in samples with high viral loads.
Conclusions
The evaluated RDT showed a high sensitivity and specificity in samples mainly obtained during the first week of symptoms and with high viral loads, despite the use of a non-validated sample material. The assay has the potential to become an important tool for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in situations with limited access to molecular methods."

The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic shocked the world, overwhelming the health systems of even high-income countries. Predictably, the situation has elicited social and medical responses from the public and governments, respectively. Nigeria recorded an imported case from Italy on February 27, 2020. Hence, this paper assesses the early socio-medical response to COVID-19 in Nigeria in the first 100 days after the index case. The paper employs analytical methods and collates data from various media reports and official sources.
Findings
The incidence of COVID-19 grew steadily in Nigeria, moving from an imported case and elitist pattern to community transmission. The case fatality stood at 2.8%. The country recorded an upsurge (52% of total cases) in the transmission of COVID-19 during the short period the lockdown was relaxed. This paper presents a concise response framework to highlight some specific multisectoral responses to the pandemic. A combination of social and medical responses to a large extent helped Nigeria curtail the spread of the virus.
Conclusion
The potential of overwhelming COVID-19 is still imminent in Nigeria as the country is attempting to hurriedly open the economy, which could sacrifice public health gains for temporary economic gains."

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, but the factors influencing viral RNA shedding remain unclear to inform optimal control strategies.
Methods
The clinical course and viral RNA shedding pattern of 267 consecutive symptomatic COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital from January 20, 2020 to March 15, 2020 were retrospectively evaluated.
Results
The median viral RNA shedding duration was 12 days (interquartile range, 8–16 d) after the onset of illness. Of the 267 patients included in this study, 65.2% had viral RNA cleared within 14 days, 88.8% within 21 days, and 94.4% within 28 days. Older age (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98–1.00; P = 0.04), time lag from illness onset to hospital admission (HR, 0.91; 95% CI: 0.88–0.94; P < 0.001), diarrhea (HR, 0.59; 95% CI: 0.36–0.96; P = 0.036), corticosteroid treatment (HR, 0.60; 95% CI: 0.39–0.94; P = 0.024), and lopinavir/ritonavir use (HR, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.52–0.94; P = 0.014) were significantly independently associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding.
Conclusions
Early detection and timely hospital admission may be warranted for symptomatic COVID-19 patients, especially for older patients and patients with diarrhea. Corticosteroid treatment is associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding and should be used with caution. Lopinavir/ritonavir use may be associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding in non-severe patients; further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this finding."

The median duration of viral shedding (the number of days from symptoms onset until the successive negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA) was 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 12–21). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis indicated that the highest temperature at admission (odds ratio [OR], 5.200; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.190−22.726; p = 0.028), time from symptom onset to admission (OR, 1.740; 95% CI: 1.296−2.337; p < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (OR, 1.604; 95% CI: 1.262−2.040; p < 0.001) were risk factors for prolonged duration of viral shedding.
Conclusions
This study, with a relatively large sample size, focused on the duration of viral shedding and related factors in patients with COVID-19, outside of Wuhan, China. Potential risk factors were identified and should be taken into consideration for the strategy of quarantining infected patients."

Non-hermetically sealed eye protection does not fully protect the eyes from airborne particles. Hermetically sealed eye protection fully protects the eyes from particles, but tends to fog up, rendering it unusable. This study aimed to build and test a filtered eye mask (FEM) to protect the eyes from airborne particles, while being usable without excessive fog build up.
Methods
The steps performed to build the FEM were described. A hermetically-sealed standard eye mask (SEM) and an FEM were examined at 1-minute, 5-minute and 60-minute periods for performance metrics relating to fog.
Results
The SEM showed minimal fog at 1minute, lots of fog at 5minutes and was dripping with condensation at 60minutes. The FEM was clear at 1minute, 5minutes and showed minimal fog at 60minutes.
Conclusion
An FEM may play an important role in preventing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) exposure by protecting the eyes from airborne particles and preventing fog, rendering it usable. Further research is strongly recommended."

Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) identified on Jan 20, 2020, in South Korea, the number of cases rapidly increased, resulting in 6284 cases including 42 deaths as of Mar 6, 2020. To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea.
Methods
The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval.
Results
We identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4–1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7), and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19. The crude case fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and increases with older age.
Conclusions
Our results indicate an early sustained transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak."

The aim of the study was to analyze the usefulness of CURB-65 and the pneumonia severity index (PSI) in predicting 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19, and to identify other factors associated with higher mortality.
Methods
A retrospective study was performed in a pandemic hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, which included 681 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19. Data on characteristics, vital signs, and laboratory parameters were recorded from electronic medical records. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to quantify the discriminatory abilities of the prognostic scales. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify other predictors of mortality.
Results
Higher CRP levels were associated with an increased risk for mortality (OR: 1.015, 95% CI: 1.008–1.021; p < 0.001). The PSI performed significantly better than CURB-65 (AUC: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.88–0.93 vs AUC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85–0.90; p = 0.01), and the addition of CRP levels to PSI did not improve the performance of PSI in predicting mortality (AUC: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.88–0.93 vs AUC: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.89–0.94; p = 0.29).

Convalescent plasma (CP) has been used successfully to treat many types of infectious diseases, and it has shown initial effects in the treatment of the emerging 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, its curative effect and feasibility have yet to be confirmed by formal evaluation and well-designed clinical trials. To explore the effectiveness of treatment and predict the potential effect of CP for COVID-19, studies of different types of infectious diseases treated with CP were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods
Related studies were obtained from databases and screened based on the inclusion criteria. The data quality was assessed, and the data were extracted and pooled for analysis.
Results
We included 40 studies on CP treatment for infectious diseases We found that CP treatment could reduce the risk of mortality with a low incidence of adverse events, promote the production of antibodies, show the decline in viral load, and shorten the disease course. A meta-analysis of 15 controlled studies showed that there was a significantly lower mortality rate in the group treated with CP (pooled OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.19-0.52, P < 0.001, I2 = 54%) than in the control groups. Studies were mostly of low or very low quality with a moderate or high risk of bias. The sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity were identified. The exclusion of heterogeneity indicated that the results were stable.
Conclusions
CP therapy has some curative effect and is well tolerated to treat infectious diseases. It is a potentially effective treatment for COVID-19."

With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 around the world, it has become a worldwide health concern. One previous study reported a family cluster with an asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19. Here, we report another series of cases and further demonstrate the repeatability of the transmission of COVID-19 by pre-symptomatic carriers.
Methods
A familial cluster of five patients associated with COVID-19 was enrolled in the hospital. We collected epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory outcomes from electronic medical records, and also verified them with the patients and their families.
Results
Among them, three family members (Case 3/4/5) had returned from Wuhan. Additionally, two family members, those who had not traveled to Wuhan, also contracted COVID-19 after contacting with the other three family members. Case 1 developed severe pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU. Case 3 and Case 5 presented fever and cough on days two through three of hospitalization and had ground-glass opacity changes in their lungs. Case 4 presented with diarrhea and pharyngalgia after admission without radiographic abnormalities. Case 2 presented no clinical nor radiographic abnormalities. All five cases had an increasing level of C-reactive protein.

To investigate the diagnostic value of serological testing and dynamic variance of serum antibody in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Methods
This study retrospectively included 43 patients with a laboratory-confirmed infection and 33 patients with a suspected infection, in whom the disease was eventually excluded. The IgM/IgG titer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay analysis.
Results
Compared to molecular detection, the sensitivities of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to diagnose COVID-19 were 48.1% and 88.9%, and the specificities were 100% and 90.9%, respectively.In the COVID-19 group, the IgM-positive rate increased slightly at first and then decreased over time; in contrast, the IgG-positive rate increased to 100% and was higher than IgM at all times. The IgM-positive rate and titer were not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative. The IgG-positive rate was up to 90% and not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative. However, the median IgG titer after conversion to virus-negative was double that before, and the difference was significant.

Methods
Between January 2018 and March 2020, 1,027 NCPP and 1,140 IP were recruited from Tongji hospital. Routine blood examination, biochemical indicators and coagulation function analysis were simultaneously performed in all participants.
Results
There was no sex predominance in NCPP. The NCPP were frequently encountered in the sixth and seventh decades of life. The mean age of NCPP (56±16 years) was higher than IP (47±17 years), but without statistical difference. Although most results of routine laboratory tests between NCPP and IP had no significant differences, some laboratory tests showed an obvious change in NCPP. It was observed that NCPP had significantly decreased white blood cells, alkaline phosphatase and d-dimer compared with IP. However, the results of lactate dehydrogenase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fibrinogen were significantly increased in NCPP compared with IP. The diagnostic model based on a combination of 18 routine laboratory indicators showed an area under the curve of 0.796 (95% CI, 0.777–0.814), with a sensitivity of 46.93% and specificity of 90.09% when using a cut-off value of 0.598.

COVID-19 is spreading quickly all over the world. Publicly released data for 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan of China were analyzed in this paper.
Methods
Various statistical and network analysis methods were employed.
Results
We found that COVID-19 patients show gender (55% vs 45%) and age (81% aged between 21 and 60) preferences; possible causes were explored. The estimated average, mode and median incubation periods are 7.4, 4 and 7 days. Incubation periods of 92% of patients were no more than 14 days. The epidemic in Henan has undergone three stages and has shown high correlations with the numbers of patients recently returned from Wuhan. Network analysis revealed that 208 cases were clustering infected, and various People's Hospitals are the main force in treating COVID-19.
Conclusions
The incubation period was statistically estimated, and the proposed state transition diagram can explore the epidemic stages of emerging infectious disease. We suggest that although the quarantine measures are gradually working, strong measures still might be needed for a period of time, since ∼7.45% of patients may have very long incubation periods. Migrant workers or college students are at high risk. State transition diagrams can help us to recognize the time-phased nature of the epidemic. Our investigations have implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in other regions of the world."

Given the high need and the absence of specific antivirals for treatment of COVID-19 (the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors are being considered as therapeutic alternatives.
Methods
Prezcobix/Rezolsta is a fixed-dose combination of 800 mg of the HIV protease inhibitor darunavir (DRV) and 150 mg cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection. There are currently no definitive data on the safety and efficacy of DRV/cobicistat for the treatment of COVID-19. The in vitro antiviral activity of darunavir against a clinical isolate from a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 was assessed.
Results
DRV showed no antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 at clinically relevant concentrations (EC50 > 100 μM). Remdesivir, used as a positive control, demonstrated potent antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.38 μM).

An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city in China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and other countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.
Methods
Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (γ), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI.
Findings
The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96–2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89–4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0.
Conclusion
The mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and is significantly larger than 1. Our findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks."

Results
The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver.

To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs.
Methods
We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase.
Results
Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9).
Conclusions
The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias."

The average time for the number of confirmed cases to increase from 30 to 100 (time from 30-to-100) was 6.6 (5.3–7.9) days, and the average case-fatality rate in the first 100 confirmed cases (CFR-100) was 0.8% (0.2–1.4%). The subsequent epidemic size per million population was significantly associated with both of these indicators. We predicted a ranking of epidemic size in the cities based on these two indicators and found it highly correlated with the actual classification of epidemic size.
Conclusions
Early epidemic characteristics are important indicators for the size of the entire epidemic."

The objective of our study was to introduce community quarantine strategy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Anhui and evaluate the effectiveness of community quarantine based on trauma center (TC) patients.
Method
The structure of community quarantine strategy was illustrated. Distribution of injuries among patients in two TCs between January 24, 2020 and February 24, 2020 was described. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the correlation between the distribution of Injuries in TCs and the number of COVID-19-associated cases.
Results
A total of 757 TC patients in the two hospitals were enrolled. The number of traffic injuries and outdoor injuries showed a significant decrease in the early stage and began to increase on February 17. The number of indoor injuries neither decreased nor increased. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between COVID-19-associated cases and traffic and outdoor injuries.
Conclusion
From the perspective of the injuries in TCs, community quarantine strategy was effectively implemented and significantly slowed the outbreak of COVID-19 in Anhui. However, the implementation and maintenance of the strategy is costly and requires the participation of the entire population."

The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat. Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions.
Methods
Based on recently published literature, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.
Results
The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicated a bat origin. The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS. Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems. Potential treatments included remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible).
Conclusion
The initial experience from the current pandemic and lessons from the previous two pandemics can help improve future preparedness plans and combat disease progression."

Methods
The study included five male patients who presented with the sole complaint of unilateral SSNHL to the otolaryngology outpatient clinic between 03–12 April 2020. The patients were referred to the infectious diseases clinic to be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing.
Results
RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in one of the patients and negative in the other four patients. A positive response to COVID-19-specific treatment in the SARS-CoV-2 positive SSNHL patient was noted.
Conclusion
It should be remembered that non-specific symptoms such as SSNHL could be the only sign with which to recognize a COVID-19 case. Awareness of such a non-specific presentation of COVID-19 patients is crucial during this pandemic period for preventing infectious spread through isolation and early initiation of COVID-19 targeted treatment."

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China has been basically controlled. However, the global epidemic of COVID-19 is worsening. We established a method to estimate the instant case fatality rate (CFR) and cure rate of COVID-19 in China.
Methods
A total of 82 735 confirmed cases released officially by the Chinese authorities from December 8, 2019 to April 18, 2020 were collected. The estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were calculated based on the median cure time or median death time of individual cases. Following this, the instant CFR was calculated according to the number of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis date.
Results
In China, the instant CFR of COVID-19 was 3.8–14.6% from January 1 to January 17; it then declined gradually and stabilized at 5.7% in April. The average CFR in China was 6.1±2.9%, while the CFR was 1.0±0.4% in China except Hubei Province. The cure rate of COVID-19 was 93.9±2.9% in China, and stabilized at 94.3%, while it was 99.0±0.4% in China except Hubei Province.
Conclusions
The instant CFR of COVID-19 in China overall was much higher than that in China except Hubei Province. The CFR of COVID-19 in China was underestimated."

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new respiratory and systemic disease which needs quick identification of potential critical patients. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the relationship between lymphocyte count and the severity of COVID-19.
Methods
A comprehensive systematic literature search was carried out to find studies published from December 2019 to 22 March 2020 from five databases. The language of literatures included English and Chinese. Mean difference (MD) of lymphocyte count in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of lymphopenia for severe form of COVID-19 was evaluated with this meta-analysis.
Results
Overall 13 case-series with a total of 2282 cases were included in the study. The pooled analysis showed that lymphocyte count was significantly lower in severe COVID-19 patients (MD -0.31×109/L; 95%CI: -0.42 to -0.19×109/L). The presence of lymphopenia was associated with nearly threefold increased risk of severe COVID-19 (Random effects model, OR=2.99, 95% CI: 1.31-6.82).
Conclusions
Lymphopenia is a prominent part of severe COVID-19 and a lymphocyte count of less than 1.5×109/L may be useful in predicting the severity clinical outcomes."

The study was aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and evaluate the dynamic changes of chest CT features in the first three weeks in the common type fo COVID-19 pneumonia patients in Jiangsu Province.
Methods
307 patients infected SARS-CoV-2 classified as common type were enrolled in the study. 628 chest CT scans were divided into three groups based on the time interval between symptoms and chest CT scan. The clinical characteristics were descriptively analyzed.The chest CT features were quantitatively evaluated. Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the differences in three groups and between men and women. Spearman rank correlation was used to test the association between the arterial blood gas(ABG) analysis results and chest CT scores.
Results
Fever (69.1%) and cough (62.8%) were common symptoms. 111(36.2%) patients were anorexia. GGO was the most common manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia, which could be followed by consolidation and fibrosis. Lower lobe or subpleural region was the most common distribution form of lesion. More lung lobes were involved in the third week. Total chest CT scores in the second week were higher than the first week. Fibrosis Scores increased in the second and third week. Total CT score, GGO score and fibrosis score of male patients were significantly higher than female in the second week. Male patients had higher consolidation score and fibrosis score than female in the third week. Total CT score and GGO score had weak to moderate correlation with arterial blood gas indices.
Conclusion
Changes in chest CT were difficult to assess quantitatively in the first third weeks. Male patients recovered slower than female in the second week. Although CT score had correlations with arterial blood gas indices, long-term follow-up of pulmonary function test is needed to determine the recovery of lung."

With the increasing number of people suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is a dire need to look for effective remedies against this pandemic. Drug repurposing seems to be the solution for the current situation.
Methods
In a quest to find a potential drug against this virus, 15 antimalarial drugs (including chloroquine) and 2413 US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs were investigated for activity against both the protease and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using an in silico approach. Molecular docking analysis followed by molecular dynamics simulation was performed to estimate the binding and stability of the complexes.
Results
This study identified a single drug – paromomycin – with activity against two targets of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., spike protein (S1) and protease domain. Paromomycin was found to have strong binding affinity for both targets of coronavirus. The results also showed that no antimalarial drug exhibited effective binding for either S1 or protease.
Conclusions
This study found that paromomycin may be an effective dual targeting drug against coronavirus, as it binds not only to the protease domain of the virion, but also to the spike domain, with high stability. Furthermore, none of the antimalarial drugs showed strong binding affinity for either protease or the receptor binding domain (RBD)."

Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, considerable attention has been paid to its epidemiology and clinical characteristics in children. However, it is also crucial for clinicians to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza viruses.
Methods
This was a retrospective study. Two groups of COVID-19 patients (n=57) and influenza A patients (n=59) were enrolled. We analyzed and compared their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics and treatments.
Results
The proportions of cough (70.2%), fever (54.4%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (14.1%) in COVID-19 patients were lower than those of influenza A patients (98.3%, P<0.001; 84.7%, P<0.001; and 35.6%, P=0.007; respectively). In addition, COVID-19 patients showed significantly lower levels of leukocytes (7.87 vs. 9.89×109L–1, P=0.027), neutrophils (2.43 vs. 5.16×109L–1, P<0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP; 3.7 vs. 15.1mg/L, P=0.001) and procalcitonin (PCT; 0.09 vs. 0.68mm/h, P<0.001), while lymphocyte levels (4.58 vs. 3.56×109L–1; P=0.006) were significantly higher compared with influenza A patients. In terms of CT imaging, ground-glass opacification in chest CT was more common in COVID-19 patients than in influenza A patients (42.1% vs. 15%, P=0.032). In contrast, consolidation was more common in influenza A patients (25%) than in COVID-19 patients (5.2%, P=0.025).
Conclusion
The clinical manifestations and laboratory tests of COVID-19 children are milder than those of influenza A children under 5 years. Additionally, imaging results more commonly presented as ground-glass opacities in COVID-19 patients."

To use Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to determine weights for eleven criteria in order to prioritize COVID-19 non-critical patients for admission to hospital in healthcare settings with limited resources.
Methods
The MCDA was applied in two main steps: specification of criteria for prioritizing COVID-19 patients (and levels within each criterion); and determination of weights for the criteria based on experts’ knowledge and experience in managing COVID-19 patients, via an online survey. Criteria were selected based on available COVID-19 evidence with a focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Results
The most important criteria (mean weights, summing to 100%), are: PaO2 (16.3%); peripheral O2 saturation (15.9%); chest X-ray (14.1%); Modified Early Warning Score-MEWS (11.4%); respiratory rate (9.5%); comorbidities (6.5%); living with vulnerable people (6.4%); body mass index (5.6%); duration of symptoms before hospital evaluation (5.4%); CRP (5.1%); and age (3.8%).
Conclusions
At the beginning of a new pandemic, when evidence for disease predictors is limited or unavailable and effective national contingency plans are difficult to establish, the MCDA prioritization model could play a pivotal role in improving the response of health systems."

Coronaviruses, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, first appeared in China. They have certain biological, epidemiological and pathological similarities. To date, research has shown that their genes exhibit 79% of identical sequences and the receptor-binding domain structure is also very similar. There has been extensive research performed on SARS; however, the understanding of the pathophysiological impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still limited.
Methods
This review drew upon the lessons learnt from SARS, in terms of epidemiology, clinical characteristics and pathogenesis, to further understand the features of COVID-19.
Results
By comparing these two diseases, it found that COVID-19 has quicker and wider transmission, obvious family agglomeration, and higher morbidity and mortality. Newborns, asymptomatic children and normal chest imaging cases emerged in COVID-19 literature. Children starting with gastrointestinal symptoms may progress to severe conditions and newborns whose mothers are infected with COVID-19 could have severe complications. The laboratory test data showed that the percentage of neutrophils and the level of LDH is higher, and the number of CD4+ and CD8+T-cells is decreased in children's COVID-19 cases.
Conclusion
Based on these early observations, as pediatricians, this review put forward some thoughts on children's COVID-19 and gave some recommendations to contain the disease."

abstract = "Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading. Here, we summarized the composition of pathogens in fever clinic patients and analyzed the characteristics of different respiratory viral infections.
Methods
Retrospectively collected patients with definite etiological results using nasal and pharyngeal swabs in a fever clinic.
Results
Overall, 1860 patients were screened, and 136 patients were enrolled. 72 (52.94%) of them were diagnosed as influenza (Flu) A virus infection. 32 (23.53%) of them were diagnosed as Flu B virus infection. 18 (13.24%) and 14 (10.29%) of them were diagnosed as COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, respectively. The COVID-19 group had a higher rate of contact with the epidemic area within 14 days and of clustering onset than other groups. Fever was the most common symptom in these patients. The ratio of fever to the highest temperature was higher in Flu A virus infection patients than in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had a lower white blood cell count and neutrophil count than Flu A virus and RSV infection groups, but higher lymphocyte count than Flu A and B virus infection groups. The COVID-19 group (83.33%) had a higher rate of pneumonia in chest CT scans than Flu A and B virus infection groups.
Conclusions
Influenza viruses accounted for a large proportion of respiratory virus infection even during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Beijing. No single symptom or laboratory finding was suggestive of a specific respiratory virus; however, epidemic history was significant for the screening of COVID-19."

abstract = "Background
An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China; the epidemic is more widespread than initially estimated, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries.
Aims
The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients and the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients.
Methods
A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science through February 25, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models.
Results
Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 1 576 infected patients. The results showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever (91.3%, 95% CI: 86–97%), followed by cough (67.7%, 95% CI: 59–76%), fatigue (51.0%, 95% CI: 34–68%) and dyspnea (30.4%, 95% CI: 21–40%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (21.1%, 95% CI: 13.0–27.2%) and diabetes (9.7%, 95% CI: 7.2–12.2%), followed by cardiovascular disease (8.4%, 95% CI: 3.8–13.8%) and respiratory system disease (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.9–2.1%). When compared between severe and non-severe patients, the pooled OR of hypertension, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular disease were 2.36 (95% CI: 1.46–3.83), 2.46 (95% CI: 1.76–3.44) and 3.42 (95% CI: 1.88–6.22) respectively.
Conclusion
We assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 patients and found that underlying disease, including hypertension, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease, may be risk factors for severe patients compared with non-severe patients."

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by an unpredictable disease course, ranging from asymptomatic to severe, life-threatening infections. Asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have been described, and the aim of this systematic review was to summarise their presentation forms.
Methods
We searched PubMed® and Google® (1 December 2019 to 29 March 2020) and extracted age, laboratory findings, and computed tomography (CT) scans. Pooled incidence rates of clinical characteristics were analyzed using random-effect models.
Results
In total, 506 patients from 34 studies (68 single cases and 438 from case-series) with an asymptomatic course were identified. Patients with normal radiology were younger (19.59 ± 17.17 years) than patients with abnormal radiology (39.14 ± 26.70 years) (p-value = 0.013). Despite being asymptomatic, CT investigations revealed abnormalities in 62.2% of the cases; ground-glass opacities were most frequently observed (43.09% by meta-analysis). Most studies reported normal laboratory findings (61.74% by meta-analysis).
Conclusions
More than half of the patients without any symptoms present with CT abnormalities. Asymptomatic patients may be contagious and thus a potential source of transmission of COVID-19."

Methods
127 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, and classified into non-severe and severe groups. Demographics, symptoms, underlying diseases and laboratory data were collected and assessed for predictive value.
Results
Of 127 COVID-19 patients, 16 cases (12.60%) were classified into the severe group. High level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reaction protein (CRP) and hypertension were independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. The risk model based on IL-6, CRP and hypertension had the highest area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). Additionally, the baseline IL-6 was positively correlated with other immune-inflammatory parameters and the dynamic change of IL-6 in the severe cases were parallel to the amelioration of the disease.
Conclusion
Our study showed that high level of IL-6, CRP and hypertension were independent risk factors for assessing the severity of COVID-19. The risk model established upon IL-6, CRP and hypertension had the highest predictability in this study. Besides, IL-6 played a pivotal role in the severity of COVID-19 and had a potential value for monitoring the process of severe cases."

To evaluate the therapeutic use of plasma exchange in COVID-19 patients compared to controls.
Methods
Case series of critically ill adult men and non-pregnant women, ≥18 years of age, with laboratory confirmed COVID-19, was conducted at the Royal Hospital, Oman, from April 17th to May 11th, 2020. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was performed on patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed or imminent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or severe pneumonia. Analysis was performed using univariate statistics.
Results
A total of 31 COVID-19 patients were included with an overall mean age of 51 ± 15 years (range: 27-76 years), 90% (n = 28) were males, and 35% (n = 11) of the patients had TPE as a mode of treatment. The TPE group was associated with higher extubation rates than the non-TPE cohort (73% versus 20%; p =  0.018). Additionally, patients on TPE had a lower 14 days (0 versus 35%; p =  0.033) and 28 days (0 versus 35%; p =  0.033) all-cause mortality compared to patients not on TPE. However, all-cause mortality was only marginally lower in the TPE group compared to the non-TPE group (9.1% versus 45%; p =  0.055; power = 66%). Laboratory and ventilatory parameters also improved with the TPE.
Conclusions
The use of TPE in severe COVID-19 patients has been associated with improved outcomes, however, randomized controlled clinical trials are warranted to draw final conclusive findings."

Existing findings regarding the relationship between comorbidities and Covid-19 severity is inconsistent and insufficient. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between different comorbidities and the severity of Covid-19.
Methods
PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify studies reporting on the rate of comorbidities in Covid-19 patients with severe/fatal outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to disease severity, and the country of residence. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using random-effects models.
Results
A total of 34 eligible studies were identified. In patients with severe/fatal Covid-19, the most prevalent chronic comorbidity was obesity (42%, 95CI 34-49%) and hypertension (40%, 95%CI 35-45%), followed by diabetes (17%, 95%CI 15-20%), cardiovascular disease (13%, 95%CI 11-15%), respiratory disease (8%, 95%CI 6-10%), cerebrovascular disease (6%, 95%CI 4-8%), malignancy (4%, 95% CI 3-6%), kidney disease (3%, 95%CI 2-4%), and liver disease (2%, 95%CI 1-3%). In order of the prediction, the pooled ORs of the chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, malignancy, diabetes, and obesity in patients with severe or fatal Covid-19 were (OR 3.56, 95%CI 2.87-4.41), (OR 3.17, 95%CI 2.46-4.08), (OR 3.13, 95%CI 2.65-3.70), (OR 3.02, 95%CI 2.23-4.08), (OR 2.74, 95%CI 1.59-4.74), (OR 2.73, 95%CI 1.73-4.21), (OR 2.63, 95%CI 2.08-3.33), and (OR 1.72, 95%CI 1.04-2.85), respectively, compared with patients with non-severe/fatal Covid-19. No correlation was observed between liver disease and Covid-19 aggravation (OR 1.54, 95%CI 0.95-2.49).
Conclusions
Chronic comorbidities, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardia-cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, kidney disease, and malignancy, are clinical risk factors of severe or fatal outcomes associated with Covid-19, with obesity being the most prevalent, and respiratory disease being the most strongly predictive. Knowledge of these risk factors can help clinicians better identify and guide the high-risk populations."

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely spread. We aim to investigate the dynamic changes of peripheral blood lymphocytes subsets in adult patients with COVID-19.
Methods
Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 435 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and retrospectively analyzed. The counts of lymphocyte subsets at each week after the onset of the illness were compared with other weeks of illness and with those from normal individuals.
Results
The various lymphocyte subsets (CD3 +, CD4 +, CD8 +, CD19 +and CD16/56 +) were below the normal ranges at the first week after the onset of the illness, reaching a nadir during the second week, which increased gradually in the third week and returned to normal levels in the fifth week, but was still lower than the healthy controls. The CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ counts were significantly lower in those with severe disease compared to those with non-severe disease, and in those patients that died compared to those who recovered.
Discussion
our research indicates that the levels of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (CD3 +, CD4 +, and CD8 +) are associated with disease progression, severity, and prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Dynamic monitoring of human immune function is one of the indicators for evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients, and it is helpful to formulate appropriate treatment strategies."

The COVID-19 outbreak spread in China and is a threat to the world. The aims of this study to help health workers better understand the epidemic of the COVID-19 and provide different control strategies toward Hubei Province and other regions in China.
Methods
A comprehensive search of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention official websites and announcements was performed between 20 Jan 2019 and 29 Feb 2020. The relevant data of the distribution of the infection on each reported day were obtained.
Results& findings
Up to 29 Feb 2020, 79,824 confirmed cases with the COVID-19 including 66,907 in Hubei Province and 12,377 in other administrative regions were reported. The SARS-COV-2 showed faster epidemic trends compared with the 2003-SARS-CoV. A total of 2,870 deaths have been reported nationwide among 79,824 confirmed cases, with a mortality of 3.6%. The mortality of the COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei Province than that in other regions(4.1% versus 0.84%). Since 1 Feb 2020 the number of discharged cases exceeded the number of the dead. By 29 Feb 2020, the number of discharged patients was 41,625, which exceeded the number of hospitalized patients, and the trend has further increased.
Conclusions
The infection of the SARS-COV-2 is spreading and increasing nationwide, and Hubei Province is the main epidemic area, with higher mortality. The outbreak is now under initial control especially in other regions outside of Hubei Province. Due to the different epidemic characteristics between Hubei Province and other regions, we should focus on different prevention and control strategies."

A pneumonia associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recently emerged in China. It was recognized as a global health hazard.
Methods
234 inpatients with COVID-19 were included. Detailed clinical data, chest HRCT basic performances and certain signs were recorded Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping were quantified. Both clinical types and CT stages were evaluated.
Results
Most patients (approximately 90%) were classified as common type and with epidemiologic history. Fever and cough were main symptoms. Chest CT showed abnormal attenuation in bilateral multiple lung lobes, distributed in the lower and/or periphery of the lungs (94.98%), with multiple shapes. GGO and vascular enhancement sign were most frequent seen, followed by interlobular septal thickening and air bronchus sign as well as consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping. There were significant differences in most of CT signs between different stage groups. The SpO2 and OI were decreased in stage IV, and the CT score of consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping was significantly lower in stage I (P<0.05). A weak relevance was between the fibrosis score and the value of PaO2 and SpO2 (P<0.05).
Conclusions
Clinical performances of patients with COVID-19, mostly with epidemiologic history and typical symptoms, were critical valuable in the diagnosis of the COVID-19. While chest HRCT provided the distribution, shape, attenuation and extent of lung lesions, as well as some typical CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia."

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak simultaneously occurred at a church and a long-term care facility in Daegu. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 and factors related to severe outcomes.
Methods
We enrolled all inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 21 and April 2, 2020 in Daegu Dongsan Hospital, South Korea. We analyzed their clinical and demographic data, laboratory parameters, radiological findings, symptoms, and treatment outcomes.
Results
Of 694 patients, severe cases accounted for 19.7% (137 patients). No severe case was observed among patients aged ≤19 years. Hypertension was the most common co-morbidity (27%), and cough was the most common symptom (59%). Besides, asymptomatic patients accounted for 14.4% of cases. Lymphopenia, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and albumin were associated with severe outcomes. The first outbreak was mostly associated with younger age groups, and asymptomatic patients mostly showed mild progression. In the second outbreak involving a long-term care facility, both the number of severe patients and the mortality rate were high.
Conclusions
The overall mortality in Daegu was low, which might have resulted from large scale mass screening to detect patients and starting appropriate treatment, including hospitalization for severe cases, and quarantine for asymptomatic patients."

Previous studies on the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) have found strong correlations between online searches and the epidemiology of the disease.
Aim
Our aim was to determine if online searches for COVID-19 related to international media announcements or national epidemiology.
Methods
Searches for “coronavirus” were made on Google Trends from December 31, 2019 to April 13, 2020 for 40 European countries. The online COVID-19 searches for all countries were correlated with each other. COVID-10 epidemiology (i.e. incidence and mortality) was correlated with the national online searches. Major announcements by the World Health Organization (WHO) were taken into consideration with peaks in online searches. Correlations were made using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
Results
Overall, the online searches for COVID-19 were not correlated with the actual incidence and mortality of COVID-19. The mean Spearman correlation for incidence was 0.20 (range −0.66 to 0.76) and for mortality was 0.35 (range −0.75 to 0.85). Online searches in Europe were all strongly synchronized with each other; a mean Spearman correlation of 0.93 (range 0.62 to 0.99).
Conclusions
Online searches for COVID-19 in Europe are not correlated with epidemiology but strongly correlated with international WHO announcements. Our study challenges previous Google Trends studies and emphasizes the role of the WHO in raising awareness of a new disease."

Several studies have indicated that densely populated urban environments and the heavy dependence on traffic could increase the potential spread of COVID-19. This study investigated the association between changes in traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea.
Methods
This study analyzed the daily national traffic and traffic trend for 3 months from January 1, 2020. Traffic data were measured using 6307 vehicle detection system (VDS). This study analyzed the difference in traffic levels between 2019 and 2020. Non-linear regression was performed to analyze the change in traffic trend in 2020. The relationship between traffic and confirmed COVID-19 cases was analyzed using single linear regression.
Results
The mean daily nationwide level of traffic for the first 3 months of 2020 was 143 655 563 vehicles, which was 9.7% lower than the same period in 2019 (159 044 566 vehicles). All regions showed a decreasing trend in traffic in February, which shifted to an increasing trend from March. In Incheon there was a positive, but insignificant, linear relationship between increasing numbers of newly confirmed cases and increasing traffic (β = 43 146; p = 0.056).
Conclusions
Numbers of newly confirmed COVID-19 patients have been decreasing since March, while the traffic has been increasing. The fact that traffic is increasing indicates greater contact between people, which in turn increases the risk of further COVID-19 spread. Therefore, the government will need to devise suitable policies, such as total social distancing."

To compare the clinical characteristics and the dynamics of viral load between imported and non-imported patients with COVID-19.
Design and methods
Data from 51 laboratory-confirmed patients were retrospectively analyzed.
Results
The incubation period in the tertiary group was longer than that in the imported and secondary groups (both p < 0.05). Fever was the most common symptom at the onset of illness (73.33%, 58.82%, and 68.42%, respectively), and half of the patients had a low-grade temperature (<38.0 °C) with a short duration of fever (<7 days). CT scans showed that most patients in the three groups had bilateral pneumonia (80.00%, 76.47%, and 73.68%, respectively). Ct values detected in the tertiary patients were similar to those for the imported and secondary groups at the time of admission (both p > 0.05). For the tertiary group, the viral load was undetectable in half of the patients (52.63%) on day 7, and in all patients on day 14. For one third of the patients in the imported and secondary groups, the viral load remained positive on day 14 after the admission.
Conclusions
COVID-19 can present as pneumonia with a low onset of symptoms, and the infectivity of SARS-CoV2 may gradually decrease in tertiary patients."

Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, recorded its first confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case on 23 January 2020. We reviewed the case epidemiology and the various public health measures implemented from January to May 2020.
Methods
The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the cases recorded in different phases of the epidemic were described and compared, and the effectiveness of the public health measures implemented were reviewed using the changes in the daily number of confirmed cases and the interval from symptom onset to hospital admission.
Results
Between January and May 2020, 1084 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported, about 70% of which had a history of travel during the incubation period. The case fatality ratio was 0.4%. The local epidemic progressed through four phases: (1) preparedness and imported infection from mainland China, (2) local transmission, (3) imported infection from overseas countries associated with local transmission, and (4) controlled imported infection with limited local transmission, with an eventual reduction of the daily case number and minimization of the onset-to-admission interval. Various public health measures, including enhanced surveillance, border control, and social distancing, were introduced in phases in response to the prevailing local and global situations.
Discussion
The overall containment strategy in Hong Kong led to a stabilization of the number of cases and the absence of a community-wide outbreak during the 4.5 m after the first case was reported. This strategy of containment might serve as an example for future planning of preparedness and response against novel infectious agents."

Although COVID-19 is known to be caused by human-to-human transmission, it remains largely unclear whether ambient air pollutants and meteorological parameters could promote its transmission.
Methods
A retrospective study was conducted to study whether air quality index (AQI), four ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and CO) and five meteorological variables (daily temperature, highest temperature, lowest temperature, temperature difference and sunshine duration) could increase COVID-19 incidence in Wuhan and XiaoGan between Jan 26th to Feb 29th in 2020.
Results
First, a significant correlation was found between COVID-19 incidence and AQI in both Wuhan (R2=0.13, p<0.05) and XiaoGan (R2=0.223, p<0.01). Specifically, among four pollutants, COVID-19 incidence was prominently correlated with PM2.5 and NO2 in both cities. In Wuhan, the tightest correlation was observed between NO2 and COVID-19 incidence (R2=0.329, p<0.01). In XiaoGan, in addition to the PM2.5 (R2=0.117, p<0.01) and NO2 (R2=0.015, p<0.05), a notable correlation was also observed between the PM10 and COVID-19 incidence (R2=0.105, p<0.05). Moreover, temperature is the only meteorological parameter that constantly correlated well with COVID-19 incidence in both Wuhan and XiaoGan, but in an inverse correlation (p<0.05).
Conclusions
AQI, PM2.5, NO2, and temperature are four variables that could promote the sustained transmission of COVID-19."

To describe the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Methods
We recruited 73 patients with COVID-19 [49 men and 24 women; average age: 58.36 years (SD: 14.31)] admitted to the intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from December 30, 2019 to February 16, 2020. Demographics, underlying diseases, and laboratory test results on admission were collected and analyzed. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.
Results
The non-survivors were older (65.46 [SD 9.74]vs 46.23 [12.01]) and were more likely to have chronic medical illnesses. Non-survivors tend to develop more severe lymphopenia, with higher C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, D-dimer, and hs-Troponin I(hs-TnI) levels. Patients with elevated hs-TnI levels on admission had shorter duration from symptom onset to death. Increased hs-TnI level was related to dismal prognosis. Death risk increased by 20.8% when the hs-TnI level increased by one unit. After adjusting for inflammatory or coagulation index, the independent predictive relationship between hs-TnI and death disappeared.
Conclusions
Cardiac injury may occur at the early stage of COVID-19, which is associated with high mortality. Inflammatory factor cascade and coagulation abnormality may be the potential mechanisms of COVID-19 combined with cardiac injury."

abstract = "Background
the recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has quickly spread globally since its discovery in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. A comprehensive strategy, including surveillance, diagnostics, research, and clinical treatment is urgently needed to win the battle against COVID-19. Recently, numerous studies reported the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients. Yet, the incidence and viral transmission from the asymptomatic cases are not apparent yet.
Aim
this study aims to systematically review the published literature on SARS-CoV-2 in the asymptomatic patients to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among asymptomatic cases, as well as describe its epidemiological and clinical significance.
Method
the literature was searched through four scientific databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct.
Results
a total of 63 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria where the majority of the reported studies were from China. However, there was a lack of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological studies from several countries worldwide, tracing the actual incidence of COVID-19, especially in asymptomatic patients. Studies with a large sample size (n>1000) estimated that percentage of people contracting SARS-CoV-2 and are likely to be asymptomatic ranges from 1.2-12.9%. However, the other studies with a smaller sample size reported a much higher incidence and indicated that up to 87.9% of COVID-19 infected individuals could be asymptomatic. Most of these studies indicated that asymptopatics are a potential source of infection to the community.
Conclusion
this review highlighted the need for more robust and well-designed studies to better estimate COVID-19 incidence among asymptomatic patients worldwide. The early identification of the asymptomatic cases, as well as monitoring and tracing close contact, could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19."

A stringent screening process at all airports in Malaysia was enforced after the first case outside China was reported in Thailand. Up to April 14, 2020, Malaysia had reported two waves of COVID-19 cases, with the first wave ending successfully within less than 2 months. In early March 2020, the second wave occurred, with worrying situations.
Actions taken
The Government of Malaysia enforced a Movement Control Order starting on March 18, 2020 to break the chain of COVID-19. The media actively spread the hashtag #stayhome. Non-governmental organizations, as well as prison inmates, started to produce personal protective equipment for frontliners. Various organizations hosted fundraising events to provide essentials mainly to hospitals. A provisional hospital was set up and collaborations with healthcare service providers were granted, while additional laboratories were assigned to enhance the capabilities of the Ministry of Health.
Economic downturn
An initial financial stimulus amounting to RM 20.0 billion was released in February 2020, before the highlighted PRIHATIN Package, amounting to RM 250 billion, was announced.

abstract = "Objective
As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to proliferate globally, this paper shares the findings of modelling the outbreak in China at both provincial and national levels. This paper examines the applicability of the logistic growth model, with implications for the study of the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious diseases.
Methods
An NLS (Non-Linear Least Squares) method was employed to estimate the parameters of a differentiated logistic growth function using new daily COVID-19 cases in multiple regions in China and in other selected countries. The estimation was based upon training data from January 20, 2020 to March 13, 2020. A restriction test was subsequently implemented to examine whether a designated parameter was identical among regions or countries, and the diagnosis of residuals was also conducted. The model's goodness of fit was checked using testing data from March 14, 2020 to April 18, 2020.
Results
The model presented in this paper fitted time-series data exceedingly well for the whole of China, its eleven selected provinces and municipalities, and two other countries - South Korea and Iran - and provided estimates of key parameters. This study rejected the null hypothesis that the growth rates of outbreaks were the same among ten selected non-Hubei provinces in China, as well as between South Korea and Iran. The study found that the model did not provide reliable estimates for countries that were in the early stages of outbreaks. Furthermore, this study concured that the R2 values might vary and mislead when compared between different portions of the same non-linear curve. In addition, the study identified the existence of heteroskedasticity and positive serial correlation within residuals in some provinces and countries.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that there is potential for this model to contribute to better public health policy in combatting COVID-19. The model does so by providing a simple logistic framework for retrospectively analyzing outbreaks in regions that have already experienced a maximal proliferation in cases. Based upon statistical findings, this study also outlines certain challenges in modelling and their implications for the results."

Several recent case reports have described common early chest imaging findings of lung pathology caused by 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV2) which appear to be similar to those seen previously in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected patients.
Objective
We present some remarkable imaging findings of the first two patients identified in Italy with COVID-19 infection travelling from Wuhan, China. The follow-up with chest X-Rays and CT scans was also included, showing a progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Results
Moderate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up, apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration. Another uncommon element was the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with short-axis oval nodes.
Conclusions
Although only two patients have been studied, these findings are consistent with the radiological pattern described in literature. Finally, the pulmonary vessels enlargement in areas where new lung infiltrates develop in the follow-up CT scan, could describe an early predictor radiological sign of lung impairment."

The outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has currently become a global concern. The generations of the epidemic spread are not well known, yet these are critical parameters to facilitate an understanding of the epidemic. A seafood wholesale market and Wuhan city, China, were recognized as the primary and secondary epidemic sources. Human movements nationwide from the two epidemic sources revealed the characteristics of the first-generation and second-generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the potential third-generation spread.
Methods
We used spatiotemporal data of COVID-19 cases in mainland China and two categories of location-based service (LBS) data of mobile devices from the primary and secondary epidemic sources to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient,r, and spatial stratified heterogeneity, q, statistics.
Results
Two categories of device trajectories had generally significant correlations and determinant powers of the epidemic spread. Bothr and q statistics decreased with distance from the epidemic sources and their associations changed with time. At the beginning of the epidemic, the mixed first-generation and second-generation spreads appeared in most cities with confirmed cases. They strongly interacted to enhance the epidemic in Hubei province and the trend was also significant in the provinces adjacent to Hubei. The third-generation spread started in Wuhan from January 17–20, 2020, and in Hubei from January 23–24. No obvious third-generation spread was detected outside Hubei.
Conclusions
The findings provide important foundations to quantify the effect of human movement on epidemic spread and inform ongoing control strategies. The spatiotemporal association between the epidemic spread and human movements from the primary and secondary epidemic sources indicates a transfer from second to third generations of the infection. Urgent control measures include preventing the potential third-generation spread in mainland China, eliminating it in Hubei, and reducing the interaction influence of first-generation and second-generation spreads."

As of week 21, 2020, the complete set of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID and GenBank databases were used in this study. SARS-CoV-2 primer sequences from publicly available panels (WHO, CDC, NMDC, and HKU) and QIAstat-Dx were included in the alignment, and accumulated genetic variability affecting any oligonucleotide annealing was annotated.
Results
A total of 11,627 (34.38%) genomes included single mutations affecting annealing of any PCR assay. Variations in 8,773 (25.94%) genomes were considered as high risk, whereas additional 2,854 (8.43%) genomes presented low frequent single mutations and were predicted to yield no impact on sensitivity. In case of the QIAstat-Dx SARS-CoV-2 Panel, 99.11% of the genomes matched with a 100% coverage all oligonucleotides, and critical variations were tested in vitro corroborating no loss of sensitivity.
Conclusions
This analysis stresses the importance of targeting more than one region in the viral genome for SARS-CoV-2 detection to mitigate the risk of loss of sensitivity due to the unknown mutation rate during this SARS-CoV-2 outbreak."

Data include the number of persons tested and the categories were classified as international arrivals, community members, and long-distance truck drivers.
Results
The first cases were international arrivals from Asia and Europe, and after that, community cases emerged. However, in the middle of April 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected among long-distance truck drivers. By May 29, 2020, 89, 224 persons had been tested; overall, 442 tested positive. Of those that tested positive, the majority, or 317 (71.8%) were truck drivers, 75 (16.9%) were community cases, and 50 (11.3%) were international arrivals. The majority of community cases have been linked to contact with truck drivers.
Conclusions
Truck drivers were the most frequently diagnosed category, and have become a core group for COVID-19 in Uganda. They have generated significant local transmission, which now threatens a full-blown epidemic unless strict controls are put in place."

The aim of this study is to assess how COVID-19 clustered across districts in South Korea and to assess whether the pattern and duration of clusters changed following the country’s containment strategy.
Methods
We conducted spatiotemporal analysis of COVID-19 daily confirmed cases by 250 districts in South Korea from January 20 to May 31, 2020, obtained from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and each provincial website. Global Moran’s I statistic was used for spatial autocorrelation analysis and retrospective space-time scan statistic was used to analyze spatiotemporal clusters of COVID-19.
Results
The geographical distribution showed strong spatial autocorrelation, with a global Moran’s I coefficient of 0.784 (p = 0.0001). Twelve statistically significant spatiotemporal clusters were identified by space-time scan statistic using a discrete Poisson model. The spatial pattern of clusters changed and the duration of clusters became shorter over time.
Conclusions
Results indicate that South Korea’s containment strategy of COVID-19 was highly effective in both early detection and mitigation, with recent clusters being small in size and duration. Lessons from South Korea should spark a discussion on epidemic response."

We hypothesized that immune response may contribute to progression of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) at the second week of illness. Therefore, we compared cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses between severe and mild COVID-19 cases.
Methods
We examined peripheral blood mononuclear cells of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from their first and third weeks of illness. Severe pneumonia was defined as an oxygen saturation ≤93% at room air. Expressions of molecules related to T-cell activation and functions were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Results
The population dynamics of T cells at the first week were not different between the two groups. However, total numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells tended to be lower in the severe group at the third week of illness. Expressions of Ki-67, PD-1, perforin, and granzyme B in CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were significantly higher in the severe group than in the mild group at the third week. In contrast to the mild group, the levels of their expression did not decrease in the severe group.
Conclusions
Severe COVID-19 had a higher degree of proliferation, activation, and cytotoxicity of T-cells at the late phase of illness without cytotoxic T-cell contraction, which might contribute to the development of severe COVID-19."

abstract = "Objectives
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a major pandemic threat that has spread to more than 212 countries with more than 432,902 recorded deaths and 7,898,442 confirmed cases worldwide so far (on June 14, 2020). It is crucial to investigate the spatial drivers to prevent and control the epidemic of COVID-19.
Methods
This is the first comprehensive study of COVID-19 in Iran; and it carries out spatial modeling, risk mapping, change detection, and outbreak trend analysis of the disease spread. Four main steps were taken: comparison of Iranian coronavirus data with the global trends, prediction of mortality trends using regression modeling, spatial modeling, risk mapping, and change detection using the random forest (RF) machine learning technique (MLT), and validation of the modeled risk map.
Results
The results show that from February 19 to June 14, 2020, the average growth rates (GR) of COVID-19 deaths and the total number of COVID-19 cases in Iran were 1.08 and 1.10, respectively. Based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) data, Iran’s fatality rate (deaths/0.1M pop) is 10.53. Other countries’ fatality rates were, for comparison, Belgium – 83.32, UK – 61.39, Spain – 58.04, Italy – 56.73, Sweden – 48.28, France – 45.04, USA – 35.52, Canada – 21.49, Brazil – 20.10, Peru – 19.70, Chile – 16.20, Mexico– 12.80, and Germany – 10.58. The fatality rate for China is 0.32 (deaths/0.1M pop). Over time, the heatmap of the infected areas identified two critical time intervals for the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. The provinces were classified in terms of disease and death rates into a large primary group and three provinces that had critical outbreaks were separate from the others. The heatmap of countries of the world shows that China and Italy were distinguished from other countries in terms of nine viral infection-related parameters. The regression models for death cases showed an increasing trend but with some evidence of turning. A polynomial relationship was identified between the coronavirus infection rate and the province population density. Also, a third-degree polynomial regression model for deaths showed an increasing trend recently, indicating that subsequent measures taken to cope with the outbreak have been insufficient and ineffective. The general trend of deaths in Iran is similar to the world's, but Iran’s shows lower volatility. Change detection of COVID-19 risk maps with a random forest model for the period from March 11 to March 18 showed an increasing trend of COVID-19 in Iran’s provinces. It is worth noting that using the LASSO MLT to evaluate variables’ importance, indicated that the most important variables were the distance from bus stations, bakeries, hospitals, mosques, ATMs (automated teller machines), banks, and the minimum temperature of the coldest month.
Conclusions
We believe that this study's risk maps are the primary, fundamental step to take for managing and controlling COVID-19 in Iran and its provinces."

COVID-19 is spreading globally. This study aims to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 to provide reference for clinical work.
Methods
The clinical features and outcomes of 10 pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 at Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, a tertiary- care teaching hospital in Hubei province, Wuhan, China from January 23 to February 23, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
Results
All the 10 observed pregnant women including 9 singletons and 1 twin were native people in Wuhan. All of them were diagnosed mild COVID-19, and none of the patients developed severe COVID-19 or died. Among the 10 patients, two patients underwent vaginal delivery, two patients underwent intrapartum cesarean section, and the remaining six patients underwent elective cesarean section. All of 10 patients showed lung abnormalities by pulmonary CT images after delivery. Their eleven newborns were recorded and no neonatal asphyxia was observed.
Conclusions
Pulmonary CT screening on admission may be necessary to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 during the outbreak period. And COVID-19 is not an indication of cesarean section."

Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan in December 2019, by March 10, 2020, a total of 80,932 confirmed cases have been reported in China. Two consecutively negative RT-PCR test results in respiratory tract specimens is required for the evaluation of discharge from hospital, and oropharyngeal swabs were the most common sample. However, false negative results occurred in the late stage of hospitalization, and avoiding false negative result is critical essential.
Methods
We reviewed the medical record of 353 patients who received tests with both specimens simultaneously, and compared the performance between nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs.
Results
Of the 353 patients (outpatients, 192; inpatients, 161) studied, the median age was 54 years, and 177 (50.1%) were women. Higher positive rate (positive tests/total tests) was observed in nasopharyngeal swabs than oropharyngeal swabs, especially in inpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from inpatients showed higher positive rate than outpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from male showed higher positive rate than female, especially in outpatients. Detection with both specimens slightly increased the positive rate than nasopharyngeal swab only. Moreover, the consistency between from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were poor (Kappa=0.308).
Conclusion
In conclusion, our study suggests that nasopharyngeal swabs may be more suitable than oropharyngeal swab at this stage of COVID-19 outbreak."

Amid the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, South Korea has been lauded for successfully preventing the spread of this infectious disease, which may be due to the aggressive implementation of preventive policies. This study was performed to evaluate the pattern of spread of COVID-19 in South Korea considering the potential impact of policy interventions on transmission rates.
Methods
A SIR (susceptible–infected–removed) model with a breakpoint that allows a change in transmission rate at an unknown point was established. Estimated trajectories of COVID-19 from SIR models with and without a breakpoint were compared.
Results
The proposed model with a break fitted the actual series of infection cases much better than the classic model. The estimated breakpoint was March 7, 2020 and the transmission rate dropped by 0.23 after the breakpoint. A counterfactual study based on our estimate indicated that the number of infected could have reached 2 500 000 compared to the peak of 8000 in the observed series.
Conclusions
It is critical to consider a change in the transmission rate to evaluate the trajectory of spread of COVID-19 in South Korea. Our estimation and counterfactual experiments indicate that public health interventions may play a role in determining the pattern of spread of infectious diseases."

abstract = "Significance
The United States is in an acceleration phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently there is no known effective therapy or vaccine for treatment of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting urgency around identifying effective therapies.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine therapy alone and in combination with azithromycin in hospitalized patients positive for COVID-19.
Design
Multi-center retrospective observational study.
Setting
The Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) in Southeast Michigan: large six hospital integrated health system; the largest of hospitals is an 802-bed quaternary academic teaching hospital in urban Detroit, Michigan.
Participants
Consecutive patients hospitalized with a COVID-related admission in the health system from March 10, 2020 to May 2, 2020 were included. Only the first admission was included for patients with multiple admissions. All patients evaluated were 18 years of age and older and were treated as inpatients for at least 48h unless expired within 24h.
Exposure
Receipt of hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, azithromycin alone, or neither.
Main outcome
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.
Results
Of 2,541 patients, with a median total hospitalization time of 6 days (IQR: 4–10 days), median age was 64 years (IQR:53–76 years), 51% male, 56% African American, with median time to follow-up of 28.5 days (IQR:3–53). Overall in-hospital mortality was 18.1% (95% CI:16.6%–19.7%); by treatment: hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin, 157/783 (20.1% [95% CI: 17.3%–23.0%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 162/1202 (13.5% [95% CI: 11.6%–15.5%]), azithromycin alone, 33/147 (22.4% [95% CI: 16.0%–30.1%]), and neither drug, 108/409 (26.4% [95% CI: 22.2%–31.0%]). Primary cause of mortality was respiratory failure (88%); no patient had documented torsades de pointes. From Cox regression modeling, predictors of mortality were age>65 years (HR:2.6 [95% CI:1.9–3.3]), white race (HR:1.7 [95% CI:1.4–2.1]), CKD (HR:1.7 [95%CI:1.4–2.1]), reduced O2 saturation level on admission (HR:1.5 [95%CI:1.1–2.1]), and ventilator use during admission (HR: 2.2 [95%CI:1.4–3.3]). Hydroxychloroquine provided a 66% hazard ratio reduction, and hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin 71% compared to neither treatment (p<0.001).
Conclusions and relevance
In this multi-hospital assessment, when controlling for COVID-19 risk factors, treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin was associated with reduction in COVID-19 associated mortality. Prospective trials are needed to examine this impact."

Method
Using openly available data of daily cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, the basic and effective reproduction numbers was estimated using a modified susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered-type epidemic model.
Results
The basic reproduction number was estimated to be  R0=1.77. The effective reproduction number increased approximately 20 times after the mass infections from the 31 st patient, which was confirmed on February 9 in the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, Daegu. However, the effective reproduction number decreased to less than unity after February 28 owing to the implementation of high-level preventive control interventions in South Korea, coupled with voluntary prevention actions by citizens.

Results
Four hundred and twenty-six (426) samples from 264 patients were tested for MERS Co-V and respiratory viruses. No MERS-CoV infections were identified by PCR. Fifty-six percent of samples were PCR positive for viral or bacterial pathogen with Influenza A as the predominant virus (44%). Sixty-two percent of all patients had a pathogen identified with the highest positivity from sputum samples. Patients with multiple samples demonstrated a 100% diagnostic yield.
Conclusions
Although no cases of MERS were identified, the majority of patients had Influenza infection for which oseltamivir treatment was indicated and isolation warranted. Sputum samples were the most useful in diagnosing respiratory viruses with a 100% diagnostic yield from patients with multiple samples."

Clinical characteristics and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from 86 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital. Chronological analysis method was used to detailly clarify the neurosensory dysfunction. The cycle threshold (Ct) values were used to approximately indicate viral load.
Results
Forth-four (51.2%) patients had neurosensory dysfunction: hyposmia (34, 39.5%), hypogeusia (33, 38.4%), and tinnitus (3, 3.5%). Neurosensory dysfunction was significantly more common in patients under 40 years old (p = 0.001) or women (p = 0.006). Hyposmia and hypogeusia coexisted in 23 (26.7%) patients. The interval between onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia was 0.7 ± 1.46 days. The interval from onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia to typical symptoms was 0.22 ± 4.57 and 0.75 ± 6.77 days; the interval from onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia to admission was 6.06 ± 6.68 and 5.76 ± 7.68 days; and the duration of hyposmia and hypogeusia was 9.09 ± 5.74 and 7.12 ± 4.66 days, respectively. The viral load was high since symptoms onset, peaked within the first week, and then gradually declined.
Conclusions
The neurosensory dysfunction tends to occur in the early stage of COVID-19, and it could be used as a marker for early diagnosis of COVID-19."

Different countries have adopted different containment and testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2. The difference in testing makes it difficult to compare the effect of different containment strategies. This study proposes methods to allow a direct comparison and presents the results.
Design
Publicly available data on the numbers of reported COVID-19-related deaths between 01 January and 17 April 2020 were compared between countries.
Results
The numbers of cases or deaths per 100,000 inhabitants gave severely biased comparisons between countries. Only the number of deaths expressed as a percentage of the number of deaths on day 25 after the first reported COVID-19-related death allowed a direct comparison between countries. From this comparison clear differences were observed between countries, associated with the timing of the implementation of containment measures.
Conclusions
Comparisons between countries are only possible when simultaneously taking into account that the virus does not arrive in all countries simultaneously, absolute numbers are incomparable due to different population sizes, rates per 100,000 of the population are incomparable because not all countries are affected homogeneously, susceptibility to death by COVID-19 can differ between populations, and a death is only reported as a COVID-19-related death if the patient was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. With the current methods, all these factors were accounted for and an unbiased direct comparison between countries was established. This comparison confirmed that early adoption of containment strategies is key in flattening the curve of the epidemic."

abstract = "Objectives
As a global pandemic is inevitable, real-time monitoring of transmission is vital for containing the spread of COVID-19. The main objective of this study was to report the real-time effective reproduction numbers (R(t)) and case fatality rates (CFR) in Europe.
Methods
Data for this study were obtained mainly from the World Health Organization website, up to March 9, 2020. R(t) were estimated by exponential growth rate (EG) and time-dependent (TD) methods. ‘R0’ package in R was employed to estimate R(t) by fitting the existing epidemic curve. Both the naïve CFR (nCFR) and adjusted CFR (aCFR) were estimated.
Results
With the EG method, R(t) was 3.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.17–3.38) for Italy, 6.32 (95% CI 5.72–6.99) for France, 6.07 (95% CI 5.51–6.69) for Germany, and 5.08 (95% CI 4.51–5.74) for Spain. With the TD method, the R value for March 9 was 3.10 (95% CI 2.21–4.11) for Italy, 6.56 (95% CI 2.04–12.26) for France, 4.43 (95% CI 1.83–7.92) for Germany, and 3.95 (95% CI 0–10.19) for Spain.
Conclusions
This study provides important findings on the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. Due to the recent rapid increase in new cases of COVID-19, real-time monitoring of the transmissibility and mortality in Spain and France is a priority."

abstract = "Objectives
This study aimed to compare clinical courses and outcomes between pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women with COVID-19, and to assess the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 in pregnancy.
Methods
Medical records of pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 15 to March 15, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The severity of disease, virus clearance time, and length of hospital stay were measured as the primary objective, while the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 was also assessed.
Results
Eighty-two patients (28 pregnant women, 54 reproductive-aged non-pregnant women) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Univariate regression indicated no association between pregnancy and severity of disease (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.08–5.15; p=0.76), virus clearance time (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.65–2.01; p=0.62), and length of hospital stay (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.66–1.84; p=0.71). Of the pregnant women, 22 delivered 23 live births, either by cesarean section (17, 60.7%) or vaginal delivery (5, 17.9%), and no neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusions
Pregnant women have comparable clinical courses and outcomes with reproductive-aged non-pregnant women when infected with SARS-CoV-2. No evidence supported vertical transmission of COVID-19 in the late stage of pregnancy, including vaginal delivery."

Methods
This study explored the spatial epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in mainland China. Moran’s I spatial statistic with various definitions of neighbours was used to conduct a test to determine whether a spatial association of the COVID-19 infections existed.
Results
The spatial spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in China was observed. The results showed that most of the models, except medical-care-based connection models, indicated a significant spatial association of COVID-19 infections from around 22 January 2020.
Conclusions
Spatial analysis is of great help in understanding the spread of infectious diseases, and spatial association was the key to the spatial spread during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China."

Elderly people had suffered a disproportionate burden of COVID-19. We hypothesized that males and females in different age groups might have different epidemic trajectories.
Methods
Using publicly available data from South Korea, daily new COVID-19 cases were assessed using generalized additive models, assuming Poisson and negative binomial distributions. Epidemic dynamics by age and gender groups were explored using interactions between smoothed time terms and age and gender.
Results
A negative binomial distribution fitted the daily case counts best. The relationship between the dynamic patterns of daily new cases and age groups was statistically significant (p<0.001), but this was not the case with gender groups. People aged 20–39 years led the epidemic processes in South Korean society with two peaks — one major peak around March 1 and a smaller peak around April 7, 2020. The epidemic process among people aged 60 or above trailed behind that of the younger age group, and with smaller magnitude. After March 15, there was a consistent decline of daily new cases among elderly people, despite large fluctuations in case counts among young adults.
Conclusions
Although young people drove the COVID-19 epidemic throughout society, with multiple rebounds, elderly people could still be protected from infection after the peak of the epidemic."

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) originating from Wuhan spread rapidly throughout China. While its origin remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market with the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated.
Methods
Using the daily series of COVID-19 incidence, stratified according to contact history with the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers (R) for market-to-human and human-to-human transmission, the reporting probability, and the early effects of public health interventions.
Results
We estimated R at 0.24 (95% CrI: 0.01–1.38) for market-to-human transmission and 2.37 (95% CrI: 2.08–2.71) for human-to-human transmission during the early spread in China (2019–2020). Moreover, we estimated that the reporting rate for cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 2–34 fold higher than that for cases stemming from human-to-human transmission, suggesting that contact history with the wet market played a key role in identifying COVID-19 cases.
Conclusions
Our R estimate tied to market-to-human transmission had substantial uncertainty, but it was significantly lower compared with the reproduction number driving human-to-human transmission. Our results also suggest that asymptomatic and subclinical infections constitute a substantial component of the COVID-19 morbidity burden."

This longitudinal, internet-based survey included 2141 people (50.8% men; 20–79 years). The baseline and follow-up surveys were conducted from February 25–27, 2020, and April 1–6, 2020, respectively. Participants were asked how often they implemented the five personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (hand hygiene, social distancing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, respiratory etiquette, and self-isolation) in the baseline and follow-up surveys.
Results
Three of the five personal protective measures’ availability significantly improved during the community transmission phase compared to the early phase. Social distancing measures showed significant improvement, from 67.4% to 82.2%. However, the prevalence of avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth, which had the lowest prevalence in the early phase, showed no significant improvement (approximately 60%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that men and persons of low-income households made fewer improvements than women and persons of high-income households.

Results
60 mild and 33 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets decreased in both groups. The reduction percentages of the absolute lymphocytes value in mild and severe groups were 32% and 64%, respectively. The lung CT lesion volume of all patients was 241.45 ± 282.92 cm3, among which the mild group was 151.29 ± 226.04 cm3, and the severe group was 405.38 ± 304.90 cm3, respectively. In critically ill patients, the decrease of the absolute value of CD4+ T cells and the increase of IL-6 levels are significantly correlated with the volume of lung lesions.
Conclusions
The absolute values of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells are lower in patients with COVID-19, while the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 are increased. The severity of lung lesions predicts poor clinical outcomes and may be a predictor of the transition from mild to severe."

To investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with abnormal imaging findings.
Methods
Patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Zhejiang province from January 17 to February 8 who had undergone CT or X-ray were enrolled. Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed among those with abnormal or normal imaging findings.
Results
Excluding 72 patients with normal images, 230 of 573 patients showed abnormalities affecting more than two lung lobes. The median radiographic score was 2.0, and there was a negative correlation between that score and the oxygenation index (ρ = −0.657, P < 0.001). Patients with abnormal images were older (46.65 ± 13.82), with a higher rate of coexisting condition (28.8%), a lower rate of exposure history, and longer time between onset and confirmation (5 days) than non-pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). A higher rate of fever, cough, expectoration and headache, a lower level of lymphocytes, albumin, and serum sodium levels and a higher total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels and a lower oxygenation index were observed in pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). Muscle ache, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, lower lymphocytes levels, and higher serum creatinine and radiographic score at admission were predictive factors for the severe/critical subtype.
Conclusion
Patients with abnormal images have more obvious clinical manifestations and laboratory changes. Combing clinical features and radiographic scores can effectively predict severe/critical types."

Prompt understanding of the temporal and spatial patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic on a national level is a critical step for the timely allocation of surveillance resources. Therefore, this study explored the temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait using daily confirmed case data collected between the 23 February and 07 May 2020.
Methods
The pandemic progression was quantified using the time-dependent reproductive number (R(t)). The spatiotemporal scan statistic model was used to identify local clustering events. Variability in transmission dynamics was accounted for within and between two socioeconomic classes: citizens-residents and migrant workers.
Results
The pandemic size in Kuwait continues to grow (R(t)s ≥2), indicating significant ongoing spread. Significant spreading and clustering events were detected among migrant workers, due to their densely populated areas and poor living conditions. However, the government's aggressive intervention measures have substantially lowered pandemic growth in migrant worker areas. However, at a later stage of the study period, active spreading and clustering events among both socioeconomic classes were found.
Conclusions
This study provided deeper insights into the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Kuwait and provided an important platform for rapid guidance of decisions related to intervention activities."

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database until March 20, 2020. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random or fixed-effects models.
Results
A total of 16 studies comprising 3962 patients with COVID-19 were included in our analysis. Random-effect results demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 in the nonsevere group had lower levels for CRP (WMD = −41.78 mg/l, 95% CI = [−52.43, −31.13], P < 0.001), PCT (WMD = −0.13 ng/ml, 95% CI = [−0.20, −0.05], P < 0.001), IL-6 (WMD = −21.32 ng/l, 95% CI = [−28.34, −14.31], P < 0.001), ESR (WMD = −8 mm/h, 95% CI = [−14, −2], P = 0.005), SAA (WMD = −43.35 μg/ml, 95% CI = [−80.85, −5.85], P = 0.020) and serum ferritin (WMD = −398.80 mg/l, 95% CI = [−625.89, −171.71], P < 0.001), compared with those in the severe group. Moreover, survivors had a lower level of IL-6 than non-survivors (WMD = −4.80 ng/ml, 95% CI = [−5.87, −3.73], P < 0.001). These results were consistent through sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment.

abstract = "Backgrounds
Up to February 16, 2020, 355 cases have been confirmed as having COVID-19 infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship.
Method
We fitted the reported serial interval (mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied “earlyR” package in R to estimate the R0 in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We applied “projections” package in R to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness.
Results
The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID-19 outbreak at the early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06–2.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384–1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981–1177) and 758 (697–817), respectively.
Conclusion
The median with 95% CI of R0 of COVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06–2.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of R0. Unless strict infection management and control are taken, our findings indicate the potential of COVID-19 to cause greater outbreak on the ship."

In this study, we estimated the probable outbreak size of COVID-19 at clusters mathematically using a simple model that can predict the number of COVID-19 cases, as a function of time.
Methods
We proposed mathematical model to estimate the R0 of COVID-19 in the outbreak occurring in both of local and international clusters in light of published data. Different types of clusters (religious, wedding, and industrial activity) were selected based on reported events in different countries between February and April 2020.
Results
The highest R0 values were found in wedding party events (5), followed by religious gathering events (2.5), while the lowest value was found in the industrial cluster (2). This in return, shall enable us to assess the trend coronavirus spread by comparing the model results and observed patterns..
Conclusions
This study provides a predictive COVID-19 transmission patterns in different clusters types based on different R0 values. This model offers the decision makers in the contact-tracing task the predicted number of cases, which would help them in epidemiology investigations by knowing when to stop."

There are no clear expert consensus or guidelines on how to treat 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of risk-adapted treatment strategy on patients with COVID-19.
Methods
We collected the medical records of 55 COVID-19 patients for analysis. We divided these patients into mild, moderate and severe groups, and risk-adapted treatment approaches were given according to the illness severity.
Results
Twelve patients were in mild group and 22 were in moderate group (non-severe group, n=34), and 21 patients were in severe group. At the end of the first two weeks after admission, clinical manifestations had completely despeared in 31(91.2%)patients in non-severe group, and 18(85.7%) patients in severe group (p=0.85). Both groups had a satisfied chest CT imaging recovery, which includes 22(64.7%) patients in non-severe group and 12(57.1%) patients in severe group recovered at least 50% of the whole leisions in the first week, and 28(82.4%) and 16(76.2%) recovered at least 75% in the second week, respectively.

We collected data from ten COVID-19 patients admitted between January 22, 2020 and February 11, 2020 at Xixi hospital in Hangzhou, China.
Results
Of ten patients, secondary, tertiary and quartus patients emerged; the incubation period was 3–7 days. Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3–38.0°C). An asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others had ground glass opacities. All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) were exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir because of adverse effects, two of them deteriorated, one was hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir use. Levels of potassium, albumin, and lymphocytes were low, but increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge. Viral load of SARS-CoV-2, radiography and eosinophil improved continuously in 3–14, 6–8 and 7–9 days, respectively.
Conclusions
Increasing eosinophils may be an indicator of COVID-19 improvement. The COVID-19 patients may benefit from sustained lopinavir use. More research on a larger scale is needed to verify these points."

Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, caused by a large number of viral and bacterial agents. PARV4 is a recently identified virus detected in human blood and variety of tissues, but its disease association with SARI could not be established.
Objective
In the present case control study, we aim to investigate the association of PARV4 with SARI.
Methods
The Nasal and Throat swab (NS/TS) samples of 241 cases and 146 healthy controls were tested for most common respiratory viruses and PARV4 by real-time PCR.
Results
PARV4 was detected in 64(26.55%) SARI cases and only one healthy control (0.68%). PARV4 was the most common viral agent detected in SARI cases. A strong association of PARV4 is seen with severe respiratory illness.
Conclusion
Detection of PARV4 in a significantly higher number of SARI cases, in comparison with controls, suggests association of PARV4 with SARI. PARV4 genotype 2 is the only circulating strain detected in our study."

Studies on the etiology of respiratory infections among children in Qatar and surrounding countries are limited.
Objectives
To describe the prevalence and seasonality of RSV, influenza, and other respiratory pathogens among children in Qatar.
Methods
We retrospectively collected and analyzed data of 33,404 children (<15 years) presented with influenza-like illness from 2012 to 2017.
Results
At least one respiratory pathogen was detected in 26,138 (78%) of patients. Together, human rhinoviruses (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza viruses comprised nearly two-thirds of all cases, affecting 24%, 19.7%, and 18.5%, respectively. A prevalence of 5-10% was recorded for adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human bocavirus (HboV), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), enteroviruses, M. pneumonia, and parechovirus had prevalences below 5%. While RSV, influenza, and HMPV exhibited strong seasonal activity in the winter, HRV was active during low RSV and influenza circulation. The burden of RSV exceeds that of influenza among young age groups, whereas influenza correlated positively with age. Further, HRV, adenovirus, influenza, and RSV infection rates varied significantly between male and females.
Conclusion
This comprehensive multi-year study provides insights into the etiology of ILI among children in Qatar, which represents the Gulf region. Our results reinforce the significance of active surveillance of respiratory pathogens to improve infection prevention and control strategies, particularly among children."

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) remain a significant public threat with high morbidity and mortality worldwide; viruses are significant pathogens that cause ARIs. This study was conducted to better understand the epidemiological characteristics of respiratory viruses circulating in southern China.
Methods
We collected 22,680 respiratory samples from ARI patients in 18 hospitals in southern China during 2009–2018; seven common respiratory viruses including Flu, RSV, PIV, hMPV, ADV, HCoV, and HBoV were screened using in-house real-time PCR.
Results
Of all samples, 9760 ARI cases (9760/22680, 43.03%) tested positive for the seven common respiratory viruses. The most detected virus was Flu (14.15%), followed by RSV (10.33%) and PIV (5.43%); Flu-A, PIV3, and HCoV-OC43 were the predominant subtypes. Although most of the viruses were detected in male inpatients, Flu was more likely detected in female outpatients. Flu infection was more likely to cause URTI (upper respiratory tract infection), whereas RSV infection was more likely to cause pneumonia and bronchitis. The prevalence of Flu was particularly high in 2009. The epidemic level was found notably high in 2014–2018 for RSV, in 2016–2018 for PIV, in the summer of 2018 for ADV, in the summer of 2016 and winter of 2018 for HCoV, and in the summer of 2011 and autumn of 2018 for HBoV. The co-detection rate of the seven viruses was 4.70%; RSV, PIV, and Flu were the most commonly co-detected viruses.
Conclusions
This work demonstrates the epidemiological characteristics of seven common respiratory viruses in ARI patients in southern China."

The simulated peak value of the confirmed cases is 1002 at Feb 10, 2020 which is mostly close to the reported number of 1007 at Feb 9, 2020. The disease will become extinction with peak value of 1397 at May 11, 2020. Moreover, the increased numbers of the input population can mainly shorten the disease extinction days and the increased percentages of the exposed individuals of the input population increase the number of cumulative confirmed cases at a small percentage. Increasing the input population and decreasing the quarantine strategy together around the time point of the peak value of the confirmed cases, may lead to the second outbreak."

Since January 23rd 2020, stringent measures for controlling the novel coronavirus epidemics have been gradually enforced and strengthened in mainland China. The detection and diagnosis have been improved as well. However, the daily reported cases staying in a high level make the epidemics trend prediction difficult.
Methods
Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current epidemics process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource datasets including cumulative number of reported, death, quarantined and suspected cases.
Results
Results show that the trend of the epidemics mainly depends on quarantined and suspected cases. The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemics peak coming soon. The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while new reported cases are increasing. Most infected cases have been quarantined or put in suspected class, which has been ignored in existing models.
Conclusions
The uncertainty analyses reveal that the epidemics is still uncertain and it is important to continue enhancing the quarantine and isolation strategy and improving the detection rate in mainland China."

Vaccination coverage is decreasing worldwide, favoring potential reemergence of vaccine-preventable disease. Here, we performed a longitudinal characterization of the vaccination coverage in Brazil and compared the profiles between the distinct regions in the country to test whether there has been a substantial change over the last five years.
Methods
We retrieved de-identified data publicly available from the repository of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, comprising detailed information on vaccination coverage, in all age groups, between 1994 and 2019. We examined the vaccination coverage from the whole country and each Brazilian region, by year, and performed a time-series pattern analysis.
Results
A significant decrease in overall vaccination coverage across the country regions was observed between 2017 and 2019, especially in childhood immunization. BCG, Hepatitis B, influenza and rotavirus vaccines displayed a reduction in coverage. Conversely, vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and meningococcus had an increase in coverage. Region-specific changes in vaccination patterns within the study period were observed.
Conclusions
Substantial reduction in vaccination coverage was detected in Brazil, a country already highly susceptible to emergency of epidemic infectious diseases. Recursively evaluation of the immunization program actions may help to improve vaccination coverage and prevent new epidemics."

To better target new vaccines and treatments being developed for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus (influenza), we studied the association of age with prevalence, diagnostic features and course of illness of these infections in primary care patients.
Methods
Secondary analysis of observational data on the aetiology, diagnosis and prognosis in adults presenting to primary care with acute cough in 12 European countries (2007–2010) using regression analyses corrected for clustering of patients within countries. Age groups were 18–59 years, 60–74 years, and 75 years and older (75+).
Results
Nasopharyngeal swabs for 144 (4.6%), 169 (5.4%) and 104 (3.4%) out of 3104 patients were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for RSV, influenza A and influenza B, respectively. RSV prevalence in patients 75+ (8.5%) was twice the prevalence in those under 60 years (4.2%). Influenza prevalence was not associated with age. Diagnostic features for these viruses were not associated with age. Symptom duration was associated with age for RSV and influenza B, but not for influenza A. The odds of unresolved symptoms after 28 days were associated with age for RSV only. Illness deterioration was associated with age for RSV, with patients 75+ at increased risk, but not for influenza.
Conclusion
In adults presenting to primary care with acute cough, the diagnostic features of RSV or influenza infection are not associated with age. For RSV both the prevalence and illness course are significantly worse at higher age, for influenza only the illness course is."

After the outbreak, we adopted exposure prevention and droplet prevention measures based on standard precautions.
Measurements and Main Results
Between August 1 and August 27, 2019, 27 cases of human adenovirus cross-infection were reported in our institution. Among the cases, 11 were doctors (41%), 11 were nurses (41%), three were respiratory therapists (11%), and two were caregivers (7%). The attack rate was 28.4% and the fatality rate was 0. The results showed that contact with the index case, lack of hand hygiene or gloving adherence was a risk factor for infection after adenovirus exposure. After taking specific precautions, no new cases of infection have appeared since August 27.
Conclusions
Our results show that HAdV55 in a single patient had strong transmission potential in an intensive care unit with adequate facilities and standardized operation. We provide convincing evidence indicating that attention could be highlighted the role of standard and specific precautions in controlling the spread of adenovirus in ICUs."

abstract = "Objectives
The study aim was to describe the etiological profile and clinical characteristics of pneumonia among children hospitalized in Thimphu, Bhutan.
Methods
This prospective study enrolled children aged 2–59 months admitted to the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined clinical pneumonia. Demographic and clinico-radiological data were collected through questionnaires, physical examination, and chest radiography. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal washing were collected for microbiological analysis including culture and molecular methods.
Results
From July 2017 to June 2018, 189 children were enrolled, of which 53.4% were infants. Pneumonia-related admissions were less frequent over the winter. Chest radiographies were obtained in 149 children; endpoints included pneumonia in 39 cases (26.2%), other infiltrates in 31 (20.8%), and were normal in 79 children (53.0%). Non-contaminated bacterial growth was detected in 8/152 (5.3%) blood cultures, with only two cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Viral detection in upper respiratory secretions was common, with at least one virus detected in 103/115 (89.6%). The three most-commonly isolated viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (52/115; 45.2%), rhinovirus (42/115; 36.5%), and human parainfluenza virus (19/115; 16.5%). A third of patients with viral infections showed mixed infections. Case fatality rate was 3.2% (6/189).
Conclusion
Respiratory viral infections predominated among this cohort of WHO-defined clinical pneumonia cases, whereas bacterial aetiologies were uncommon, highlighting the epidemiologic transition that Bhutan seems to have reached."

abstract = "Objectives
In Korea, the National Immunization Program provided trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3) to all children aged 6 – 59 months during the 2017-2018 season. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of IIV3 in children during the 2017-2018 season.
Methods
Children aged 6 -59 months who were tested for influenza for their acute respiratory illness were included in four hospitals during the 2017-2018 influenza season. We estimated the VE of IIV3 by test-negative case-control design based on the rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results.
Results
A total of 4,738 children were included in this study. The number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases was 845 (17.8%), and there were 478 cases of influenza A, 362 cases of influenza B. The adjusted VE based on RT-PCR was 53.4% (95% CI, 25.3-70.5) against any influenza, 68.8% (95% CI, 38.7-84.1) against influenza A, and 29.7% (95% CI, -35.1-61.8) for influenza B. The adjusted VE based on RIDT was 14.8% (95% CI, -4.4-30.0) against any influenza, 24.2% (95% CI, 3.1-40.2) against influenza A, and -5.1% (95% CI, -42.6-21.4) against influenza B. Age-specific VE based on RT-PCR against any influenza was 44.1% (95% CI, -0.2-67.8) in children aged 6 months to 2 years and 59.3% (95% CI, 8.8-81.9) in children aged 3 to 5 years.
Conclusion
Our results suggest moderate protection (53.4%) of IIV3 against RT-PCR laboratory-confirmed influenza in children in the 2017-2018 influenza season. However, the RIDT hampered the validity to assess VE during influenza season. Caution is needed when interpreting RIDT-based test negative design influenza VE study."

This study investigated causes of fever in the primary levels of care in Southeast Asia, and evaluated whether C-reactive protein (CRP) could distinguish bacterial from viral pathogens.
Methods
Blood and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were taken from children and adults with fever (>37.5 °C) or history of fever (<14 days) in Thailand and Myanmar.
Results
Of 773 patients with at least one blood or nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected, 227 (29.4%) had a target organism detected. Influenza virus type A was detected in 85/227 cases (37.5%), followed by dengue virus (30 cases, 13.2%), respiratory syncytial virus (24 cases, 10.6%) and Leptospira spp. (nine cases, 4.0%). Clinical outcomes were similar between patients with a bacterial or a viral organism, regardless of antibiotic prescription. CRP was higher among patients with a bacterial organism compared with those with a viral organism (median 18 mg/L, interquartile range [10–49] versus 10 mg/L [≤8–22], p = 0.003), with an area under the curve of 0.65 (95% CI 0.55–0.75).
Conclusions
Serious bacterial infections requiring antibiotics are an exception rather than the rule in the first line of care. CRP testing could assist in ruling out such cases in settings where diagnostic uncertainty is high and routine antibiotic prescription is common. The original CRP randomised controlled trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02758821."

Public health officials need tools to assist in anticipating the healthcare resources required to confront the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. We constructed a modeling tool to aid active public health officials to estimate healthcare demand from the pandemic in their jurisdictions and to evaluate the potential impact of population-wide social-distancing interventions.
Methods
The tool uses an SEIR compartmental model to project the pandemic’s local spread. Users input case counts, healthcare resources, and select intervention strategies to evaluate. Outputs include the number of infections and deaths with and without intervention, and the demand for hospital and critical care beds and ventilators relative to existing capacity. We illustrate the tool using data from three regions of Chile.
Results
Our scenarios indicate a surge in COVID-19 patients could overwhelm Chilean hospitals by June, peaking in July or August at six to 50 times the current supply of beds and ventilators. A lockdown strategy or combination of case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing of individuals >70 years, and telework interventions may keep treatment demand below capacity.
Conclusions
Aggressive interventions can avert substantial morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Our tool permits rapid evaluation of locally-applicable policy scenarios and updating of results as new data become available."

The present study provides a comprehensive review of the recently published data on RSV epidemiology in adults and the elderly in Latin America.
Methods
A systematic literature search was carried out in Medline, Scielo, Lilacs, and Cochrane Library. The search strategy aimed at retrieving studies focusing on RSV prevalence, burden, risk factors, and the routine clinical practice in the prevention and management of RSV infections in Latin American countries. Only articles published between January 2011 and December 2017 were considered.
Results
Eighteen studies were included. Percentages of RSV detection varied highly across included studies for adult subjects with respiratory infections (0% to 77.9%), influenza-like illness (1.0% to 16.4%) and community-acquired pneumonia (1.3% to 13.5%). Considerable percentages of hospitalization were reported for RSV-infected adults with influenza-like illness (40.9% and 69.9%) and community-acquired pneumonia (91.7%).
Conclusions
Recent RSV data regarding adult populations in Latin America are scarce. RSV was documented as a cause of illness in adults and the elderly, being identified in patients with acute respiratory infections, influenza-like illness and community-acquired pneumonia. The studies suggest that RSV infections may be a significant cause of hospitalization in adult populations in Latin America, including younger adults."

Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most important pathogens that cause acute respiratory infections in children and immunocompromised adults. This work was conducted to understand the epidemiological and phylogenetic features of RSV in southern China during 2011–2016.
Methods
A total of 16 024 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with respiratory infections in 14 hospitals, and screened for RSV and seven other respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Six hundred and twenty-three RSV-positive samples from 13 hospitals were further analyzed for subtypes. G gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed based on 46 RSV-A and 15 RSV-B strains.
Results
RSV was detected in 9.5% of the 16 024 specimens, the highest among the eight respiratory viruses screened. Most of these specimens came from inpatients and children under 3 years of age. The incidence of RSV-A (9.4%) was higher than that of RSV-B (4.4%) in children (<15 years), but not in adults (0.64% vs. 0.58%). A 2-year RSV-A dominance followed by a 1-year RSV-B dominance pattern was found. The co-detection rate of RSV was 25.1%. The main prevalent genotypes were NA1, ON1, and BA9. The prevalent RSV-A genotype in 2011–2012 was NA1, close to Chongqing and Brazil, but a new Hong Kong ON1 genotype was introduced and became the prevalent genotype in Guangzhou in 2014–2015. Deduced amino acid sequence analysis confirmed the ongoing evolution and a high selection pressure of RSV-A and B strains, especially in RSV-A ON1 and NA1 genotypes.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated the molecular epidemiological characteristics of RSV in patients with respiratory infections in southern China."

abstract = "Objective
The re-emergence and spread of tropical viruses to new areas has raised a wave of concern worldwide. In order to treat patients at an early stage and prevent the diffusion of an outbreak, early diagnosis, and therefore fast and adequate detection, is needed. To this end, a multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction TaqMan method was designed to detect Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses simultaneously.
Methods
Two methods targeting different genome segments were selected from the literature for each virus. These were adapted for high genome coverage and combined in a four-plex assay that was thoroughly validated in-house. The SCREENED tool was used to evaluate the sequence coverage of the method.
Results
The full validation approach showed that the new four-plex method allows the specific and sensitive identification and discrimination of ZIKV and CHIKV in routine samples. The combination of two targets per virus allowing almost 100% coverage of about 500 genomes is shown for the first time.
Conclusions
PCR is a reliable user-friendly technique that can be applied in remote areas. Such multiplex methods enable early and efficient diagnosis, leading to rapid treatment and effective confinement in outbreak cases. They may also serve as an aid for surveillance, and the full validation permits easy method-transfer allowing worldwide harmonization."

To control epidemics, sites more affected by mortality should be identified.
Methods
Defining epidemic nodes as areas that included both most fatalities per time unit and connections, such as highways, geo-temporal Chinese data on the COVID-19 epidemic were investigated with linear, logarithmic, power, growth, exponential, and logistic regression models. A z-test compared the slopes observed.
Results
Twenty provinces suspected to act as epidemic nodes were empirically investigated. Five provinces displayed synchronicity, long-distance connections, directionality and assortativity – network properties that helped discriminate epidemic nodes. The rank I node included most fatalities and was activated first. Fewer deaths were reported, later, by rank II and III nodes, while the data from rank I–III nodes exhibited slopes, the data from the remaining provinces did not. The power curve was the best fitting model for all slopes. Because all pairs (rank I vs. rank II, rank I vs. rank III, and rank II vs. rank III) of epidemic nodes differed statistically, rank I–III epidemic nodes were geo-temporally and statistically distinguishable.
Conclusions
The geo-temporal progression of epidemics seems to be highly structured. Epidemic network properties can distinguish regions that differ in mortality. This real-time geo-referenced analysis can inform both decision-makers and clinicians."

abstract = "Viral diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of the general population from emerging and re-emerging viral diseases, reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we review discovery and development of BSAAs and summarize the information on 120 safe-in-man agents in a freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand the spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections."
