abstract = "Summary
Background
Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Many HAI pathogens, including multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs), colonize the gastrointestinal tract.
Aim
The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of MDRO carriage in patients who do and do not harbor toxigenic Clostridioides difficile in their stools.
Methods
Stool specimens received from nine U.S. laboratories were cultured using media selective for C. difficile, Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and carbapenem-resistant gram-negative organisms (CRO). Specimens and isolates were also tested by PCR. Bacterial isolates underwent susceptibility testing and genotyping.
Findings.
Among 363 specimens, 175 yielded toxigenic C. difficile isolates spanning 27 PCR ribotypes. C. difficile (TCD+) stools harbored an additional 28 organisms, including six CRO (3.4%), of which two (1.1%) were carbapenemase producing organism (CPO), 19 VRE (10.9%), and three meticillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MRSA 1.7 %). Stools that were culture negative for toxigenic-C. difficile (TCD-) yielded 26 organisms, including four CROs (2.1%), 20 VREs (10.6), and two MRSA (1.1%). Excluding C. difficile, no significant differences were seen in the rates of the MDROs between TCD+ and TCD-specimens.
Conclusion
Overall, 15.4% of the TCD+ stools and 11.2% of the TCD-stools carried at least one non-C. difficile MDRO pathogen, indicating that multiple MDROs may be present in the gastrointestinal tracts of patients, including those that harbor C. difficile."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Influenza vaccination coverage is low in France, in at-risk patients and in healthcare workers.
Aim
We aimed to estimate the incidence of nosocomial influenza, its characteristics and outcome.
Methods
During one influenza season, we retrospectively evaluated all cases of documented influenza. Inpatients with symptoms onset ≥48 h after admission were enrolled. Data were collected on a standardized questionnaire.
Results
From November 2017 to April 2018, 860 patients tested positive for influenza by polymerase chain reaction analysis on a respiratory sample. Among them, 204 (23.7%) were diagnosed ≥48 h after admission, of whom 57 (6.6% of all influenza cases) fulfilled inclusion criteria for nosocomial influenza: 26 women and 31 men, median age 82 years (interquartile range, 72.2–86.9). Twenty patients (38.6%) had recently (<6 months) received the seasonal influenza vaccine. Median time between admission and symptoms onset, and between symptoms onset and diagnosis were, respectively, 11 days (7–19.5) and 29 h (15.5–48). Influenza was mostly acquired in a double-bedded room (N = 39, 68.4%), with documented exposure in 14 cases. Influenza B virus was more common in nosocomial (46/57, 80.7%), than in community-acquired cases (359/803, 44.6%), P<0.001. Mortality rate at three months was 15.8% (N = 9). Incidence of nosocomial influenza was estimated at 0.22 per 1000 hospital-days during the study period.
Conclusion
Nosocomial influenza is not rare in elderly inpatients, and may have severe consequences. Influenza B virus was over-represented, which suggests higher transmissibility and/or transmission clusters."

abstract = "SUMMARY
Background
Little is known about patient risk factors associated with environmental contamination.
Aim
To evaluate the rate of environmental contamination and to investigate individual risk factors.
Methods
A prospective cohort study was conducted. Each day, five rooms occupied by patients were selected. Five critical surfaces were systematically swabbed twice a day before and after cleaning. Clinical characteristics of all patients were collected. Logisitic regression was performed to evaluate the association between environmental contamination and patients' characteristics.
Findings
A total of 107 consecutive patients were included and 1052 environmental samples were performed. Nineteen (18%) patients were known previously colonized/infected with a multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO). Respectively, 723 (69%) and 112 (11%) samples grew with ≥1 and >2.5 cfu/cm2 bacteria, resulting in 62 (58%) contaminated rooms. Considering positive samples with at least one pathogenic bacterium, 16 (15%) rooms were contaminated. By univariate and multivariate analysis, no variables analysed were associated with the environmental contamination. Considering contaminated rooms with >2.5 cfu/cm2, three factors were protective for environmental contamination: known MDRO carriers/infected patients (odds ratio: 0.25; 95% confidence interval: 0.09–0.72; P = 0.01), patients with urinary catheter (0.19; 0.04–0.89; P = 0.03) and hospitalization in single room (0.3; 0.15–0.6; P < 0.001).
Conclusion
This study was conducted in a non-outbreak situation and showed a low rate of environmental contamination with pathogenic bacteria. Only 11% of environmental samples grew with >2.5 cfu/cm2, and they were related to non-pathogenic bacteria. No risk factors associated with environmental contamination were identified."

Background
Colonization pressure is a risk factor for intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDROs).
Aim
To measure the long-term respective impact of colonization pressure on ICU-acquired extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-PE) and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
Methods
All patients admitted to two ICUs (medical and surgical) between January 1997 and December 2015 were included in this retrospective observational study. Rectal and nasal surveillance cultures were obtained at admission and weekly thereafter. Contact precautions were applied for colonized or infected patients. Colonization pressure was defined as the ratio of the number of MDRO-positive patient-days (PDs) of each MDRO to the total number of PDs. Single-level negative binomial regression models were used to evaluate the incidence of weekly MDRO acquisition.
Findings
Among the 23,423 patients included, 2327 (10.0%) and 1422 (6.1%) were colonized with ESBL-PE and MRSA, respectively, including 660 (2.8%) and 351 (1.5%) acquisitions. ESBL-PE acquisition increased from 0.51/1000 patient-exposed days (PEDs) in 1997 to 6.06/1000 PEDs in 2015 (P<0.001). In contrast, MRSA acquisition decreased steadily from 3.75 to 0.08/1000 PEDs (P<0.001). Controlling for period-level covariates, colonization pressure in the previous week was associated with MDRO acquisition for ESBL-PE (P<0.001 and P=0.04 for medical and surgical ICU, respectively), but not for MRSA (P=0.34 and P=0.37 for medical and surgical ICU, respectively). The increase in colonization pressure was significant above 100/1000 PDs for ESBL-PE.
Conclusion
Colonization pressure contributed to the increasing incidence of ESBL-PE but not MRSA. This study suggests that preventive control measures should be customized to MDROs."

abstract = "Summary
Background
An exceptionally high demand for surgical masks and N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) during the COVID-19 pandemic has considerably exceeded their supply. These disposable devices are generally not approved for routine decontamination and re-use as a standard of care, while this practice has widely occurred in hospitals. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allowed it “as a crisis capacity strategy”. However, limited testing was conducted on the impact of specific decontamination methods on the performance of N95 FFRs and no data was presented for surgical masks.
Aim
We evaluated common surgical masks and N95 respirators with respect to the changes in their performance and integrity resulting from autoclave sterilization and a 70% ethanol treatment; these methods are frequently utilized for re-used filtering facepieces in hospitals.
Methods
The filter collection efficiency and pressure drop were determined for unused masks and N95 FFRs, and for those subjected to the treatments in a variety of ways. The collection efficiency was measured for particles of approximately 0.037–3.2 μm to represent aerosolized single viruses, their agglomerates, bacteria and larger particle carriers.
Findings
The initial collection efficiency and the filter breathability may be compromised by sterilization in an autoclave and ethanol treatment. The effect depends on a protective device, particle size, breathing flow rate, type of treatment and other factors. Additionally, physical damages were observed in N95 respirators after autoclaving.
Conclusion
Strategies advocating decontamination and re-use of filtering facepieces in hospitals should be re-assessed considering the data obtained in this study."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In 2014, two residents of a long-term care facility (LTCF) developed invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infections with identical typing (emm 11), resulting in one death. The second resident recovered but had a subsequent episode of emm 11 iGAS infection 10 months later. This second episode was linked to a third case, within 12 days, leading to a further outbreak investigation.
Aim
To combine different techniques to establish whether this was a protracted outbreak, understand transmission pathways and inform appropriate control measures.
Methods
Following a routine response to the first cluster, the second investigation included a care record review. This informed network analysis of case interactions with staff and visitors during 10 days prior to infection. These data were combined with post-outbreak whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using isolates from cases, and staff and resident screening (44 GAS isolates: 11 outbreak-related and 33 sporadic isolates).
Findings
Two of the three confirmed iGAS cases died (one suffered two episodes). All iGAS cases, and six non-invasive isolates from 2015, were emm 11 (monophylogenetic WGS clade). Network analysis highlighted only indirect contact through staff–visitor interactions between iGAS cases in 2015. This suggested a common source and transmission propagation through carriage and/or environmental contamination over an 11-month period.
Conclusions
This outbreak highlighted benefits of staff/resident screening and typing as part of routine response. Network analysis and highly discriminatory WGS clarified the protracted nature of the outbreak, supporting findings of hygiene and infection control issues and adding to our understanding of the epidemiology."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hand hygiene is crucial in infection prevention and control. It is unclear whether sprayed alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) is non-inferior to the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended method of handrubbing with poured ABHR.
Aim
To test whether sprayed ABHR can be an alternative (non-inferior) method for effective hand hygiene with/without handrubbing.
Methods
A laboratory experiment was conducted with ABHR (isopropanol 60% v/v) according to European Norm 1500. Hand hygiene was performed by: (1) handrubbing with ABHR poured on to the palm of the hand; (2) handrubbing with sprayed ABHR; and (3) applying sprayed ABHR to hands without handrubbing. Hands were contaminated with Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, followed by hand hygiene and microbiological sampling. A generalized linear mixed model with a random intercept per subject was used to analyse the reduction in bacterial count following hand hygiene.
Findings
In total, 19 healthcare workers participated in the study. Handrubbing with sprayed ABHR was non-inferior [margin log10 0.6 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL] to the WHO-recommended method of handrubbing with poured ABHR; bacterial count reductions were log10 3.66 cfu/mL [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68–5.64] and log10 3.46 cfu/mL (95% CI 1.27–5.65), respectively. Conversely, non-inferiority was not found for sprayed ABHR without handrubbing [bacterial count reduction log10 2.76 cfu/mL (95% CI 1.65–3.87)].
Conclusion
Handrubbing with sprayed ABHR was non-inferior to handrubbing with ABHR poured on to the palm of the hand to reduce bacterial counts on hands under experimental conditions. Handrubbing with sprayed ABHR may be an acceptable alternative hand hygiene method pending assessment in other settings and for other pathogens."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Electronic tablet devices are commonly used in outpatient clinics to obtain patient information for both clinical and research purposes. These devices are often colonized with bacteria; there are many cleaning methods to reduce this bacterial load.
Aim
The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate whether regular cleaning with either germicidal wipes or ultraviolet (UV) irradiation leads to lower bacterial levels compared with irregular cleaning.
Methods
A randomized blinded trial was conducted of tablet cleaning strategies between each patient encounter in orthopaedic clinics. The cleaning method was randomized to either germicidal wipes, UV irradiation, or cleaning only when the tablet was visibly soiled. Research assistants (blinded to the treatment) obtained bacterial cultures from the tablets at the beginning and end of each clinic day.
Findings
Using germicidal wipes between each patient encounter vs no routine cleaning resulted in a marked decrease in the amount of bacterial contamination (risk ratio (RR) = 0.17 (0.04–0.67)). Similarly, using UV irradiation between each patient encounter led to significantly lower bacterial contamination rates (RR = 0.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.09–0.95)) compared with no routine cleaning. The majority of bacteria identified were normal skin flora. No meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was identified and only sparse colonies of meticillin-sensitive S. aureus.
Conclusion
Electronic tablets used in orthopaedic trauma clinics are colonized with bacteria if no routine cleaning is performed. Routine use of either UV irradiation or germicidal wipes significantly decreases this bacterial burden. Providers should implement routine cleaning of tablets between each patient encounter to minimize exposure to potential pathogens."

Single-use filtering face respirators (FFRs) are critical pieces of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers treating patients with suspected upper respiratory tract pathogens. Experiences during pandemics in the 2000s, as well as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-2-CoV-2, have highlighted concerns over the pressures that sustained respiratory virus pandemics may have on supplies of FFRs globally. Decontamination of FFRs has been posited as one solution to support the re-use of FFRs with a growing body of literature over the last 10+ years beginning to examine both the efficacy of disinfection of contaminated FFRs but also the impact of the decontamination process on the FFR's performance. Physical and chemical methods of decontamination have been tested for treatment of FFRs with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, sterilization by steam, ethylene oxide and vaporous hydrogen peroxide, demonstrating the most promising results thus far. Many of these methods utilize existing equipment that may already be available in hospitals and could be re-purposed for FFR decontamination. Importantly, some methods may also be replicated on household equipment, broadening the utility of FFR decontamination across a range of healthcare settings. Utilizing techniques to experimentally contaminate FFRs with a range of microorganisms, most decontamination methods appear to reduce the risk of the mask as a source of infection to the wearer and others to negligible levels. The performance of the filter, especially the efficiency of particle penetration following treatment, varied greatly depending on the processing method as well as the model of the filter itself, however. Urgent regulatory body-supported research is required to endorse the routine decontamination of FFRs. In emergency settings, these methods should nevertheless be carefully considered as one strategy to address potential shortfalls in supplies of FFRs for healthcare workers."

Background
Nosocomial or healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are associated with a financial burden that affects both patients and healthcare institutions worldwide. The clinical best care practices (CBPs) of hand hygiene, hygiene and sanitation, screening, and basic and additional precautions aim to reduce this burden. The COVID-19 pandemic has confirmed these four CBPs are critically important prevention practices that limit the spread of HCAIs.
Aim
This paper conducted a systematic review of economic evaluations related to these four CBPs using a discounting approach.
Methods
We searched for articles published between 2000 and 2019. We included economic evaluations of infection prevention and control of Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. Results were analyzed with: cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit and cost-consequence analyses. Articles were assessed for quality.
Results
A total of 11 898 articles were screened and seven were included. Most studies (4/7) were of overall moderate quality. All studies demonstrated cost effectiveness of CBPs. The average yearly net cost savings from the CBPs ranged from $252 847 (2019 $CAD) to $1 691 823 depending on the rate of discount (3% and 8%). The average incremental benefit cost ratio of CBPs varied from 2.48 to 7.66.
Conclusion
In order to make efficient use of resources and maximize health benefits, ongoing research in the economic evaluation of infection control should be carried out to support evidence-based healthcare policy decisions."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Despite large reductions from 2005 to 2012, hospital-onset meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (HO MRSA BSIs) continue to be a major source of morbidity and mortality.
Aim
To describe risk factors for and underlying sources of HO MRSA BSIs.
Methods
This study investigated HO MRSA BSIs at eight high-burden short-stay acute care hospitals. A case was defined as first isolation of MRSA from a blood specimen collected in 2016 on or after hospital day 4 from a patient without an MRSA-positive blood culture in the preceding 2 weeks. Case demographics and risk factors were reviewed by medical record abstraction. The potential clinical source(s) of infection were determined by consensus by a clinician panel.
Findings
Of the 195 eligible cases, 186 were investigated. Cases were predominantly male (63%) and the median age was 57 years (range 0–92 years). In the 2 weeks preceding BSI, 88% of cases had indwelling devices, 31% underwent a surgical procedure and 18% underwent dialysis. The most common locations of attribution were intensive care units (ICUs) (46%) and step-down units (19%). The most commonly identified non-mutually exclusive clinical sources were central venous catheters (46%), non-surgical wounds (17%), surgical site infections (16%), non-ventilator healthcare-associated pneumonia (13%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (11%).
Conclusions
Device- and procedure-related infections were common sources of HO MRSA BSIs. Prevention strategies focused on improving adherence to existing prevention bundles for device-and procedure-associated infections and on source control for ICU patients, patients with certain indwelling devices, and patients undergoing certain high-risk surgeries are being pursued to decrease the burden of HO MRSA BSIs at these facilities."

To assess the effects of CRE colonization active screening and various CRE patient placements implemented in decreasing CRE infection risk.
Methods
CRE colonization screening and various CRE patient placements were performed across CRE high-risk departments (paediatric intensive care unit, neonatal intensive care unit, neonatal wards and haematology departments) between 2017 and 2018.

The CRE colonization incidence at different lengths of hospital stay (LOSs) decreased at eight to 14 days and >14 days LOS in CRE high-risk departments (all P<0.05). In addition, 62.5% clinical strains, 66.7% screening strains, and 74.1% nosocomial infection strains belonged to the CC17 complex group in neonatal isolates; while, 56.6%, 47.5% and 100% strains mentioned above belonged to the CC11 complex group in non-neonatal isolates. The predominant carbapenemase gene was blaNDM-1 (98%) in neonatal and blaKPC-2 (70%) in non-neonatal carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) stains.
Conclusions
Active CRE colonization surveillance and CRE-positive appropriate patient placement may decrease the CRE infection risk. Neonatal and non-neonatal CR-KP isolates showed different CRE molecular characteristics, which could further benefit CRE infection precaution and antibiotic therapy."

Aim
To determine whether pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) accurately recognizes isolates belonging to clusters defined by techniques based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model.
Methods
We selected 65 isolates of ST395 P. aeruginosa isolated in seven European hospitals between 1998 and 2012. Isolates were typed by PFGE and sequenced by WGS. A core genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) analysis based on 3831 genes was performed with a homemade pipeline.
Findings
PFGE identified eight pulsotypes and cgMLST differentiated nine clusters and nine singletons. Five cgMLST clusters and pulsotypes (31/65 isolates) coincided perfectly. Isolates without evident epidemiological links grouped by PFGE were separated by cgMLST (16/65 isolates) differentiating cities, suggesting that PFGE should be kept for the investigation of local outbreaks. Importantly, hypermutator isolates still shared the pulsotype with their parents (16/65 isolates), whereas they were not recognized by cgMLST. This shows that PFGE was less affected than WGS-based typing by the accelerated genetic drift that occurs in epidemic P. aeruginosa.
Conclusions
although WGS-based typing has logically become the new reference standard, we show here that the PFGE can be used with confidence for the investigation of local outbreaks caused by P. aeruginosa."

abstract = "SUMMARY
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic presents a significant infection prevention and control challenge. The admission of large numbers of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease risks overwhelming the capacity to protect other patients from exposure. The delay between clinical suspicion and confirmatory testing adds to the complexity of the problem.
Methods
We implemented a triage tool aimed at minimizing hospital-acquired COVID-19 particularly in patients at risk of severe disease. Patients were allocated to triage categories defined by likelihood of COVID-19 and risk of a poor outcome. Category A (low-likelihood; high-risk), B (high-likelihood; high-risk), C (high-likelihood; low-risk) and D (low-likelihood; low-risk). This determined the order of priority for isolation in single-occupancy rooms with Category A the highest. Patients in other groups were cohorted when isolation capacity was limited with additional interventions to reduce transmission.
Results
Ninety-three patients were evaluated with 79 (85%) receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis during their admission. Of those without a COVID-19 diagnosis: 10 were initially triaged to Category A; 0 to B; 1 to C and 4 to D. All high-risk patients requiring isolation were, therefore, admitted to single-occupancy rooms and protected from exposure. Twenty-eight (30%) suspected COVID-19 patients were evaluated to be low risk (groups C and D) and eligible for cohorting. No symptomatic hospital-acquired infections were detected in the cohorted patients.
Discussion
Application of a clinical triage tool to guide isolation and cohorting decisions may reduce the risk of hospital-acquired transmission of COVID-19 especially to individuals at the greatest of risk of severe disease."

Background
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are among the biggest global public health challenges, and overlap widely. These infections cause significant morbidity and mortality, put pressure on health systems, and incur rising direct and indirect costs.
Aim
This study analysed the direct medical burden attributable to AMR-HAIs in Chinese public tertiary hospitals, and aimed to inform both the medical regulators and hospital managers for better control of HAIs and containment of AMR.
Methods
The propensity score matching method (γ= 0.25σ, nearest neighbor 1:1 matching) was applied to conduct a retrospective cohort study in five public tertiary hospitals in the Hubei province of China during 2013–2015. Descriptive analysis, Pearson's chi-squared test, Mann–Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test and paired/independent Z/T test were conducted. The statistically significant level was set at P<0.05.
Findings
From 2013 to 2015 overall, the additional total medical expenditure per HAI-AMR inpatient was US$15,557.25 compared with that of the non-HAIs, and the additional length of per hospital stay of the HAI-AMR inpatient was 41 days compared with that of the non-HAIs (P<0.001).
Conclusions
In combination with AMR, HAIs caused significant additional medical expenses and affected the turnover rate of hospital beds. Most of the increased medical costs fell to patients and their families. These findings call for more effective control of HAIs and containment of AMR. A national study is needed to estimate the medical, social and economic burden of HAIs in combination with AMR."

Antimicrobial touch surfaces have been introduced in healthcare settings with the aim of supporting existing hygiene procedures, and to help combat the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance. However, concerns have been raised over the potential selection pressure exerted by such surfaces, which might drive the evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance. In this review, we highlight studies that indicate risks associated with resistance on antimicrobial surfaces by different processes including evolution by de novo mutations and horizontal gene transfer, and species sorting of inherently resistant bacteria dispersed onto antimicrobial surfaces. We focus on antimicrobial surfaces made of copper, silver and antimicrobial peptides because of the practical application of the former two and the promising characteristics of the latter. The available data point to a potential for resistance selection and a subsequent increase of resistant strains via cross-resistance and co-resistance conferred by metal and antibiotic resistance traits. However, translational studies describing resistance development to antimicrobial touch surfaces in healthcare-related environments are rare and will be needed to assess whether and how antimicrobial surfaces lead to resistance selection in these settings. Such studies will need to consider numerous variables, including the antimicrobial concentrations present in coatings, the occurrence of biofilms on surfaces, and the humidity relevant to dry-surface environments. On-site tests on the efficacy of antimicrobial coatings should routinely evaluate the selection risk associated with their use."

abstract = "SUMMARY
Background
Isolation precautions are applied to control the risk of transmission of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs). These precautions have been associated with adverse effects, such as anxiety and depression. This study aimed to quantify stigma among MDRO carriers and its association with perceived mental health and experienced quality of care.
Methods
A quantitative questionnaire study was performed in MDRO carriers exposed to ≥ 3 days of isolation precautions during hospitalization. Items derived from the Consumer Quality Index questionnaire (CQI) were used to assess perception of care. Stigma scores were calculated using the recently modified Berger Stigma Scale for MRSA. Mental health was measured with the RAND Mental Health Inventory. The Spearman rank correlation test was used to assess the association between stigma score and RAND mental health score
Findings
Of the 41 included carriers, 31 (75.6%) completed both questionnaires. The experienced quality of care was good according to CQI score. Twenty-four % reported not to have received proper explanation about MDRO carriership from health care workers (HCWs). MDRO associated stigma was reported in 1/31(3.2%). Poor mental health was self-reported in 3/31(9.7%). There was no correlation between stigma score and RAND mental health score (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.347).
Conclusions
In this study, MDRO carriers exposed ≥ 3 days of isolation precautions did not report stigma. This contrasts with a recent study that investigated MRSA associated stigma and may be explained by contact plus airborne isolation protocols in MRSA compared to contact isolation alone in most other MDROs. Also, the psychological impact may be of a different magnitude due to yet unknown reasons."

Background
Carbapenem non-susceptible Enterobacterales (CNSE) can be broadly divided into those that produce carbapenemases (carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE)), and those that harbour other mechanisms of resistance (non-carbapenemase-producing CNSE (NCP-CNSE)).
Aim
To determine the predictors of CNSE nosocomial incidence rates according to their mechanism of resistance.
Methods
A time-series analysis was conducted (July 2013 to December 2018) to evaluate the relationship in time between hospital antibiotic use and the percentage of adherence to hand hygiene with the CNSE rates.
Findings
In all, 20,641 non-duplicated Enterobacterales isolates were identified; 2.2% were CNSE. Of these, 48.1% and 51.9% were CPE and NCP-CNSE, respectively. Of the CPE, 78.3% possessed a blaOXA-232 gene. A transfer function model was identified for CNSE, CPE, and OXA-232 CPE that explained 20.8%, 19.3%, and 24.2% of their variation, respectively. According to the CNSE and CPE models, an increase in piperacillin–tazobactam (TZP) use of 1 defined daily dose (DDD) per 100 hospital patient-days (HPD) would lead to an increase of 0.69 and 0.49 CNSE and CPE cases per 10,000 HPD, respectively. The OXA-232 CPE model estimates that an increase of 1 DDD per 100 HPD of TZP use would lead to an increase of 0.43 OXA-232 CPE cases per 10,000 HPD. A transfer function model was not identified for NCP-CNSE, nor was there an association between the adherence to handhygiene and the CNSE rates.
Conclusion
The use of TZP is related in time with the CPE nosocomial rates, mostly explained by its effect on OXA-232 CPE."

Background
Ventilator-associated pneumonia surveillance is used as a quality indicator due to concerns that some cases may be preventable and may contribute to mortality. Various surveillance criteria exist for the purposes of national reporting, but a large-scale direct comparison has not been conducted.
Methods
A prospective cohort study applied two routinely used surveillance criteria for ventilator-associated pneumonia from the European Centre for Disease Control and the American Centers for Disease Control to all patients admitted to two large general intensive care units. Diagnostic rates and concordance amongst diagnostic events were compared.
Findings
A total of 713 at-risk patients were identified during the study period. The European surveillance algorithm returned a rate of 4.6 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia per 1000 ventilation days (95% confidence interval 3.1–6.6) and the American surveillance system a rate of 5.4 (3.8–7.5). The concordance between diagnostic events was poor (Cohen's Kappa 0.127 (-0.003 to 0.256)).
Conclusions
The algorithms yield similar rates, but the lack of event concordance reveals the absence of inter-algorithm agreement for diagnosing ventilator-associated pneumonia, potentially undermining surveillance as an indicator of care quality."

abstract = "Introduction
Hospital admissions for non-COVID-19 pathology have significantly reduced. It is believed that this may be due to public anxiety about acquiring COVID-19 infection in hospital and the subsequent risk of mortality. There is an urgent need for clarity regarding patients who acquire COVID-19 in hospital (nosocomial COVID-19 infection [NC]), their risk of mortality, compared to those with community acquired COVID-19 (CAC) infection.
Methods
The COPE-Nosocomial Study was an observational cohort study. The primary outcome was the time to all-cause mortality (estimated with an adjusted hazards ratio [aHR]), and secondary outcomes were Day-7 mortality and the time-to-discharge. A mixed-effects multivariable Cox’s proportional hazards model was used, adjusted for demographics and comorbidities.
Results
Our study included 1564 patients from 10 hospital sites throughout the UK, and one in Italy, and collected outcomes on patients admitted up to 28th April, 2020. 12.5% of COVID-19 infections were acquired in hospital. 425 (27.2%) patients with COVID died. The median survival time in NC patients was 14 days, which compared to 10 days in CAC patients. In the primary analysis, NC infection was associated with reduced mortality (aHR=0.71, 95%CI 0.51-0.99). Secondary outcomes found no difference in Day-7 mortality (aOR=0.79, 95%CI 0.47-1.31), but NC patients required longer time in hospital during convalescence (aHR=0.49, 95%CI 0.37-0.66).
Conclusion
The minority of COVID-19 cases were the result of NC transmission. Whilst no COVID-19 infection comes without risk, patients with NC had a reduced risk of mortality compared to CAC infection, however, caution should be taken when interpreting this finding. In the United Kingdom, authority to conduct the study was granted by the Health Research Authority (20/HRA/1898), and in Italy by the Ethics Committee of Policlinico Hospital Modena (Reference 369/2020/OSS/AOUMO).

Background
Surgical site infection (SSI) largely implicates the patient’s endogenous skin microbiota. Perioperative disinfection protocols do not follow a general agreement.
Aim
To compare antisepsis and skin protection protocols on quantitative analysis of recolonization in the operating room at regular time-steps. The study hypothesis was that one protocol would be more effective than others.
Methods
A single-centre prospective interventional study was conducted between January and June 2019. Healthy volunteers were randomized between protocols and served as their own controls. The protocols began ahead of scheduled orthopaedic surgery with a preoperative shower, mechanical cleansing, application of major antiseptics (alcoholic Bétadine™ 5% or alcoholic chlorhexidine 0.5%), sterile draping, then adhesive draping (3M™ Steri-Drape™ or iodine-impregnated 3M™ Ioban2™). Sampling was by swabbing in the operating room at 30 min intervals up to 90 min after draping. Cultures were performed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Qualitative and quantitative (cfu/mL) bacteriology was performed in the laboratory by direct reading on the blood agar plates.
Findings
Thirty subjects were included; none was lost to follow-up or excluded from analysis. Bacterial load before manipulation (T0) was significantly higher in males (P < 0.0001) despite a significantly shorter shower-to-sampling interval (P = 0.03). Smoking (P = 0.85), body mass index (P = 0.38), and depilation (P = 0.50) did not significantly affect preoperative load. Mean load increased significantly under all protocols up to T90 min, without significant superiority for any one protocol. Associated Bétadine™/Ioban™ showed the lowest T90 load, and chlorhexidine alone the highest, but without significant difference. Isolates at T0 were predominantly healthy skin commensals: coagulase-negative staphylococci, micrococci, and coryneforms.
Conclusion
No one protocol demonstrated superiority, whether in immediate bactericidal action or in preventing skin recolonization in the operating room. Further studies are needed to define generally agreed protocols for SSI risk management."

Background
In late 2019, a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China. This virus has caused a global pandemic involving more than 200 countries. SARS-CoV-2 is highly adapted to humans and readily transmits from person-to-person.
Aim
The aim of this study was to investigate the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 under various environmental factors, disinfectants and different pH conditions. The efficacy of a variety of laboratory virus inactivation methods and home disinfectants against SARS-CoV-2 were investigated.
Methods
The residual virus in dried form or in solution was titrated on Vero E6 cell line at day 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 after incubation at different temperatures. The viability of virus was determined after treatment with different disinfectants and pH solutions at room temperature (20∼25oC).
Findings
SARS-CoV-2 was able to retain viability for 3-5 days in dried form or 7 days in solution at room temperature. SARS-CoV-2 could be detected under a wide range of pH conditions from pH4 to pH11 for several days and 1 to 2 days in stool at room temperature but lost 5 logs of infectivity. A variety of commonly used disinfectants and laboratory inactivation procedures were found to reduce viral viability effectively.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on environmental surfaces and raises the possibility of faecal-oral transmission. Commonly used fixatives, nucleic acid extraction methods and heat inactivation were found to significantly reduce viral infectivity that could ensure hospital and laboratory safety during the COVID-19 pandemic."

One method with the potential to improve disinfection efficacy is whole room disinfection with H2O2.
AIM
To determine the influence of delivery system on the efficacy of low concentration H2O2 on common healthcare associated infection pathogens.
METHODS
We compared SanoStatic (electrostatic spray) with SanoFog (fogging) in terms of performance for delivery of 5% H2O2 and trace silver ions for disinfection. The bacterial test challenges were VRE, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (ESBLK), CPE, MRSA, Clostridium difficile spores, Bacillus atropheus and Geobacillus stearothermophilus commercial spore strips.
FINDINGS
SanoFog and SanoStatic were effective when tested under the conditions of experimentation reported here. For VRE, ESBLK, CPE and MRSA, SanoFog and SanoStatic were comparable in performance. For C. difficile we concluded the following: SanoFog was most effective for disinfection of C. difficile spores when compared to SanoStatic.
CONCLUSION
We concluded that while SanoFog and SanoStatic were effective against bacterial cells, the current practice of using SanoFog and SanoStatic together would be effective for disinfection of C. difficile spores based on investigations under the conditions of experimentation reported here. For the spore strips we found results that were not comparable to the results for either the vegetation cells (VRE, ESBLK, CPE, and MRSA) or C. difficile spores."

Background
Postoperative pneumonia is the third most common complication in surgical patients. However, little is known regarding pneumonia after craniotomy, which is the most common surgical procedure in neurosurgery.
Aim
To investigate the incidence of pneumonia and its association with the length of hospital stay, identify risk factors, and build a nomogram as a prediction model.
Methods
The study population was based on the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2005 to 2017. Both multi-variate logistic regression models and linear regression models were employed.
Findings
The overall incidence rate of postoperative pneumonia was 3.11% in a total of 57,201 surgical procedures. Risk factors were age >55 years, male gender, low body mass index (BMI), diabetes, functional dependence, ventilator dependence, history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, systemic sepsis, white blood cell count >12,000, emergency case, American Society of Anesthesiologists class ≥3, general anaesthesia and total surgical time >240 min. Ten featured factors were used in the nomogram (C-statistic=0.803). Postoperative pneumonia was associated with extended hospital stay. Compared with other postoperative complications, pneumonia had the second-highest impact on the extension of hospital stay (by 4.7 days).
Conclusion
This study identified several pre-operative risk factors for postoperative pneumonia after craniotomy. Novel factors including male gender and low BMI warrant further investigation. This novel nomogram could serve as a reliable tool to evaluate the risk of postoperative pneumonia pre-operatively."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Medical devices face the challenge of microbial biofilm attached to the surface. Ultimately, this may jeopardize the function of the device and increase the patient’s risk of infection. Still, reliable methods to prevent biofilm are lacking.
Aim
To investigate the effect of silicone oil-coated polypropylene plastic, used in a new automatic urinometer, on biofilm formation. Furthermore, to explore the impact of silicone oil viscosity and compare polypropylene with polystyrene, another common medical plastic.
Methods
Common pathogens, including ESBL-producing and multidrug resistant bacteria, as well as Candida albicans, were investigated. Isogenic Escherichia coli strains deficient in the important biofilm forming factors curli, cellulose and type 1 fimbriae (fim D) were used to determine the possible mode of action by silicone oil. Clear flat-bottomed polypropylene or polystyrene wells were pretreated with either low or medium viscosity silicone oil and microbes were added. After 72 hours, biofilm formation was quantified using crystal violet assay.
Findings
Silicone oil-coated polypropylene plastic surfaces, regardless of the oil viscosity, significantly inhibited biofilm formation of all tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including ESBL-producing and multidrug resistant strains, as well as C. albicans. Silicone oil did not affect bacterial or candida growth and curli fimbriae was found to be the main target of silicone oil. Polypropylene plastic itself without oil had better effect preventing biofilm formation than polystyrene.
Conclusion
These findings suggest a new strategy to decrease microbial biofilm formation, which may reduce hospital-acquired infections and prevent dysfunction of medical devices."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Linezolid resistance in enterococci has been reported with increasing frequency, with a recent rise in resistance encoded by optrA, poxtA or cfr.
Aim
To investigate a hospital outbreak of linezolid- and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (LVREfm) using whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
Methods
Thirty-nine VREfm from patient screening (19 isolates, 17 patients) and environmental sites (20 isolates) recovered in October 2019 were investigated. Isolates were screened using polymerase chain reaction for optrA, poxtA and cfr, and underwent Illumina MiSeq WGS. Isolate relatedness was assessed using E. faecium core genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST). One LVREfm underwent MinION long-read WGS (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and hybrid assembly with MiSeq short-read sequences to resolve an optrA-encoding plasmid.
Findings
Twenty isolates (51.3%) were LVREfm and optrA-positive, including the LVREfm from the index patient. A closely related cluster of 28 sequence type (ST) 80 isolates was identified by cgMLST, including all 20 LVREfm and eight linezolid-susceptible VREfm, with an average allelic difference of two (range 0–10), indicating an outbreak. Nineteen (95%) LVREfm harboured a 56,684-bp conjugative plasmid (pEfmO_03). The remaining LVREfm exhibited 44.1% sequence coverage to pEfmO_03. The presence of pEfmO_03 in LVREfm and the close relatedness of the outbreak cluster isolates indicated the spread of a single strain. The outbreak was terminated by enhanced infection prevention and control (IPC) and environmental cleaning measures, ceasing ward admissions and ward-dedicated staff.
Conclusion
WGS was central in investigating an outbreak of ST80 LVREfm. The rapid implementation of enhanced IPC measures terminated the outbreak."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Heater–cooler units (HCUs) have been implicated in the recent global outbreak of invasive Mycobacterium chimaera infection among patients following cardiothoracic surgery. Because infected patients tend to remain asymptomatic for extended periods, detection of M. chimaera from HCUs in real time is essential to halting the ongoing M. chimaera HCU-associated outbreak. Sample collection protocols to evaluate the presence of M. chimaera offer conflicting recommendations regarding the addition of sodium thiosulfate (NaT) during the collection process.
Aim
To study the effect of NaT on M. chimaera recovery and culture contamination.
Methods
Seventy-six paired HCU water samples (with and without NaT) were collected, processed and cultured simultaneously into Lowenstein–Jensen slants, Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates, and mycobacterial growth indicator tubes (MGITs), and incubated at 37°C. A subset of 31 paired samples was additionally cultured on MGITs and incubated at 30°C.
Findings
Of 76 samples incubated at 37°C in each of the three media, with and without NaT, M. chimaera was identified in at least one aliquot of 21 samples.
Conclusion
The presence of NaT did not significantly increase the probability of recovering M. chimaera in a multi-variable conditional logistic model and culture contamination rates were similar between aliquots with and without NaT. In the subset of samples cultured on MGITs at both 30°C and 37°C, the presence of NaT again was not associated with M. chimaera recovery, but was significantly associated with reduced culture contamination."

Background
Due to their frequent use, peripheral venous catheters (PVCs) are of importance in terms of catheter-related infections and their prevention. In 2017, revised national guidelines for the prevention of PVC-related infections were published in Germany.
Aim
To describe PVC handling practices and assess the implementation of national guidelines for the prevention of PVC-related infections in German acute care hospitals, 10 months after their release.
Methods
An online survey on the management of PVCs in hospital wards was conducted. For this, 1191 acute care hospitals participating in the national surveillance system for healthcare-associated infections in Germany were invited to participate. Each hospital was asked to complete the survey for an intensive care unit (ICU), as well as a medical ward and a surgical ward. Participation in the survey was voluntary.
Findings
In total, 701 hospitals (response rate 59%) participated and provided data on 1449 wards (599 ICUs, 446 medical wards, 404 surgical wards). Approximately 43% of wards reported that they had implemented the new national guidelines where necessary. Structured surveillance for PVC-associated infections was established in only 21% of wards. While 94% of wards reported the inclusion of aspects of PVC handling in their general infection prevention education, questions on the training methods yielded diverse results. Approximately 59% of wards reported that they did not routinely use a combination of alcohol and a remanant disinfectant for skin disinfection before PVC insertion.
Conclusion
Generally, PVC management in Germany is well organized. However, potential for improvement was identified, particularly considering surveillance and implementation of selected national guidelines."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) lead to high morbidity and mortality. Data for HAIs in psychiatric hospitals are scarce, and not deriving from long-term surveillance.
Aim
We aimed to assess the impact of an infection control service on the prevalence of HAI in a psychiatric hospital during an 18-year period.
Methods
In 1999, a professional infection control service was initiated at the university psychiatric hospital in Basel, Switzerland, with a part-time infection control nurse, a hospital epidemiologist, and administrative support. In addition to monitoring rates of multidrug resistant pathogens, eight prevalence studies using definitions outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were conducted between 2001 and 2018. For the primary outcome, a poisson regression model was fitted to confirm cases of HAIs, standardized for patients at risk as a model offset.
Findings
Overall, the predicted prevalence of nosocomial infections decreased from 3.7% (95% CI 2.2-5.3%) in 2001 to 1.0% (95% CI 0.2-1.8%) in 2018 after introduction of an infection control service (Incidence Ratio Rate (IRR) for yearly decrease of 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-0.98, p=0.007).
Conclusions
Implementation of an infection control service may lead to a significant long-term decrease of HAIs, even in an institution caring for patients with low risk for HAIs, such as in psychiatric hospitals. In addition, epidemics and clusters were rapidly contained. Infection control services from acute care hospitals should be expanded to psychiatric institutions, in order to decrease the incidence of HAIs and meet new challenges in times of emergence of multidrug resistant pathogens."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) is a side-effect of antibiotic consumption and probiotics have been shown to reduce AAD.
Methods
A multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the role of Lactobacillus casei DN114001 (combined as a drink with two regular yoghurt bacterial strains) in reducing AAD and Clostridioides difficile infection in patients aged over 55 years. The primary outcome was the incidence of AAD during 2 weeks of follow-up.
Results
A total of 1127 patients (mean age ± standard deviation: 73.6 ± 10.5) were randomized to the active group (N = 549) or placebo group (N = 577). Both groups were followed up as per protocol. The proportion of patients experiencing AAD during follow-up was 19.3% (106/549) in the probiotic group vs 17.9% (103/577) in the placebo group (unadjusted odds ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.82–1.49, P = 0.53).
Conclusions
No significant evidence was found of a beneficial effect of the specific probiotic formulation in preventing AAD in this elderly population drawn from a number of different UK hospitals. However, in the UK and in many other healthcare systems there have, in recent years, been many changes in antibiotic stewardship policies, an overall decrease in incidence in C. difficile infection, as well as an increased awareness of infection prevention, and modifications in nursing practice. In light of these factors, it is impossible to conclude definitively from the current trial that the study-specific probiotic formulation has no role in preventing AAD, and it is our view that further trials may be indicated, controlling for these variables."

Background
Globally, there have been many cases of COVID-2019 cases among medical staff, however, the main factors associated with the infection are not well understood.
Aim
To identify the super-factors causing COVID-19 infection in medical staff in China.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted between Jan. 1st, and Feb. 30th, 2020, where front line members of medical staff that took part in the care and treatment of patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Epidemiological and demographic data between infected and uninfected groups were collected and compared. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to establish socio-metric social links between influencing factors.
Findings
A total of 92 medical staff were enrolled. In all participant groups, the super-factor identified by the network was wearing a medical protective mask or surgical mask correctly (degree = 572; closeness =25; betweenness centrality = 3·23). Touching the cheek, nose, and mouth while working was the super-factor in the infected group. This was the biggest node in the network and had the strongest influence (degree = 370; closeness = 29; betweenness centrality = 0·37). Self-protection score was the super-factor in the uninfected group but was the isolated factor in the infected group (degree = 201; closeness = 28; betweenness centrality = 5·64). For family members, the exposure history to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and the contact history to wild animals were two isolated nodes.
Conclusion
High self-protection score was the main factor that prevented medical staff from contracting COVID-19 infection. The main factor that contributed to COVID-19 infections among medical staff was touching the cheek, nose and mouth while working."

The high demand for personal protective equipment during the novel coronavirus outbreak has prompted the need to develop strategies to conserve supply. Little is known regarding decontamination interventions to allow for surgical mask reuse.
Aim
Identify and synthesize data from original research evaluating interventions to decontaminate surgical masks for the purpose of reuse.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Global Health, the WHO COVID-19 database, Google Scholar, DisasterLit, preprint servers, and prominent journals from inception to April 8, 2020 for prospective original research on decontamination interventions for surgical masks. Citation screening was conducted independently in duplicate. Study characteristics, interventions, and outcomes were extracted from included studies by two independent reviewers. Outcomes of interest included impact of decontamination interventions on surgical mask performance and germicidal effects.
Findings
Seven studies met eligibility criteria: one evaluated the effects of heat and chemical interventions applied after mask use on mask performance, and six evaluated interventions applied prior to mask use to enhance antimicrobial properties and/or mask performance. Mask performance and germicidal effects were evaluated with heterogenous test conditions. Safety outcomes were infrequently evaluated. Mask performance was best preserved with dry heat decontamination. Good germicidal effects were observed in salt-, N-halamine-, and nanoparticle-coated masks.
Conclusion
There is limited evidence on the safety or efficacy of surgical mask decontamination. Given the heterogenous methods used in studies to date, we are unable to draw conclusions on the most efficacious and safe intervention for decontaminating surgical masks."

Background
Invasive fusariosis (IF) is a frequently fatal disease as there are few antifungals to treat it, making the prevention of IF crucial. However, fusarium infections have not been as thoroughly studied as other common pathogenic fungi such as Aspergillus or Candida.
Aim
To investigate the epidemiology of IF in patients with haematological diseases in Japan and to elucidate the infectious route of fusarium infection.
Methods
We retrospectively analysed 29 IF cases in patients with haematological diseases from 2009 to 2019 in Japan. To discover the infectious source of IF, we performed an indoor environment survey targeted at indoor air and drain outlets in medical institutions and residences using culture-based and metagenomic methods. Finally, we performed aerosol- and droplet-mediated dispersion studies.
Findings
The epidemiological study showed that the primary pathogen of IF was Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC), and the most common species was Fusarium petroliphilum. Most patients were likely to develop IF during hospitalization. A fusarium culture was positive in 26 of 72 drain samples. Few fusarium were detected from air samples; by contrast, 29 of 108 isolates from the drain outlets were identified as fusarium. Furthermore, similar results were obtained in the metagenomic analysis. Interestingly, species belonging to FSSC were isolated from indoor drain outlets, which was similar to those of the IF patients. In the droplet-mediated dispersion study, eight to 17 colonies of fusarium were isolated.
Conclusion
Our study indicates that causative Fusarium spp. could inhabit drain outlets in hospitals or residences, and droplet-mediated fusarium dispersion is a potential cause of IF."

abstract = "Summary
Introduction
Bacterial lower respiratory tract infections (BLRTI) may represent serious clinical conditions which can lead to respiratory failure, intensive care unit admission and high hospital costs. The detection of carbapenemase- and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales, as well as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), has become a major issue, especially in healthcare-associated infections. This study aimed to determine whether molecular assays could detect genes encoding carbapenemases, ESBL and MRSA directly from respiratory samples in order to expedite appropriate therapy and infection control for patients with BLRTI.
Methods
The carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales (CRE), ESBL and MRSA/SA ELITe MGB assays were performed directly on 354 respiratory specimens sampled from 318 patients admitted with BLRTI. Molecular results were compared with routine culture-based diagnostics results.
Results
Positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values of the CRE ELITe MGB kit were 75.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 60.3–86.7] and 100%, respectively. PPV and NPV of the ESBL ELITe MGB kit were 80.8% (95% CI 63.6–91.0) and 99.1% (95% CI 96.6–99.8), respectively. PPV and NPV of the MRSA/SA ELITe MGB kit were 91.7% (95% CI 73.7–97.7)/100% and 98.3% (95% CI 89.8–99.3)/96.8% (95% CI 81.6–99.5), respectively.
Discussion
Validity assessment of molecular assays detecting the main antibiotic resistance genes directly from respiratory samples showed high accuracy compared with culture-based results. Molecular assays detecting the main carbapenemase, ESBL, S. aureus and meticillin resistance encoding genes provide an interesting tool with potential to expedite optimization of antibiotic therapy and infection control practices in patients with BLRTI."

Background
Since the first appearance of Candida auris in 2009, this yeast has become a relevant pathogen in the clinical field. C. auris has been detected on various surfaces in health facilities, and is therefore a target for appropriate disinfection procedures. Preventive measures have to be implemented based on disinfectants with proven efficacy against C. auris.
Aim
The chemical tolerance of C. auris was compared with the surrogate test organism Candida albicans as established in the European standards (EN). In this way, conclusions will be drawn as to whether the disinfectants tested according to EN 13624 and EN 16615 are at least equally effective against C. auris.
Methods
The chemical susceptibility of C. auris and C. albicans was investigated using standardized EN test protocols. EN 13624 and EN 16615 were used in this study to examine two commercially available surface disinfectants based on alcohol and quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), respectively. In addition, the survival rates of the two yeast species were studied on a defined test surface simulating practical conditions.
Findings
In comparison with C. albicans, C. auris was found to be significantly more susceptible to the alcohol- and QAC-based disinfectants used in this study. C. albicans was found to be more tolerant to drying on the test surface in EN 16615, yielding higher recovery rates.

Background
Multicentre intervention studies tackling urinary catheterization and its infections and non-infectious complications are lacking.
Aim
To decrease urinary catheterization and consequently catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) and non-infectious complications.
Methods
Before/after non-randomized multicenter intervention study in seven hospitals in Switzerland. Intervention bundle consisting of 1) a concise list of indications for urinary catheterization, 2) daily evaluation of the need for ongoing catheterization, and 3) education on proper insertion and maintenance of urinary catheters. The primary outcome was urinary catheter utilization. Secondary outcomes were CAUTI, non-infectious complications, and process indicators such as proportion of indicated catheters and frequency of catheter evaluation.
Findings

A straightforward bundle of three evidence-based measures reduced catheter utilization and non-infectious complications, whereas the proportion of indicated urinary catheters and daily evaluations increased. The CAUTI rate remained unchanged, albeit on a very low level."

The rapid growth of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, limited availability of personal protective equipment, and uncertainties regarding transmission modes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have heightened concerns for the safety of healthcare workers (HCWs). Systematic studies of occupational risks for COVID-19 in the context of community risks are difficult and have only recently started to be reported. Ongoing quality improvement studies in various locales and within many affected healthcare institutions are needed. A template design for small-scale quality improvement surveys is proposed. Such surveys have the potential for rapid implementation and completion, are cost-effective, impose little administrative or workforce burden, can reveal occupational risks while taking community risks into account, and can be repeated easily with short time intervals between repetitions. This article describes a template design and proposes a survey instrument that is easily modifiable to fit the particular needs of various healthcare institutions in the hope of beginning a collaborative effort to refine the design and instrument. These methods, along with data management and analytic techniques, can be widely useful and shared globally. The authors' goal is to facilitate quality improvement surveys aimed at reducing the risk of occupational infection of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Given the scarce therapeutic options for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE), aggressive interventions are implemented to limit its spread among hospitalized patients. One such option is contact isolation by cohorting patients in designated units.
Aim
To describe the experiences in cohort isolation units (CIUs) due to CPE from the perspectives of patients admitted to these units and their families, and those of health care workers (HCWs) who served in the same units.
Methods
A qualitative study. Face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were conducted in a large tertiary hospital. Twenty-four participants were interviewed, including 15 HCWs, 3 patients, and 6 family members. Data was coded using thematic analysis.
Findings
The CIU provoked negative feelings such as fear, risk, loneliness, distrust and unfairness. It also created a sense of conflict with the curative assumptions of hospital care. The poor CIU infrastructure was echoed in perceptions of crowdedness in the site. Moreover, family members described HCWs’ inconsistent protective behaviours that led them to a state of vigilance. The hospital infection control unit imparted and refreshed HCWs’ knowledge and expected behaviours regarding the CIU. However, patients and families expressed dissatisfaction with the information, guidance and education regarding the ‘why and how’ of the CIU. They were not guided consistently about recommended behaviours after discharge. In retrospective, HCWs found that the CIU took a psychological, physical and professional toll.
Conclusion
The CIU was planned as a temporary containment mechanism. It needs to develop into a permanent system, capable of addressing the various needs of all involved."

abstract = "Background
Carbapenem-producing Enterobacterales are an expanding group of Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to carbapenems and cause over 9000 cases of hospital-associated infections in the USA. Efforts to quantify the economic and societal burden to healthcare are important to inform resource planning to implement infection control programmes.
Aim
We estimated the healthcare costs during an outbreak of carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli OXA-181 in Australia. We aimed to understand the economic burden to hospitals of patients who are asymptomatically colonized with high-risk bacteria.
Methods
Hospital admissions data and associated costs were obtained from the State Health Department. Colonized patients were matched to non-colonized patients on age, sex, admission ward and diagnostic category. Mean healthcare costs and length of stay were examined using generalized linear models and accounted for time-dependent bias, patient age and ward location.
Findings
On average, colonized patients had six times higher mean costs (AU$155,784; 95% confidence interval (CI): AU$77,892–285,604) than non-colonized patients (AU$25,964). Mean costs for those aged 75–79 years were 50% lower (P=0.02) compared with the youngest subgroup, 35–39 years of age. The mean extended length of stay was 12 days (95% CI: 3–21) for colonized patients. Nursing care was the main driver of overall costs for colonized (44%) and non-colonized (39%) patients.
Conclusion
Patients colonized with carbapenem-producing Enterobacterales during an official hospital outbreak incurred higher costs than non-colonized patients. Although infected patients incur substantial economic burden to hospitals, the costs incurred by colonized patients is also high."

Background
Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) represent a serious threat to public health. Clinical microbiology laboratories (CMLs) need effective protocols for screening and confirmation of CPE.
Aim
To prospectively evaluate an algorithm for the screening of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in an OXA-48 endemic hospital.
Methods
The algorithm was based on a disc diffusion assay using ertapenem and temocillin, which also served as a purity check for routine automated antimicrobial susceptibility testing. All isolates with minimal inhibitory concentrations >0.5 mg/L or zone inhibition diameters <25 mm for ertapenem (Criterion 1) and <12 mm for temocillin (Criterion 2) were tested sequentially by an OXA-48 lateral flow immunochromatographic assay and a multiplex polymerase chain reaction targeting VIM, KPC and OXA-48. If neither test was positive, the modified Hodge test or CARBA NP test was used.
Findings
Over 2 years, 2487 K. pneumoniae were assessed by the algorithm proposed, and 378 (15.20%) met both criteria. Of these, 98.68% (373/378) were either confirmed as OXA-48 producers or originated from patients with a previous CPE isolate that maintained the same resistance phenotype over time. The remaining three K. pneumoniae were VIM producers. Only two of the 378 isolates (0.53%) did not produce carbapenemase, despite meeting Criteria 1 and 2.
Conclusion
The algorithm described combined the most sensitive carbapenem for CPE detection with a cut-off for temocillin that was highly specific for detection of OXA-48. It is reliable and easy to apply in routine CML work flow, allowing rapid detection of CPE isolates and hence prompt implementation of infection control measures and targeted antimicrobial regimens."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The role of laminar flow (LAF) is contradictory with several studies failing to replicate risk reduction. The 2016 World Health Organization guidelines identified this lack of good comparative studies.
Aim
To analyse the use of LAF and the incidence of prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) in Asian patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR).
Methods
Patients who underwent standard cemented posterior-stabilized TKR from 2004 to 2014 were reviewed from a prospectively collected single-surgeon database. Revision, traumatic and/or inflammatory cases were excluded. The type of airflow used was identified. The technique and surgical protocol for all procedures were similar. Tourniquets and inserted drains were routinely used. Patellar resurfacing was not performed. Patients were followed up at the outpatient clinics at regular intervals up to two years. At each visit, the patient was assessed for the occurrence of PJI.
Findings
Of the 1028 procedures, 453 (44.1%) were performed in an LAF operating theatre (OT) whereas 575 (55.9%) were performed in a non-LAF OT. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age, gender, or side of procedure. The overall incidence of PJI was 0.6% (N = 6). Three (50%) occurred in an LAF OT whereas three (50%) occurred in a non-LAF OT. This was not statistically significant.
Conclusion
Laminar flow systems are costly to procure and maintain. With modern aseptic techniques, patient optimization, and use of prophylactic antibiotics, laminar flow does not appear to further reduce risk of PJI in Asian patients after TKR."

Background
In the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and unprecedented global demand, clinicians are struggling to source adequate access to personal protective equipment. Respirators can be in short supply, though are necessary to protect workers from SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Rapid decontamination and reuse of respirators may provide relief for the strained procurement situation.
Method
In this study, we investigated the suitability of 70°C dry heat and microwave-generated steam (MGS) for reprocessing of FFP2/N95-type respirators, and Type-II surgical face masks. Staphylococcus aureus was used as a surrogate as it is less susceptible than enveloped viruses to chemical and physical processes.
Results
We observed >4 log10 reductions in the viability of dry S. aureus treated by dry heat for 90 min at 70°C and >6 log10 reductions by MGS for 90 s. After 3 reprocessing cycles, neither process was found to negatively impact the bacterial or NaCl filtration efficiency of the respirators that were tested. However, MGS was incompatible with Type-II surgical masks tested, as we confirmed that bacterial filtration capacity was completely lost following reprocessing. MGS was observed to be incompatible with some respirator types due to arcing observed around some types of metal nose clips and by loss of adhesion of clips to the mask.
Conclusion
Considering the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, we propose a reprocessing personal protective equipment/face mask workflow for use in medical areas."

Background
Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common healthcare-associated infections and is particularly prevalent following colorectal surgery. It is associated with an increase in patient morbidity and healthcare costs. SSI is difficult to monitor as it frequently presents after discharge from hospital, especially if enhanced recovery programmes are in place.
Aim
To develop an effective method for measuring patient-reported 30-day SSI in patients undergoing colorectal resection. To implement a new care bundle capable of delivering a sustainable reduction in SSI.
Methods
The Public Health England SSI surveillance questionnaire was used. Several data collection methods were tested including postal and telephone-based systems. A new SSI bundle was introduced in our centre incorporating four evidence-based interventions: 2% chlorhexidine skin preparation; repeat-dose antibiotics after 4 h; dual-ring wound protectors; and triclosan-coated sutures for wound closure. System changes were introduced to ensure that the change was sustainable.
Findings
The most reliable method of measuring patient-reported SSI was found to be postal questionnaire with telephone calls made to non-responders. Response rates to the SSI surveillance questionnaire were consistently >75%. Introduction of the new care bundle produced a significant reduction in SSI from 20% to 10% (P ≤ 0.0001) which has been sustained for six years.
Conclusion
This is a reliable method for measuring 30-day patient-reported SSI rates. The introduction of this new care bundle has halved the rate of SSI from 20% to 10%."

Background
In many countries, healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are problematic in long-term aged care living facilities. In the United States (US), HAIs occur frequently in nursing homes (NHs). Identifying effective practices for state Departments of Health (DOHs) to help NHs improve infection prevention and control and reduce HAIs is necessary.
Aim
As a first step, the objective was to systematically examine and catalogue the variations in state intentions and activities related to HAI prevention in NHs.
Methods
An environmental scan of state DOH websites, HAI plans, and HAI state infographics was conducted. Data were collected on 16 items across three domains: (1) intentions to reduce HAIs in NHs, (2) actions to reduce HAIs in NHs, and (3) website usability.
Findings
State infection control support for NHs varied widely. Most states (92%) mentioned NHs in their HAI plans and 76% included NHs in their infographic. Half has an HAI prevention advisory council, while one-third had a state HAI prevention collaborative. Only 57% of HAI plans that mentioned NHs included training materials on HAI reduction. The most common training available was on antibiotic stewardship.
Conclusion
Many US states have room for improvement in the support they provide NHs regarding infection prevention and control. Specific areas of improvement include: (1) increased provision of training materials on HAI reduction, (2) focusing training materials on common HAIs, and (3) NH engagement in collaboratives aimed at HAI reduction. More research is needed linking DOH activities to resident outcomes."

Background
Since 2000, the National Health System has adopted international guidelines for assessing Legionella spp. in hospital water systems. The control of water contamination by Legionella spp. is still a matter of research concerning the most effective method in preventing nosocomial infections.
Aim
To compare three different decontamination methods by monitoring colony-forming unit count and number of hospital-acquired legionellosis cases. A secondary objective was to evaluate the long-term effects of the preventive measures on the water pipes.
Methods
A protocol was developed for the selection of high-risk sampling sites and for the testing of three disinfection methods over the course of 19 years: hyperchlorination and thermal shock (period A, 2000–2005); copper–silver ionization (period B, 2006–2010); and integration of pre-filtering, filtering, pipe-protecting products, and remote control with chlorine dioxide (ClO2) (period C, 2011–2018).
Findings
The use of shock disinfection and hyperchlorination led to a decrease in contamination level immediately after the procedure, but then it rose again to the previous level in two months. Both copper–silver ionization and ClO2 disinfection showed a stable and durable decrease in contamination level. Throughout these three phases, six cases of Legionella spp. occurred during period A, six cases during period B, and three cases during period C. With regard to the damage of water pipes, effective copper–silver levels caused corrosion and calcification in water pipes.
Conclusion
Both copper–silver ionization and ClO2 properly controlled Legionella spp. contamination. ClO2 significantly reduced the number of positive sites (P < 0.001) without damaging the pipelines."

Background
Bacterial contamination by airborne particles is one of the most important factors in the pathogenesis of surgical-site infections.
Aim
This study aimed to identify the generation and behaviour of airborne particles around the feet of surgical staff while walking in and out of an operating theatre.
Methods
Two physicians and two nurses walked in and out of a bio-clean theatre under laminar airflow, either individually or as a group. The generation and behaviour of airborne particles was filmed using a fine particle visualization system, and the number of airborne particles per 2.83 m3 of air was counted using a laser particle counter. Each action was repeated five times, and particle counts were evaluated statistically.
Findings
Airborne particles were generated from the floor and by the shoes and gown hems of the participants, whether walking individually or as a group. Numerous airborne particles were generated by the group, and significantly more particles, especially those measuring 0.3–0.5 μm, were carried up to the level of the operating table by the group than by individuals (P < 0.01).
Conclusions
The results of this study provide a clearer picture of the dispersion and distribution of airborne particles around the feet of staff walking in and out of an operating theatre. The findings suggest that to reduce the incidence of bacterial contamination and risk of surgical site infections, surgical staff should walk calmly and independently, if possible, near sterile areas."

Worldwide dissemination of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) has led to national and international guidance recommending the implementation of cohorting in healthcare settings. However, in view of recent data regarding the spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, the usefulness of this measure in non-outbreak settings is questionable; here, individual contact isolation may be sufficient to control the risk of dissemination. A narrative review of the literature was conducted and the role of cohorting discussed. CPE are responsible for outbreaks in healthcare settings, which are considered the epicentre of spread of resistance strains. CPE are responsible for adverse effects such as increases in hospital stay and costs, fewer therapeutic options and thus higher risk of clinical failures and mortality. Environment and materials have also been reported as contaminated with CPE and may be the source of outbreak. Even if guidelines and publications have supported implementation of cohorting, there are no randomized studies to demonstrate that this measure should be mandatory. Most studies are descriptive and cohorting is usually one of several other measures to control outbreaks. Cohorting is not adapted to all healthcare settings, requiring human and material resources. Other measures must be strengthened such as compliance with hand hygiene, antibiotic stewardship, and surveillance of contact patients. Individual risk factors for acquisition should also be evaluated. In conclusion, local epidemiology and resources must be assessed before implementing cohorting."

Background
Surgical site infections (SSI) present a significant burden to healthcare and patients in terms of excess length of stay, distress, disability and death. SSI risk and the associated economic burden may be reduced through adherence to prevention guidelines although the irreducible minimum is unclear.
Aim
To evaluate the methods used to estimate the cost effectiveness of prevention strategies for all SSI.
Methods
Pubmed, Medline, CINAHL and NHS Economic Evaluation Database were searched from inception to January 2020 to identify English language economic evaluation studies, embedded economic evaluations and studies with some analysis in relation to cost and benefit in adult patients receiving surgical care in any setting. Risk of bias was assessed using the Drummond [1] and Philips [2] checklists.
Findings
32 studies involving 24 043 participants were included. Most studies evaluated SSI prevention in orthopaedic surgeries. Antibiotic prophylaxis, screening, treating or decolonisation of MRSA and surgical wound closure were the main methods evaluated. Methods ranged from cost analyses to cost effectiveness and cost utility analyses. Synthesis of results was not possible due to heterogeneity. All studies reported some economic benefit associated with preventing SSI however measures of benefit were not reported consistently and the quality of studies was low to moderate. Limited evidence in relation to SSI impact on quality of life was identified.
Conclusion
Current evidence in relation to the economic benefits of SSI prevention is limited. Further robust studies which utilise sound economic and epidemiological methods are required to inform future investment decisions in SSI prevention."

Background
The air in the operating room is considered a risk factor for surgical site infection (SSI) due to airborne bacteria shed from the surgical staff or from patients themselves.
Aim
To assess the influence of validated operating room (OR) ventilation data on the risk of revision surgery due to deep infection after primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) reported to the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register (NAR).
Methods
Forty orthopaedic units reporting THAs to the NAR during the period 2005–2015 were included. The true type of OR ventilation in all hospitals at the time of primary THA was confirmed in a previous study. Unidirectional airflow (UDF) systems were subdivided into: small, low-volume, unidirectional vertical flow (lvUDVF) systems; large, high-volume, unidirectional vertical flow (hvUDVF) systems; and unidirectional horizontal flow (UDHF) systems. These three ventilation groups were compared with conventional, turbulent, mixing ventilation (CV). The association between the end-point, time to revision due to infection, and OR ventilation was estimated by calculating relative risks (RRs) in a multivariate Cox regression model, with adjustments for several patient- and surgery-related covariates.
Findings
A total of 51,292 primary THAs were eligible for assessment. Of these, 575 had been revised due to infection. A similar risk of revision due to infection after THA performed was found in ORs with lvUDVF and UDHF compared to CV. THAs performed in ORs with hvUDVF had lower risk of revision due to infection compared to CV (RR = 0.8; 95% CI: 0.6–0.9; P = 0.01).
Conclusion
THAs performed in ORs with hvUDVF systems had lower risk of revision due to infection compared to THAs performed in ORs with CV systems. The perception that all UDF systems are similar and possibly harmful seems erroneous."

Patients prescribed a systemic antibacterial agent between April 2016 and March 2018 in a 750 bed English hospital were included. The following data were extracted for each patient hospital spell; age, sex, co-morbidity, infection treated, antibiotic usage (DDD), hospital length of stay, and penicillin allergy status. Multivariable log-linear modelling was used to determine the association between patients labelled as penicillin allergic and total antibiotic costs and length of stay. Using the above models, we estimated the potential reduction in total costs and hospital bed days of ‘de-labelling’ patients with penicillin allergy records.
Results
Penicillin allergy records were present in 14.3% of hospital admissions and were associated with an increase in non-penicillin antibiotic prescribing, a 28.4% increase in antibiotic costs and 5.5% longer length of hospital stay, relative to patients without a penicillin allergy record. Patients with penicillin allergy records accounted for an excess antibiotic spend of £10,637 (2.61% of annual antibiotic drug spend) and 3,522 excess bed days (3.87% of annual bed days). De-labelling 50% of patients with a self-reported allergy record would save an estimated £5,501 in antibiotic costs and £503,932 through reduced excess bed days
Conclusion
De-labelling patients with a self-reported allergy record has potential to reduce antibiotic costs but its biggest cost impact is via reduction in excess bed days."

Background
Global pandemic outbreaks often have people fear. Healthcare personnel (HCP), especially those fighting the pathogens at the front lines, encounter a higher risk of being infected, while they treat patients. In addition, a variety of environmental fomites in hospitals, which may contain infectious agents, can post a high risk of getting infectious diseases.
Aim
Making HCP feel safe from infectious diseases is critical to delivering the best healthcare practice. Therefore, this study aims provide a better understanding of HCP’s HH behaviours and perceptions of infectious diseases from psychological perspectives.
Method
Observations measured different environmental features at three different departments and questionnaires asked HCP’s perception of safety from infectious diseases and coping behaviors (e.g., avoidance and disinfection).
Findings
This study has implications for potential interventions that enough HH stations at convenient locations would increase HH compliance rate from psychological perspectives, perception of safety from infectious diseases. In response to the current research gap in psychological aspects associated with HH, this study also presents HCP’s coping behaviours (e.g., avoidance and disinfection) would be predicted by their perceived contamination likelihoods and their perceived vulnerability enhanced the associations.
Conclusions
Nonetheless, due to several limitations, those findings should be carefully interpreted and further studies must be conducted with more solid academic rigor."

Background
Viral respiratory illnesses are common causes of outbreaks and can be fatal to some patients.
Aim
To investigate the association between laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections and potential sources of exposure during the previous 7 days.
Methods
In this nested case–control analysis, healthcare personnel from nine Canadian hospitals who developed acute respiratory illnesses during the winters of 2010/11–2013/14 submitted swabs that were tested for viral pathogens. Associated illness diaries and the weekly diaries of non-ill participants provided information on contact with people displaying symptoms of acute respiratory illness in the previous week. Conditional logistic regression assessed the association between cases, who were matched by study week and site with controls with no respiratory symptoms.
Findings
There were 814 laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory illnesses. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of a viral illness was higher for healthcare personnel reporting exposures to ill household members [7.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.4–9.1], co-workers (3.4, 95% CI 2.4–4.7) or other social contacts (5.1, 95% CI 3.6–7.1). Exposures to patients with respiratory illness were not associated with infection (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7–1.2); however, healthcare personnel with direct patient contact did have higher odds (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1–1.6). The aORs for exposure and for direct patient contact were similar for illnesses caused by influenza.
Conclusion
Community and co-worker contacts are important sources of viral respiratory illness in healthcare personnel, while exposure to patients with recognized respiratory infections is not associated. The comparatively low risk associated with direct patient contact may reflect transmission related to asymptomatic patients or unrecognized infections."

abstract = "SUMMARY
Objective
The international outbreak of cardiac-surgery-associated Mycobacterium chimaera infections was traced back to infectious aerosols originating from contaminated water reservoirs of heater-cooler devices (HCDs). In general, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) frequently colonize water systems and can contaminate medical devices. Data on detection of NTM other than M. chimaera in samples gathered from HCDs are scarce. The present study summarizes prospective mycobacterial surveillance of five HCDs over more than 4 years.
Methods
Five LivaNova 3T (London, UK) HCDs, acquired factory-new in 2014, were followed prospectively. Until mid-April 2014, the HCDs were maintained according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and subsequently, they were maintained according to an intensified in-house protocol including exhaust air evacuation. Mycobacterial surveillance cultures consisted of monthly water samples gathered from patient and cardioplegia circuits, as well as airflow samples.
Results
Of 441 water samples, 170 (38.6%) revealed NTM growth. The most frequently detected NTM were M. chimaera [N=120 (67.4%)], Mycobacterium gordonae [N=35 (19.7 %)] and Mycobacterium paragordonae [N=17 (9.6%)]. Growth of NTM, M. chimaera and M. paragordonae was significantly more common in water samples derived from the patient circuit than the cardioplegia circuit of the HCD. Three (2.0%) of 150 air samples grew NTM.
Conclusion
Growth of NTM in HCD water samples was common. Diverse NTM species were detected, with M. chimaera being the most common. The majority of air samples remained negative. The relevance of NTM other than M. chimaera contaminating HCDs is poorly defined, but a recent report on an HCD-associated outbreak with Mycobacterium abscessus confirmed a potential threat."

Background
Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a shortage of respirators is occurring worldwide; more specifically, Conformité Européene (CE)-certified Filtering Face-Piece (FFP2) respirators. This has resulted in an increased supply to hospitals of alternative respirators of uncertain quality. Nevertheless, the quality of the respirators used by our healthcare workers must be ensured.
Aim
To develop a protocol to ensure the quality of respiratory protective devices for healthcare workers nursing and treating patients with possible or confirmed COVID-19 in the Catharina Hospital.
Methods
A protocol and criteria based on applicable standards were developed to ensure the quality of respirators. The protocol has been implemented at the Catharina Hospital and includes verification of the documents accompanying the respirator, visual inspection of the respirator, and a test for total inward leak of particles into respirators.
Findings
Sixty-seven percent of the respirator brands and types received in the Catharina Hospital did not meet quality criteria.
Conclusion
With a simple verification protocol the quality of the respirators can be checked and guaranteed while there is a shortage of the CE-approved respirators that are normally used. With this in-hospital protocol, healthcare workers can be equipped with safe-to-use respirators."

Background
Ultraviolet C (UVC) light has been used to inactivate several pathogens. Unlike conventional 254-nm UVC, 222-nm UVC is harmless to mammalian cells.
Aim
To investigate the disinfection efficacy of 222-nm UVC against human pathogens which are commonly found in the environment and healthcare facilities.
Methodology
Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subsp. serovar Typhimurium, Campylobacter jejuni, Bacillus cereus (vegetative cells and endospores), Clostridium sporogenes (vegetative cells and endospores), Clostoridioides difficile (endospores), Candida albicans (yeast), Aspergillus niger (hyphae and spores), Trichophyton rubrum (hyphae and spores), feline calicivirus and influenza A virus were irradiated with 222-nm UVC at various doses. The remaining live bacterial and fungal cells, and viral infectivity were evaluated. The germicidal effect of 222-nm UVC was compared with that of 254-nm UVC.
Results
UVC with a wavelength of 222 nm had a potent germicidal effect on vegetative bacterial cells, yeast and viruses, and was as efficient as 245-nm UVC. In addition, 222-nm UVC had a more potent germicidal effect on bacterial endospores compared with 254-nm UVC. The fungicidal effect of 222-nm UVC against fungal spores and hyphae was weaker than that of 254-nm UVC.
Conclusions
UVC with a wavelength of 222 nm was able to inactivate a wide spectrum of microbial pathogens. In comparison with 254-nm UVC, the germicidal effect of 222-nm UVC for fungal hyphae and spores was low, but 222-nm UVC had a strong germicidal effect on bacterial endospores."

Aim
The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) between February 24th to April 30th, 2020 in a hospital in Madrid, Spain.
Methods
We designed a retrospective cohort study. Cumulative COVID-19 incidence was calculated for all HCWs and categorized according to presumed level of COVID-19 exposure (high, medium and low).
Results
Among 1,911 HCW, 213 (11.1%) had COVID-19 during the study period. Cases increased gradually from March 8th, peaking in March 17th and declining thereafter. The peak of cases among HCWs was reached 14 days before the peak in admitted COVID-19 cases in the hospital. There were no significant differences in the proportion of COVID-19 cases according to level of occupational exposure (p=0.123). There were 5 departments and 2 professions in which more than 20% of the workers had confirmed COVID-19. We identified temporal clusters in three of these departments and one profession, with most of the cases occurring over a period of less than 5 days. The prevalence of comorbidities was low and 91.5% of patients had mild or moderate symptoms. Eleven patients were admitted to the hospital and 1 patient needed intensive care. None of the patients died. The median time of sick leave was 20 (IQR: 15 – 26) days.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that HCW-to-HCW transmission accounted for part of the cases. In spite of a low prevalence of comorbidities and a mild clinical course in most cases, COVID-19 caused long periods of sick leave."

Background
Copper-oxide-impregnated linens and hard surfaces within the hospital environment have emerged as a novel technology to reduce environmental contamination and thereby potentially reduce the risk of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs).
Methods
This was a two-phase study. Phase 1 was a prospective, cluster-randomized, cross-over clinical trial in which one pod (eight beds) of our general ICU (GICU) utilized copper-oxide-impregnated linens whereas the other pod (eight beds) used standard hospital linens. Phase 2 was a two-year before–after study, following the relocation of three ICUs into a new ICU tower in which all the hard surfaces were treated with copper oxide (in addition to copper-impregnated linens). HCAIs were recorded using the National Healthcare Safety Network definitions.
Findings
A total of 1282 patients were enrolled in phase 1. There was no difference in the rate of HCAI between the patients who received standard compared with copper oxide linen. In phase 2 there was a significant reduction in the number of infections due to Clostridioides difficile (2.4 per 1000 vs 0.7 per 1000 patient-days; incidence rate ratio: 3.3; 95% confidence interval: 1.4–8.7; P = 0.002) but no difference in the rate of central-line-associated bloodstream infections nor of catheter-associated urinary tract infections.
Conclusion
Copper-oxide-impregnated linens alone had no effect on the rate of HCAI. Our data suggest that copper-oxide-treated hard surfaces reduced the rate of infections due to C. difficile; however, important confounders cannot be excluded."

Background
Heterogeneity of outcomes measured in trials to improve antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in care homes has compromised quality of evidence. A core outcome set (COS) is needed to facilitate interpretation and synthesis of evidence in this area.
Aim
To determine outcomes deemed important by relevant stakeholders for interventions aimed at improving AMS in care homes, and to produce a refined list of outcomes that could be considered for use in future research.
Methods
Semi-structured face-to-face or telephone interviews were conducted with key stakeholders. Outcomes reported in previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of AMS in care homes were included in a topic guide for interviews. Content analysis was undertaken to identify potential outcomes suggested by participants, followed by further review.
Findings
Twenty-seven outcomes reported in RCTs were refined into a list of 12 overarching outcomes. Interviews with participants (six researchers, 31 healthcare professionals, and four family members of care home residents) identified 40 additional outcomes that were important to them. From these 52 outcomes, the total number of antimicrobials, the appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing and adherence to guidelines were highlighted by most participants. After reviewing all 52 outcomes, a refined list of 14 outcomes potentially feasible for use in AMS trials in care homes was generated.
Conclusion
s: A number of potential outcomes for AMS in care homes, some of which had not been reported in previous studies, were identified. The refined list of 14 outcomes will be used in a future study to agree a COS for care home AMS trials."

The influenza season of 2017/2018 was burdensome in comparison with previous years. Management of patients with seasonal influenza is poorly described.
Aim
To assess the impact of managing patients with influenza on a dedicated influenza ward on antimicrobial use and duration, and length of stay (LOS).
Methods
A prospective cohort study was performed from 1st January to 28th February 2018. Patients diagnosed with influenza in the emergency department (ED) were cohorted under infectious disease (ID) or general internal medicine (GIM) services on a 35-bed influenza ward. At times of maximum capacity, some patients were managed on other wards by other services.
Findings
Ninety-one patients were admitted to the influenza ward from the ED (64 ID, 27 GIM); of these, 38 patients had influenza A. Patients managed by the ID service were generally switched to oral antibiotics sooner than patients managed by the GIM service (median 3 vs 5 days; P=0.049). Antibiotic duration was shorter for patients managed by the ID service compared with patients managed by the GIM service (median 7 vs 9 days; P=0.016). LOS was shorter for patients managed by the ID service on the influenza ward compared with patients with influenza on non-influenza wards (median 5 vs 9 days; P=0.007). No significant difference in LOS was seen between patients on the influenza ward managed by the ID and GIM services (median 5 vs 7 days; P=0.30).
Conclusion

Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan in December 2019 and has rapidly spread across different cities within and outside China. Hong Kong started to prepare for COVID-19 on 31st December 2019 and infection control measures in public hospitals were tightened to limit nosocomial transmission within healthcare facilities. However, the recommendations on the transmission-based precautions required for COVID-19 in hospital settings vary from droplet and contact precautions, to contact and airborne precautions with placement of patients in airborne infection isolation rooms.
Aim
To describe an outbreak investigation of a patient with COVID-19 who was nursed in an open cubicle of a general ward before the diagnosis was made.
Method
Contacts were identified and risk categorized as ‘close’ or ‘casual’ for decisions on quarantine and/or medical surveillance. Respiratory specimens were collected from contacts who developed fever, and/or respiratory symptoms during the surveillance period and were tested for SARS-CoV-2.
Findings
A total of 71 staff and 49 patients were identified from contact tracing, seven staff and 10 patients fulfilled the criteria of ‘close contact’. At the end of 28-day surveillance, 76 tests were performed on 52 contacts and all were negative, including all patient close contacts and six of the seven staff close contacts. The remaining contacts were asymptomatic throughout the surveillance period.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not spread by an airborne route, and nosocomial transmissions can be prevented through vigilant basic infection control measures, including wearing of surgical masks, hand and environmental hygiene."

Background
Clostridioides difficile is transmitted through endospores. Most disinfection procedures for these structures deploy high concentrations of chlorine-derived compounds such as sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC). However, these substances are linked to undesirable public health and environmental issues.
Aim
To compare the efficacy of NaCl-derived electrochemically activated solution (ECAS, 0.18% w/v NaOCl, pH=9.6–10.3), commercial bleach (5000 ppm, 2.83% w/v NaOCl, pH=5.6) and NaDCC (1000 ppm, pH=6.8) to inactivate C. difficile endospores on surfaces using a standard quantitative test (EPA MO-21-03).
Findings
Ten representative reference and field strains from multi-locus sequence typing Clades 1–5 were assayed (N=10). Irrespective of the phylogenetic background of the strains, ECAS showed comparable or better log reduction values [mean=3.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40–5.56] than bleach (mean=2.74, 95% CI 0.12–5.50) and NaDCC (mean=2.02, 95% CI 0.10–5.12). Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed similar electrochemical behaviours and open-circuit potentials for ECAS and NaOCl. Congruently, similar morphologies for spores treated with these two compounds were observed by transmission electron microscopy. A factorial design demonstrated that exposure time, but not activation time, influenced the efficacy of ECAS.
Conclusions
ECAS and NaOC were found to have functional equivalence and may have a common mechanism of action."

Introduction
Aging and comorbidities such as diabetes and vascular problems contribute to the increasing occurrence of chronic wounds. From the beginning of 2016, a marked increase in Arcanobacterium haemolyticum (ARH) in chronic wound cultures was noted among patients visiting a wound expertise centre in The Netherlands.
Aim
To report the outbreak investigation of ARH cultured from chronic wounds and describe the implemented infection prevention measures.
Methods
In total, 50 ARH isolates were sent to a reference laboratory for molecular typing. Samples for bacterial culture and ARH polymerase chain reaction were taken from care workers, the environment and items used for wound care. Infection prevention measures were implemented in a bundled approach, involving education, better aseptic wound care conditions and hygienic precautions. Before and after the implementation of infection prevention measures, two screening rounds of ARH testing were performed among all patients receiving home care.
Results
ARH isolates from wound care patients were found to be identical by core genome multi-locus sequence typing. No definite outbreak source could be determined by culture. However, three pairs of forceps, used by two nurses on multiple patients, were found to be ARH positive by polymerase chain reaction. In the two screening rounds before and after the implementation of infection prevention measures, the proportion of ARH-positive patients decreased significantly from 20% (20/99) to 3% (3/104). Subsequently, no new cases occurred.
Conclusion
This first ARH outbreak was likely caused by re-using contaminated instruments. Through the implementation of improved infection prevention measures and re-education of all employees involved, the outbreak was controlled. With the current trend of care transition, infection control must be a major concern."

abstract = "SUMMARY
Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) continues to affect ∼25,000 patients in the UK per year with a high crude mortality of 30% at 90 days. Prompt source control improves outcomes in sepsis and SAB and is included in sepsis guidelines. A recent clinical trial of adjunctive antibiotic treatment in SAB found that the majority of recurrences of SAB were associated with a failure of source management. In this condition, the ability to control the source of infection may be limited by the ability to detect a focus of infection. Echocardiogram is now a routinely used tool to detect such unknown foci in the form of unexpected infectious vegetations. We review the literature to explore the utility of advanced imaging techniques, such as [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (including whole-body MRI), to detect foci which may otherwise be missed. As unknown foci are associated with increased mortality, we propose that increasing the detection of foci could enable improved source control and result in improved outcomes in SAB."

abstract = "Summary
Classical waterborne pathogens (cholera/typhoid) drove the development of safe water and sanitation during the industrial revolution. Whilst effective against these organisms, other bacteria exploited the potential to form biofilm in the narrow pipes of buildings. Legionella was discovered in 1976. Despite evidence dating back to 1967 (including paediatric deaths in Manchester in 1995 from splashes from a sink contaminating parenteral nutrition) it required the deaths of four neonates and the might of the news media in 2011 for the UK medical services to accept waterborne transmission of other opportunistic plumbing premise pathogens (OPPPs). Human nature, a healthcare construction industry largely devoid of interest in water safety, and failures in recognizing transmission are major forces hindering progress in preventing infection/deaths from waterborne infections. The advent of highly resistant Gram-negative bacteria is highlighting further deficiencies in modern drainage systems. These bacteria are not thought to have special adaptations promoting their dispersal but purely attract our attention to the well-trodden routes used by susceptible organisms, which go undetected. The O'Neill report warns of the bleak future without effective antibiotics. This review examines the evidence as to why modern water services/sanitation continue to present a risk to patient safety (and the general public) and suggests that their designs may be flawed if they are to stem the modern equivalent of cholera, the dissemination of antibiotic resistance."

Aim
To investigate the dissemination of Salmonella spp. within four levels of government hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
Methods
The identification of Salmonella spp. was performed by amplification of the invA gene. Isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular characterization of eight resistance genes (qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, tetA, tetB, tetC, tetG, ermB) and three virulence genes (sitC, spvA, spv). Genetic relatedness between isolates was determined using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) polymerase chain reaction.
Findings
Ninety-four isolates were obtained. The largest source of isolates was the regional hospital. Paediatric wards had the highest prevalence of isolates. Nurses' tables contained the most isolates out of all sites sampled. Twenty-two clusters indicating diverse isolates were obtained via molecular typing. Four main ERIC types were identified, each unique to a specific hospital. A possibility of dissemination across the wards was noted as highly related isolates were present at various sites within the wards. Many of these sites were highly trafficked areas by healthcare staff. Ten multi-drug-resistant isolates were found.
Conclusions
This study suggests that infection prevention and control strategies that involve environmental cleaning and decontamination may not be enough, or adhered to sufficiently, to prevent the dissemination of Salmonella spp."

Background
Many antiseptics have been used to treat wounds.
Aim
To compare the microbicidal efficacy of ClHO (Clortech®) with other antiseptics used on wounds, healthy skin and mucous membranes.
Methods
The microbicidal efficacy of 13 antiseptic products on eight micro-organisms (three Gram-positive; three Gram-negative; two yeasts) inoculated on organic germ-carriers was studied. In addition, the loss of efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with biofilm was assessed with the six best-performing products.
Findings
Chlorhexidine (1%) had the highest microbicidal effect at 1 min. At 5 min, 500 and 1500 mg/L ClHO showed similar, or better, activity than the other antiseptics studied. The ClHO concentration of 300 mg/L achieved this same efficacy at 10 min. The product that lost the most efficacy due to biofilm was 1% chlorhexidine, while 1% PVP-I and ClHO at either 300 or 500 mg/L were moderately affected by biofilm. The most effective in the presence of biofilm was ClHO at 1500 mg/L.
Conclusions
ClHO at medium–low concentrations (300 or 500 mg/L) is a good antiseptic that can be used on wounds and mucous membranes for 5–10 min. Lower concentrations of ClHO, as well as of the other antiseptics studied, were less effective or more altered by the biofilm. ClHO at a concentration of 1500 mg/L is very effective in the presence or absence of biofilm that can be used on healthy skin for 5 min."

The effects of subinhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of antibacterial agents on the biofilm-forming ability of Staphylococcus aureus remain understudied. We investigated the effects of sub-MICs of chlorhexidine and mupirocin on biofilm formation in clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates.
Methods
MRSA isolates were collected from patients with bloodstream infections at a tertiary care hospital. The basal level of biofilm formation and biofilm induction by sub-MICs of chlorhexidine and mupirocin were evaluated by measuring biofilm mass stained with crystal violet.
Results
Of the 112 MRSA isolates tested, 63 (56.3%) and 44 (39.3%) belonged to ST5 and ST72 lineages, respectively, which are the most predominant healthcare- and community-associated clones in South Korea. ST5 isolates were more likely to have chlorhexidine MIC ≥4 (73.0% vs. 29.5%), resistance to mupirocin (23.8% vs. 0%), agr dysfunction (73.0% vs. 9.1%), and qacA/B gene (58.7% vs. 2.3%) compared to ST72 isolates. The basal level of biofilm formation ability was frequently stronger in ST72 isolates compared to ST5 isolates (77.3% vs. 12.7%). Sub-MICs of chlorhexidine and mupirocin promoted biofilm formation in 56.3% and 53.6%, respectively, of all isolates. Biofilm induction was more prevalent in ST5 isolates (85.7% for chlorhexidine, 69.8% for mupirocin) than in ST72 isolates (15.9% for chlorhexidine, 27.3% for mupirocin).
Conclusions
Sub-MICs of chlorhexidine and mupirocin promoted biofilm formation in half of the clinical MRSA isolates. Our results suggest that ST5 MRSA biofilm can be induced together with some other bacterial virulent factors following exposure to chlorhexidine, which might confer a survival advantage to this clone in healthcare environment."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Candida auris, a multi-drug-resistant fungal pathogen, has become an emerging threat in healthcare settings around the world. Reliable disinfection protocols specifically designed to inactivate C. auris are essential, as many chemical disinfectants commonly used in healthcare settings have been shown to have variable efficacy at inactivating C. auris.
Aim
Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) was investigated as a method to inactivate clinically relevant strains of C. auris.
Methods
Ten C. auris and two C. albicans isolates were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) energy to determine the UV dose required to inactivate each isolate. Using a UV reactor, each isolate (106 cells/mL) was exposed to 11 UV doses ranging from 10 to 150 mJ/cm2 and then cultured to assess cell viability.
Findings
An exponential decay model was applied to each dose–response curve to determine inactivation rate constants for each isolate, which ranged from 0.108 to 0.176 cm2/mJ for C. auris and from 0.239 to 0.292 cm2/mJ for C. albicans. As the model of exponential decay did not accurately estimate the dose beyond 99.9% inactivation, a logistic regression model was applied to better estimate the doses required for 99.999% inactivation. Using this model, significantly greater UV energy was required to inactivate C. auris (103–192 mJ/cm2) compared with C. albicans (78–80 mJ/cm2).
Conclusion
UVGI is a feasible approach for inactivating C. auris, although variable susceptibility among isolates must be taken into account. This dose–response data is critical for recommending UVGI dosing strategies to be tested in healthcare settings."

Background
Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) have rapidly emerged in Europe, being responsible for nosocomial outbreaks.
Aim
Following an outbreak in the burn unit of Ghent University Hospital, we investigated whether CPE can spread between toilets through drain water and therefrom be transmitted to patients.
Methods
In 2017, the burn centre of our hospital experienced an outbreak of OXA-48 producing Klebsiella pneumoniae that affected five patients staying in three different rooms. Environmental samples were collected from the sink, shower, shower stretcher, handrail of the bed, nursing carts, toilets and drain water to explore a common source. Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was performed on K. pneumoniae outbreak isolates and two random K. pneumoniae isolates.
Findings
OXA-48 producing K. pneumoniae was detected in toilet water in 4/6 rooms and drain water between two rooms. The strain persisted in 2/6 rooms after two months of daily disinfection with bleach. All outbreak isolates belonged to sequence type (ST) 15 and showed isogenicity (<15 allele differences). This suggests that the strain may have spread between rooms by drain water. Unexpectedly, one random isolate obtained from a patient who became colonized whilst residing at the geriatric ward clustered with the outbreak isolates, suggesting the outbreak to be larger than expected. Daily application of bleach tended to be superior to acetic acid to disinfect toilet water, however, disinfection did not completely prevent the presence of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae in toilet water.
Conclusion
Toilet drain water may be a potential source of hospital room-to-room transmission of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae."

Monitoring and evaluation are an essential part of infection prevention and control (IPC) implementation. The authors developed an IPC assessment framework (IPCAF) to support implementation of the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on core components of IPC programmes in acute healthcare facilities.
Aim
To evaluate the usability and reliability of the IPCAF tool for global use.
Methods
The IPCAF is a questionnaire with a scoring system to measure the level of IPC implementation according to the eight WHO core components. The tool was pre-tested qualitatively, revised and translated selectively. A convenience sample of hospitals was invited to participate in the final testing. At least two IPC professionals from each hospital independently completed the IPCAF and a usability questionnaire online. The tool's internal consistency and interobserver reliability or intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were assessed, and usability questions were summarized descriptively.
Findings
In total, 46 countries, 181 hospitals and 324 individuals participated; 52 (16%) and 55 (17%) individual respondents came from low- and lower-middle income countries, respectively. Fifty-two percent of respondents took less than 1 h to complete the IPCAF. Overall, there was adequate internal consistency and a high ICC (0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.89–0.94). Ten individual questions had poor reliability (ICC <0.4); these were considered for revision according to usability feedback and expert opinion.
Conclusions
The WHO IPCAF was tested using a robust global study and revised as necessary. It is now an effective tool for IPC improvement in healthcare facilities."

Previously, the RICAT (Reduction of Inappropriate use of intravenous and urinary CATheters) study had been conducted by ourselves to reduce inappropriate use of intravenous and urinary catheters in medical wards to prevent healthcare-associated infections.
Aim
To compare surgical and medical wards, and to determine risk factors for inappropriate catheter use.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was performed from October, 2017, to May, 2018, in surgical wards of two university hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients were prospectively observed every other week for seven months. Inappropriate use was compared with non-surgical wards in the RICAT study.
Findings
In all, 409 surgical patients were included, and they were compared with 1781 medical patients. Inappropriate use occurred in 36 (8.5%) out of 425 peripheral intravenous catheters in 373 surgical patients, compared to 400 (22.9%) out of 1747 peripheral intravenous catheters in 1665 medical patients, a difference of 14.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.1–17.8; P < 0.001). Inappropriate use of urinary catheters occurred in 14 (10.4%) out of 134 surgical patients, compared to 105 (32.4%) out of 324 medical patients, a difference of 22.0% (95% CI: 14.7–29.2; P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis in the two university hospitals confirmed these differences. The main risk factor for inappropriate use of peripheral intravenous catheters was admission in medical wards (odds ratio (OR): 3.50; 95% CI: 2.15–5.69), which was also one of the main risk factors for urinary catheters (OR: 2.75; 95% CI: 1.36–5.55).

Background
Biofilm formation has been shown to be associated with damaged areas of endoscope channels. It was hypothesized that the passage of instruments and brushes through endoscope channels during procedures and cleaning contributes to channel damage, bacterial attachment and biofilm formation.
Aim
To compare surface roughness and bacterial attachment in used and new endoscope channels in vivo and in vitro.
Methods
Surface roughness of 10 clinically used (retired) and seven new colonoscope biopsy channels was analysed by a surface profiler. For the in-vitro study, a flexible endoscope biopsy forceps was passed repeatedly through a curved 3.0-mm-diameter Teflon tube 100, 200 and 500 times. Atomic force microscopy was used to determine the degree of inner surface damage. The number of Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecium attached to the inner surface of the new Teflon tube and the tube with 500 forceps passes in 1 h at 37oC was determined by culture.
Results
The average surface roughness of the used biopsy channels was found to be 1.5 times greater than that of the new biopsy channels (P=0.03). Surface roughness of Teflon tubes with 100, 200 and 500 forceps passes was 1.05-, 1.12- and 3.2-fold (P=0.025) greater than the roughness of the new Teflon tubes, respectively.

Background
A common complication of central venous access devices (CVADs) is catheter-associated bloodstream infection (CA-BSI). We previously demonstrated that insertion of CVADs on the right side was associated with increased risk of CA-BSI, and hypothesized that this related to the predominance of right-handedness in the patient population, resulting in greater movement and bacterial contamination.
Aim
We performed a prospective randomised controlled, non-blinded study to determine whether the side of CVAD insertion influenced the incidence of CA-BSI.
Methods
Adult cancer patients were randomly allocated to either dominant or non-dominant side CVAD insertion. The primary end-point of the study was the number of line days until CA-BSI, determined in a blinded fashion by two assessors.
Findings
640 CVADs were randomised to dominant (n=322) or non-dominant (n=318) side of insertion, 60% had hematological malignancies, and 40% solid tumors. CVADs were a peripherally inserted central catheter line (67%), tunnelled CVAD (23%) and non-tunnelled CVAD (10%). 22% of CVADs were complicated by CA-BSI. The rate of CA-BSI per 1000 line days was 3.49 vs 3.66 in the non-dominant vs dominant group (HR 0.91; 95%CI, 0.65-1.28). By multivariable analysis, the rate of CA-BSI was increased by: use of tunnelled CVADs compared to PICC lines (HR 2.05, 95%CI 1.45-2.91); having a haematological malignancy compared to non-gastrointestinal solid tumors (HR 5.55; 95%CI 2.47-12.5); but not dominant compared to non-dominant side of CVAD (HR 0.97, 95%CI 0.69-1.36).

abstract = "Summary
Background
Carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter species, especially A. baumannii, are frequently associated with treatment failures and hospital outbreaks; thus, rapid and reliable detection of specific resistance markers is paramount. The most common carbapenemases found in A. baumannii, namely OXA-23-like, OXA-24-like, and OXA-58-like, belong to the oxacillinase group (class D β-lactamases) which is notoriously difficult to identify phenotypically due to the lack of specific inhibitors.
Aim
To design and validate a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect and differentiate the above three oxacillinases.
Methods
All available variants of the above three oxacillinase subfamilies were downloaded (as of November 2019) from the Beta-Lactamase DataBase (http://bldb.eu/) aligned with Clustal Omega and oligonucleotides designed using Primer-BLAST. A multiplex real-time PCR assay that included an internal control to discount inhibition was optimized on the Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen) using the Rotor-Gene Multiplex PCR Kit (Qiagen) and validated using a panel of 122 previously characterized strains carrying a wide range of β-lactamases, often in combination.
Findings
The in-silico approach enabled the design of oligonucleotides in conserved regions of the OXA-24-like and OXA-58-like alignments. Among the 42 described OXA-23-like variants, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was present in one of the oligonucleotide binding sites of OXA-27, OXA-166, OXA-811, OXA-812, and OXA-816. The assay was 100% sensitive and highly specific. Inhibition was not observed.
Conclusion
The assay is easy to perform with results available in about 70 min. It enables unequivocal detection and differentiation of OXA-23-like, OXA-24-like, and OXA-58-like carbapenemases even when more than one is simultaneously present."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Patients with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have a high mortality rate. Early, targeted antibiotic therapy is crucial for patient survival. The clinical use of a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based approach for pathogen identification may lead to improved diagnostic performance. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to examine changes in the pulmonary microbiome and resulting influences on patient outcome in sepsis-induced ARDS, and to compare NGS- and culture-based diagnostic methods for pathogen identification.
Methods
In total, 30 patients in two groups were enrolled in the study: 15 patients with sepsis-induced ARDS following major abdominal surgery and 15 patients undergoing oesophageal resection (serving as controls). In the ARDS group, blood samples were collected at ARDS onset (day 0), and 5 and 10 days later. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed at the same timepoints to collect epithelial lining fluid for culture- and NGS-based analyses, and to evaluate longitudinal changes in the pulmonary microbiome. In the control group, only one BAL and one blood sample were collected.
Results
Patients with ARDS showed significantly lower α-diversity (P=0.007) and increased dominance (P=0.012) in their pulmonary microbiome compared with the controls. The α-diversity index correlated with the length of stay in the intensive care unit (P=0.015) and the need for mechanical ventilation (P=0.009). In 42.9% of patients with ARDS, culture-based results were negative while NGS findings indicated bacterial colonization.
Conclusion
Sepsis-induced ARDS is associated with significant dysbiosis of the patient's pulmonary microbiome, which is closely correlated with the clinical course of disease."

abstract = "SUMMARY
Background
Clinical outcomes of patients undergoing a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantation following a recent non-device related infection are unknown.
Aim
To evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients with recent infection before CIED implantation.
Methods
Consecutive patients (N = 1237) were classified as patients with recent infection (N = 72) and without recent infection (N = 1165). A recent infection was established by reviewing medical records, including symptoms and clinical manifestations, diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score. Multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of in-hospital all-cause mortality.
Findings
During nearly three years of follow-up, 17 patients had CIED infection (1.4%), and the incidence of CIED infection did not significantly differ between patients with and without recent infection according to symptoms and clinical manifestations (2.8% vs 1.3%, respectively; not significant). However, patients with recent infection had a significantly higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to those without recent infection (22.2% vs 0.9%, respectively; P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, predictors of in-hospital mortality were recent infection before CIED implantation (odds ratio: 20.3; 95% confidence interval: 8.4–49.3; P < 0.001) and end-stage renal disease (4.3; 1.4–12.8; P = 0.009).
Conclusion
A CIED implantation is feasible in patients with recent infection if the patient is afebrile and has received an adequate duration of antibiotic therapy. Participants in shared decision-making before implant should be advised that recent infection increases in-hospital mortality risk, especially in patients with a qSOFA score of ≥2."

Background
Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a frequent and severe complication of antibiotic treatment in elderly patients hospitalized for acute pneumonia (AP).
Aim
To assess the burden and risk factors of CDI and to determine which of the usual antibiotics regimens is at lower risk for post-AP CDI incidence.
Methods
Among patients aged >75 years hospitalized for AP in all departments of a university hospital between 2007 and 2017, all the 92 patients developing CDI were compared with 213 patients without CDI. Factors associated with (i) in-hospital and one-year mortality and (ii) CDI incidence were assessed using logistic regression models.
Findings
In patients with and without CDI after AP, mortality rates were respectively at 34% vs 20% in hospital and 63% vs 42% at one year. After adjustment for confounders, CDI was associated with a two-fold risk of in-hospital and one-year mortality after pneumonia (respectively, odds ratio (OR): 1.95; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06–3.58; and OR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.43–7.31). High number of antibiotics (per antibiotic, OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.18–3.06) rather than antibiotics duration (per day, OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.96–1.11) was associated with a higher risk of CDI. Compared with other antibiotics, use of penicillin + β-lactamase inhibitors was associated with a lower risk of CDI (OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.19–0.99).
Conclusion
In elderly inpatients, CDI greatly increases the burden of AP in the short and long term. If confirmed, these results suggest the preferential use of penicillin + β-lactamase inhibitors for a lower incidence of CDI in elderly inpatients with AP."

Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Streptococcus pyogenes is a well-known cause of postpartum infections and is causing significant morbidity and mortality.
Aim
To describe measures taken to control an outbreak of postpartum infections caused by S. pyogenes emm75 on a maternity ward.
Methods
Patients presenting postpartum with signs and symptoms of infection were cultured for β-haemolytic streptococci with cervical swabs and blood cultures, and bacterial isolates were species-determined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and emm-typed. Pharyngeal swabs were taken from healthcare workers (HCWs) at the ward. Bacterial isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The multi-locus sequence type and the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to an index genome were determined.
Findings
During a three-month period, six cases of postpartum infection with S. pyogenes emm75 were identified on the maternity ward. By comparing delivery dates with duty rotas, one HCW was identified as a possible source of infection in five cases. After repeated pharyngeal swabs from this individual, an S. pyogenes emm75 was isolated. The five isolates from patients epidemiologically linked to the HCW and the two isolates of the family members had an identical sequence type (ST49) and 0–2 SNPs difference compared to the HCW isolate, whereas the sixth patient had an unrelated isolate. Eradication antibiotic therapy with clindamycin and rifampicin was given to the carrier. All patients received intravenous antibiotic treatment and recovered.
Conclusion
A three-month outbreak was stopped when a carrier was identified and treated. Source identification and WGS proved vital for outbreak control."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Surveillance systems for surgical site infections (SSIs), as a measure of patient safety, help health institutions devise strategies to reduce or prevent them. No surveillance systems exist to monitor SSIs in Ghana.
Aim
To establish a system for monitoring trends and detecting outbreaks in order to create awareness of and control SSIs.
Methods
An active 30-day surveillance was undertaken at the general surgical unit of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, from July 1st, 2017 to December 31st, 2018 to identify SSI. It involved a daily inpatient surveillance of patients who had had a surgical procedure, followed by post-discharge surveillance by means of a healthcare personnel-based survey and a patient-based telephone survey. We supplied quarterly feedback of results to surgeons.
Findings
Among the 3267 patients included, 331 were identified with an SSI, a 10% incidence risk. Patients who acquired an SSI experienced increased morbidity including nine extra days in hospital and an adjusted relative mortality risk of 2.3 (95% confidence interval: 1.3 - 4.1; P=0.006) compared to patients without SSI. Forty-nine per cent (161/331) of SSIs were diagnosed post discharge using the healthcare personnel-based survey. The patient-based telephone survey contributed 12 additional cases. SSI incidence risk decreased from 12.8% to 7.5% during the study period.
Conclusion
Post-discharge surveillance is feasible using existing healthcare personnel, and the results highlight the high risk and burden of SSIs in Ghana. A surveillance system with feedback for monitoring SSIs may contribute to reducing SSIs; however, firm conclusions regarding the impact need longer observation time."

Impact of isolation precautions on psychological wellbeing of patients has yet to be fully quantified. To assess the impact of isolation precautions on patients' health-related quality of life and depression or anxiety scales and estimate per day cost of anxiety and depression. Literature pertaining to impact of isolation precautions was searched on EMBASE and PubMed databases and Google Scholar. A two-step independent screening of the articles was performed. Articles that compared isolated and non-isolated patients using different quality of life and psychological burden scales were included. A meta-analysis was conducted using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS-A and HADS-D). Psychological burden measures from selected literature were presented in a graph as effect sizes. Per day cost of anxiety and depression was estimated using pooled mean difference from meta-analysis. Out of 106 articles, 94 were excluded due to inclusion criteria, leaving 12 for full text review. After review of full text of the articles, seven articles were shortlisted for empirical analysis and four out of these seven for meta-analysis. The pooled mean difference estimates for HADS-A was −1.4 (P=0.15) and that for HADS-D was −1.85 (P=0.09). In the empirical analysis of psychological burden scales, the effect in all studies except one was negative. Results from meta-analysis and empirical analysis of psychological burden implied that isolated patients are worse off in general. The implied estimated per day cost of anxiety and depression in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) is approximately US$10."

abstract = "SUMMARY
Background
methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bloodstream infection rates have risen steadily in recent years, with a marked decline in the corresponding rates due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Screening for MSSA carriage is not routinely undertaken and MRSA screening is not universal, thus the extent of S. aureus colonization pressure in nosocomial settings is unknown.
Methods
We conducted a prospective, observational study of patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) across nine inpatient wards in a tertiary referral hospital over a two-year period. Participants were screened for MSSA and MRSA using nasal swabs and oral rinses. Environmental surfaces and air were also tested for S. aureus using contact plates and active air sampling.
Findings
We enrolled 388 patients and 326 HCWs; and took 758 contact plate samples from surfaces and 428 air samples. MSSA was recovered from 24% of patients, 31.3% of HCWs, 16% of air samples and 7.9% of surface samples. MRSA was recovered from 6.4% of patients, 3.7% of HCWs, 2.5% of air samples and 2.2% of surface samples. Inclusion of the oral cavity in addition to the anterior nares in the sampling regimen identified 30 patients and 36 HCWs who exhibited exclusive oral colonization.
Conclusions
The oral cavity comprises a significant nosocomial reservoir for S. aureus that is currently under-appreciated. Oral screening should be considered both in terms of the colonization pressure in a healthcare facility, and on an individual patient level, especially in patients where decolonization attempts have repeatedly failed and in those undergoing high-risk procedures."

Background
Hand hygiene plays a crucial role in the prevention of healthcare-associated infections and transmission of pathogens. In 2008 the national campaign ‘Aktion Saubere Hände’ was launched in Germany. It is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) ‘Clean Care is Safer Care’ initiative. Direct observation and feedback of the results are key components in the improvement of hand hygiene compliance. In 2014 a voluntary national surveillance electronic tool for the documentation of directly observed compliance to hand hygiene was introduced.
Aim
Description and evaluation of compliance with the WHO model ‘my 5 moments’ in German hospitals after implementation.
Methods
Direct observation was performed in the participating hospitals by trained local staff according to the WHO recommendations. We evaluated wards that reported annually at least 150 hand hygiene opportunities (HHOs) of hand hygiene per observation period from January 1st, 2015 until December 31st, 2018.
Findings
In all, 1,485,622 HHOs observed on 3337 wards in 525 hospitals were included into analysis. Overall compliance increased from 72% (interquartile range: 61–82) to 76% (66–84). Compliance significantly increased for all individual moments of the WHO model except moment 2. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis the following parameters were independently associated with a high compliance in hand hygiene: intensive care unit, nurse, opportunity observed in 2017 or 2018, as well as all moments except moment 2.
Conclusion
Overall compliance in German hospitals increased over time. To improve HH compliance ‘before aseptic procedures’ appears to be difficult and should be addressed explicitly. Underlying reasons need to be the focus of future investigations."

abstract = "Summary
The role of antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) has expanded in health systems. ASP interventions often contain an educational component; however, current guidelines suggest that educational interventions should not be used alone but to support other stewardship interventions. Such interventions are most commonly directed towards prescribers (often general practice physicians) with few studies offering education towards other healthcare providers such as pharmacists, nurses, or even members of the stewardship team. Educational interventions are offered most frequently, but not exclusively, with concomitant stewardship interventions such as prospective audit and feedback. Such strategies appear to positively impact prescribing behaviours, but it is not possible to isolate the effect of education from other interventions. Common educational methods include one-time seminars and online e-learning modules, but unique strategies such as social media platforms, educational video games and problem-based learning modules have also been employed. Education directed towards patients often occurs in conjunction with education of local prescribers and wider community-based efforts to impact prescribing. Such studies evaluating patient education often include passive educational leaflets and focus most often on appropriate treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. Educational interventions appear to be an integral component of other interventions of ASPs; however, there is a paucity of evidence to support use as a stand-alone intervention outside of regional public health interventions. Future studies should focus on efficacy of educational interventions including providing education to non-prescribers and disease states beyond upper respiratory tract infections to demonstrate a broader role for education in ASP activities."

To synthesize existing data on the effectiveness of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) for N95 FFR decontamination.
Methods
Systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020176156) on UVGI in N95 FFRs using Embase, Medline, Global Health, Google Scholar, WHO feed, and MedRxiv. Two reviewers independently determined eligibility and extracted predefined variables. Original research reporting on function, decontamination, or mask fit following UVGI were included.
Findings and Conclusions
Thirteen studies were identified, comprising 54 UVGI intervention arms and 58 N95 models. FFRs consistently maintained certification standards following UVGI. Aerosol penetration averaged 1.19% (0.70-2.48%) and 1.14% (0.57-2.63%) for control and UVGI arms respectively. Airflow resistance for the control arms averaged 9.79 mm H2O (7.97-11.70 mm H2O) vs 9.85 mm H2O (8.33-11.44 mm H2O) for UVGI arms. UVGI protocols employing a cumulative dose >20,000 J/m2 resulted in a 2 log reduction in viral load. A >3 log reduction was observed in seven UVGI arms using >40,000 J/m2. Impact of UVGI on fit was evaluated in two studies (16,200; 32,400 J/m2) and did not find evidence of compromise. Our findings suggest that further work in this area (or translation to a clinical setting) should use a cumulative UV-C dose of 40,000 J/m2 or greater, and confirm appropriate mask fit following decontamination."

Background
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections in cardiac surgery patients, caused by Mycobacterium chimaera or Mycobacterium abscessus, have been traced to NTM-aerosols produced by heater–cooler units of cardiopulmonary bypass equipment.
Aim
To develop a protocol to disinfect the water reservoir(s) of heater–coolers to reduce NTM numbers and thereby prevent potential NTM aerosolization; and to devise an approach to disrupt surface biofilms of heater–coolers to reduce reinoculation of the heater–cooler reservoir(s) after disinfection.
Methods
A laboratory-scale Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bioreactor and a heater–cooler were inoculated with M. chimaera or M. abscessus to measure the ability of different disinfection protocols to reduce NTM colony-forming units in water and biofilm samples and to delay the reappearance of NTM after disinfection.
Findings
The combination of an enzyme detergent cleaning agent and Clorox® were equivalent to Clorox alone in reducing M. chimaera cfu in heater–cooler water reservoir samples. However, reappearance of those bacteria was delayed by 12 weeks by the combination of enzyme detergent cleaning agent and Clorox exposure compared to Clorox disinfection alone.

Background
Bloodstream infections (BSIs) in patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and economic costs. Many BSIs are associated with central venous catheters (CVCs). The Infection in Critical Care Quality Improvement Programme (ICCQIP) was established to initiate surveillance of BSIs in English ICUs.
Methods
A web-based data capture system was launched on 1st May 2016 to collect all positive blood cultures (PBCs), patient-days and CVC-days. National Health Service (NHS) trusts in England were invited to participate in the surveillance programme. Data were linked to the antimicrobial resistance dataset maintained by Public Health England and to mortality data.
Findings
Between 1st May 2016 and 30th April 2017, 84 ICUs (72 adult ICUs, seven paediatric ICUs and five neonatal ICUs) based in 57 of 147 NHS trusts provided data. In total, 1474 PBCs were reported, with coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium being the most commonly reported organisms. The rates of BSI and ICU-associated CVC-BSI were 5.7, 1.5 and 1.3 per 1000 bed-days and 2.3, 1.0 and 1.5 per 1000 ICU-CVC-days in adult, paediatric and neonatal ICUs, respectively. There was wide variation in BSI and CVC-BSI rates within ICU types, particularly in adult ICUs (0–44.0 per 1000 bed-days and 0–18.3 per 1000 ICU-CVC-days).
Conclusions
While the overall rates of ICU-associated CVC-BSIs were lower than 2.5 per 1000 ICU-CVC-days across all age ranges, large differences were observed between ICUs, highlighting the importance of a national standardized surveillance system to identify opportunities for improvement. Data linkage provided clinically important information on resistance patterns and patient outcomes at no extra cost to participating trusts."

Background
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) following cardiac surgery is a preventable complication associated with adverse outcomes.
Aims
We aimed to assess risk factors and outcomes of VAP following cardiac surgery.
Methods
A matched 1:3 case:control study, including adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery through sternotomy between September 2014 and March 2017 was conducted in a tertiary-care hospital in Israel. Cases included all patients developing VAP within 30 days after surgery, defined using consensus criteria. Controls were matched for age, gender and surgery type. Operative data were collected prospectively, other data were collected retrospectively. Cox regression was used for adjusted analysis of matched data.
Findings
Out of 946 operated patients, we identified 57 patients with VAP after cardiac surgery (17.7 episodes per 1000 ventilator-days) matched to 149 controls. Significant independent risk factors for VAP included congestive heart failure (odds ratio (OR) 2.357, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.052–5.281), chest re-exploration in the intensive care unit (OR 10.213, 95% CI 2.235–46.678), preoperative glucose levels (OR 1.1010 per 1 mg/dL increase 95% CI 1.004–1.019) intraoperative red blood cell transfusions (OR 1.542 per 1 unit, 95% CI 1.109–2.094) and pulmonary hypertension (OR 2.261, 95% CI 1.048–6.554). VAP was most commonly caused by Gram-negative pathogens. VAP was associated with higher mortality, longer length of stay, longer need for ventilator support and longer stay in ICU setting.
Conclusions
Postoperative VAP in cardiac surgery patients is associated with severe clinical outcomes. We identified risk factors that can aid in preventive measures implementation for high-risk patients."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Environmental surfaces are a potential vehicle for the transmission of norovirus outbreaks in closed and semi-closed settings. Testing of environmental samples may help control outbreaks.
Aim
To assess the level of environmental contamination by norovirus in acute gastroenteritis outbreaks in closed or semi-closed settings (nursing homes, schools, kindergartens, youth accommodations, hospitals and social health centres) in the Barcelona region between January 2017 and March 2019.
Methods
A prospective surveillance study was carried out. Environmental samples (529) were collected in 46 of the 50 outbreaks of acute norovirus gastroenteritis from environmental surfaces of common areas, bathrooms and kitchens in closed and semi-closed settings when the outbreak was notified and 10 days later. Instructions for taking environmental samples were distributed to public health inspectors. Norovirus was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
Findings
Environmental samples were positive for norovirus in 31 (67.4%) outbreaks. Norovirus was most frequently detected on elevator buttons (4/17, 24%), toilet handles (16/66, 24%) and handrail bars (7/34, 21%). Positive samples from the first sampling were mainly found in bathrooms and greater viral persistence in the second sampling was found on elevator buttons and TV remote controls. Nursing homes were the setting with the most types of environmental surfaces contaminated (82% in first samples and 55% in second samples).
Conclusion
The probability of virus detection is independent of the time between notification of the outbreak or symptom onset and sample collection. Our results suggest possible defects in cleaning protocols and disinfection in closed and semi-closed settings."

Introduction
Risk factors for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) acquisition/infection and associated clinical outcomes have been evaluated in the context of clonal, species-specific outbreaks. Equivalent analyses for complex, multi-species outbreaks, which are increasingly common, are lacking.
Methods
Between December 2010 and January 2017, a case–control study of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing organism (KPCO) acquisition was undertaken using electronic health records from inpatients in a US academic medical centre and long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) with ongoing multi-species KPCO transmission despite a robust CPE screening programme. Cases had a first KPCO-positive culture >48 h after admission, and included colonizations and infections (defined by clinical records). Controls had at least two negative perirectal screens and no positive cultures. Risk factors for KPCO acquisition, first infection following acquisition, and 14-day mortality following each episode of infection were identified using multi-variable logistic regression.
Results
In 303 cases (89 with at least one infection) and 5929 controls, risk factors for KPCO acquisition included: longer inpatient stay, transfusion, complex thoracic pathology, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and exposure to carbapenems and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors. Exposure to other KPCO-colonized patients was only a risk factor for acquisition in a single unit, suggesting that direct patient-to-patient transmission did not play a major role. There were 15 species of KPCO; 61 (20%) cases were colonized/infected with more than one species. Fourteen-day mortality following non-urinary KPCO infection was 20% (20/97 episodes) and was associated with failure to achieve source control.
Conclusions
Healthcare exposures, antimicrobials and invasive procedures increased the risk of KPCO colonization/infection, suggesting potential targets for infection control interventions in multi-species outbreaks. Evidence for patient-to-patient transmission was limited."

Background
Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is associated with high healthcare demands and related costs.
Aim
To evaluate the healthcare and economic burden of CDI in hospitalised patients with community- (HOCA-CDI) or hospital-associated CDI (HOHA-CDI) in the National Health Service in Scotland.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted, examining data between August 2010 and July 2013 from four patient-level Scottish datasets, linked to death data. Data examined included prior antimicrobial prescriptions in the community, hospitalisations, length of stay and mortality. Each CDI case was matched to three hospital-based controls on the basis of age, gender, hospital and date of admission. Descriptive economic evaluations were based on bed-day costs for different types of wards.
Findings
Overall, 3304 CDI cases were included in the study. CDI was associated with additional median lengths of stay of 7.2 days for HOCA-CDI and 12.0 days for HOHA-CDI compared with their respective, matched controls. The 30-day mortality rate was 6.8% for HOCA-CDI and 12.4% for HOHA-CDI. Overall, recurrence within 90 days of the first CDI episode occurred in 373/2740 (13.6%) survivors. The median additional expenditure for each initial CDI case compared with matched controls was £1713. In the 6 months after the index hospitalisation, the cost associated with a CDI case was £5126 higher than for controls.
Conclusion
Using routinely collected national data, we demonstrate the substantial burden of CDI on healthcare services, including lengthy hospital stays and readmissions, which increase the costs of managing patients with CDI compared with matched controls."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Norovirus (NoV) can survive in buffer at a range of pH values. However, when variations to pH are combined with the enzymatic conditions typical in gastric fluid, NoV survival is less predictable. Added to this, the material on which expelled vomitus fluid lands, e.g., safety vinyl or carpet, might also affect the level of NoV survival in the environment.
Aim
This study aimed to assess survival of the NoV surrogate feline calicivirus (FCV) after application on to four material types in the presence of synthetic gastric fluid of varying pH values.
Methods
Synthetic gastric fluid of varying pH values (1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5) containing FCV (1 × 106 plaque-forming units (pfu)/100 μL of gastric fluid) was seeded (100 μL) on to four material types: Formica, safety vinyl, cotton sheet and carpet tiles (2 cm × 2 cm) and left for 0, 30 and 60 min before recovering and identifying any viable viruses via plaque assay.
Findings
FCV survived in synthetic gastric fluid at pH values as low as 2.5 and in some cases as low as 1.5 for at least 30 min when associated with certain materials. Greater average numbers of viable virus were recovered from the more absorbent materials of cotton (1900 pfu/sample) and carpet (1600 pfu/sample) compared with Formica (360 pfu/sample) and safety vinyl (380 pfu/sample).
Conclusion
This study showed that FCV can survive in synthetic gastric fluids of low pH values for significant time periods especially on absorbent materials. This emphasises the importance of ensuring effective cleaning and decontamination procedures, particularly of soft furnishings and laundry, for infection prevention and control of NoV outbreaks."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Quality improvement (QI) methods are recommended to address healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) in hospitals, but whereas internal initiatives have been widely studied, there is little evidence on the application and effect of a QI approach from an external system-wide perspective.
Aim
To analyse the effect of a national system-wide QI initiative aimed at promoting HCAI prevention via regulatory interventions in Brazil.
Methods
A QI cycle approach designed and assessed with a before-and-after quasi-experimental design was implemented by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA), targeting 1869 hospitals. Eleven evidence-based quality indicators related to HCAI prevention and a composite measure were assembled, shared, and assessed; the intervention to improve was then based on participatory multifaceted regulatory actions. Absolute and relative improvements were estimated after the intervention.
Findings
In all, 563 hospitals (30.1% response) totalling 86,837 beds participated in the baseline assessment, and 681 hospitals (36.4% response) totalling 101,231 beds in the second. Ten of the 11 criteria improved (P < 0.05), as well as the composite indicator (P = 0.001) in all the regions of the country, particularly in the group of hospitals participating at baseline. ‘Hand hygiene (HH) infrastructure’ reached 100% (baseline: 97.9; P = 0.001), ‘HH protocol’ 96.9% (baseline: 92.9; P = 0.001), ‘HH monitoring’ 70% (baseline: 60.7; P < 0.001) and ‘existence of antimicrobial prescription protocol’ 80.7% (baseline: 73.2; P < 0.001), among others. The HCAI rates of the participating hospitals decreased after the intervention (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
The QI cycle approach was useful in guiding system-wide interventions for patient safety. External regulation was feasible and effective in promoting internal HCAI prevention nationwide."

Background
Staphylococcus epidermidis is a commensal of human skin flora and a frequent causative micro-organism in prosthetic joint infections (PJIs). To date, no single marker has been identified to distinguish infecting strains from commensal S. epidermidis populations.
Aim
To find possible genetic markers to distinguish between the two populations.
Methods
Fifty S. epidermidis strains from patients with PJIs were analysed, 50 from the skin of healthy individuals (commensal strains) and 17 from the surgical field of patients undergoing primary arthroplasty. In these three groups the antimicrobial susceptibility profile, sequence type, biofilm formation, and virulence factors were studied. Strains from the surgical field have not been compared previously with strains from the other two groups.
Findings
S. epidermidis strains from PJI patients were significantly more antibiotic resistant than commensal strains and surgical field strains. A wide variety of sequence types was found in commensal and surgical field strains. The predominant sequence type was ST2 and it was only present in PJI strains (44%). Differences in biofilm production did not differ between populations. Virulence genes sdrF and bhp, the complete ica operon, and the insertion sequence IS256 were significantly predominant in PJI strains. By contrast, embp and hld genes and the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) were more prevalent in commensal strains. Surgical field strains could be a valid control group to discriminate between infecting and commensal strains.
Conclusion
A combination of characteristic features can differentiate between infecting and commensal S. epidermidis strains in PJI, whereas a single marker cannot."

Background
Few studies have estimated the burden of infections due to antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) pathogens in China.
Aim
To summarize antimicrobial resistance and assess the frequency of community-associated infections (CAIs) and healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) due to AMR pathogens in Dongguan city, China.
Methods
Seven acute care hospitals provided antimicrobial susceptibility data for 2017, from which ‘bug–drug’ combinations were analysed. To calculate incidence proportions of CAI and incidence densities of HCAI, data from three tertiary care hospitals were merged with patient data, obtained from the Dongguan Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System.
Findings
A total of 16,548 pathogens were analysed. Non-susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was 43.9% and 30.2%, respectively. Non-susceptibility to carbapenems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii was 29.5% and 50.9%, respectively. A quarter of Staphylococcus aureus (26.3%) were non-susceptible to oxacillin. The incidence density of HCAI due to E. coli non-susceptible to 3GCs and fluoroquinolones combined was 0.09 (95% confidence interval: 0.07–0.11) per 1000 patient-days. Both E. coli and K. pneumoniae were the predominant pathogens isolated from blood. Compared with the 2017 European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network report, the incidence proportion of bloodstream infections due to multidrug-resistant E. coli was significantly higher (14.9% and 4.6%, respectively).
Conclusion
The incidence of non-susceptible bug–drug combinations in Dongguan city was lower compared with China as a whole. Non-susceptible bug–drug combinations were significantly more frequent in HCAI compared with CAI. The incidence proportion of bloodstream infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens in Dongguan City was higher compared with Europe."

This study aimed to describe the strength of recommendations of infection prevention and control guidelines published in the last 10 years. For this review, the websites of government and professional organizations for national and international infection prevention and control clinical guidelines were purposively searched. The search was limited to publications between January 2009 and April 2019, and those with a formal grading system were used to determine the strength of the evidence underpinning the recommendations. Recommendations from guidelines were categorized into 21 infection control categories. A descriptive synthesis of the data was undertaken. A total of 31 guidelines comprising 1855 recommendations were included. Guidelines were mainly developed in the USA (N = 11, 35.5%) and Canada (N = 9, 29.0%). Most guidelines used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (N = 6, 19.4%. The majority of the guidelines contained recommendations categorized under the themes of devices (N = 316, 16.9%) and transmission-based precautions (N = 315, 16.8%). Most recommendations (N = 769, 41.5%) were graded as using evidence from descriptive studies, expert opinion and low-quality evidence.

Background
Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective approach for refractory and recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Despite its excellent efficacy, FMT is not yet a routine procedure in most centres. There is very little experience with FMT based on lyophilized capsules, and data from European institutions are lacking. This article describes our experience with FMT to treat recurrent CDI using lyophilized oral capsules.
Methods
A prospectively recorded single-centre case series of patients with recurrent CDI who underwent FMT between January 2018 and May 2019 were analysed. The primary outcome was defined as resolution of CDI without recurrences over a two-month period. Overall resolution was defined as resolution of diarrhoea without recurrence of CDI within two months after a further cycle of FMT. The FMT process involved oral ingestion of four or five lyophilized capsules in a single dose. All stool donors were rigorously screened.
Findings
FMT was performed in 32 patients. Primary cure was achieved in 81.3% of patients, and the overall cure rate was 87.5%. FMT via lyophilized capsules was well tolerated. No FMT procedure-related adverse events and no further complications were observed for lyophilized-capsule FMT.
Conclusions
This initial clinical experience suggests that FMT based on oral lyophilized preparations is a safe, well-tolerated, and highly effective treatment for recurrent CDI. Administration of oral lyophilized capsules seems feasible in hospital routine and will enable FMT to be more widely used."

In order to protect healthcare staff adequately it is necessary that we establish whether aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) increase the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Where we do not have evidence relating to SARS-CoV-2, guidelines for safely conducting these procedures should consider the risk of transmitting related pathogens. Currently there is very little evidence detailing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 associated with any specific procedures. Regarding AGPs and respiratory pathogens in general, there is still a large knowledge gap that will leave clinicians unsure of the risk to themselves when offering these procedures.

Background
Little is known on the economic burden of healthcare-associated infection (HAI) in Brazil.
Aim
To analyze the costs of hospitalization by reimbursement from the Brazilian government, via the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) affiliation, and direct costs in the adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
Methods
The matched-pairs case-control study (83 patients with HAI and 83 without HAI) was performed at a referral tertiary-care teaching hospital in Brazil in January 2018. In order to calculate the HAI costs from the perspective of the payer, the total cost for each hospitalization was obtained through the Hospital's Billing Sector. Direct costs were calculated by an annual for 949 critical patients during 2018.
Findings
The reimbursement cost per hospitalization of patients with HAI was 75% (US$2721) higher than patients without HAI (US$1553). When a patient has a HAI, in addition to a longer length of stay (15 days), there was an extra increase (US$996) in the reimbursement cost per hospitalization. An HAI in the ICU was associated with a total direct cost eight times higher compared to patients who did not develop infections in this unit, US$11776 x US$1329, respectively. The direct cost of hospitalization in the ICU without HAI is 56.5% less than the reimbursement (US$1329 x US$3052, respectively), whereas for the patient with HAI, the direct cost was 111.5% above the reimbursement (US$11776 x US$5569, respectively).
Conclusion
HAIs contribute to a longer stay and an 8-fold increase in direct costs. It is necessary to reinforce programmes that prevent HAIs in Brazilian hospitals."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) result in increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. HAI rates in Greek NICUs are among the highest in Europe. There is a need to identify the factors that influence the transmission of HAIs and implementation of prevention interventions in this setting.
Aim
To understand healthcare workers' perceptions about HAI prevention in Greek NICUs.
Methods
Qualitative interviews were conducted with NICU staff (physicians and nurses) and infection prevention stakeholders (infectious diseases physicians and infection control nurses) working in three hospitals in Athens. Interviews were conducted in Greek, transcribed and translated into English, and analysed using a modified grounded theory approach.
Findings
Interviews were conducted with 37 respondents (20 physicians and 17 nurses). Four main barriers to HAI prevention were identified: (1) resource limitations leading to understaffing and cramped space; (2) poor knowledge about HAI prevention; (3) Greek-specific cultural norms, including hierarchy-driven decisions, a reluctance for public workers to do more than they are paid for, a belief that personal experience trumps evidence-based knowledge, and reactive rather than proactive approaches to societal challenges; and (4) lack of a national infection prevention infrastructure. Respondents believed that these barriers could be overcome through organized initiatives, high-quality HAI performance data, interpersonal interactions to build engagement around HAI prevention, and leveraging the hierarchy to promote change from the ‘top down’.
Conclusion
Implementing HAI prevention interventions in Greek NICUs will require consideration of contextual features surrounding the delivery of care, with particular attention paid to national culture."

Background
The feasibility of introducing three separate Cepheid GeneXpert® assays was assessed: Xpert SA Nasal Complete, Xpert C. difficile, and Xpert Norovirus for point-of-care testing (POCT) on a ward in a district general hospital.
Aim
To establish a seven-day/24 h POCT service for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridioides difficile, and norovirus operated solely by healthcare workers (HCWs).
Methods
The Cepheid GeneXpert assays performance characteristics were assessed by comparing the assays to traditional central laboratory methods in terms of clinical turnaround times, hands-on time, number of process steps, time to result and diagnostic accuracy. HCW feedback was collected to consider the potential added value of applying this technology to improve patient flow and clinical care.
Findings
In total 1170 tests were carried out over the 16-month study period. The assays significantly reduced hands-on time, process steps, and time to result for identification of all three micro-organisms. Overall agreement with central laboratory testing was >98% for all three assays. Staff members fed back that POCT had a positive impact in terms of clinical utility.
Conclusion
Xpert SA Nasal Complete for MRSA detection, Xpert C. difficile, and Xpert Norovirus can be used as POCT solely by HCWs in a ward setting. Each assay was used throughout a seven-day/24 h period with potential positive impact on bed management and patient care."

Background
Preprescription authorization (PPA) and postprescription review with feedback (PPRF) were successively implemented in 2012 and 2016 in our 1500-bed hospital.
Aim
The impact of PPA and PPRF on carbapenems use and resistance levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed in three intensive care units (ICUs).
Methods
Carbapenems use (in DDDs/1000 occupied bed-days) and resistance of P. aeruginosa (percentage of non-susceptible (I+R) isolates to imipenem and/or meropenem) were analysed using a controlled interrupted time-series method. Two periods were compared: 2012–2015 (PPA) and 2016–2017 (PPA+PPRF). Models were adjusted on the annual incidence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriacae.
Findings
Carbapenem use was stable over the PPA period in all ICUs, with a significant change of slope over the PPA+PPRF period only in ICU1 (β2 = -12.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -19.5 to -6.1). There was a switch from imipenem to meropenem during the PPA period in all three units. Resistances of P. aeruginosa were stable over the study period in ICU1 and ICU2, and significantly decreased over the PPA+PPRF period in ICU3 (β2 = -0.18, CI = -0.3 to -0.03).
Conclusion
In real-life conditions and with the same antimicrobial stewardship programme (AMSP) led by a single team, the impact of PPRF was heterogeneous between ICUs. Factors driving the impact of AMSPs should be further assessed in comparable settings through real-life data, to target where they could prove cost-effective."

Recently, molecular assays have been demonstrated to be reliable for rapid detection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) directly from positive blood cultures, reducing significantly the time for identification. Few studies have tested their performance on rectal swabs and no comprehensive conclusions have been reached regarding their utility for infection control management. Our aim was to review and assess the overall diagnostic test accuracy of polymerase chain reaction for the detection of CPE in rectal swabs. The electronic database PubMed was searched, up to October 1st, 2019, without language restriction or publication date restrictions. First, the concepts of the research questions were defined: ‘carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae’, ‘molecular testing’, ‘test detection’, and ‘rectal screening’. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed quality using the QUADAS-2 instrument. Statistical analyses were carried out in Stata software using the bivariate model. In all, 143 articles were screened and 16 studies were included. Five (31%) of the studies were conducted in the context of a CPE outbreak; one study (6%) included patients pre-identified with CPE in clinical samples (blood or tracheal secretions), whereas the rest (63%) collected rectal swabs from patients considered at high risk of colonization. The molecular assays evaluated had a relatively good sensitivity of 0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.902–0.989), and an excellent specificity of 0.994 (95% CI: 0.965–1). Molecular techniques seem to be a useful, accurate diagnostic tool in screening for carriage of CPE in contact patients around a fortuitous discovery of a non-isolated hospitalized carrier patient."

Background
Active warming during surgery prevents perioperative hypothermia but the effectiveness and postoperative infection rates may differ between warming technologies.
Aim
To establish the recruitment and data management strategies needed for a full trial comparing postoperative infection rates associated with forced air warming (FAW) versus resistive fabric warming (RFW) in patients aged >65 years undergoing hemiarthroplasty following fractured neck of femur.
Methods
Participants were randomized 1:1 in permuted blocks to FAW or RFW. Hypothermia was defined as a temperature of <36°C at the end of surgery. Primary outcomes were the number of participants recruited and the number with definitive deep surgical site infections.
Findings
A total of 515 participants were randomized at six sites over a period of 18 months. Follow-up was completed for 70.1%. Thirty-seven participants were hypothermic (7.5% in the FAW group; 9.7% in the RFW group). The mean temperatures before anaesthesia and at the end of surgery were similar. For the primary clinical outcome, there were four deep surgical site infections in the FAW group and three in the RFW group. All participants who developed a postoperative infection had antibiotic prophylaxis, a cemented prosthesis, and were operated under laminar airflow; none was hypothermic. There were no serious adverse events related to warming.
Conclusion
Surgical site infections were identified in both groups. Progression from the pilot to the full trial is possible but will need to take account of the high attrition rate."

Background
Infection control strategies are implemented in all neonatal intensive care units (NICUs); however, the details of the strategies seem to differ among institutions. The purpose of this survey was to investigate the current implementation status of infection control strategies in NICUs in Japan and to identify and recommend appropriate strategies for the prevention of outbreaks in neonatal units.
Methods
This survey documented the current implementation status and methods of selected infection prevention and control measures (active surveillance cultures and standard precaution) in 453 Japanese NICUs/neonatal units registered with the Japan Society of Perinatal and Neonatal Medicine, using questionnaires, in May 2018.
Findings
The response rate was 48.1% (level I institutions, 25.5%; level II, 55.9%; level III, 64.2%). Surveillance cultures were performed every week and targeted all bacteria in most units. The proportion of level III institutions that experienced outbreaks over the previous five years was significantly higher than that of level II institutions (55% vs 27%, P=0.0003). However, wearing a mask was less frequently recommended in level III institutions (55.7%) than in level II institutions (67.9%). Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was the most frequently reported bacterial pathogen responsible for NICU outbreaks.
Conclusion
Infection prevention and control practices regarding active pathogen surveillance cultures and the use of barrier precautions varied widely in Japanese neonatal units. National guidelines and evidence-based recommendations are needed to rationalize and standardize current infection prevention and control practices in neonatal units in Japan."

Preventing vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infection is a healthcare priority. However, the cost-effectiveness of VRE control interventions is unclear. The aim of this study was to synthesize evidence on economic evaluation of VRE control practices such as screening, contact precautions, patient cohorting, and others. The literature was searched from January 1985 to June 2018, and included economic evaluations of VRE control practices in hospital settings, published in English. A total of 4711 articles were screened; nine primary studies met our criteria. All studies evaluated some form of VRE screening and contact precautions, in populations ranging from single hospital wards (or select patient groups) to multiple healthcare facilities. There was significant variability in the interventions and comparisons used. Most studies (N = 7) conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis; two studies were cost-consequence studies. All economic evaluations were from the hospital perspective. Four studies found implementing enhanced VRE-specific control practices to be cost-effective/cost-saving and two studies found that discontinuing VRE-specific control practices was not cost-effective. Three studies found decreasing VRE-specific control practices to be cost-effective/cost-saving. The quality of the included studies was generally low according to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for economic evaluations; major limitations included risks of bias in intervention effect estimates, and a lack of sensitivity analyses. Most studies show that some form of VRE screening and use of Contact Precautions is cost-effective. The low study quality and heterogeneity of interventions and comparators precludes definitive conclusions about the cost effectiveness of specific VRE control interventions. Additional high-quality economic evaluations are needed to strengthen the available evidence."

abstract = "Summary
Background
There has been an increase in the number of carbapenemase-producing organisms documented across the UK over the past 10 years. From these, the ‘big five’ carbapenemases (KPC, OXA-48, IMP, VIM, and NDM) are the most common types reported in the order Enterobacterales, identified from a variety of reactive screening, outbreak, inpatient surveillance, and diagnostic samples.
Aim
To perform a point prevalence study to determine the inpatient carriage rate of carbapenemase-producing organisms at Barts Health NHS Trust, which encompasses 2.5 million patients across four London boroughs: Tower Hamlets, Newham, Redbridge, and Waltham Forest.
Methods
Rectal swabs were collected from consenting inpatients, alongside details of the ward's medical specialty, patient's country of birth, history of foreign travel, length of hospitalization, and history of prior hospitalization. Swabs were enriched and subcultured on to mSuperCARBA selective medium. All Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas species were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy and underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing by disc diffusion, according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines. All isolates were screened for the ‘big five’ carbapenemases using a modified version of a published reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction assay.
Findings
Of the 977 inpatients tested, 35 CPOs were isolated from 30 patients. NDM was the most frequently detected carbapenemase, followed by OXA-48, with an overall prevalence of 3.1%. Organisms isolated included Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli. Renal and elderly care patients had the highest prevalences of CPOs, whereas the intensive care unit prevalence was low. Statistical analysis found that hospitalization abroad, any previous hospitalization, foreign travel and, specifically, travel to India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh were associated with increased risk of CPO carriage.
Conclusion
The overall prevalence of CPOs at Barts Health Trust was 3.1%, comprising NDM and OXA-48-type carbapenemases, which is in line with other London-based studies. Renal patients and the elderly had the highest burden of CPOs, whereas previous hospitalization and foreign travel were associated with an increased risk of CPO carriage."

Background
Pathogens involved in healthcare-associated infections can quickly spread in the environment, particularly to frequently touched surfaces, which can be reservoirs for pathogens.
Aim
The purpose of this study was to investigate naturally occurring bacterial contamination on touch surfaces in five French long-term care facilities and to compare bacterial populations recovered from copper and control surfaces.
Methods
More than 1300 surfaces were sampled. The collected bacteria were identified to obtain a global view of the cultivable bacterial populations colonizing touch surfaces. Haemolytic colonies and putative pathogens were also screened using specific agar plates and then identified with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. In total, more than 3400 colonies were analysed.
Findings
Staphylococcus and Micrococcus were the two predominant genera present on touch surfaces, respectively occurring on 51.8% and 48.0% of control surfaces. In these facilities with relatively low bioburden, copper surfaces efficiently reduced the occurrence frequencies of three genera: Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Roseomonas. Pathogenic species such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium were observed in very few samples. In addition, meticillin-resistant S. aureus was observed on five control surfaces and one copper surface.
Conclusion
Contamination of healthcare facilities touch surfaces can be the source for the spread of bacteria through the institution. This in situ study shows that the frequency of the contamination as well as the specific bacterial population bioburden is reduced on copper alloy surfaces."

Background
Immobile inpatients have a high risk of urinary tract infection (UTI). Additional epidemiological data regarding UTIs among immobile inpatients are needed.
Aim
To investigate the prevalence and incidence of, and risk factors for, UTIs among immobile patients in 25 hospitals throughout China.
Methods
This was a national multi-centre cross-sectional investigation. We recruited six tertiary hospitals, 12 non-tertiary hospitals, and seven community hospitals. We obtained data regarding demographics, clinically related variables, and UTI-specific variables from immobile patients during their hospitalization. We performed univariate and multivariable analyses, and binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors.
Findings
Among 23,985 immobile patients, 393 had a UTI. The prevalence and incidence of UTIs in hospitalized immobile patients was 1.64% (393/23 985) and 0.69 per 1000 patient-days, respectively. The infection rate of catheter-associated UTI was 2.25 per 1000 urinary catheter-days. We found that a greater number of bedridden days, longer length of hospital stay, being in a medical ward, the presence of an indwelling urethral catheter, prolonged duration of an indwelling catheter, use of glucocorticoids, female sex, diabetes mellitus, and older age were independent risk factors of UTI.
Conclusion
Immobile patients had similar risk factors for UTI as the general population, as well as some additional risk factors. Greater attention is needed in the management of UTIs among the population of immobile hospitalized patients."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Cleaning high-touch surfaces serves as a crucial step towards controlling the transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens in hospital environments. The process can be made most effective if scientifically monitored using a simple, feasible and reliable technique, especially in resource-poor settings.
Aim
To identify a novel florescent marker (FM) comparable to the already existing commercial FM systems and to assess its efficacy in evaluating cleaning of high-touch surfaces in a hospital environment.
Methods
A liquid detergent used for washing purposes was identified as a novel FM. Pre- and post-cleaning sampling were performed from 250 high-touch surfaces in different patient-care areas using this marker and aerobic colony counts. Concordance between the two methods was assessed and compared by Cohen's kappa coefficient. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values for the new FM method were calculated against the microbiological method.
Findings
A good correlation (κ = 0.60) with overall concordance of 79.6% was observed between the two methods. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the FM were 79.58% (95% confidence interval (CI): 72–85.85%), 79.63% (95% CI: 70.79–86.78), 83.70% (95% CI: 76.38–89.50) and 74.78% (95% CI: 65.83–82.38), respectively.
Conclusions
The FM used in the present study proved to be a simple and cost-effective alternative to commercially available FMs for assessing environmental cleaning practices on a daily basis in resource-poor settings. Additional studies making direct comparisons of the FM used here with the established FMs are warranted before it can be generalized for use."

Background
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is commonly associated with haematologic malignancies but also occurs with solid tumours.
Aim
To compare the diagnostic approaches and therapeutic outcomes for IPA between patients with haematologic malignancies and solid cancers.
Methods
A retrospective study was conducted evaluating consecutive cases of proven and probable IPA from 2004 to 2016. Patients >18 years of age with an underlying solid tumour, haematologic malignancy, or haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) within one year of IPA diagnosis were included.
Findings
Of the 311 patients analysed, 225 had haematologic malignancies and 86 had solid tumours. Patients with solid tumours were more likely to have had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other pulmonary diseases, have Aspergillus fumigatus infections, and have received radiotherapy before IPA occurrence than were those with haematologic malignancies (all P<0.01). Antifungal monotherapy and voriconazole-based therapy were more often prescribed in the solid group (87% vs 56%, P<0.0001, and 77% vs 53%, P=0.0002, respectively). The median duration of primary antifungal therapy was longer in the solid group (64 days vs 20 days, P<0.0001). Complete or partial response to antifungal therapy was recorded in 66% of the solid group and 40% of the haematologic group (P=0.0001). At 12 weeks, overall mortality was similar in both groups, but IPA-attributable mortality was higher in the haematologic group (30% vs 18%, P=0.04).
Conclusions
Monotherapy was more often prescribed in patients with solid tumours than in patients with haematologic malignancies. Patients with solid tumours had better antifungal therapy response and lower 12-week IPA-attributable mortality than did those with haematologic malignancies."

Objective
To determine the prevalence and genotypic characteristics of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBLE) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) in nursing homes (NHs) in a French region. Risk factors associated with their carriage were also investigated.
Methods
A point-prevalence survey was proposed from November 2017 to June 2018 to NHs in the study region. Volunteer residents were screened for ESBLE and CPE carriage. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were genotyped using multi-locus sequence typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and phylogrouping (for E. coli alone). Collective and individual data were analysed by random-effects logistic regression.
Results
The study was conducted in 18 NHs and included 262 patients. Fifty-two patients (19.8%) carried at least one ESBLE, corresponding to 56 isolates (42 E. coli, 11 K. pneumoniae and three others), while no CPE was detected. The majority (27/42) of ESBL E. coli belonged to phylogroup B2, and ST131 was over-represented in this subset (21/27). PFGE analysis revealed ST131 cross-transmission within NHs. Regarding ESBL K. pneumoniae, nine of 11 isolates belonged to ST663, and PFGE suggested diffusion of the clone in six NHs. Significant individual risk factors for colonization by ESBLE were: use of a shared bathroom, previous antibiotic use and recent history of hospitalization. Significant collective protective factors were proper compliance with glove use and support of the NH by a healthcare facility.
Conclusion
This study shows that NHs in the study region are an important reservoir of ESBLE, whereas no residents were CPE carriers. The control of ESBLE in NHs should focus on antibiotic stewardship and excreta management policies."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Although population characteristics and antimicrobial prescribing practices suggest that the hospitalized population in Japan is at high risk of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), the epidemiology of CDI in Japan is poorly understood.
Aim
This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of CDI at 12 hospitals in Japan.
Methods
Patients with clinically significant diarrhoea (CSD) were enrolled. Stool specimens were tested for C. difficile by toxin A and/or B enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in the hospital laboratories, and a toxigenic culture and nucleic acid amplification tests were performed at a central laboratory. The risk factors of CDI and the impact of CDI on mortality were investigated.
Findings
In total, 566 patients with CSD were included in the analyses. A total of 152 patients received the diagnosis of CDI by Toxin A/B EIA, toxigenic culture, or nucleic acid amplification test. Factors associated with CDI included low albumin (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–2.34) and length of hospital stay before stool collection >18 days (aOR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.09–2.75). CDI was associated with an increased mortality on univariate analysis (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0–2.6) but was not associated with an increased risk of mortality on multivariable analysis.
Conclusion
Risk factors for CDI in Japan were similar to those identified in the USA and Europe. However, CDI was not associated with an increased risk of mortality in this population of patients with CSD."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) the rate of surgical site infections (SSI) is high, leading to negative patient outcomes and excess healthcare costs. A causal relationship between airborne bacteria in the operating room and SSI has not been established, at a molecular or genetic level. We studied the relationship between intraoperative airborne bacteria and bacteria causing SSI in an LMIC.
Methods
Active air sampling using a portable impactor was performed during clean or clean-contaminated elective surgical procedures. Active patient follow-up consisting of phone calls and clinical examinations was performed 3, 14 and 30 days after surgery. Bacterial isolates recovered from SSI and air samples were compared by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) identification, ribotyping, whole genome sequencing (WGS), and metagenomic analysis.
Results
Of 128 included patients, 116 (91%) completed follow-up and 11 (9%) developed SSI. Known pathogenic bacteria were isolated from intraoperative air samples in all cases with SSI. A match between air and SSI isolates was found by MALDI-TOF in eight cases. Matching ribotypes were found in six cases and in one case both WGS and metagenomic analysis showed identity between air- and SSI-isolates.
Conclusion
The study showed high levels of intraoperative airborne bacteria, an SSI-rate of 9% and a genetic link between intraoperative airborne bacteria and bacteria isolated from SSIs. This indicates the need for awareness of intraoperative air quality in LMICs."

Background
Linezolid (LZD)-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (LRSE) are increasing, and are mainly associated with outbreaks in hospital wards with high LZD consumption.
Aim
To investigate the frequency of LRSE in a tertiary hospital in the context of LZD use.
Methods
The frequency of LRSE and the data on LZD usage [expressed as defined daily dose (DDD) per 100 patient-days], from 2011 to 2017, were analysed retrospectively. Selected LRSE were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and screened for transferable LZD resistance genes. Representative isolates were typed by multi-locus sequence typing, and ribosomal mechanisms of LZD resistance were investigated.
Findings
In total, 435 LRSE were detected, with frequencies ranging from 13.56% to 32.93% in the intensive care unit (ICU) where LZD consumption was high (6.34–8.10 DDDs), and from 2.48 to 6.80% in the remaining wards where LZD use was considerably lower (0.63–2.49 DDDs). The first 44 LRSE isolates recovered (June 2013–June 2014) were closely related according to PFGE patterns, and all except one were resistant to meticillin due to mecA production. Selected isolates belonged to ST2, carried SCCmec III, and had the G2576T mutation in the V domain of each of the six copies of the 23S rRNA gene. Five of the 44 isolates (11.36%) were positive for the cfr gene.
Conclusion
An ST2 LZD- and meticillin-resistant clone was found in the ICU and also in wards with low consumption of LZD. This highlights the need to implement and maintain infection control measures as well as antimicrobial stewardship programmes in all hospital units in order to preserve the efficacy of LZD."

abstract = "Summary
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) caused by multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDRGNB) have increased prevalence in intensive care units (ICUs). A common strategy to prevent HAIs is bathing patients with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG). However, the effectiveness of CHG bathing against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) is still controversial. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of CHG bathing on Acinetobacter baumannii colonization and infection in the ICU setting. A systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CINAHL was performed from inception through to June 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), pre-post studies, or interrupted time series (ITS) studies were included. The numbers of patients with/without colonization or infection of A. baumannii in the experimental or control groups were extracted from each study. Quality assessment was performed by the related instruments of National Institute of Health. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) were calculated using the random-effects model. One RCT and 12 pre-post or ITS studies comprising 18,217 patients were included, of which 8069 were in the CHG bathing arm and 9051 in the control arm. CHG bathing was associated with a reduced colonization of A. baumannii (RR, 0.66; 95% confidence interval: 0.57–0.77; P<0.001). Chlorhexidine at 4% showed a better effect than 2% chlorhexidine (meta-regression P=0.044). CHG bathing was associated with a non-significant reduction of infection (pooled RR 0.41, 95% CI: 0.13–1.25). This study suggests that CHG bathing significantly reduces colonization of A. baumannii in the ICU setting. However, more trials are needed to confirm whether CHG bathing can reduce infections with A. baumannii."

Background
Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains one of the most common nosocomial pathogens in intensive care units (ICUs). Although exogenous acquisition has been widely documented in outbreaks, its importance is unclear in non-epidemic situations.
Aim
To elucidate the role of exogenous origin of P. aeruginosa in ICU patients.
Methods
A chronological analysis of the acquisition of P. aeruginosa was performed using samples collected in 2009 in the DYNAPYO cohort study, during which patients and tap water were screened weekly. Molecular relatedness of P. aeruginosa isolates was investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Exogenous acquisition was defined as identification of a P. aeruginosa pulsotype previously isolated from another patient or tap water in the ICU.
Findings
The DYNAPYO cohort included 1808 patients (10,402 samples) and 233 water taps (4946 samples). Typing of 1515 isolates from 373 patients and 375 isolates from 81 tap water samples identified 296 pulsotypes. Analysis showed exogenous acquisition in 170 (45.6%) of 373 patients. The pulsotype identified had previously been isolated from another patient and from a tap water sample for 86 and 29 patients, respectively. The results differed according to the ICU.
Conclusion
Exogenous acquisition of P. aeruginosa could be prevented in half of patients. The overall findings of this survey support the need for studies on routes of transmission and risk assessment approach to better define how to control exogenous acquisition in ICUs."

abstract = "Summary
Background
There are few published reports of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infection outbreaks. In 2017–2018, British Columbia Children's Hospital (BCCH) experienced an increase in CSF shunt infections co-incident with a move to new operating rooms and a change in shunt catheters used.
Aims
To describe how an outbreak was detected, investigations were undertaken to determine the cause, risk factors associated with CSF shunt infection during the outbreak, and changes implemented to attempt to control the outbreak.
Methods
Retrospective case–control study. Population included patients who underwent new shunt insertion or revision. Univariate logistic regression models were fitted for each of the variables. Associations with P-values <0.2 were considered of potential interest for further investigation.
Findings
There were six cases of CSF shunt infection and 19 controls. The causative organism was different in each case. The only risk factors that met the criteria for further investigation were being a neonate at the time of surgery [odds ratio (OR) 9.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7–125.3, P=0.10] and the presence of gastrointestinal disease (OR 3.8, 95% CI 0.5–26.2, P=0.18). No association was found with the operating room used or the surgical staff. In response to the outbreak, human traffic through the operating rooms was limited, rigid adherence to the wearing of surgical masks was enforced, and return to the previous CSF shunt catheters used was implemented.
Conclusion
No modifiable risk factors were associated with CSF shunt infection. After implementation of surgical protocol changes, no further cases of CSF shunt infection linked to the outbreak were identified."

Background
Isolation of patients colonized or infected by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is an established infection-control measure taken in Norway. Local reliable data on the costs of this isolation are needed.
Methods
A micro-costing study from a healthcare perspective was conducted on infectious disease wards in three general acute hospitals, utilising direct observation, staff registration, interviews and survey data.
Findings
The daily additional cost of isolation was €56.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 42.4–72.7) for non-bedridden patients and €87.5 (95% CI 48.3–129.6) for bedridden patients. Of these sums, labour costs accounted for the largest share (71–72%), followed by the costs of personal protective equipment (21–23%) and waste management (6–8%). Overall, isolation-specific workload amounted to 65 min/day for non-bedridden patients and 95 min/day for bedridden patients, predominantly in the form of extra time used by nurses. Higher isolation costs for bedridden patients were largely attributable to resources used for personal hygiene practices. One-time isolation costs incurred for room cleaning after patient discharge averaged at €14.0 (95% CI 10.7–17.6).
Conclusions
Our study provides novel, detailed evidence on resource use attributable to patient isolation in hospitals that can be used to inform future assessments directed toward precautionary hygienic measures. Our results suggest that allocating additional nurse staffing to wards with large numbers of isolated patients should be considered."

Acinetobacter baumannii infections have become an emerging health concern in hospitals across the world and are often associated with nosocomial infections with poorer clinical outcomes in patients with prolonged hospital stay. Management of infections involves prompt identification of the infecting strain, isolating the source of infection, and proper choice of antibiotic regimen. However, resistance to first-line antimicrobial drugs, combined with a lack of equally effective alternatives, complicates the treatment of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. Presently, multidrug-resistant A. baumannii is a serious health concern in hospitals and long-term care facilities and requires immediate and sustained prevention efforts to control the rate of incidence. This review describes trends in epidemiology, genetic markers, and other factors that influence the incidence of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. Current and emerging treatments as well as infection control strategies are discussed."

Background
Surgical site infections (SSIs) are associated with morbidity, mortality and costs.
Aim
To identify the burden of (deep) SSIs in costs and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) following colectomy, mastectomy and total hip arthroplasty (THA) in the Netherlands.
Methods
A retrospective cost-analysis was performed using 2011 data from the national SSI surveillance network PREZIES. Sixty-two patients with an SSI (exposed) were matched to 122 patients without an SSI (unexposed, same type of surgery). Patient records were studied until 1 year after SSI diagnosis. Unexposed patients were followed for the same duration. Costs were calculated from the hospital perspective (2016 price level), and cost differences were tested using linear regression analyses. Disease burden was estimated using the Burden of Communicable Disease in Europe Toolkit of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The SSI model was specified by type of surgery, with country- and surgery-specific parameters where possible.
Findings
Attributable costs per SSI were €21,569 (THA), €14,084 (colectomy) and €1881 (mastectomy), mainly caused by prolonged length of hospital stay. National hospital costs were estimated at €10 million, €29 million and €0.6 million, respectively. National disease burden was greatest for SSIs following colectomy (3200 DALYs/year, 150 DALYs/100 SSIs), while individual disease burden was highest following THA (1200 DALYs/year, 250 DALYs/100 SSIs). For mastectomy, these DALYs were <1. The total cost of DALYs for the three types of surgery exceeded €88 million.
Conclusion
Depending on the type of surgery, SSIs cause a significant burden, both economically and in loss of years in full health. This underlines the importance of appropriate infection prevention and control measures."

abstract = "Summary
Introduction
In India, due to manpower constraints, patients' family members are often actively involved in healthcare activities of their near and dear ones. They have significant contact with the patient at all World Health Organization (WHO) ‘five moments for hand hygiene’. This study analysed the impact of decade-long awareness campaigns on the hand hygiene compliance (HHC) by our patients' carers.
Methods
Trained infection control nurses observed the HHC at each of the five moments for patients' attendants in different hospital settings from January 2014 to December 2018. Compliance was calculated as percentage of events divided by total opportunities.
Findings
A total of 7302 opportunities were observed with an overall compliance of 46.1% (35.5% in 2014 to 48.2% in 2018, P < 0.0001). Compliance at WHO moments 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 was 51.0%, 47.4%, 67.6%, 48.8%, and 24.3% respectively. Among family members, mothers of newborns had a much higher HHC (77%) than others (44.5%) (P < 0.0001). Also, the compliance was higher in medical versus surgical wards and in paediatric wards versus adult wards (P < 0.0001 in both).
Conclusion
This is the first study on family members' HHC in a hospital setting in a low- and middle-income country. The study shows that family members, once trained, exhibit fairly good HHC while caring for their patients, especially mothers of newborns. It is worthwhile empowering and educating patient attendants about the importance and process of hand hygiene as it is likely to result in immense benefit for patients."

Background
Alcoholic povidone-iodine (API) used as skin disinfection reduces the risk of postoperative infection but there is no evidence for its use on mucous membranes. We therefore conducted a tolerance study on the glans of men operated in urology.
Aim
To confirm the safety of using API on mucous membranes.
Methods
The impact of applying API on the glans mucosa was measured using a chromameter. Caucasian men, without any dermatological lesion of the glans, operated by endoscopic transurethral route, were included. Measurements (L*a*b*) were made preoperatively and postoperatively by an independent person. Parameters were compared using the recognized formula ΔE = √(ΔL2 + Δa2 + Δb2).
Findings
Ninety-six patients, average age 68.9 ± 10.4 years, were included. For L*, the mean pre- and postoperative difference was +2.36 (P = 0.168). For a* and b*, the mean pre- and postoperative differences were +0.13 (P = 0.9085) and –0.12 (P = 0.17089), respectively. ΔE was equal to 13.92 ± 17.49 (non-significant difference).

Background
Though nurses have frequent contact with patients, their personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance rate is low, which poses a significant challenge in infection control.
Aim
To investigate the relative influence of specific factors on PPE compliance.
Methods
A sequential two-stage mixed-methods design was applied. In a qualitative study, semi-structured interviews were conducted from May to July 2018. In a quantitative study, a nationwide, cross-sectional survey was conducted from January to March 2019, in which a questionnaire was mailed to 735 nurses in 28 tertiary care hospitals in Japan.
Findings
In the quantitative study, 435 (59.2%) analysable responses were obtained. In the linear regression analysis, the lack of the knowledge that ‘standard precaution was the fundamental infection countermeasure applied when patients had signs of infections, and these countermeasures could be terminated if there was no infection found’ was significantly associated with decreased PPE adherence, whereas an antimicrobial-resistant bacteria outbreak or a ward shutdown due to an outbreak and the belief ‘I must never be the cause of spreading infection’ were significantly associated with increased PPE adherence. The β of standard coefficients and t-values of the items were –0.344, –7.784, 0.090, 2.089, 0.088, 2.018, respectively.
Conclusion
This survey systematically identified nursing-associated factors that contribute to PPE compliance. As a practical approach to ensure positive outcomes, we suggest educating nurses by providing adequate knowledge on appropriate PPE use and sharing outbreak or ward shutdown experiences."

Background
Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis are known nosocomial pathogens. The bactericidal activity of biocidal agents used for disinfection, however, is determined with E. hirae.
Aim
To find out whether E. hirae is a suitable species to evaluate the efficacy of biocidal agents against the clinically relevant species E. faecalis and E. faecium.
Methods
The bactericidal activity was determined in suspension tests according to EN 13727 using E. faecium ATCC 6057, E. faecalis ATCC 47077 and E. hirae ATCC 10541. Glutaraldehyde, ethanol, benzalkonium chloride, peracetic acid and sodium hypochlorite were used with three exposure times per biocide. When major differences in the sensitivity of the three enterococcal species to the respective substance was found, two more replicates were performed. The number of colony-forming units (cfu) was transformed into decimal logarithms. Results from replicate experiments were described with means and standard deviations.
Findings
At a 5-min exposure time, E. hirae was found to be more tolerant to 0.2% glutaraldehyde and 0.0125% peracetic acid compared to E. faecium and E. faecalis, whereas it was more susceptible to 40% ethanol and 3% sodium hypochlorite. Only with 0.00125% benzalkoniumchloride (15 min) was the susceptibility of E. hirae between that of E. faecium and E. faecalis.
Conclusions
E. hirae is a suitable species when a bactericidal activity should be determined against enterococci with glutaraldehyde and peracetic acid. E. hirae may not be a suitable species for ethanol or sodium hypochlorite if the bactericidal activity should include the clinical pathogens E. faecium and E. faecalis."

Background
Reported antibiotic allergy in hospitalized patients seems to be related to more adverse events, the use of reserve antibiotics and longer hospitalization. Most patients reporting an antibiotic allergy can be de-labelled; as such, an antimicrobial stewardship intervention was set up.
Aim
To determine the impact of reported antibiotic allergy on the antibiotic treatment of hospitalized patients, and prevent unnecessary deviation from the preferred antibiotic treatment by a proactive antimicrobial stewardship intervention.
Methods
Hospitalized patients reporting an antibiotic allergy were included in an intervention study at a teaching hospital in the Netherlands between March and May 2019. Physicians received training and were provided with a recommendation in the electronic medical record in case the preferred antibiotic treatment was unnecessarily avoided due to the allergy label and the patient was eligible for a drug challenge.
Findings
In total, 492 patients reporting an antibiotic allergy were identified, accounting for 558 hospital admissions. In 93 cases, the antibiotic allergy label interfered with the preferred antibiotic treatment. Sixty-eight of these patients were eligible for a drug challenge, and 42 patients were challenged. In 40 (95%) of these patients, no allergic reaction was observed, and the preferred antibiotic treatment was given. Two (5%) patients developed a non-severe skin reaction after a drug challenge and continued an alternative antibiotic regimen.
Conclusion
This antimicrobial stewardship intervention can be used to provide patients with reported antibiotic allergy labels with the preferred antibiotic treatment, and to de-label them after uneventful re-exposure to the antibiotic agent."

Background
Levofloxacin has been considered as an alternative treatment for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection. However, levofloxacin-resistant S. maltophilia (LRSM) are emerging worldwide.
Aim
To investigate LRSM risk factors in hospitalized patients and to determine antibiotic susceptibility patterns of LRSM isolates.
Methods
In a retrospective matched case–control–control study, LRSM patients (the case group) were compared with two control groups: levofloxacin-susceptible S. maltophilia (LSSM) patients (control group A) and non-S. maltophilia-infected patients (control group B). Conditional logistic regression was used to analyse risk factors for LRSM occurrence. Tigecycline, ceftazidime, colistin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) susceptibilities in collected LRSM clinical isolates were determined.
Findings
A total of 105 LRSM, 105 LSSM, and 105 non-S. maltophilia-infected patients were analysed. The first multivariate analysis (cases vs group A) revealed that previous fluoroquinolones use was significantly associated with LRSM occurrence, and the second multivariate analysis (cases vs group B) revealed that previous fluoroquinolone use, previous intensive care unit stay, and the number of previous exposures to different classes of antibiotics were significantly associated with LRSM occurrence. Of all the LRSM isolates tested for antibiotic susceptibility, ceftazidime, TMP/SMX, tigecycline, and colistin resistance rates were 42.0, 99.0, 78.0, and 40.0%, respectively.
Conclusion
LRSM antibiotic susceptibility patterns revealed multiple-drug resistance, which further limits treatment options for clinicians. To reduce LRSM occurrence, proper use of antibiotics, especially fluoroquinolones, is mandatory."

Several guidelines recommend specific treatments for endoscopes, procedures of quarantine for endoscopes, or additional treatments for the endoscope washer disinfector (EWD) in suspected or confirmed cases of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) or variant CJD (vCJD) but vary in many details. This study therefore reviewed guidelines on reprocessing flexible endoscopes after use in patients with suspected or confirmed prion disease. In addition, a literature search was performed in Medline on prion, CJD, vCJD, chemical inactivation, transmission healthcare, epidemiology healthcare, concentration tissue human and endoscope. Thus far, no case of CJD or vCJD transmitted by flexible endoscope has been reported. In animals it has been shown that oral uptake of 0.1–5 g of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-infected brain homogenate is necessary for transmission. The maximum prion concentration in other tissues (e.g., terminal ileum) is at least 100-fold lower. Automated cleaning of endoscopes alone results in very low total residual protein ≤5.6 mg per duodenoscopes. Recommendations vary between countries, sometimes with additional cleaning, use of alkaline cleaners, no use of cleaners with fixative properties, use of disinfectants without fixative properties or single-use disinfectants. Sodium hydroxide (1 M) and sodium hypochlorite (10,000 and 25,000 mg/L) are very effective in preventing transmission via contaminated wires implanted into animal brains, but their relevance for endoscopes is questionable. Based on circumstantial evidence, it is proposed to consider validated reprocessing as appropriate in the case of delayed suspected prion disease when immediate bedside cleaning, routine use of alkaline cleaners, no fixative agents anywhere prior to disinfection and single use brushes and cleaning solutions can be assured."

The Cepheid® GeneXpert® (GXP) can simultaneously test for norovirus (NV), Clostridium difficile (CD), influenza A/B (IFA/B) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
Aim
To compare centralized multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing with localized GXP testing at a district general hospital.
Methods
From December 2017 to December 2018, samples received at Whipps Cross University Hospital (WCUH) were first tested at the local laboratory before transport centrally to the Royal London Hospital (RLH). At the RLH, a non-proprietary multiplex reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR assay was performed, which also tested for gastrointestinal or respiratory pathogens not tested for by the GXP.
Findings
A total of 1111 stool and respiratory samples were processed at both sites; 591 were respiratory and 520 were stool samples. Compared to centralized testing, the GXP gave sensitivity, specificity, and NPV all in excess of 97%, with the exception of RSV. The RSV assay had a sensitivity of 66.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 24.1, 94.0) but an NPV of 99.7% (95% CI 98.6, 99.9). At the RLH, 65 (5.9%) additional respiratory or gastrointestinal viruses were detected, predominantly rhinovirus 35 (3.2%) and adenovirus 11 (1.0%). Compared to centralized testing, the median time saved for local respiratory and gastrointestinal sample testing was 19 h and 46 min and 17 h and 6 min, respectively.
Conclusions
Local GXP testing compared to centralized multiplex PCR testing for IF, NV and CD, demonstrated sensitivities, specificities and NPV between 95% and 100%. Turnaround times were faster, enabling quicker infection prevention and control decision making. In our local setting (WCUH), the GXP demonstrated the potential to reduce NV and IFA/B outbreaks."

Background
The inappropriate use of antimicrobials and increased rates of antimicrobial resistance is a challenge all over the world. Although antibiotic stewardship is recommended by the Brazilian government, data regarding antibiotic use in Brazilian hospitals are scarce. The aim of this study was to conduct a point prevalence survey of antimicrobial use in 18 Brazilian hospitals.
Methods
Eighteen Brazilian hospitals conducted the Global Point Prevalence Survey of Antimicrobial Consumption and Resistance (Global-PPS) in 2017. The study enrolled inpatients on antimicrobials. Data collection included details on the antimicrobial prescriptions. A web-based programme was used for data-entry, validation and reporting. The Global-PPS was developed by the University of Antwerp and bioMérieux provided funding support.
Findings
A total of 1801 patients were evaluated, of which 941 (52.2%) were on antimicrobials. Four hundred (42.5%) patients were given at least two antimicrobials. Out of the 1317 antibacterials for systemic use, 514 (39%) were prescribed for community-acquired infections, 533 (40.5%) for healthcare-associated infections and 248 (18.8%) for prophylactic use. The most frequently used antimicrobials were ceftriaxone (12.8%), meropenem (12.3%) and vancomycin (10.3%). Pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection was the most common site of infection (29.2%). In general, antimicrobials were given mainly parenterally (91%) and empirically (81.2%).
Conclusions
A high prevalence of antibiotic use was observed in the 18 Brazilian hospitals. The antibiotics were prescribed mainly empirically. Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics were the most frequent antimicrobials used, showing that reinforcement of de-escalation strategy is needed. The Global-PPS data can be very useful for monitoring stewardship programmes and intervention."

This experimental study had a one-group multiple comparison design. In total, 104 nursing students participated, and performed nursing procedures for 10 min when wearing the best-fitting 3M FFR and the nanofibre FFR. Mask fit and perceived usability of the FFRs were evaluated.
Findings
More participants failed to obtain a fit factor ≥100 when using the best-fitting 3M FFR than when wearing the nanofibre FFR (33.7% vs 21.2%) after the procedures (P=0.417). The nanofibre FFR also demonstrated higher usability than the 3M FFRs in terms of facial heat, breathability, facial pressure, speech intelligibility, itchiness, difficulty of maintaining the mask in place, and comfort level (P<0.001). The nanofibre FFR was also lighter, thinner and had slightly higher bacterial filtration efficiency than the 3M FFRs.
Conclusion
The nanofibre FFR demonstrated significantly better usability than the 3M FFRs. None of the respirators were able to provide consistent protection for the wearer, as detected by face seal leakage after performing nursing procedures. Further improvement in the prototype design is needed to increase compliance and ensure the respiratory protection of users."

Background
Prompted by an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in a medical facility, this study examined a pneumatic tube transport system (PTS) as a potential transmission channel.
Method
Samples from the receiving station and entry racks were gathered via smear technique. Sponges used for PTS decontamination were soaked with 0.89% NaCl and transported through the channel. Micro-organisms were recovered from the tubes and cleaning sponges using a wash-away technique. Air sampling was performed at the receiving station in order to detect any airborne contamination. Tubes were artificially inoculated with Escherichia coli K12 NCTC 10538 and Staphylococcus epidermidis DSM 20044 and sent through the PTS to investigate channel contamination.
Results
No pathogens were detected in effluent air from the PTS or in tubes during routine operation. Entry racks for the test tubes were contaminated with coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), aerobic bacilli, moulds and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium. E. coli proved to be unsuitable for detecting bacterial transmission by the PTS due to low persistence, but S. epidermidis was more resilient. After sending contaminated test tubes through the PTS, levels of S. epidermidis only decreased marginally. Subsequently, sponges soaked with disinfectant solution were put through the system and these eliminated S. epidermidis completely from the first attempt.
Discussion
Routine hygienic maintenance of the PTS makes pathogen transmission highly unlikely, although entry racks should be disinfected regularly. Any involvement of the PTS in the VRE outbreak at the study institution was unlikely."

Background
Cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infection, a major complication of a CIED implant procedure, can prolong hospitalization and cause mortality.
Aim
To evaluate the efficacy of a bundled skin antiseptic preparation for preventing infection after implantation of a complex CIED.
Methods
This study analysed 1163 consecutive patients who had received a bundled skin antiseptic preparation before CIED implantation from July 2012 to December 2017. According to the complexity of the CIED implant procedure, the patients were divided into a complex CIED group (N = 370) and a non-complex CIED group (N = 793). A complex procedure was defined as a pacemaker replacement, implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy, device upgrade, or lead revision.
Findings
During a mean follow-up of 2.9 ± 1.7 years, CIED infection developed in 15 patients (1.3%), and the incidence of minor and major infection was 1.1% and 0.2%, respectively. The incidence of CIED infection did not significantly differ between the complex CIED group and the non-complex CIED group (1.1% vs 1.4%, respectively; non-significant). Multivariate analysis indicated that procedural complexity was not an independent predictor of CIED infection. After 2:1 propensity score matching, the matched non-complex CIED group and the matched complex CIED group still showed no significant difference in the incidence of CIED infection.
Conclusion
Bundled skin antiseptic preparation is an effective and widely applicable strategy for decreasing infection risk after a complex CIED implantation."

Background
Antibiotic use in hospitals is high, particularly in surgical specialty and intensive care units. Antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) are increasingly intervening in antibiotic use by surgeons and intensivists. However, there is limited information on the features which characterize antibiotic decision making in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), an area in hospital practice where critically ill surgery patients can be kept under close observation.
Aim
To explore the features which characterize antibiotic decision making in the SICU.
Methods
A total of 160 h of ethnographic observation and 10 semi-structured interviews were conducted at two teaching hospitals in the USA. Data were analysed using thematic coding.
Findings
Three key characteristics of SICU practice with regard to antibiotic use were identified: (1) physical proximity makes SICU clinicians acutely aware of changes in patient status; (2) communication of patient status relies on active involvement by SICU clinicians; (3) SICU clinicians have contested and variable autonomy over antibiotic decisions.
Conclusions
Antibiotic decision making in the SICU is a complex process involving multiple clinician teams with varying levels of physical proximity to and autonomy over patient cases. This study found that the SICU clinician team has increased physical proximity to patient cases but little autonomy over antibiotic decisions. If these characteristics are not considered, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions may have diminished success in addressing high levels of the antibiotic use in the SICU."

Background
A cluster of seven cases of skin and wound infections caused by a multiply resistant meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were detected in a small-town community in South Yorkshire. Initial microbiological investigations showed that all isolates belonged to a spa type observed rarely in England (t1476).
Aim
To describe the epidemiology of t1476 MRSA in South Yorkshire.
Methods
Retrospective and prospective case ascertainment was promoted through communication with local microbiology laboratories. Public health investigation included a detailed review of clinical notes for a subset of nine cases. Genomic and phylogenetic analysis was undertaken on t1476 MRSA.
Findings
Thirty-two cases of t1476 MRSA infection or colonization were identified between December 2014 and February 2018. Cases were older adults (aged 50–98 years). Healthcare exposures for a subset of nine cases indicated frequent contact with a team of district nurses, with all but one case receiving treatment on the same day as another case prior to their own diagnosis. No cases were admitted to hospital at the time of specimen collection. Despite detailed investigations, no carriers were detected among district nursing staff. A long-term carrier/super-shedder was not found. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that t1476 MRSA cases from South Yorkshire were monophyletic and distant from both MRSA of the same lineage from elsewhere in the UK (N = 15) and from publicly available sequences from Tanzania.
Conclusion
Genomic and epidemiological analyses indicate community-based transmission of a multiply resistant MRSA clone within South Yorkshire introduced around 2012–2013, prior to the detection of a spatial–temporal cluster associated with a distinct risk group. Surveillance data indicate continued circulation."

Background
Surgical site infection (SSI) following spinal surgery is a frequent clinical problem with significant clinical and socio-economic consequences. Malnutrition has been linked with SSI in various other surgical procedures.
Aim
To investigate whether malnutrition is a risk factor for SSI following spinal surgery.
Methods
Two electronic databases (PUBMED and SCOPUS) and the Cochrane Library were searched systematically from inception to May 2019. Cohort and case–control studies assessing malnutrition as a risk factor for SSI in patients undergoing spinal procedures were considered eligible. Μalnutrition was defined according to laboratory measurements or by relevant International Classification of Diseases-9 codes. SSI was the outcome of interest. Two reviewers independently abstracted study data and assessed the risk of bias for each study. Pooled effect estimates were calculated using random effects models.
Findings
In total, 22 studies (20 retrospective cohort and two case–control) with over 175,000 participants (of whom 2.14% developed postoperative SSI) were analysed. SSIs were more likely to develop in malnourished patients [odds ratio (OR) 2.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75–3.05]. While pre-operative malnutrition was significantly associated with SSI in patients undergoing thoracolumbar spinal and sacral surgery, no significant difference was seen in patients undergoing cervical spinal surgery. In subgroup analyses, similar results were observed for both hospital-based (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.84–5.43) and population-based (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.63–2.46) studies.
Conclusions
Malnutrition is associated with increased risk of developing SSI after spinal surgery. Further high-quality research is warranted to investigate whether improvement of pre-operative nutritional status can decrease SSI rates."

Background
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Streptococcus pyogenes linked to invasive disease has been used to identify and investigate outbreaks. The clinical application of WGS in real-time for outbreak control is seldom employed.
Aims
A fatal case of bacteraemia at a national orthopaedic hospital prompted an outbreak investigation to identify carriers and halt transmission using real-time WGS.
Methods
Retrospective surveillance was conducted to identify patients with Streptococcus pyogenes infections in the last year. Upon contact tracing, four patients and 179 staff were screened for Streptococcus pyogenes carriage. All isolates identified were emm-typed. WGS was performed in real-time on a subset of isolates.
Findings
Twelve isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes from the index case, two patients and eight staff were identified. Six isolates were emm 1.0, including the index case and five staff isolates. The remaining isolates belonged to distinct emm types. WGS analysis was undertaken on the six emm 1.0 isolates. Five were indistinguishable by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, with 0 SNP distance, and one had one SNP difference, supporting the hypothesis of recent local transmission. All screen-positive healthcare workers were offered treatment with penicillin or clindamycin. No further cases were identified.
Conclusion
The increased molecular discrimination of WGS confirmed the clustering of these cases and the outbreak was contained. This demonstrates the clinical utility of WGS in managing outbreaks of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes in real-time and we recommend its implementation as a routine clinical service."

Background
Outbreaks of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) are a serious problem in hospitals. Inferring the transmission route is an important factor to institute appropriate infection control measures; however, the methodology has not been fully established.
Aim
To reconstruct and evaluate the transmission model using sequence variants extracted from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and epidemiological information from patients involved in a VRE outbreak.
Methods
During a VRE outbreak in our hospital, 23 samples were collected from patients and environmental surfaces and analysed using WGS. By combining genome alignment information with patient epidemiological data, the VRE transmission route was reconstructed using a Bayesian approach. With the transmission model, evaluation and further analyses were performed to identify risk factors that contributed to the outbreak.
Findings
All VREs were identified as Enterococcus faecium belonging to sequence type 17, which consisted of two VRE genotypes: vanA (N = 8, including one environmental sample) and vanB (N = 15). The reconstruction model using the Bayesian approach showed the transmission direction with posterior probability and revealed transmission through an environmental surface. In addition, some cases acting as VRE spreaders were identified, which can interfere with appropriate infection control. Vancomycin administration was identified as a significant risk factor for spreaders.
Conclusion
A Bayesian approach for transmission route reconstruction using epidemiologic data and genomic variants from WGS can be applied in actual VRE outbreaks. This may contribute to the design and implementation of effective infection control measures."

Background
Antimicrobial stewardship is considered as one of the most fundamental aspects of bacterial resistance control. Among the multitude of initiatives, restrictive strategies have been widely practiced in hospital settings. However, data concerning their potential effectiveness have not been methodically collected and evaluated to date.
Aim
To identify, collect and evaluate the available evidence regarding the impact of restrictive policies on bacterial resistance in hospital settings.
Methods
A systematic literature review was conducted using the PubMed/Medline, Embase, Global Health and CINAHL Plus databases.
Findings
In total, 5555 papers were retrieved in the search process, and 29 studies were included in the final analysis. There were no randomized studies, and the inherent limitations of the observational designs employed impede the deduction of safe conclusions. Seemingly beneficial interventions encompass the restriction of broad-spectrum cephalosporins in favour of beta-lactam/lactamase inhibitor combinations as well as the restriction of fluoroquinolones. Antimicrobial restrictions might also play a role in the control of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, while carbapenem stewardship in the form of the preferred use of ertapenem did not produce the anticipated results. Complex restrictions are not offered for informative comparative analyses. Hospital-wide policies could perhaps be superior to those confined to high-risk departments. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii might be difficult to control through solely formulary interventions.
Conclusion
The presumably effective restrictive strategies rely mainly on inadequately tested hypotheses and low-quality evidence. Therefore, systematic, high-quality research is needed to confirm and expand comprehension of the subject so that the most successful policies are employed in the field."

abstract = "Summary
Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an acute febrile illness, often accompanied by haemorrhagic manifestations, with a high case fatality rate (CFR). The causative agent is CCHF virus (CCHFV), and is transmitted to humans mainly through tick bites or exposure to blood or tissues of viraemic patients or livestock. Human-to-human transmission usually occurs in hospital settings, and healthcare workers (HCWs) are mainly affected. A review on nosocomial CCHFV infections was performed to elucidate the routes and circumstances of CCHFV transmission in hospital settings. From 1953 to 2016, 158 published cases of CCHFV nosocomial infection in 20 countries in Africa, Asia and Europe were found. Almost all cases were symptomatic (92.4%), with an overall CFR of 32.4%. The majority of cases occurred in hospital clinics (92.0%) and 10 cases (8.0%) occurred in laboratories. Most cases occurred among HCWs (86.1%), followed by visitors (12.7%) and hospitalized patients (1.3%). Nursing staff (44.9%) and doctors (32.3%) were the most affected HCWs, followed by laboratory staff (6.3%). The primary transmission route was percutaneous contact (34.3%). Cutaneous contact accounted for 22.2% of cases, followed by exposure to aerosols (proximity) (18.2%), indirect contact (17.2%) and exposure to patient environment (8.1%). CCHFV can cause nosocomial infections with a high CFR. During the care and treatment of patients with CCHF, standard contact precautions, barrier precautions and airborne preventive measures should be applied. In order to improve patient safety and reduce healthcare-associated CCHFV exposure, there is a need for guidelines and education for HCWs to ensure that CCHF is appropriately included in differential diagnoses; this will enable early diagnosis and implementation of infection prevention measures."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Near-patient surfaces are recognized as a source for hospital-acquired infections. Such surfaces act as reservoirs for microbial contamination by which pathogens can be transmitted from colonized or infected patients to susceptible patients. Routine disinfection of surfaces only results in a temporal elimination of pathogens, and recontamination inevitably occurs shortly between disinfections.
Aim
A novel antimicrobial coating based on photodynamics was tested under laboratory conditions and subsequently in a field study in two hospitals under real-life conditions.
Methods
Identical surfaces received a photodynamic or control coating. Bacterial counts [colony-forming units (cfu)/cm2) were assessed regularly for up to 6 months.
Findings
The laboratory study revealed a mean reduction of several human pathogens of up to 4.0 ± 0.3 log10. The field study in near-patient environments demonstrated mean bacterial values of 6.1 ± 24.7 cfu/cm2 on all control coatings. Photodynamic coatings showed a significantly lower mean value of 1.9 ± 2.8 cfu/cm2 (P<0.001). When considering benchmarks of 2.5 cfu/cm2 or 5 cfu/cm2, the relative risk for high bacterial counts on surfaces was reduced by 48% (odds ratio 0.38, P<0.001) or 67% (odds ratio 0.27, P<0.001), respectively.
Conclusion
Photodynamic coatings provide a significant and lasting reduction of bacterial counts on near-patient surfaces, particularly for high bacterial loads, in addition to routine hygiene. The promising results of this proof-of-concept study highlight the need for further studies to determine how this novel technology is correlated with the frequency of hospital-acquired infections."

Background
Smartphones used in clinical settings harbour potentially pathogenic bacteria, and this may pose an infection risk. Previous studies have relied on culture-based methods.
Aim
To characterize the quantity and diversity of microbial contamination of hospital staff smartphones using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods; to determine the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant potential pathogens; to compare microbial communities of hospital staff and control group phones.
Methods
Smartphones of 250 hospital staff and 191 control group participants were swabbed. The antibiotic resistance profile of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus isolates was determined. Swabs were pooled into groups according to the hospital area staff worked in, and DNA was extracted. The microbial community of the phone was characterized using an Illumina MiSeq metabarcoding pipeline.
Findings
Almost all (99.2%) of hospital staff smartphones were contaminated with potential pathogens, and bacterial colony forming units (CFUs) were significantly higher on hospital phones than in the control group. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) were only detected on hospital mobile phones. Metabarcoding revealed a far greater abundance of Gram-negative contaminants, and much greater diversity, than culture-based methods. Bacillus spp. were significantly more abundant in the hospital group.

This study reinforces the need to consider infection-control policies to mitigate the potential risks associated with the increased use of smartphones in clinical environments, and highlights the limitations of culture-based methods for environmental swabbing."

abstract = "SUMMARY
Background
Non-antibiotic interventions for urinary tract infection (UTI) prevention have been investigated as a strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing for UTI and subsequent antibiotic resistance. Increased hydration is widely advocated for preventing UTI; however, evidence for its effectiveness is unknown.
Aim
To systematically review the published literature on the effectiveness of increased fluid intake as a preventive intervention for UTI in adults and children in any setting.
Methods
Five electronic databases were searched from inception to February 2019 to identify published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies evaluating the effectiveness of high (≥1.5 L/24 h) versus normal/low (<1.5 L/24 h) fluid intake for UTI prevention. The outcome was UTI incidence. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Due to the small number of studies identified, meta-analysis was not possible. Hence a narrative synthesis was undertaken.
Findings
Of the 2822 potentially relevant papers, two were eligible for inclusion: an RCT (individual randomization) and a cluster-RCT. Both studies differed regarding participants, setting, sample size, UTI definition, and intervention. The RCT was assessed as having a low risk of bias whereas the cluster-RCT had a high risk of bias. Only the RCT, which included healthy premenopausal women visiting primary care clinics, demonstrated statistical significance for the effect of high fluid intake for UTI prevention.
Conclusion
The lack of enough adequately powered and robust RCTs highlights the need for further research on the effectiveness of this intervention for UTI prevention."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antimicrobial stewardship initiatives in secondary care depend on clinicians undertaking antibiotic prescription reviews but decisions to limit antibiotic treatment at review are complex.
Aim
To assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing ARK (Antibiotic Review Kit), a behaviour change intervention made up of four components (brief online tool, prescribing decision aid, regular data collection and feedback process, and patient leaflet) to support stopping antibiotic treatment when it is safe to do so among hospitalized patients; before definitive evaluation through a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial.
Methods
Acceptability of the different intervention elements was assessed for a period of 12 weeks by uptake of the online tool, adoption of the decision aid into prescribing practice, and rates of decisions to stop antibiotics at review (assessed through repeated point-prevalence surveys). Patient perceptions of the information leaflet were assessed through a brief questionnaire.
Findings
All elements of the intervention were successfully introduced into practice. A total of 132 staff encompassing a broad range of prescribers and non-prescribers completed the online tool (19.4 per 100 acute beds), including 97% (32/33) of the pre-specified essential clinical staff. Among 588 prescription charts evaluated in seven point-prevalence surveys over the 12-week implementation period, 82% overall (76–90% at each survey) used the decision aid. The median antibiotic stop rate post implementation was 36% (range: 29–40% at each survey) compared with 9% pre implementation (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
ARK provides a feasible and acceptable mechanism to support stopping antibiotics safely at post-prescription reviews in an acute hospital setting."

Healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs) continue to persist in hospitals, despite the use of increasingly strict infection-control precautions. Opportunistic airborne transmission of potentially pathogenic bioaerosols may be one possible reason for this persistence. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the concentrations and compositions of indoor bioaerosols in different areas within hospitals and the effects of different ventilation systems. Electronic databases (Medline and Web of Science) were searched to identify articles of interest. The search was restricted to articles published from 2000 to 2017 in English. Aggregate data was used to examine the differences in mean colony forming units per cubic metre (cfu/m3) between different hospital areas and ventilation types. A total of 36 journal articles met the eligibility criteria. The mean total bioaerosol concentrations in the different areas of the hospitals were highest in the inpatient facilities (77 cfu/m3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 55–108) compared with the restricted (13cfu/m3, 95% CI: 10–15) and public areas (14 cfu/m3, 95% CI: 10–19). Hospital areas with natural ventilation had the highest total bioaerosol concentrations (201 cfu/m3, 95% CI: 135–300) compared with areas using conventional mechanical ventilation systems (20 cfu/m3, 95% CI: 16–24). Hospital areas using sophisticated mechanical ventilation systems (such as increased air changes per hour, directional flow and filtration systems) had the lowest total bioaerosol concentrations (9 cfu/m3, 95% CI: 7–13). Operating sophisticated mechanical ventilation systems in hospitals contributes to improved indoor air quality within hospitals, which assists in reducing the risk of airborne transmission of HAIs."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pseudo-outbreaks of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in association with the water supply system in hospitals have been previously reported. We found that the frequency of NTM isolation in clinical samples increased after the reconstruction and renovation of a hospital in Japan in 2014.
Aim
To analyse NTM, their possible relationship with the hospital water supply system, and outcomes of preventive measures.
Methods
Environmental samples obtained from the water supply in hospital wards were tested for NTM. On obtaining positive results, the bacteria were further analysed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Findings
The PCR products of NTM showed that most samples tested positive for Mycobacterium paragordonae. Because none of the analysed patients developed any disease due to these bacteria, this event was considered a pseudo-outbreak. Investigation of the water supply system revealed that samples obtained from the recently attached aerators/rectifiers during hospital renovation tested positive for these bacteria. Therefore, measures to remove aerators/rectifiers and prevent patients from drinking tap water in the hospital were introduced. Thereafter, the frequency of NTM-positive samples significantly decreased in the hospital.
Conclusion
This study is one of the few reports which reveal the possibility of pseudo-outbreaks of M. paragordonae in hospitals, hence raising the question whether aerators/rectifiers should be used in hospitals at all, because their mesh structure may promote NTM proliferation in supplied water. The importance of surveillance of bacteria derived from the environment, particularly after hospital reconstruction/renovation, is re-emphasized."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Multi-resistant bacteria (MRB) are an emerging problem. Early identification of patients colonized with MRB is mandatory to avoid in-hospital transmission and to target antibiotic treatment. Since most patients pass through specialized emergency departments (EDs), these departments are crucial in early identification. The Danish National Board of Health (DNBH) has developed exposure-based targeted screening tools to identify and isolate carriers of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE).
Aim
To assess the national screening tools for detection of MRSA and CPE carriage in a cohort of acute patients. The objectives were to investigate: (i) if the colonized patients were detected; and (ii) if the colonized patients were isolated.
Methods
This was a multi-centre cross-sectional survey of adults visiting EDs. The patients answered the DNBH questions, and swabs were taken from the nose, throat and rectum. The collected samples were examined for MRSA and CPE. Screening performances were calculated.
Findings
Of the 5117 included patients, 16 were colonized with MRSA and four were colonized with CPE. The MRSA screening tool had sensitivity of 50% [95% confidence interval (CI) 25–75%] for carrier detection and 25% (95% CI 7–52%) for carrier isolation. The CPE screening tool had sensitivity of 25% (95% CI 1–81%) and none of the CPE carriers were isolated.
Conclusion
The national screening tools were of limited use as the majority of MRSA and CPE carriers passed unidentified through the EDs, and many patients were isolated unnecessarily."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Detection of faecal carriers of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) has become a routine medical practice in many countries. In an outbreak setting, several public health organizations recommend three-weekly rectal screenings to rule-out acquisition in contact patients. This strategy, associated with bed closures and reduction of medical activity for a relatively long time, seems costly.
Aim
The objective of this study was to test the positive and negative predictive values of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; GeneXpert®) carried-out at Day 0, compared with conventional three-weekly culture-based rectal screenings, in identifying, among contact patients, those who acquired CPE/VRE.
Methods
A multicentre retrospective study was conducted from January2015 to October2018. All contact patients (CPs) were included identified from index patients (IPs) colonized or infected with CPE/VRE, incidentally discovered. Each CP was investigated at Day 0 by PCR (GeneXpert®), and by the recommended three-weekly screenings.
Findings
Twenty-two IPs and 159 CPs were included. An average of 0.77 secondary cases per patient was noted, with a mean duration of contact of 10 days (range 1–64). Among the 159 CPs, 16 (10%) had a CPE/VRE-positive culture during the monitoring period. Rectal screenings were positive at Day 0 (10 patients), Day 7 (two patients), Day 14 (four patients). Thirteen of 16 patients with positive culture had a positive PCR at Day 0. Overall, a concordance of 97.5% (155/159) was observed between the three-weekly screenings and Day 0 PCR results. When performed on CPs at Day 0 of the identification of an IP, PCR (GeneXpert®) allowed the reduction in turnaround time by five to 27 days, compared to three-weekly screenings. Positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 100% and 98%, respectively.
Conclusions
The use of RT-PCR (GeneXpert®) can avoid the three-weekly rectal samplings needed to rule-out acquisition of CPE/VRE."

Background
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major bacterial pathogen responsible for hospital-acquired infections. Although its epidemiology is considered as non-clonal, certain international high-risk multidrug-resistant clones have been recognized.
Aim
From the first report of an intra-hospital outbreak due to an SHV2a-producing P. aeruginosa strain, to describe the emergence of a new ST235-specific lineage harbouring this rare extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL).
Methods
Between May and October 2018, four patients hospitalized in the cardiovascular intensive care unit of a French teaching hospital were infected by a multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolate. Serotype and antimicrobial susceptibility were tested; multi-locus sequence type (MLST), core genome MLST, and resistome were determined through whole genome sequencing. A phylogenetic analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphism was performed using available ST235 genomes.
Findings
The four strains were susceptible to colistin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime–avibactam, and ceftolozane–tazobactam. blaSHV2a was identified in each genome of this ST235-O11 serotype cluster that showed an identical cgMLST profile (0–2 out of 4162 different alleles). The phylogenic analysis of 162 ST235 genomes showed that only four other strains harboured a blaSHV2a, originating from France and USA, clustering together although being different from the outbreak strains.
Conclusions
Among the ST235 P. aeruginosa strains, a sub-lineage sharing a common genetic background and harbouring the blaSHV2a ESBL seems to emerge from different locations, yielding secondary local outbreaks."

Antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) are suggested as a vital strategy to address antimicrobial resistance.
Aim
To examine the current status of ASPs in Korean hospitals, to identify problems and challenges for the implementation of proper ASPs, and to provide a reference for developing more effective ASP policies.
Methods
A questionnaire based on the ‘Seven Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship Programs’ from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was developed, modified from the previous questionnaire on ASPs in Korea, 2015. ASP-participating physicians such as infectious disease specialists (IDSs), paediatric IDSs, and directors of infection control departments were targeted. Only one ASP-associated physician per hospital participated in the survey.
Findings
The survey response rate was 88.4% (84/95). The median number of medical personnel participating in ASPs was 3 (interquartile range (IQR): 1–5), most of whom were IDS (median: 2; IQR: 1–2). Only 6.0% (5/84) of hospitals had full-time workers for ASPs. Whereas restrictive measures for designated antimicrobials were widely implemented among Korean hospitals (88.1%, 74/84), the proportion of hospitals with interventions for inappropriate long-term antimicrobial use and a conversion strategy from parenteral to oral antimicrobial administration was only 9.5% (8/84) and 1.2% (1/84), respectively. Lack of time, personnel, and appropriate compensation was perceived as the major barrier to establishing an ASP in Korean hospitals.
Conclusion
ASPs in Korean hospitals were primarily carried out by one or two IDSs, and programmes mostly comprised restrictive measures for designated antimicrobials. National-level support to implement appropriate ASPs in Korean hospitals is necessary."

Background
Livestock-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) clonal complex (CC) 398 may be transmitted and cause morbidity and mortality in hospitals. The economic cost of stopping hospital transmission of LA-MRSA CC398 is poorly described. Early detection of transmission may limit the extent of the intervention.
Aim
To evaluate core genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) for detecting transmission chains and to estimate the costs for interventions to prevent further spread after discovery of hospital transmission of LA-MRSA CC398.
Methods
Five patients were involved in two episodes of transmission of LA-MRSA CC398 in a hospital. Standard interventions including MRSA screening of patients and healthcare workers were initiated. Whole genome sequences of the five isolates and 17 epidemiologically unrelated MRSA CC398 isolates from other hospitalized patients were analysed by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) comparisons and cgMLST. The economic costs of constraining transmission were calculated from relevant sources.
Findings
The five isolates suspected to be involved in hospital transmission clustered with ≤2 SNPs in the draft genome sequences with some distance to other isolates. cgMLST allocated the five isolates to the same type, which was different from all but two of the sporadic isolates. Furthermore, cgMLST separated the five transmission isolates from all other isolates. The economic costs of the outbreak interventions exceeded €11,000 per patient.
Conclusion
LA-MRSA CC398 is transmittable in hospitals, and intervention against transmission may reach considerable costs. cgMLST is useful in surveillance of hospital transmission of LA-MRSA."

Concerns are growing over the importance of the hospital water environment for the transmission of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE).
Aim
To report a large outbreak in the cardiology units involving intensive care units (ICUs) and wards at a tertiary-care hospital.
Methods
This was a contact tracing, case–control study to find the risk factors for acquisition of CPE and environmental sampling was performed during a CPE outbreak between July and December 2018.
Findings
A total of 87 patients with CPE infection or colonization were identified in the cardiology units of the Asan Medical Centre. Diverse organisms were identified containing blakpc, blaNDM-1, blaVIM or blaIMP, blaOXA-48, and co-producing organisms. A case–control study indicated that using the sinks in the ward patient room bathroom for teeth brushing was associated with CPE acquisition (83% vs 30%; P=0.03). The environment was cultured and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Escherichia coli was isolated from a water dispenser and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) 1-producing Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae from sinks in patient rooms. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of KPC-producing E. coli from patients and the water dispenser in ICU and NDM-1-producing E. cloacae from the patient and sink drain showed the same pulsotypes.
Conclusions
The water dispenser and sink drain were suspected as possible reservoirs of CPE in this outbreak. Close contacts with contaminated water such as tooth brushing were identified as risk factors for CPE acquisition. Education for the adequate use of the water environment system as well as the control of the hospital water environment should be implemented to prevent the CPE outbreaks."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) and antimicrobial use in hospitals in the Netherlands has been measured using voluntary biannual national point-prevalence surveys (PPSs).
Aim
To describe trends in the prevalence of patients with HCAI, risk factors, and antimicrobial use in 2007–2016.
Methods
In the PPS, patient characteristics, use of medical devices and antimicrobials, and presence of HCAI on the survey day are reported for all hospitalized patients, excluding patients in the day-care unit and psychiatric wards. Analyses were performed using linear and (multivariate) logistic regression, accounting for clustering of patients within hospitals.
Findings
PPS data were reported for 171,116 patients. Annual prevalence of patients with HCAI with onset during hospitalization decreased from 6.1% in 2007 to 3.6% in 2016. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for trend was 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.96–0.98). Most prominent trends were seen for surgical site infections (1.6%–0.8%; OR: 0.91 (0.90–0.93)) and urinary tract infections (2.1%–0.6%; OR: 0.85 (0.83–0.87)). From 2014 on, HCAIs at admission were also registered with a stable prevalence of approximately 1.5%. The mean length of stay decreased from 10 to 7 days. The percentage of patients treated with antibiotics increased from 31% to 36% (OR: 1.03 (1.02–1.03)).
Conclusion
Repeated PPS data from 2007 to 2016 show a decrease in the prevalence of patients with HCAI with onset during hospitalization, and a stable prevalence of patients with HCAI at admission. The adjusted OR of 0.97 for HCAI during hospitalization indicates a true reduction in prevalence of approximately 3% per year."

Appropriate decontamination of breast pump milk collection kits (BPKs) is critical to obtain safe milk for infants and to avoid discarding donor human milk (DHM).
Aim
To evaluate two strategies for BPK decontamination by assessing microbial cultures and the proportion of discarded DHM, according to the criteria of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for pre-pasteurization cultures.
Methods
Prospective comparative study, allocation ratio 1:1, microbiologist-blind.
Participants
47 new donors in a human milk bank in Madrid.
Interventions
Study group (N=21): BPKs washed with water and detergent after each use and further steam decontamination within a microwavable bag. Control group (N=26): washing, rinsing and drying only. Five samples: first sample by hand expression and four samples (one per week) collected using the same pump and method.
Outcomes
Primary: proportion of DHM discarded due to contamination. Secondary: comparison of the microbiota between samples obtained by hand expression and breast pump in both groups.
Findings
In total, 217 milk samples were collected: 47 by hand expression and 170 by pump expression (78 from study group). Steam decontamination of BPKs using a microwavable bag after washing resulted in a lower proportion of discarded DHM samples (1.3% vs 18.5%, P<0.001) and samples contaminated with Enterobacteriaceae (1.3% vs 22.8%, P<0.001) and Candida spp. (1.3% vs 14.1%, P<0.05) compared with samples collected with BPKs that were washed but not steam decontaminated. There were no differences in bacterial contamination between samples obtained using steam decontaminated BPKs and those obtained by hand expression.
Conclusions
Steam decontamination of BPKs using a microwavable bag after washing decreases the amount of discarded DHM and the number of samples with potentially pathogenic bacteria."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Given the lack of hospital-wide ownership and shortage of nurses, the ideal model for large-scale implementation of hand hygiene (HH) behaviour change in low- and middle-income countries is unknown.
Aim
The aim of the multi-modal strategy was to engender hospital accountability for HH compliance.
Methods
The quasi-experimental study was conducted in 50 South African hospitals (November 2015 to July 2017) and involved five overlapping phases: executive governance and corporate behaviour change; group-wide systematic situational analysis; development of an electronic-assisted direct-observed data collection and analysis application; launch and implementation; and accountable governance. Measurement of intra- and inter-hospital variance to six HH opportunities was calculated and data compliance dashboards were e-mailed weekly to hospital leadership teams to provide feedback of recorded HH compliance and behaviour to frontline teams. Baseline comparison (July 2016) of compliance was compared versus post-implementation (July 2017).
Findings
Baseline HH compliance of ≤60% was documented for 16% (8/50) of hospitals, whereas overall, 48% (24/50) of hospitals demonstrated a significant improvement (P < 0.01). Over the 13-month observation period, 523,422 observations were recorded with a mean rate of 277 ± 223 observations per 1000 patient-days. The group mean composite compliance improved by 7.8% (P < 0.01) from 77.4% ± 12.8 to 85.2% ± 8.8 between July 2016 and July 2017, respectively.
Conclusion
Implementation of a multi-faceted HH model in a large, diverse group of South African hospitals translated into changes in the organizational systems and accountability, standardized HH compliance management and feedback that led to HH proprietorship."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hand hygiene, a simple and low-cost measure, remains the leading intervention for reducing the burden related to healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). While many interventions have been tested to improve staff hand hygiene compliance, hospital visitors continue to have low compliance rates, which increases the risk of HAIs and resistant organisms' transmission into hospitals and out to the community.
Aim
To assess the effectiveness of educational speech intervention (ESI) for increasing hand hygiene compliance rate among hospital visitors.
Methods
This interventional study was conducted from March to June 2019 in an inpatient unit of a large academic hospital. Visitor hand hygiene compliance was observed before and after implementation of ESI. The purpose of providing ESI to the visitors in the intervention phase was to remind them about the importance of hand hygiene and the proper method for cleaning hands. Post-intervention data were collected using the survey questionnaires. Unpaired t-test compared the hand hygiene compliance rate before and after the intervention.
Findings
Baseline hand hygiene compliance rate was 9.73% while hand hygiene compliance rate post-intervention increased to 87.06% (P<0.001). Barriers to hand hygiene compliance included occupied hands, improper location of hand hygiene supplies, and past habit of not practising hand hygiene. Visitors preferred to be reminded about hand hygiene by verbal reminder (57%), followed by signage (38%), and wristband notices (5%).
Conclusion
The ESI substantially increased visitors' hand hygiene compliance rate. Further studies are warranted to assess the sustainability of ESI and address other barriers to visitors' hand hygiene compliance."

abstract = "Summary
Clostridioides difficile, a spore-forming bacillus, is a major cause of healthcare-associated infection, and can survive for prolonged periods in the inanimate environment. Environmental sampling to detect C. difficile is not routine but may be undertaken as part of outbreak management and during research projects. We conducted a literature search covering the period between 1980 and 2018 to review methods for the detection of this pathogen in the environment. There are many acceptable sampling methods used for environmental screening, including contact plates, cotton swabs, flocked swabs and sponges. Most recent studies suggest that sponges are the most effective method of sampling and have the added benefit of being capable of sampling larger and curved areas. Culture methods are the most common laboratory method of detecting C. difficile from environmental samples. However, the results are variable depending on the type of agar used and the turnaround times can be long. Molecular methods such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), although more commonly used to detect C. difficile from faecal specimens, has been used with varying degrees of success in environmental sampling. Further studies are needed to determine whether molecular techniques could offer a more reliable, faster method of environmental sampling, giving infection prevention and control teams more reassurance that patients are being placed in adequately decontaminated hospital environments."

abstract = "SUMMARY
Background
Invasive non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections are emerging worldwide in patients undergoing open-chest cardiac bypass surgery exposed to contaminated heater–cooler units (HCUs). Although this outbreak has been investigated by culturing bacteria isolated from HCU aerosol and water samples, these conventional methods have low-analytic sensitivity, high rates of sample contamination, and long turnaround time.
Aim
To develop a simple and effective method to detect NTM in HCUs by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with a short laboratory turnaround time and reliable culture results.
Methods
A total of 281 water samples collected from various HCUs at seven Italian hospitals were simultaneously screened for NTM by a propidium monoazide (PMA)–PCR assay and by conventional culture testing. The results were analysed with culture testing as the reference method.
Findings
(i) The agreement between culture testing and PMA–PCR was 85.0% with a cycle threshold (CT) cut-off value of <38 vs 80.0% with a CT of <43, with a moderate Cohen's κ-coefficient; (ii) the CT cut-off value of <42 was deemed more suitable for predicting positive specimens; (iii) given the low concentration of target DNA in water samples, the minimum volume to be tested was 1 L.
Conclusion
The use of PMA–PCR for fast detection of NTM from environmental samples is highly recommended in order to ascertain whether HCUs may represent a potential source of human exposure to NTM. This reliable and simple method reduces laboratory turnaround time compared to conventional methods (one to two days vs eight weeks, respectively), thereby improving control strategies and effective management of HCUs."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A previous study among neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses showed that the antibacterial efficacy of alcohol-based handrubs (ABHR) can be achieved in 15 s instead of 30 s with a significant increase in the frequency of hand antisepsis. This study aimed to examine 15-s vs 30-s antisepsis performance by measuring microbial load on fingertips and compliance among nurses in a low-risk gynaecological ward.
Methods
An independent trained observer monitored the frequency and compliance with hand antisepsis during shifts in a crossover design. Fingertips including thumbs were rinsed in soy broth before hand rubbing at the beginning of a shift and then hourly to determine the bacterial load. Performance activity was assigned to the contamination class of the Fulkerson scale. Immediately before the lunch break, volunteers cleaned their hands for a randomly determined application time of 15 or 30 s.
Results
Examination of bacterial load on fingertips revealed no difference between 15 vs 30 s application time. Controlled hand antisepsis before the lunch break also showed no difference in efficacy for either test series. Participants rubbing for 15 s were more likely to perform hand antisepsis compared with those rubbing for 30 s (P=0.2). The compliance increased from 54.7% to 69.5% in the 15-s trial.
Discussion
Shortening the duration for hand antisepsis did not decrease efficacy. Shortening the application time to 15 s should be considered within the critical components of a successful multimodal intervention strategy to improve hand-hygiene compliance in clinical practice."

Background
Infections account for 15% of neonatal deaths and one-tenth of maternal mortality globally. Evidence-based practices to prevent and control infection are essential to reduce newborn and maternal mortality.
Aim
To identify the barriers and opportunities experienced by staff when implementing infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines in maternity wards and delivery units in six health centres in two states in Nigeria.
Methods
A structured survey was undertaken in the maternity ward and delivery unit of six healthcare facilities to assess critical infrastructure and equipment. A survey was completed with the matron to assess staff practices and quality assurance procedures. Data were triangulated with qualitative data from interviews with facility staff.
Findings
Usable handwashing facilities – with water, functioning taps and soap available – were present in the delivery units of all six facilities, but were present in only one postnatal ward. All facilities were visibly clean, and staff demonstrated a strong will to comply with protocol. Areas of concern included effectiveness of training, inadequate availability of personal protective equipment, inadequate hand hygiene practices, and outdated procedures to reprocess re-usable medical equipment.
Conclusion
Safe childbirth and postnatal care require comprehensive adherence to hand hygiene protocols and the use of disposable personal protective equipment. Financial, equipment and human resource constraints are obstacles to effective implementation of IPC in labour and delivery wards in the centres included in this study. Recommended interim measures include the introduction of champions to systematize step-down training and to monitor and provide feedback at facility level."

Background
Patients with haematological diseases are at high risk of developing Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI).
Aim
The study aim was to describe excess length of stay and costs associated with CDI during the hospital stay for induction chemotherapy in the United States (USA).
Methods
A retrospective analysis was conducted utilizing data from US databases of Truven Health Analytics®. Comprehensive hospitalization data of patients with induction chemotherapy due to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) were analysed. Patients with CDI occurring during the hospital stay were compared to controls through a case–control comparison of the direct treatment costs and length of stay was performed with an exact matching algorithm.
Findings
A total of 2611 patients were included between January 2014 and December 2017. NHL (43.5%) and AML (38.4%) were the predominant underlying diseases and 15% of patients received a stem cell transplantation. During the matching, 105 CDI cases (CDI+) were compared with 801 controls (CDI−). On average, hospitalization costs were increased by US$36,113 in CDI+ compared to CDI− patients (P=0.009) and patients with CDI spent on average 8.9 additional days in hospital (P=0.003).
Conclusions
The findings highlight a significant burden associated with CDI in haematological patients undergoing induction chemotherapy in the USA. There is an important need for prevention of CDI in this specific patient population."

Background
Increased occurrence of a particular species of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), especially when multi-drug-resistant (MDR), in routine screening surveillance in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) can be evoked by selection pressure.
Aim
To evaluate adaptation of the empiric antibiotic regimen for its usefulness as a control measure in suspected outbreaks in the NICU.
Methods
In a retrospective outbreak analysis, cases between 1st December 2017 and 31st March 2018 were identified through microbiology and hygiene surveillance records. Furthermore, risk factors for MDR-GNB colonization were collected. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on all isolates. Control measure documentations and interviews were employed to define interventions. As well as infection control measures, administration of third-generation cephalosporins was avoided and replaced whenever clinically acceptable as part of the intervention bundle.
Findings
In total, nine patients were found to have rectal colonization with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacter cloacae in routine screening surveillance in the pre-intervention period. After implementation of an infection control bundle, the incidence declined rapidly. WGS analysis revealed that two MDR E. cloacae were transmitted, and the majority were new cases. The incidence density of MDR-GNB colonization was 7.94/1000 patient-days (PD) before the intervention and 1.68/1000 PD during the altered antibiotic regimen. No infections with MDR-GNB occurred during the study.
Conclusions
Altering the antibiotic regimen with regard to selection pressure may be considered as part of an intervention bundle to rapidly control the emergence of MDR-GNB in suspected outbreak situations in the NICU."

There is increasing evidence that the hospital surface environment contributes to the spread of pathogens. However, evidence on how best to sample these surfaces is inconsistent and there is no guidance or legislation in place on how to do this. The aim of this review was to assess current literature on surface sampling methodologies, including the devices used, processing methods, and the environmental and biological factors that might influence results. Studies published prior to March 2019 were selected using relevant keywords from ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and PubMed. Abstracts were reviewed and all data-based studies in peer-reviewed journals in the English language were included. Microbiological air and water sampling in the hospital environment were not included. Although the numbers of cells or virions recovered from hospital surface environments were generally low, the majority of surfaces sampled were microbiologically contaminated. Of the organisms detected, multidrug-resistant organisms and clinically significant pathogens were frequently isolated and could, therefore, present a risk to vulnerable patients. Great variation was found between methods and the available data were incomplete and incomparable. Available literature on sampling methods demonstrated deficits with potential improvements for future research. Many of the studies included in the review were laboratory-based and not undertaken in the real hospital environment where sampling recoveries could be affected by the many variables present in a clinical environment. It was therefore difficult to draw overall conclusions; however, some recommendations for the design of routine protocols for surface sampling of healthcare environments can be made."

Background
Neonatal sepsis remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality. Maternal bacterial colonization plays a major role in transmission to the infant, with potential for subsequent development of neonatal sepsis with maternally derived strains.
Aim
To review the molecular evidence supporting transmission of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) from colonized mothers to their infants and the risk factors for MDR-GNB transmission.
Methods
PubMed and Scopus were searched for studies investigating the mechanisms, risk factors for and/or scale of transmission of MDR-GNB from colonized mothers to their infants. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to determine pooled proportions of MDR-GNB transmission and the neonatal outcomes of transmission.
Findings
Eight studies were included in the narrative description and six in the meta-analysis. Five studies used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to assess relatedness of isolates from colonized mothers and their infants. Pooled proportion of MDR-GNB transmission from colonized mothers to their infants was 27% (95% confidence interval (CI): 8–47%). Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae were the most frequently studied MDR-GNB pathogens transmitted between mother–infant pairs. Following mother-to-infant transmission of an MDR-GNB pathogen, the pooled proportion for the outcome of neonatal colonization was 19% (95% CI: 3–35%).
Conclusion
This systematic review strongly supports MDR and/or ESBL Enterobacteriaceae transmission from colonized mothers to their infants, with subsequent infant colonization. The risk factors contributing to transmission of MDR-GNB between colonized mothers and their infants warrants further research."

Background
Environmental hygiene is one of the most important strategies to prevent hospital-acquired infections by reducing pathogens in haematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patient rooms. This study was designed in response to JACIE requirements for microbiological monitoring, and aimed to assess environmental hygiene in protective isolation rooms.
Methods
Environmental cleanliness was assessed by measuring microbial loads in at-rest and operational conditions sampled from target surfaces, and in passive and active air from rooms occupied by patients with different grades of neutropenia. The study also evaluated whether microbial loads were influenced by isolation precautions.
Results
The failure rate of cleanliness on target surfaces in at-rest conditions was 0% compared with 37% for surfaces and 13% for passive and active air samples in operational conditions. Differences in failure rates were observed in the rooms of patients with different levels of neutropenia (P=0.036 for surfaces, 0.028% for passive air). No relationship was found between infections and microbial loads.
Conclusions
Microbiological assessment integrated with an enhanced monitoring programme for hospital hygiene provides invaluable information to drive infection control policies in HCT patients. These results highlight the need to set and validate strict standards for the assessment of cleanliness in a clinical setting."

In total, eight CPE carriers, including the index case, were identified among 110 residents. VIM-CPE spread was associated with the use of shared toilets in communal areas. Seven months after the first finding, all carriers were found to be VIM-negative, and after 1 year, VIM CPE was no longer detectable in the environment.
Conclusion
A customized bundled approach was needed to control the outbreak successfully. Current guidelines should be adapted to be suitable for all types of residential care homes in order to combat the spread of multi-resistant pathogens effectively."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The effects of early central venous catheter (CVC) removal on the clinical outcomes of patients with candidaemia remain controversial. This study evaluated the impact of delayed CVC removal on mortality according to the severity of comorbidities in patients with candidaemia.
Methods
Patients with candidaemia in a tertiary care hospital between January 2010 and December 2017 were included retrospectively. The severity of comorbidities was classified as low [Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score ≤3] or high (CCI score ≥4). Cases with removal of CVC >2 days after the onset of candidaemia or without CVC removal were classified as having delayed CVC removal.
Results
In total, 239 patients with candidaemia were included, excluding 18 who died within 2 days of onset of candidaemia. Of these, 149 had low CCI scores and 90 had high CCI scores. Septic shock [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=9.5] and delayed CVC removal (aOR=4.7) were significantly associated with increased 30-day mortality, whereas Candida parapsilosis infection (aOR=0.2) and cerebrovascular disease (aOR=0.3) were associated with decreased 30-day mortality, in patients with low CCI scores. Septic shock (aOR=13.0) was the only risk factor for 30-day mortality in those with high CCI scores. Delayed CVC removal was associated with increased 30-day mortality in patients with low CCI scores (50.0% vs 20.3%; P=0.001), but not in those with high CCI scores (50.0% vs 47.9%; P=0.87).
Conclusion
Early CVC removal may improve the survival of patients with candidaemia and low CCI scores, but no such protective effect was evident in those with high CCI scores."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hand washbasin U-bends have increasingly been associated with nosocomial outbreaks by Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is virtually ubiquitous in U-bends. Wastewater networks servicing U-bends are potential highways for trafficking pathogenic bacteria.
Aim
To use P. aeruginosa to investigate trafficking of bacteria between hospital washbasin U-bends.
Methods
Twenty-five washbasin U-bends in five locations in Dublin Dental University Hospital (DDUH) were investigated for trafficking of P. aeruginosa: 10 in Clinic 2 (C2), 10 in the Accident & Emergency Department (A&E) and five in three other locations. In addition, washbasin tap samples (N=80) and mains and tap water samples (N=72) were cultured for P. aeruginosa. Selected P. aeruginosa isolates recovered over 29 months underwent whole-genome sequencing, and relatedness was interpreted using whole-genome multi-locus sequence typing and pairwise single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis.
Findings
P. aeruginosa was recovered from all U-bends but not from taps or water. Eighty-three U-bend isolates yielded 10 sequence types (STs), with ST560 and ST179 from A&E, C2 and two other locations predominating (70%). ST560 was also recovered from a common downstream pipe. Isolates within ST560 and ST179 were highly related regardless of source. ST560 was divided into Cluster I (N=25) and Cluster II (N=2) with average allelic differences and SNPs of three and zero, and two and five, respectively. The 31 ST179 isolates exhibited an average allelic difference and SNPs of three and 12, respectively.
Conclusion
Highly related P. aeruginosa strains were identified in multiple U-bends in several DDUH locations, indicating trafficking via the wastewater network."

Background
There is a mismatch between research questions which are considered to be important by patients, carers and healthcare professionals and the research performed in many fields of medicine. No relevant studies which have assessed research priorities in healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) that have involved patients' and carers' opinions were identified in the literature.
Aim
The Healthcare-Associated Infections Priority Setting Partnership was established to identify the top research priorities in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HCAI in the UK, considering the opinions of all these groups.
Methods
The methods broadly followed the principles of the James Lind Alliance (JLA) priority setting activity.
Findings
In total, 259 unique valid research questions were identified from 221 valid responses to a consultation of patients, carers and healthcare professionals after seeking their opinions for research priorities. The steering committee of the priority setting partnership rationalized these to 50 unique questions. A literature review established that for these questions there were no recent high-quality systematic reviews, high-quality systematic reviews which concluded that further studies were necessary, or the steering committee considered that further research was required despite the conclusions of recent systematic reviews. An interim survey ranked the 50 questions, and the 10 main research priorities were identified from the top 32 questions by consensus at a final priority setting workshop of patients, carers and healthcare professionals using group discussions.
Conclusions
A priority setting process using JLA methods and principles involving patients, carers and healthcare professionals was used to identify the top 10 priority areas for research related to HCAI. Basic, translational, clinical and public health research would be required to address these uncertainties."

Background
A rapid test system using fluorescent Mycobacterium terrae to evaluate the tuberculocidal efficacy of disinfectants has recently been published. Results were obtained in a significantly shorter time than was previously possible.
Aim
To compare the European Standard test system with the fluorescence assay and to validate the rapid test system, including particularly the quantitative suspension test.
Methods
Quantitative suspension tests and quantitative carrier tests were carried out according to EN 14348 and EN 14563, respectively. Quantitative carrier tests and subsequent green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based determination of germicidal efficacy were carried out as described previously. A peracetic acid-based formulation was used as a test germicide.
Findings
Testing of the germicide in the quantitative suspension test EN 14348 and in the quantitative carrier test EN 14563 revealed tuberculocidal efficacy at a concentration of 1% after 15 min contact time. Accordingly, data obtained from the fluorescence assay demonstrated that a germicide concentration of 1% was effective after 15 min, indicating no live mycobacteria following this treatment. Thus, identical in-use parameters for tuberculocidal efficacy were obtained either by applying the quantitative suspension and quantitative carrier tests EN 14348 and EN 14563 or by using the GFP-based rapid test system.
Conclusion
The GFP-based rapid test system compares well with the established European Standard test procedure including both phase 2, step 1 and phase 2, step 2 tests and provides a rapid and sensitive tool for testing germicides for relevant in-use concentrations and contact times."

abstract = "Summary
Background
There is growing recognition by national and international policymakers of the contribution nurses make towards antimicrobial stewardship. Although undergraduate education provides an ideal opportunity to prepare nurses for antimicrobial stewardship roles and activities, only two-thirds of undergraduate nursing programmes incorporate any antimicrobial stewardship teaching and only 12% cover all the recommended antimicrobial stewardship principles. Nurses also report that they do not have a good knowledge of antibiotics, and many have not heard of the term antimicrobial stewardship.
Aim
To provide international consensus on the antimicrobial stewardship competency descriptors appropriate for undergraduate nurse education.
Methods
A modified Delphi approach comprising two online surveys delivered to an international panel of 15 individuals reflecting expertise in prescribing and medicines management in the education and practice of nurses; and antimicrobial stewardship. Data collection took place between February and March 2019.
Findings
A total of 15 participants agreed to become members of the expert panel, of whom 13 (86%) completed round 1 questionnaire, and 13 (100%) completed round 2. Consensus was achieved, with consistently high levels of agreement across panel members, on six overarching competency domains and 63 descriptors, essential for antimicrobial stewardship practice.
Conclusion
The competency descriptors should be used to direct undergraduate nurse education and the antimicrobial stewardship practices of qualified nurses (including those working in new roles such as Nursing Associates) due to the high levels of agreement reached on competency descriptors."

abstract = "Summary
In the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) approximately 9 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), and many are undiagnosed. Targeted active case finding initiatives are needed. Iatrogenic transmission of HBV/HCV is relevant in Europe but people at risk of infection are often overlooked. This study aimed to identify groups at increased risk of HBV/HCV infection due to iatrogenic transmission, including healthcare workers, and to estimate incidence and prevalence. PubMed and Embase were systematically searched in February 2017 using strings combining terms for HBV/HCV, occurrence and population subgroups. All retrieved publications were screened and included articles were quality assessed. A predefined set of variables were extracted, and detailed summary tables were developed per population group of interest, virus and outcome. Thirty-eight articles were included, two reported on HBV, 22 on HCV and 16 on both, contributing 70 estimates of prevalence or incidence among: haemodialysis recipients, diabetes patients, recipients of substances of human origin, recipients of medical/dental procedures and healthcare workers. Estimates varied widely from 0.4% to 11.7% for HBV and from 0.7% to over 90% for HCV with most being higher than in the general population. Despite the limited number of studies retrieved, mostly old and focused on populations with multiple risk factors, our findings highlight the importance of considering population groups at higher risk for HBV/HCV iatrogenic transmission as target groups for active case finding in the EU/EEA. Test offers should be guided by individual risk assessment alongside local epidemiological data and local context."

Background
Automated radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based hand-hygiene monitoring technology was implemented in an infectious disease department to study healthcare workers' (HCWs') practices and to improve hand hygiene.
Aim
To assess HCWs' attitudes towards this innovative monitoring device in order to anticipate resistance to change and facilitate future implementation.
Methods
In-depth interviews and an ethnographic approach.
Findings
From the perspective of HCWs, while they recognize the usefulness of RFID technology to prevent the transmission of infections to patients, they expressed concerns about risks related to RFID electromagnetic waves, as well as control by their superiors. Overall, HCWs' opinions oscillated between positive feelings characterized by enthusiasm for the possibility of changing their practices using technologies and research, and negative feelings marked by strong criticisms of these technologies and research. These criticisms included blaming hand-hygiene monitoring technology for decontextualizing HCWs' practices. They perceived the technologies through the prism of the local and national contexts in which they are embedded. From their point of view, technologies are primarily in the best interests of the project team. Thus, they affirm and maintain the different interests and objectives between themselves and the project team, crystallizing a conflict of professional norms and values between these two groups. The forms of resistance taken by HCWs were practical as well as oral.
Conclusion
Innovative technologies should be developed to address HCWs' attitudes surrounding RFIDs. It is crucial to inform HCWs about the nature of these technologies, although some criticisms about monitoring systems are based on more structural causes."

Background
Moraxella catarrhalis is a common agent causing upper and lower respiratory tract infections, particularly of ventilated patients. The bacteria are transmitted between humans by direct and indirect contacts. However, reports of nosocomial outbreaks by this pathogen are scarce.
Aim
To analyse M. catarrhalis strains isolated during an outbreak in a medical rehabilitation centre to reveal their clonal relationship and to elucidate potential transmission routes.
Methods
Extensive environmental and medical staff sampling was performed. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of 15 isolates were executed, including repetitive element palindromic polymerase chain reaction (repPCR) and whole-genome sequencing. Furthermore, an intensified hygiene regimen was installed.
Findings
The clonal nature of nine patient isolates and a simultaneous presence of separate entities including a strain isolated from a physician during staff screening was confirmed. Although neither asymptomatic carriers among the staff persons nor outbreak strain-contaminated fomites were identified for a specific intervention, the outbreak ceased due to maximum general and specific hygiene precautions. Retrospective analysis showed the increasing prevalence of M. catarrhalis strains over a period of two years before the incidence. Since then and after returning to the regular hygiene regimen, only one patient with a phenotypically diverse M. catarrhalis isolate has been documented.
Conclusion
The first M. catarrhalis outbreak involving nine patients of a neurological and trauma rehabilitation centre was reported. Potential transmission pathways were discussed. Comprehensive outbreak analyses insinuated the extension of routine laboratory storage time for defined species."

Background
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are among the most common adverse events in patient care, and account for substantial morbidity and mortality.
Aim
To obtain the first estimates of the current prevalence of HAIs and antimicrobial resistance in acute care hospitals in Kyiv, Ukraine.
Methods
Prospective surveillance was conducted from January 2014 to December 2016 in five acute care hospitals in Kyiv. Definitions of HAIs were adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network.
Findings
Among 53,884 patients, 3753 (7%) HAIs were observed. The most frequently reported HAIs were respiratory tract infections (pneumonia 19.4%, lower respiratory tract infections 4.1%), surgical site infections (19.6%), urinary tract infections (17.5%) and bloodstream infections (10.6%). Death during hospitalization was reported in 7.2% cases of HAI. The micro-organisms most frequently isolated from HAIs were Escherichia coli (15.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.8%), Enterococcus spp. (10.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.9%) and Klebsiella spp. (8.9%). Meticillin resistance was reported in 28.2% of S. aureus, and 14.2% of enterococci were resistant to vancomycin. Overall, 35.1% of all Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, with the highest resistance rates seen in K. pneumoniae (53.8%) and E. coli (32.1%).
Conclusions
Infection control priorities in hospitals should include prevention of surgical site infections, pneumonia, bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections. These results may help to delineate the requirements for infection prevention and control in acute care hospitals."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The National Health Service in England advises hospitals collect data on hospital-onset diarrhoea (HOD). Contemporaneous data on HOD are lacking.
Aim
To investigate prevalence, aetiology and management of HOD on medical, surgical and elderly-care wards.
Methods
A cross-sectional study in a volunteer sample of UK hospitals, which collected data on one winter and one summer day in 2016. Patients admitted ≥72 h were screened for HOD (definition: ≥2 episodes of Bristol Stool Type 5–7 the day before the study, with diarrhoea onset >48 h after admission). Data on HOD aetiology and management were collected prospectively.
Findings
Data were collected on 141 wards in 32 hospitals (16 acute, 16 teaching). Point-prevalence of HOD was 4.5% (230/5142 patients; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.9–5.0%). Teaching hospital HOD prevalence (5.9%, 95% CI 5.1–6.9%) was twice that of acute hospitals (2.8%, 95% CI 2.1–3.5%; odds ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.7–3.0). At least one potential cause was identified in 222/230 patients (97%): 107 (47%) had a relevant underlying condition, 125 (54%) were taking antimicrobials, and 195 (85%) other medication known to cause diarrhoea. Nine of 75 tested patients were Clostridium difficile toxin positive (4%). Eighty (35%) patients had a documented medical assessment of diarrhoea. Documentation of HOD in medical notes correlated with testing for C. difficile (78% of those tested vs 38% not tested, P<0.001). One-hundred and forty-four (63%) patients were not isolated following diarrhoea onset.
Conclusion
HOD is a prevalent symptom affecting thousands of patients across the UK health system each day. Most patients had multiple potential causes of HOD, mainly iatrogenic, but only a third had medical assessment. Most were not tested for C. difficile and were not isolated."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are among the most common hospital-acquired infections, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. A major reason for this is that urinary catheters are not yet capable of preventing CAUTIs.
Aim
To develop an anti-infective urinary catheter.
Methods
An efficient silver-polytetrafluoroethylene (Ag-PTFE) nanocomposite coating was deposited on whole silicone catheters, and two in-vitro bladder models were designed to test antibacterial (against Escherichia coli) and anti-encrustation (against Proteus mirabilis) performances. Each model was challenged with two different concentrations of bacterial suspension.
Findings
Compared with uncoated catheters, coated catheters significantly inhibited bacterial migration and biofilm formation on the external catheter surfaces. The time to develop bacteriuria was an average of 1.8 days vs 4 days and 6 days vs 41 days when the urethral meatus was infected with 106 and 102 cells/mL, respectively. For anti-encrustation tests, the coated catheter significantly resisted encrustation, although it did not strongly inhibit the increases in bacterial density and urinary pH. The time to blockage, which was found to be independent of the initial bacterial concentration in the bladder, was extended from 36.2±1.1 h (uncoated) to 89.5±3.54 h (coated) following bacterial contamination with 103 cells/mL in the bladder. Moreover, the coated catheter exhibited excellent biocompatibility with L929 fibroblast cells.
Conclusion
Ag-PTFE coated Foley catheters should undergo further clinical trials to determine their ability to prevent CAUTIs during catheterization."

abstract = "Summary
Aim
To describe the investigation and management of a meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outbreak on a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the lessons learnt.
Methods
This was an outbreak report and case–control study conducted in a 40-cot NICU in a tertiary referral hospital and included all infants colonized/infected with gentamicin-resistant MRSA.
Intervention
Standard infection-control measures including segregation of infants, barrier precautions, enhanced cleaning, assessment of staff practice including hand hygiene, and increased MRSA screening of infants were implemented. Continued MRSA acquisitions led to screening of all NICU staff. A case–control study was performed to assess staff contact with colonized babies and inform the management of the outbreak.
Findings
Eight infants were colonized with MRSA (spa type t2068), one of whom subsequently developed an MRSA bacteraemia. MRSA colonization was significantly associated with lower gestational age; lower birthweight and with being a twin. Three nurses were MRSA colonized but only one nurse (45) was colonized with MRSA spa type t2068. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified being cared for by nurse 45 as an independent risk factor for MRSA colonization.
Conclusions
Lack of accurate recording of which nurses looked after which infants (and when) made identification of the risk posed by being cared for by particular nurses difficult. If this had been clearer, it may have enabled earlier identification of the colonized nurse, avoiding subsequent cases. This study highlights the benefit of using a case–control study, which showed that most nurses had no association with colonized infants."

Background
Hand hygiene compliance even before infection-prone procedures (indication 2, ‘before aseptic tasks’, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)) remains disappointing.
Aim
To improve hand hygiene compliance by implementing gloved hand disinfection as a resource-neutral process optimization strategy.
Methods
We performed a three-phase intervention study on a stem cell transplant ward. After baseline evaluation of hand hygiene compliance (phase 1) gloved hand disinfection was allowed (phase 2) and restricted (phase 3) to evaluate and differentiate intervention derived from learning and time effects. The incidence of severe infections as well as of hospital-acquired multidrug-resistant bacteria was recorded by active surveillance.
Findings
Hand hygiene compliance improved significantly from 50% to 76% (P < 0.001) when gloved hand disinfection was allowed. The biggest increase was for infection-prone procedures (WHO 2) from 31% to 65%; P < 0.001. Severe infections decreased by trend (from 6.0 to 2.5 per 1000 patient-days) whereas transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms was not affected.
Conclusion
Gloved hand disinfection significantly improved compliance with the hand hygiene, especially in activities relevant to infections and infection prevention. Thus, this process optimization may be an additional, easy implementable, resource-neutral tool for a highly vulnerable patient cohort."

Background
A growing body of evidence associates malnutrition with several adverse outcomes.
Aim
To investigate the link between malnutrition with surgical site and periprosthetic joint infections (SSIs and PJIs) following total knee and hip arthroplasty (TKA and THA) through a comprehensive meta-analysis of observational studies.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus databases through December 2018, and recent proceedings of major orthopaedic meetings. Data from eligible studies were extracted and synthesized; pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated.
Findings
Seven publications were included, reporting eight independent cohort studies with >250,000 subjects. SSIs and PJIs were more likely to develop in malnourished patients (OR: 2.49; 95% CI: 2.13–2.90; and 3.62; 2.33–5.64, respectively). The association of SSI with malnutrition was evident both after TKA (2.42; 1.94–3.02) and after THA (2.66; 1.64–4.30). Similarly, PJI was associated with malnutrition after TKA (2.55; 1.10–5.91) and after THA (3.10; 1.84–5.25). Finally, PJI correlated with malnutrition both after primary arthroplasty (3.58; 1.82–7.03) and revision arthroplasty (3.96; 2.47–6.33). The subgroup analysis by study setting confirmed the relationship between PJI and malnutrition in hospital (6.02; 3.07–11.81) and population-based (2.80; 1.76–4.44) studies.
Conclusion
Malnutrition is associated with PJIs and SSIs after total joint arthroplasty. Further high-quality research is warranted to confirm or refute these findings."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The effectiveness of an airflow system in preventing entrainment of particles carrying micro-organisms from the periphery of an operating room (OR) or instrument lay-up room (ILR) is affected by many variables. It is suspected that differences in the design of the systems affect the effective protection ratio (EPR): the ratio of the size of the protected area to the surface area of the supply canopy. However, no analysis has yet been done to determine which design variables have a significant effect on this ratio.
Aim
To evaluate which design variables have a significant effect on the performance of airflow systems (EPR) in ORs and ILRs.
Methods
All general and teaching hospitals in the Netherlands (N = 77) were asked to provide data from their standardized (at-rest measurement method) compulsory systems assessment reports for ORs and ILRs. Nineteen hospitals (25%) with a total of 22 hospital sites supplied information of sufficient completeness and homogeneity, resulting in measurement data for 101 ORs and 23 ILRs. This dataset was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences.
Findings
For ORs, important predictors for the EPR were: shape of the canopy; air speed under the supply canopy; height of the canopy screen; type of system; and size of the canopy. These significant predictors (P < 0.05) explain 48% of the outcome in the dataset. For ILRs, significant predictors for the EPR were: the position of exhaust air terminals; height of the canopy screen; and size of the canopy. These significant predictors explain 66% of the outcome in the dataset.
Conclusion
On the basis of the dataset available for analysis, it is concluded that the ratio of the size of the protected area to the surface area of the supply canopy (EPR) improves with the presence and the height of a screen around the canopy, the surface area of the supply canopy, and the air speed of the supply air under the canopy. This information can be used as guidance for the future design of unidirectional displacement airflow systems."

Background
Sporicidal surface disinfection is recommended to control transmission of Clostridium difficile in healthcare facilities. EN 17126 provides a method to determine the sporicidal activity in suspension and has been approved as a European standard. In addition, a sporicidal surface test has been proposed.
Aim
To determine the interlaboratory reproducibility of a test method for evaluating the susceptibility of a C. difficile spore preparation to a biocidal formulation following the 4-field test (EN 16615 methodology).
Methods
Nine laboratories participated. C. difficile NCTC 13366 spores were used. Glutaraldehyde (1% and 6%; 15 min) and peracetic acid (PAA; 0.01% and 0.04%; 15 min) were used to determine the spores' susceptibility in suspension in triplicate.
Findings
One-percent glutaraldehyde revealed a mean decimal log10 reduction of 1.03 with variable results in the nine laboratories (0.37–1.49) and a reproducibility of 0.38. The effect of 6% glutaraldehyde was stronger (mean: 2.05; range: 0.96–4.29; reproducibility: 0.86). PAA revealed similar results. An exemplary biocidal formulation based on 5% PAA was used at 0.5% (non-effective concentration) and 4% (effective concentration) to determine the sporicidal efficacy (4-field test) under clean conditions in triplicate with a contact time of 15 min. When used at 0.5% it demonstrated an overall log10 reduction of 2.68 (range: 2.35–3.57) and at 4% of 4.61 (range: 3.82–5.71). The residual contamination on the three primarily uncontaminated test fields was <50 cfu/25 cm2 in one out of nine laboratories (0.5%) and in seven out of nine laboratories (4%).
Conclusion
The interlaboratory reproducibility seems to be robust."

Background
Nosocomial infections by respiratory viruses undetected by rapid tests are not often diagnosed. For paediatric patients with background diseases, nosocomial infection could be fatal.
Aim
To determine the relationship between developing symptoms by respiratory viruses undetectable by rapid tests and respiratory risks and to improve the management of infection control.
Methods
Two episodes of nosocomial infection by human bocavirus (HBoV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) were retrospectively investigated in a tertiary hospital paediatric ward in Japan. Viruses were identified by polymerase chain reaction to determine infection control management. When viruses of the same species were detected from different patients, the virus homology was investigated. The relationship between respiratory risks and developing symptoms was statistically investigated.
Findings
Three and four patients with respiratory risks in the HBoV and HRV outbreaks, respectively, developed respiratory symptoms. The nucleotide sequences of two patients in the HBoV outbreak and all four patients in the HRV outbreak were phylogenetically close. In both outbreaks, the patients with respiratory risks developed significantly more symptoms than those without any risk (P = 0.035 and 0.018, respectively). After the patients with respiratory infection were separated from those with respiratory risks, no additional nosocomial infection occurred.
Conclusion
Patients with respiratory risks easily develop respiratory symptoms and acquire severe symptoms of nosocomial infection by those viruses. In a paediatric ward, we should adopt not only standard precautions but also isolation management of the patients with respiratory symptoms, even if they have negative results in rapid tests."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is an opportunistic infection occurring in renal transplant patients. Over a 14-month period an increase in PCP cases was identified among our renal transplant cohort.
Aim
The outbreak population was studied to identify potential risk factors for the development of PCP.
Methods
A retrospective analysis of hospital records was carried out, with each case being matched with two case-linked controls. Information was collected on patient demographics, laboratory tests, and hospital visits pre and post development of infection.
Findings
No patients were receiving PCP prophylaxis at the time of infection and mean time from transplantation to developing PCP was 4.7 years (range: 0.51–14.5). The PCP group had a significantly lower mean estimated glomerular filtration rate than the control group (29.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs 70 mL/min−1 (P = 0.0007)). Three patients were treated for active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection prior to PCP diagnosis and two had active CMV at the time of diagnosis compared to none in the control group (P = 0.001). Those who developed PCP were more likely to have shared a hospital visit with another patient who went on to develop PCP; 37% of clinic visits vs 19% (P = 0.014).
Conclusion
This study highlights the ongoing risk of opportunistic infection several years after transplantation and adds weight to potential person-to-person Pneumocystis jirovecii transmission. Risk factors have been identified which may highlight those most at risk, enabling targeted rather than blanket long-term PCP prophylaxis."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The spread of pathogens via the airborne route is often underestimated, and little is known about the extent to which airborne microbial contamination levels vary throughout the day and night in hospital facilities.
Aims
To evaluate airborne contamination levels within intensive care unit (ICU) isolation rooms over 10–24-h periods in order to improve understanding of the variability of environmental aerial bioburden, and the extent to which ward activities may contribute.
Methods
Environmental air monitoring was conducted within occupied and vacant inpatient isolation rooms. A sieve impactor sampler was used to collect 500-L air samples every 15 min over 10-h (08:00–18:00 h) and 24-h (08:00–08:00 h) periods. Samples were collected, room activity was logged, and bacterial contamination levels were recorded as colony-forming units (cfu)/m3 air.
Findings
A high degree of variability in levels of airborne contamination was observed across all scenarios in the studied isolation rooms. Air bioburden increased as room occupancy increased, with air contamination levels highest in rooms occupied for the longest time during the study (10 days) (mean 104.4 cfu/m3, range 12–510 cfu/m3). Counts were lowest in unoccupied rooms (mean 20 cfu/m3) and during the night.
Conclusion
Peaks in airborne contamination were directly associated with an increase in activity levels. This study provides the first clear evidence of the extent of variability in microbial airborne levels over 24-h periods in ICU isolation rooms, and found direct correlation between microbial load and ward activity."

Background
Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa can negatively affect patients and hospitals.
Aim
To evaluate excess mortality and cost burden among patients hospitalized with suspected respiratory infections due to MDR P. aeruginosa vs patients with non-MDR P. aeruginosa in 78 United States (US) hospitals.
Methods
This study analyzed electronically captured microbiological and outcomes data of patients hospitalized with non-duplicate P. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory sources collected ≥3 days after admission to identify hospital-onset MDR or non-MDR P. aeruginosa per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition. The risk of multi-drug resistance was estimated on mortality, length of stay (LOS), cost, operation gain/loss, and 30-day readmission. A sensitivity analysis was conducted utilizing a cohort with pharmacy data available.
Findings
Of 523 MDR and 1381 non-MDR P. aeruginosa cases, unadjusted mortality was 23.7% vs 18.0% and multi-variable-adjusted mortality was 20.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 14.3–27.2%) vs 15.5% (95% CI: 11.2–20.9%; P=0.026), the average adjusted excess LOS was 6.7 days (P<0.001); excess cost per case was US$22,370 higher (P=0.002) and operational loss per case was US$10,661 (P=0.024) greater, and the multi-variable adjusted readmission rate was 16.2% (95% CI: 11.2–22.9%) vs 11.1% (95% CI: 7.8–15.6%; P=0.006). The sensitivity analysis yielded similar results.
Conclusions
Compared with suspected infections due to non-MDR P. aeruginosa, patients with MDR P. aeruginosa had higher risk of mortality, readmission, and longer LOS, as well as US$20,000 incremental cost and >US$10,000 incremental net loss per case after controlling for patient and hospital characteristics."

Background
Infections by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative (MDRGN) bacteria are among the greatest contemporary health concerns, especially in intensive care units (ICUs), and may be associated with increased hospitalization time, morbidity, costs, and mortality.
Aim
The study aimed to predict carbapenem-resistant MDRGN acquisition in ICUs, to determine its risk factors, and to assess the impact of this acquisition on mortality rate.
Methods
A matched case–control study was performed in patients admitted to the ICU at a large Brazilian hospital over a five-year period. Cases were defined as patients who acquired carbapenem-resistant MDRGN bacteria during hospitalization. Controls were defined as patients who had no detection of carbapenem-resistant MDRGN bacteria. Cases were matched to controls according to the admission period. Risk factors were identified by multiple logistic regression using a stepwise selection method.
Findings
In total, 343 cases and 1029 controls were analysed. The 30-day mortality rate for subjects with ICU-associated carbapenem-resistant MDRGN was 37.6%. Five variables were identified as statistically significant and more relevant for the acquisition of multidrug-resistant strains: increased Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3, patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and exposure to haemodialysis catheter, central venous catheter, or mechanical ventilation. Models developed displayed good results with an accuracy of ∼90%. Patients who acquired MDRGN were 2.72 times more likely to die than non-MDRGN acquisition patients.
Conclusion
Finding risk factors and developing predictive models may benefit patients through early detection and by controlling the spread of MDR. The presence of mechanical ventilation and central venous catheter were the main risk factors demonstrated, and their use requires special attention."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Although the hand hygiene (HH) procedure is simple, the related behaviour is complex and is not readily understood, explained or changed. There is a need for practical tools to provide data that can guide healthcare managers and practitioners not only on the ‘what’ (the standards that must be met), but also the ‘how’ (guidance on how to achieve the standards).
Aim
To develop a valid questionnaire to evaluate attitudes to the factors that influence engagement in HH behaviour that can be readily completed, administered and analysed by healthcare professionals to identify appropriate intervention strategies. Construct validity was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis, predictive validity was assessed through comparison with self-reported HH behaviour, and convergent validity was assessed through direct unit-level observation of HH behaviour.
Methods
The Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model was used to design a 25-item questionnaire that was distributed to intensive care unit (ICU) personnel in Ireland. Direct observation of HH behaviour was carried out at two ICUs.
Findings
In total, 292 responses to the survey (response rate 41.0%) were included in the analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis resulted in a 17-item questionnaire. Multiple regression revealed that a model including capability, opportunity and motivation was a significant predictor of self-reported behavioural intention [F(3,209)=22.58, P<0.001]. However, the opportunity factor was not found to make a significant contribution to the regression model.
Conclusion
The COM-B HH questionnaire is reliable and valid, and provides data to support the development and evaluation of HH interventions that meet the needs of specific healthcare units."

Antibiotic resistance is a growing global problem associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and presents a significant financial and economic burden on healthcare. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been proven effective for curing recurrent Clostridium difficile infections, however no systematic review to date has addressed its effectiveness for decolonization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from the gut. The aim of this study was to establish whether faecal microbiota transplantation decolonizes antibiotic-resistant bacteria from the gut of colonized adults. A systematic review was performed by undertaking a comprehensive search on MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, PubMed and CINAHL databases for evidence up until May 2018. Randomized and non-randomized studies evaluating the effects of FMT on gut colonization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in adults were eligible. Studies were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institution critical appraisal checklists. Quality of reporting was assessed using PROCESS and CARE checklists. Data was synthesized narratively, along with a meta-analysis of proportions for the primary outcome. Five studies with a total number of 52 participants were included. Evidence of low quality showed that decolonization was achieved in half of the cases one month after FMT with higher response noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lower response in Klebsiella pneumoniae with New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) mechanisms of resistance. In successful cases, 70% of decolonization cases occurred within the first week after FMT. Few temporary adverse events were identified. Despite the limitations of the included studies, evidence from this review indicates a potential benefit of FMT as a decolonization intervention, which can only be confirmed by future well-designed RCTs."

abstract = "SUMMARY
Background
Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) and bloodstream infection (CABSI) are leading causes of healthcare-associated infection in England's National Health Service (NHS), but health-economic evidence to inform investment in prevention is lacking.
Aims
To quantify the health-economic burden and value of prevention of urinary-catheter-associated infection among adult inpatients admitted to NHS trusts in 2016/17.
Methods
A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the annual prevalence of CAUTI and CABSI, and their associated excess health burdens [quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] and economic costs (£ 2017). Patient-level datasets and literature were synthesized to estimate population structure, model parameters and associated uncertainty. Health and economic benefits of catheter prevention were estimated. Scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
Findings
The model estimated 52,085 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 42,967–61,360] CAUTIs and 7529 (UI 6857–8622) CABSIs, of which 38,084 (UI 30,236–46,541) and 2524 (UI 2319–2956) were hospital-onset infections, respectively. Catheter-associated infections incurred 45,717 (UI 18,115–74,662) excess bed-days, 1467 (UI 1337–1707) deaths and 10,471 (UI 4783–13,499) lost QALYs. Total direct hospital costs were estimated at £54.4M (UI £37.3–77.8M), with an additional £209.4M (UI £95.7–270.0M) in economic value of QALYs lost assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000/QALY. Respectively, CABSI accounted for 47% (UI 32–67%) and 97% (UI 93–98%) of direct costs and QALYs lost. Every catheter prevented could save £30 (UI £20–44) in direct hospital costs and £112 (UI £52–146) in QALY value.
Conclusions
Hospital catheter prevention is poised to reap substantial health-economic gains, but community-oriented interventions are needed to target the large burden imposed by community-onset infection."

Background
It is not known whether age alone or the increased comorbidities in older patients are responsible for the higher rate of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) in older patients.
Aim
To test the hypothesis that age alone is not a risk factor for PJI after total joint arthroplasty.
Methods
This retrospective study included the review of 23,966 patients undergoing primary total hip and knee arthroplasty between January 1st, 2010 and December 31st, 2016 at a single institution. Patients who developed PJI, as defined by International Consensus Meeting criteria, were identified. All enrolled patients were divided into three groups that included patients aged <65 years (N = 12,761), 65–74 years (N = 6850) and ≥75 years (N = 4355). Using multivariate analysis and propensity score matching analysis, the possible association between age and PJI was examined.
Findings
The incidence of PJI in the entire cohort was 0.72% (171 out of 23,966). Multivariate analysis adjusting for all variables, except age, demonstrated that, compared to the patients aged <65 years, there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of PJI for patients aged 65–74 years (odds ratio: 0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.55–1.42; P = 0.62) or for patients aged ≥75 years (0.69; 0.36–1.32; P = 0.26).
Conclusion
When adjusting for confounding variables, age alone is not a risk factor for PJI. Studies evaluating the influence of age on the incidence of PJI should take into account the other confounding variables that contribute to PJI."

To evaluate the workflow and benefits of EpiSeq solution (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) in exploring the increased incidence of S. aureus bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
Methods
Four S. aureus bacteraemia isolates and 27 colonization isolates obtained between January and July 2016 were submitted to the ‘all in one solution’ EpiSeq [WGS, quality data assessment, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), spa typing, virulome and resistome characterization, and phylogenetic tree construction]. More in-depth analyses were performed (whole-genome MLST and whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (wgSNP)] with BioNumerics software (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium).
Findings
Nine different sequence types and 13 different spa types were found among the 31 isolates studied. Among those isolates, 11 (seven patients) were ST146 spa type t002, five (four patients) were ST30 and four (four patients) were ST398. The 11 ST146 isolates had a maximum of seven pairwise SNP differences.
Conclusion
Use of EpiSeq solution allowed fast demonstration of the polyclonal profile of the MSSA population in neonates, and enabled the suspicion of a global outbreak to be ruled out. However, wgSNP analysis showed the transmission and persistence of one sequence type for over six months in the NICU, and enabled the infection control team to adapt its response."

Objectives
Flexible endoscopes are difficult to decontaminate, and endoscope-associated infections are increasing. This report describes an outbreak of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa identified following an increase in incidence of clinical infections associated with flexible ureteroscopy at a tertiary care centre in the UK.
Methods
Clinical, laboratory and central decontamination unit (CDU) records were reviewed to determine the extent of the problem, and links to the used endoscopes. Audits of the ureteroscopy procedure, endoscopy unit and CDU were performed. Endoscopes were sampled, cultured and examined for structural integrity. All available isolates were typed.
Results
Thirteen patients developed clinical infections linked to two flexible ureteroscopes. The first ureteroscope was likely colonized from a known infected patient and the second ureteroscope after use on another patient infected by the first. Risk factors identified include surface cuts, stretching and puckering of the outer cover in both ureteroscopes, absence of bedside cleaning, overnight delay between the ureteroscopy and decontamination, inadequate drying after decontamination and non-traceability of connector valves.
Conclusions
The adequacy of flexible endoscope decontamination depends on numerous steps. With the increasing global incidence of multi-drug resistant organisms, stringent monitoring of the flexible endoscopy process by users and decontamination units is essential."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In 2011–2012, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) initiated the first European point prevalence survey (PPS) of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) in addition to targeted surveillance of the incidence of specific types of HCAI such as surgical site infections (SSIs).
Aim
To investigate whether national and multi-country SSI incidence can be estimated from ECDC PPS data.
Methods
In all, 159 hospitals were included from 15 countries that participated in both ECDC surveillance modules, aligning surgical procedures in the incidence surveillance to corresponding specialties from the PPS. National daily prevalence of SSIs was simulated from the incidence surveillance data, the Rhame and Sudderth (R&S) formula was used to estimate national and multi-country SSI incidence from the PPS data, and national incidence per specialty was predicted using a linear model including data from the PPS.
Findings
The simulation of daily SSI prevalence from incidence surveillance of SSIs showed that prevalence fluctuated randomly depending on the day of measurement. The correlation between the national aggregated incidence estimated with R&S formula and observed SSI incidence was low (correlation coefficient = 0.24), but specialty-specific incidence results were more reliable, especially when the number of included patients was large (correlation coefficients ranging from 0.40 to 1.00). The linear prediction model including PPS data had low proportion of explained variance (0.40).
Conclusion
Due to a lack of accuracy, use of PPS data to estimate SSI incidence is recommended only in situations where incidence surveillance of SSIs is not performed, and where sufficiently large samples of PPS data are available."

Background
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a significant cause of increased medical costs, morbidity, mortality, and have been partly associated with sinks, their waste water outlets and associated pipework.
Aim
To determine whether an engineered sink could limit microbial aerosol contaminants in the air and sink basin.
Methods
Multiple comparisons were undertaken between an experimental sink, designed to limit aerosolization and p-trap contamination to a control hospital sink, both connected to a common drain system. The experimental sink was equipped with ultraviolet light (UV), an aerosol containment hood, ozonated water generator and a flush system to limit bacterial growth/aerosolization and limit microbial growth in the p-trap. Nutrient material was added daily to simulate typical material discarded into a hospital sink. Surface collection swabs, settle plates and p-trap contamination levels were assessed for bacteria and fungi.
Findings
The experimental sink had significantly decreased levels of bacterial and fungal p-trap contamination (99.9% for Tryptic Soy (TSA) and Sabouraud agar (SAB) plates) relative to the initial levels. Aerosol-induced contaminant from the p-traps was significantly lower for the experimental vs the control sink for TSA (76%) and SAB (86%) agar settle plates.
Conclusions
Limiting microbial contamination is critical for the control of nosocomial infections of in-room sinks, which provide a major source of contamination. Our experimental sink studies document that regular ozonated water rinsing of the sink surface, decontamination of p-trap water, and UV decontamination of surfaces limits microbial aerosolization and surface contamination, with potential to decrease patient exposure and reduce hospital acquired infections."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Over the last decade there has been a rapid, worldwide increase in carbapenem resistance, which is of growing concern. The main protagonists, the carbapenemases Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), oxacillinase β-lactamase 48 (OXA-48), imipenemase metallo-β-lactamase (IMP), Verona integron-borne metallo-β-lactamase (VIM), and New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) have also been reported across the UK. However, these reports are derived from a combination of reactive screening, outbreak control, inpatient surveillance, and diagnostic samples. Therefore, the true community prevalence is unknown.
Aim
To determine the community prevalence of carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) in the area served by Barts Health NHS Trust.
Methods
Active screening of 200 non-duplicate community stool samples was performed. Patient demographics and foreign travel history were extracted from the laboratory information management system to identify potential risk factors for carriage of CPOs.
Findings
Patients in this study were aged from one to 93 years and were evenly distributed between male and female. Foreign travel in the last year was listed for 46 out of 200 (23%) patients, with the most commonly visited countries including Bangladesh (4%), India (2.5%), Morocco (2%), and Turkey (1.5%). However, only one patient tested positive for a CPO, an NDM-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and this patient had travelled to the Caribbean.
Conclusion
To date, there have been no studies investigating the prevalence of CPOs in the UK community. Given the high-risk patient population served by Barts Health NHS Trust, it is reassuring that the prevalence observed here was low. However, it should be highlighted that travel to countries not previously categorized as high risk may also pose a threat."

Background
Awareness of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial use in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) is increasing. In 2017, the third national point prevalence survey (PPS) was conducted in Italy as part of the third ‘Healthcare-Associated Infections in European Long-Term Care Facilities’ (HALT3) study.
Aim
To report the results of HALT3 and analyse the resident population of LTCFs, implementation of good practices, prevalence of infections and antimicrobial use.
Methods
The survey was designed as a PPS, carried out from April to June 2017. All residents who lived full-time in the institution were included. All facilities were asked to complete an institutional questionnaire, a ward list for all residents, and a resident questionnaire for those residents presenting with signs/symptoms of active infection and/or receiving an antimicrobial agent.
Findings
In total, 418 facilities took part in the study; 24,132 residents were eligible, and most were aged >85 years, disoriented and incontinent. The prevalence of HAIs was 3.9%, and 50% of the institutions reported that they had a professional trained in infection control on their staff. Only 26.4% of infections were confirmed by a microbiological sample, and 26.9% of the isolated micro-organisms were resistant to at least one antimicrobial class. In total, 1022 residents received at least one antimicrobial agent, and cephalosporins were prescribed most commonly.
Conclusion
The number of infection control and antimicrobial stewardship measures implemented was found to be considerably higher in this study compared with previous studies. This could lead to a reduction in the prevalence of HAIs, antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance. Further studies are needed to monitor these aspects."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Certain Clostridium difficile ribotypes have been associated with complex disease phenotypes including recurrence and increased severity, especially the well-described hypervirulent RT027. This study aimed to determine the pattern of ribotypes causing infection and the association, if any, with severity.
Methods
All faecal samples submitted to a large diagnostic laboratory for C. difficile testing between 2011 and 2013 were subject to routine testing and culture. All C. difficile isolates were ribotyped, and associated clinical and demographic patient data were retrieved and linked to ribotyping data.
Results
In total, 86 distinct ribotypes were identified from 705 isolates of C. difficile. RT002 and RT015 were the most prevalent (22.5%, N=159). Only five isolates (0.7%) were hypervirulent RT027. Ninety of 450 (20%) patients with clinical information available died within 30 days of C. difficile isolation. RT220, one of the 10 most common ribotypes, was associated with elevated median C-reactive protein and significantly increased 30-day all-cause mortality compared with RT002 and RT015, and with all other ribotypes found in the study.
Conclusions
A wide range of C. difficile ribotypes were responsible for C. difficile infection presentations. Although C. difficile-associated mortality has reduced in recent years, expansion of lineages associated with increased severity could herald increases in future mortality. Enhanced surveillance for emerging lineages such as RT220 that are associated with more severe disease is required, with genomic approaches to dissect pathogenicity."

Background
Labelling outbreaks in surveillance data is necessary to train advanced analytical methods for outbreak detection, but there is a lack of software tools dedicated to this task.
Aim
To evaluate the usability of a web-based tool by infection control practitioners for labelling potential outbreaks.
Methods
A mixed methods design was used to evaluate how 25 experts from France and Canada interacted with a web-based application to identify potential outbreaks. Each expert used the application to retrospectively review 11–12 1-year incidence time series from 23 different types of micro-organism. The interactions between the users and the application were recorded and analysed using mixed effect models. The users' comments were analysed via qualitative methods.
Findings
From the 240 reviews completed, 439 potential outbreaks were labelled, approximately half with a high probability. Significant heterogeneity was observed between users regarding their answers and behaviours (evaluation time, usage of the different options). A significant learning effect was also observed for the experts' interactions with the tool, but this did not seem to impact their answers. The content analysis of the comments highlighted the difficulty of early outbreak identification for practitioners, but also the potential utility of web applications such as that evaluated for routine surveillance.
Conclusion
The interactive web application was both usable and useful for infection control practitioners. Its implementation in routine practice could help professionals to identify potential outbreaks while creating data to train automated detection algorithms."

Background
Blood culture contamination (BCC) increases length of stay (LOS) and leads to unnecessary antimicrobial therapy and/or hospital-acquired conditions (HACs).
Aim
To quantify the magnitude of additional LOS, costs to hospitals and society, and harm to patients attributable to BCC.
Methods
A retrospective matched survival analysis was performed involving hospitalized patients with septicaemia-compatible symptoms. BCC costs, HACs and potential savings were calculated based on the primary LOS data, a modified Delphi process and published sources. The cost analysis compared standard care with interventions for reducing BCC, and estimated annual economic and clinical consequences for a typical hospital and for the USA as a whole.
Findings
Patients with BCC experienced a mean increase in LOS of 2.35 days (P=0.0076). Avoiding BCC would decrease costs by $6463 [$4818 from inpatient care (53% of which was from reduced LOS) and 26% from reduced antibiotic use]. Annually, in a typical 250- to 400-bed hospital, employing phlebotomists would save $1.3 million and prevent 24 HACs (including two cases of Clostridium difficile infection); based on clinical efficacy evidence, use of the studied initial specimen diversion device (ISDD) would save $1.9 million and prevent 34 HACs (including three cases of C. difficile infection). In the USA, the respective strategies would prevent 69,300 and 102,900 HACs (including 6000 and 8900 cases of C. difficile infection) and save $5 and $7.5 billion.
Conclusion
Costs and clinical burdens associated with false-positive cultures are substantial and can be reduced by available interventions, including phlebotomists and use of ISDD."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The dispersal of airborne norovirus (NoV) particles from the floor after contamination with faeces or vomit is a challenge for infection control, as this pathogen is infectious at low doses. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a safe protocol for floor decontamination.
Aim
To assess the presence of residual NoV-GII particles on floors and airborne particles following various floor decontamination procedures.
Methods
Two types of floor (vinyl and granite) were contaminated intentionally with 10% human faeces, positive for NoV-GII. Two decontamination protocols were implemented: cleaning followed by disinfection using 1% sodium hypochlorite, and cleaning followed by disinfection using a manual ultraviolet C (UV-C) light device. Swab samples were taken from the floors, and air samples were obtained using an air sampler. The TaqMan method for real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was employed for analysis.
Findings
The disinfection protocol using 1% sodium hypochlorite after cleaning proved to be more effective than cleaning followed by UV-C light exposure (P<0.001). Viral particles were detected in 27 of 36 air samples after cleaning, with no significant difference between the two floor types. On average, 617 genome copies/sample were identified in air samples after cleaning, but the number decreased gradually after disinfection.
Conclusion
NoV-GII can be aerosolized during floor cleaning, and its particles may be inhaled and then swallowed or can settle on surfaces. Therefore, residual viral particles on floors must be fully eliminated. Cleaning followed by 10 min of 1% sodium hypochlorite disinfection proved to be the superior decontamination protocol."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea with peak incidence in late winter or early autumn. Although CDI is commonly associated with hospitals, community transmission is important.
Aim
To explore potential drivers of CDI seasonality and the effect of community-based interventions to reduce transmission.
Methods
A mechanistic compartmental model of C. difficile transmission in a hospital and surrounding community was used to determine the effect of reducing transmission or antibiotic prescriptions in these settings. The model was extended to allow for seasonal antibiotic prescriptions and seasonal transmission.
Findings
Modelling antibiotic seasonality reproduced the seasonality of CDI, including approximate magnitude (13.9–15.1% above annual mean) and timing of peaks (0.7–1.0 months after peak antibiotics). Halving seasonal excess prescriptions reduced the incidence of CDI by 6–18%. Seasonal transmission produced larger seasonal peaks in the prevalence of community colonization (14.8–22.1% above mean) than seasonal antibiotic prescriptions (0.2–1.7% above mean). Reducing transmission from symptomatic or hospitalized patients had little effect on community-acquired CDI, but reducing transmission in the community by ≥7% or transmission from infants by ≥30% eliminated the pathogen. Reducing antibiotic prescription rates led to approximately proportional reductions in infections, but limited reductions in the prevalence of colonization.
Conclusion
Seasonal variation in antibiotic prescription rates can account for the observed magnitude and timing of C. difficile seasonality. Even complete prevention of transmission from hospitalized patients or symptomatic patients cannot eliminate the pathogen, but interventions to reduce transmission from community residents or infants could have a large impact on both hospital- and community-acquired infections."

Background
Infection prevention and control (IPC) is a measure to prevent healthcare-associated infections in healthcare settings. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of IPC programmes in long-term care facilities (LTCFs).
Aim
To review and analyse the effectiveness and the components of IPC programmes in LTCFs for older adults.
Methods
Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane CENTRAL) were searched systematically for English-language articles assessing IPC interventions in LTCFs, published over the last decade (2007–2016). The components of IPC programmes were analysed based on the World Health Organization (WHO) manuals for improving IPC activities. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of studies using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the risk-of-bias assessment tool for non-randomized studies.
Findings
Seventeen studies met the eligibility criteria; 10 studies were randomized trials (58.8%) and the others were non-randomized trials to examine the impact of IPC programmes on infection and/or performance outcomes of healthcare workers. None of the included studies implemented all of the WHO core components. Behavioural change strategies using education, monitoring and feedback were reported to be successful interventions for reducing the threat of healthcare-associated infections. Generally, studies using four or more elements of the WHO multi-modal strategy reported significant reductions in infection rates.
Conclusions
There is some evidence for the effectiveness of IPC interventions using education, monitoring, feedback and four or more elements of the WHO multi-modal strategy to control healthcare-associated infections in LTCFs."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Staphylococcus aureus remains an important bacterial pathogen worldwide. This study utilized known staphylococcal epidemiology to track S. aureus between different ecological reservoirs in one 10-bed intensive care unit (ICU).
Methods
Selected hand-touch surfaces, staff hands and air were screened systematically 10 times during 10 months, with patients screened throughout the study. S. aureus isolates were subjected to spa typing and epidemiological analyses, followed by whole-genome sequencing to provide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data.
Results
Multiple transmission pathways between patients and reservoirs were investigated. There were 34 transmission events, of which 29 were highly related (<25 SNPs) and five were possibly related (<50 SNPs). Twenty (59%) transmission events occurred between colonized patients and their own body sites (i.e. autogenous spread); four (12%) were associated with cross-transmission between patients; four (12%) occurred between patients and hand-touch sites (bedrails and intravenous pump); four (12%) linked airborne S. aureus with staff hands and bedrail; and two (6%) linked bed tables, bedrail and cardiac monitor.
Conclusion
Colonized patients are responsible for repeated introduction of new S. aureus into the ICU, whereupon a proportion spread to hand-touch sites in (or near) the patient zone. This short-term reservoir for S. aureus imposes a colonization/infection risk for subsequent patients. More than half of ICU-acquired S. aureus infection originated from the patients' own flora, while staff hands and air were rarely implicated in onward transmission. Control of staphylococcal infection in the ICU is best served by patient screening, systematic cleaning of hand-touch surfaces and continued emphasis on hand hygiene."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antimicrobial misuse leading to drug resistance is a growing concern for clinicians. Improving antimicrobial stewardship programmes through development of new tools could be part of the solution.
Aim
To evaluate antimicrobial use in hospitalized patients after implementation of an antimicrobial checklist for ward-based clinical pharmacists.
Methods
A checklist based on quality indicators of optimal antimicrobial use was implemented to standardize hospital pharmacists' assessments of antimicrobial therapy. Antimicrobial use metrics from adults hospitalized during the control and intervention periods were assessed in an interrupted time series analysis of individual patient data. The primary endpoint was days of therapy (DOT) for all antimicrobials per 1000 days present for included patients. Secondary endpoints were the DOT of extended-spectrum antimicrobials (DOT-ES), length of therapy of all antimicrobials (LOT) and the number of pharmacist interventions.
Findings
One-thousand six-hundred and nineteen patients were included: 800 and 819 in the pre- and post-checklist implementation periods, respectively. As indicated by the point estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), there were no changes in trend for DOT, DOT-ES or LOT. A change in level was not found for the DOT, while a change of -118 DOT-ES [-209,-28] and -51 LOT [-97,-4] was documented. Furthermore, pharmacists' interventions regarding antimicrobials increased by 18.7% (14.0, 23.5) and progress notes by 32.3% (27.8, 36.8).
Conclusion
An antimicrobial checklist used by ward-based clinical pharmacists did not decrease DOT for all antimicrobials, but decreased DOT-ES and LOT upon its implementation."

Background
Allograft contamination during extraction represents a major limiting factor for tissue bank availability. Contamination rates remain persistently high independent of the hospital, country or year considered.
Aim
To analyse the factors associated with contamination of bone and tendon samples extracted from Spanish donors.
Methods
Data for 1162 bone and tendon samples extracted from 102 donors between 2014 and 2017 were collected retrospectively from the hospital database. Descriptive statistics, potentially associated factors and correlation of contamination between samples extracted from different anatomical locations of the same donor were analysed.
Findings
In total, 227 (19.54%) of the extracted samples [131 (18.49%) bone samples and 96 (20.92%) tendon samples] rendered positive cultures and were discarded. Male sex [odds ratio (OR) 2.023; P=0.019], extraction of >10 samples per donor (OR 1.997; P<0.001) and extraction time >240 min (OR 1.755; P=0.001) were factors independently associated with a higher contamination rate. Meanwhile, the tissue sample type ‘bone-patellar tendon-bone’ was associated with a significantly lower contamination rate (OR 0.446; P=0.001). Significant correlation between certain localization of contaminated samples and the concordance of bacterial species was also observed.
Conclusion
Factors related to the extraction procedure, such as total extraction time, extraction sequence, number of samples extracted and anatomical location of extracted samples, play a major role in allograft contamination. Further optimization of procedures, guided by the contamination patterns analysed in this study, should help to increase tissue bank availability."

Microbial contamination of the near-patient environment is an acknowledged reservoir for nosocomial pathogens. The hospital bed and specifically bed rails have been shown to be frequently and heavily contaminated in observational and interventional studies. Whereas the complexity of bed rail design has evolved over the years, the microbial contamination of these surfaces has been incompletely evaluated. In many published studies, key design variables are not described, compromising the extrapolation of results to other settings. This report reviews the evolving structure of hospital beds and bed rails, the possible impact of different design elements on microbial contamination and their role in pathogen transmission. Our findings support the need for clearly defined standardized assessment protocols to accurately assess bed rail and similar patient zone surface levels of contamination, as part of environmental hygiene investigations."

Background
Associations between antimicrobial exposure in the community and community-associated Clostridioides difficile infection (CA-CDI) are well documented but associations with healthcare-associated CDI (HA-CDI) are less clear. This study estimates the association between antimicrobial prescribing in the community and HA-CDI.
Methods
A matched case–control study was conducted by linking three national patient level datasets covering CDI cases, community prescriptions and hospitalizations. All validated cases of HA-CDI (August 2010 to July 2013) were extracted and up to three hospital-based controls were matched to each case on the basis of gender, age, hospital and date of admission. Conditional logistic regression was applied to estimate the association between antimicrobial prescribing in the community and HA-CDI. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to consider the impact of unmeasured hospital antimicrobial prescribing.
Results
Nine-hundred and thirty unique cases of HA-CDI with onset in hospital and no hospital discharge in the 12 weeks prior to index admission were linked with 1810 matched controls. Individuals with prior prescription of any antimicrobial in the community had an odds ratio (OR) = 1.41 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13–1.75) for HA-CDI compared with those without. Individuals exposed to high-risk antimicrobials (cephalosporins, clindamycin, co-amoxiclav or fluoroquinolones) had an OR = 1.86 (95% CI: 1.33–2.59). After accounting for the likely impact of unmeasured hospital prescribing, the community exposure, particulary to high-risk antimicrobials, was still associated with elevated HA-CDI risk.
Conclusions
Community antimicrobial exposure is an independent risk factor for HA-CDI and should be considered as part of the risk assessment of patients developing diarrhoea in hospital."

Background
Antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) include strategies that enable sustainable management of rational anti-infective treatment in the clinical setting. The successful introduction of ASPs requires close interdisciplinary collaboration among various health professionals, including the hospital management. So far, ASPs have been evaluated mainly from a clinical–pharmacological and infectious disease perspective.
Aim
To identify and evaluate parameters with decisive significance for the economic impact of ASPs.
Methods
A systematic literature search for peer-reviewed health-economic studies associated with antimicrobial stewardship programmes was performed. Primary outcomes included savings in drug costs and lower revenue losses for hospitals.
Findings and conclusions
A total of 16 studies met all inclusion criteria. Most of the evidence from published clinical trials demonstrated savings through reduced direct cost of antibiotics. However, there are also studies that prove revenue effects of ASPs through decreases in length of stay and readmission rates."

Background
Despite the general consensus on the use of single-dose antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) in instrumented spine surgery, evidence supporting this approach is not robust.
Aim
To compare the efficacies of single-dose and 72 h AMP protocols for the prevention of surgical site infection (SSI) in instrumented spine surgery (ISS) in a before-and-after study.
Methods
Prospective non-randomized cohort study on 5208 patients who underwent spine surgery in one neurosurgical department between 2003 and 2014. Two protocols of AMP were compared in ISS: a single-dose protocol from 2003 to 2008, and a 72 h protocol from 2009 to 2014. Patients undergoing non-instrumented spine surgery (NSS) received single-dose prophylaxis throughout both periods. The outcome measure was the incidence of SSI.
Findings
For ISS, the SSI incidences were 5.3% for the single-dose protocol and 2.2% for the 72 h protocol (P < 0.01). For NSS, the SSI incidence was 0.8% between 2003 and 2008 and 1.2% between 2009 and 2014 (P = 0.054). Multiple correspondence analysis showed that in surgeries with an implant a one-dose prophylaxis carries a 7.1% risk of SSI; patients who received 72 h prophylaxis had a lower (3.6%) risk of SSI.
Conclusion
Analysis of individual categories of data suggests that 72 h prophylaxis was the most important factor for minimizing the risk of wound infection in our study group."

abstract = "Summary
The World Health Organization published guidelines in 2016 for preventing surgical site infections. The guidelines contained a conditional recommendation that laminar airflow (LAF) ventilation systems should not be used to reduce the risk of infection after total joint arthroplasty (TJA). This recommendation was largely based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of information from hospital infection surveillance registries. The recommendation contradicts information published in earlier major studies carried out by Charnley and the UK Medical Research Council (MRC). The first aim of this article is to revisit and explain the MRC study, and reply to criticisms of it. The second aim is to suggest reasons why some recent studies have failed to demonstrate that ultraclean air (UCA) systems reduce deep joint infection after TJA. It demonstrates that if a UCA system establishes average airborne concentrations of microbe-carrying particles (MCPs) <10/m3, and preferably <1/m3, then deep joint infection after TJA will be lower than in conventionally ventilated operating theatres."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Vomiting is one way in which the body rids itself of harmful gastric contents rapidly. Whilst this process is generally beneficial for the emetic individual, it can pose significant infection control issues if they are infected with a highly communicable pathogen such as norovirus. It is not known how far norovirus could spread through vomiting while remaining viable, particularly in far-reaching droplets and splashes that might be missed during cleaning.
Aim
To identify the potential level of dissemination of viable norovirus after simulated vomiting.
Methods
This study used a system called ‘Vomiting Larry’ to simulate vomiting with infection medium containing the norovirus surrogate feline calicivirus (FCV) as a worst-case scenario for distribution and survival of viruses after simulated vomiting. Air and floor samples were taken after simulated vomiting, and analysed for viable virus via plaque assay. Analysis of covariance investigated differences in FCV concentration by sample volume and location.
Findings
Whilst viable virus was not isolated from any air samples taken after simulated vomiting, FCV concentrations of ≥10 plaque-forming units/mL were recovered from almost all samples taken from the floor (88/90). These included small droplets of fluid that travelled 3 m away from the vomiting system. There was evidence that FCV concentration depended on both sample volume and location.
Conclusion
This study suggests that norovirus can survive being ejected even within small far-reaching droplets at concentrations capable of eliciting infection. Such droplets could easily go unnoticed and be overlooked during cleaning, adding to the challenge of controlling norovirus outbreaks."

Aim
The aim of this study was, for the first time, to describe in detail the epidemiology and impact of norovirus outbreaks in healthcare institituions (HCIs) in Norway to identify areas which may improve outbreak response.
Methods
An analysis of all reported norovirus outbreaks in hospitals and long-term-care facilities (LTCFs) was carried out from week 34, 2005 to week 33, 2018. Seasonality, symptoms and number of cases among personnel and patients were described.
Findings
A total of 20,544 cases, including 7044 healthcare personnel were reported in 965 outbreaks; 740 from LTCFs and 225 from hospitals. Median number of cases per outbreak was 15, interquartile range (IQR) 8–25 in LTCF; and 17, IQR 10–28 in hospitals. All regions reported outbreaks, with one-third of the municipalities having at least one outbreak in LTCFs during the study period. The start of the outbreak season happened almost four weeks earlier in hospitals than in LTCFs. The estimated average number of working days lost for healthcare personnel per year ranged from 1590 to 1944.
Conclusions
Norovirus outbreaks in Norwegian HCIs appears to have a substantial impact on both hospital and LTCFs all over Norway, especially during the winter months. That up to half of all cases were healthcare professionals emphasizes a need for further focus on infection control. Our results suggest that hospitals, affected first, could alert LTCFs in the area in order to prevent further outbreaks."

The emergency department (ED) is where hand hygiene problems are significant as the procedures in the ED are often high risk and invasive. To date, there have been no comprehensive reviews on hand hygiene in EDs. The aim of this study was to investigate hand hygiene compliance (HHC) rate, factors affecting the HHC rate, and intervention strategies to improve HHC in EDs. Electronic databases were used to search for research published from 1948 to January 2018. The databases included ovidMEDLINE, ovidEMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Koreamed, and Kmbase. All study designs were included. Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the bias risk using reliable and validated tools. A narrative synthesis was performed. Twenty-four studies, including 12 cross-sectional surveys and 12 interventional studies, were included. Of the 12 interventional studies reviewed, only 33% (N = 4) reported HHC rates of more than 50%. Factors that influenced HHC included types of healthcare worker, hand hygiene indication, ED crowding, positive attitudes towards HHC, patient location, auditing hand hygiene, and type of shift. Almost all of the studies (83.3%) applied multimodal or dual interventions to improve HHC. A range of strategies, including education, monitoring and providing feedback, campaigns, and cues, effectively improved HHC. The review findings indicate that there is a room for improvement in HHC in EDs. Future randomized controlled trials are necessary to determine which intervention modalities are most effective and sustainable for HHC improvement."

Escherichia coli bloodstream infection (BSI) is a common and serious problem, and incidence and antibiotic resistance are increasing.
Aim
To understand the drivers of outcomes and factors associated with preventable cases at the study institution.
Methods
Between 1st November 2017 and 30th April 2018, cases of E. coli BSI in adults treated as inpatients at the study institution were included in a prospective cohort. Clinical, demographic and laboratory features were recorded, with seven-, 30- and 90-day mortality and length of hospital stay post BSI. Qualitative data on preventability were reviewed independently by two infection specialists.
Findings
In total, 195 cases in 188 patients were included in the analysis. Empirical antibiotics showed in-vitro resistance in 30.9% of cases. Thirty-day mortality was 23.6%, with a median length of hospital stay of seven days. On multi-variable analysis, 30-day mortality was associated with higher Charlson score, residential home residency, higher respiratory rate and higher serum urea, whilst prolonged length of stay was associated with hospital-acquired E. coli BSI. Fifty patients were felt to have avoidable BSI, all of which were health care associated; urinary catheter use, antibiotic-related and procedural complications were the areas of preventability.
Conclusions
E. coli BSI has an appreciable mortality, with little in the way of modifiable risk factors for mortality or prolonged hospital stay. Attention to urinary catheter use is likely to be the most useful way to reduce the incidence, but current UK reduction targets may be unachievable."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Acinetobacter baumannii is a cause of healthcare-associated infections and has considerable potential to survive on inanimate hospital surfaces under hostile conditions (e.g. disinfection or desiccation).
Aim
To learn more about its survival strategy and capacity to persist in liquid media and on surfaces mimicking hospital environments.
Methods
The effect of temperature, nutrient deprivation, permanence on inanimate surfaces, and exposure to disinfectants on the survival of four A. baumannii strains (ATCC 19606T and three clinical isolates) was studied by monitoring the number of total and viable cells using fluorescent microscopy and of culturable cells by standard cultures.
Findings
Bacterial survival was differentially affected by temperature (cells maintained at 20°C remained culturable at least within 30 days) and physical environment (desiccation favoured cell resistance to stress at 37°C). Moreover, persistence was associated with two adaptation patterns: one linked to entry into the viable but non-culturable state, whereas the other apparently followed a bust-and-boom model. During a study on the effect of disinfectant (commercial bleach and quaternary ammonium compounds), it was found that treatment with these antibacterial compounds did not eliminate A. baumannii populations and provoked the reduction of culturable populations, although a fraction of cells remained culturable.
Conclusion
The ability to persist for long periods on different surfaces, mimicking those usually found in hospitals, along with A. baumannii's capacity to survive after a disinfection process may account for the recurrent outbreaks in intensive care units."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The use of effective cleaning/disinfectant products is important to control pathogens on healthcare surfaces. With the increasing number of wipe products available, there is a concern that combination of a formulation with the wrong material will decrease the efficacy of the product. This study aimed to use a range of efficacy test protocols to determine the efficacy of four formulations before and after binding to three commonly used wiping materials.
Methods
Two quaternary ammonium (QAC)-based products, one hydrogen-peroxide-based product and one neutral cleaner were combined with microfibre, cotton or non-woven materials and tested for efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus with two surface tests (ASTM E2197-17 and EN13697-15) and two ‘product’ tests (ASTM E2967-15 and EN16615-15).
Findings
Overall, the impact of using different materials on formulation efficacy was limited, except for an alkyl(C12-16)dimethylbenzylammonium chloride-based product used at 0.5% v/v. The hydrogen peroxide product was the most efficacious regardless of the material used. The results from wipe test ASTM E2967-15 were consistent with those from the surface tests, but not with EN16615-15 which was far less stringent.
Conclusions
The use of different wiping cloth materials may not impact severely on the efficacy of potent disinfectants, despite the absorption of different volumes of formulation by the materials. QAC-based formulations may be at higher risk when a low concentration is used. There were large differences in efficacy depending on the standard test performed, highlighting the need for more stringency in choosing the test to make a product claim on label."

Background
Estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatically carried Clostridium difficile in elderly patients in long-term care range from 0% to 51%. Asymptomatic carriage is possibly a risk factor for the development of infection, and there is ongoing debate surrounding the role of asymptomatic carriage in transmission.
Aim
To investigate the prevalence of asymptomatic carriage amongst patients residing in intermediate care (bedded) facilities (ICBFs), and to investigate whether asymptomatically carried C. difficile strains contribute to nosocomial C. difficile infection (CDI).
Methods
Stools were collected from eligible asymptomatic patients in ICBFs, and a subset was also processed from symptomatic patients accessing primary or secondary care outside of ICBFs. All samples were cultured for C. difficile, and resulting colonies were processed through whole genome sequencing.
Findings
In total, 151 asymptomatic patients were sampled, 22 of which were positive for C. difficile through stool culture, representing a carriage rate of 14.6%. Sequencing of these isolates, alongside 14 C. difficile polymerase chain reaction and culture-positive isolates from symptomatic individuals, revealed that all asymptomatic patients were carrying toxigenic C. difficile, and these strains were genetically similar to those from symptomatic patients.
Conclusion
This small study of asymptomatic carriage revealed a rectal asymptomatic carriage rate of 14.6% in patients nursed in ICBFs, and a high level of genetic similarity of these strains to those recovered from symptomatic patients. As such, asymptomatic carriers may be important for the transmission of symptomatic CDI, although it is acknowledged that this study was small, and many other factors govern whether C. difficile is carried asymptomatically or causes symptoms."

Inadequately reprocessed reusable surgical instruments (RSIs) may harbour infectious agents which may then be transferred to a suitable site for replication.
Aim
To determine the cumulative effect of 20 cycles of contamination, cleaning (manual or manual followed by automated) and steam sterilization on high-complex-design RSIs used for orthopaedic surgery.
Methods
New flexible medullary reamers and depth gauges were contaminated by soaking in tryptone soya broth, containing 5% sheep blood and 109 cfu/mL of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), for 5 min. To mimic a worse-case scenario, RSIs were dried 7 h and subjected to either (a) rinsing in distilled water, (b) manual cleaning or (c) manual plus automated cleaning (reference standard), and steam sterilization. The contamination, cleaning, and sterilization cycle was repeated 20 times. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was measured after cleaning procedures; microbial load and residual protein were measured following the 10th and 20th reprocessing, in triplicate. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to confirm soil and biofilm presence on the RSIs after the 20th reprocessing.
Findings
Manual and manual plus automated cleaning significantly reduced the amount of ATP and protein residues for all RSIs. Viable bacteria were not detected following sterilization. However, SEM detected soil after automated cleaning, and soil, including biofilms, after manual cleaning.
Conclusion
Soil and/or biofilms were evident on complex-design RSIs following 20 cycles of contamination and reprocessing, even using the reference standard method of cleaning. Although the depth gauges could be disassembled, biological residues and biofilm accumulated in its lumen. The current design of these RSIs prevents removal of all biological soil and this may have an adverse effect on patient outcome."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are emerging pathogens representing a major concern for public health. In Belgium, the OXA-48 carbapenemase resistance gene is identified most frequently. Sink drains in intensive care units (ICUs) are known to be colonized by Gram-negative bacilli. A correlation between environmental contamination and CPE infections in ICUs has been established. A long-term CPE epidemic in a local ICU proved difficult to control.
Methods and results
A variety of CPE strains, all carrying the OXA-48 resistance gene, were isolated from almost all sinks in patient rooms in the ICU. Decontamination of the sinks with 250 mL 25% acetic acid three times weekly was implemented. Sink drain colonization was followed up for six months thereafter. Both the number of CPE-colonized sinks and the number of patients colonized or infected with CPE decreased drastically, to the extent that the epidemic was considered to be eradicated. In-vitro growth of all isolates was inhibited by a concentration of acetic acid equal to or smaller than that used for decontamination. Epidemiological analysis demonstrated a positive and significant relationship between contaminated sinks and CPE acquisition of patients admitted to ICU rooms, indicating the importance of contaminated sinks as the environmental reservoir of the epidemic.
Conclusion
Decontamination of sink drains with acetic acid is a valuable alternative to other methods, such as heated sinks and water-free care, especially when other options are not feasible in the short term. Acetic acid is cheap, widely available, effective and manageable from a safety and technical point of view."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Accounting for time-dependency and competing events are strongly recommended to estimate excess length of stay (LOS) and risk of death associated with healthcare-associated infections.
Aim
To assess the effect of organ/space (OS) surgical site infection (SSI) on excess LOS and in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery (ECS).
Methods
A multicentre prospective adult cohort undergoing ECS, January 2012 to December 2014, at 10 Spanish hospitals was used. SSI was considered the time-varying exposure and defined as incisional (superficial and deep) or OS. Discharge alive and death were the study endpoints. The mean excess LOS was estimated using a multistate model which provided a weighted average based on the states patients passed through. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess the effect of OS-SSI on risk of discharge alive or in-hospital mortality.
Findings
Of 2778 patients, 343 (12.3%) developed SSI: 194 (7%) OS-SSI and 149 (5.3%) incisional SSI. Compared to incisional SSI or no infection, OS-SSI prolonged LOS by 4.2 days (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.1–4.3) and 9 days (8.9–9.1), respectively, reduced the risk of discharge alive (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 0.36 (95% CI: 0.28–0.47) and aHR: 0.17 (0.14–0.21), respectively), and increased the risk of in-hospital mortality (aHR: 8.02 (1.03–62.9) and aHR: 10.7 (3.7–30.9), respectively).
Conclusion
OS-SSI substantially extended LOS and increased risk of death in patients undergoing ECS. These results reinforce OS-SSI as the SSI with the highest health burden in ECS."

Seventeen studies, including 4390 patients for drain tip cultures and 1288 for drainage fluid cultures, were selected. The pooled negative predictive values were high (99%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 98–100 for drain tip cultures and 98%, 95% CI 94–100 for drainage fluid cultures). The positive predictive values were low (11%, 95% CI 2–24 for drain tip cultures and 12%, 95% CI 3–24 for drainage fluid cultures). The sensitivities were low (41%, 95% CI 12–73 for drain tip cultures and 37%, 95% CI 16–60 for drainage fluid cultures). The specificities were high (93%, 95% CI 88–96) for drain tip cultures and moderate (77%, 95% CI 54–94) for drainage fluid cultures. Systematic cultures of drain tips or drainage fluids appear not to be relevant, because their positive predictive values were low in the prediction of SSIs."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The survival of pathogenic organisms in the healthcare environment plays a major role in acquiring healthcare-associated infections (HAIs).
Aim
This meta-analysis was conducted to investigate whether pathogenic organisms can be transmitted from roommates and prior room occupants to other inpatients and thus increase the risks of HAIs.
Methods
PubMed (from January 1966) and Embase (from January 1974) were searched to identify studies up to March 2018. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-squared statistic. The random-effects model was applied which provides more conservative estimates. Subgroup analyses, cumulative meta-analysis, publication bias diagnosis, and sensitivity analysis were conducted. All the statistical analyses were performed using Stata statistical software version 9.0.
Results
Twelve studies including 33,153 subjects reported risk from exposure to infected/colonized roommates and nine studies including 49,839 subjects reported risk from infected/colonized prior room occupants. Exposure to infected/colonized roommates and prior room occupants were associated with the increased risks of HAIs with the same organism (odds ratio (OR) = 2.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.61–4.49; OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.36–2.68; respectively). Sensitivity analyses results did not show major changes in the overall findings. No publication bias was detected.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis showed exposure to infected/colonized roommates and prior room occupants significantly increased the risks of HAIs with the same organism. Health authorities and hospitals should attach higher importance to the fact that current standards or practices for disinfection and isolation are often not sufficient to block transmission of pathogens in the healthcare settings, which may warrant enhanced terminal and intermittent disinfection and strict isolation for reducing HAIs."

In recent years, approaches to tracking the spread of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as part of outbreak management have used conventional DNA-based methods, including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and spa typing. However, when a predominant clone is present, these methods may be insufficiently discriminatory. A literature search was undertaken to highlight how whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized the investigation of outbreaks of MRSA, including intrahospital spread and MRSA in the community, and to review its future potential. WGS provides enhanced isolate discrimination, as it permits the entire genomic DNA sequence of isolates to be determined and compared rapidly. Software packages used for the analysis of WGS data are becoming increasingly available. To date, WGS has been more sensitive in confirming outbreaks, often persisting for prolonged periods, previously undetected by conventional molecular typing. The evolving dynamic of spread from the community to hospitals, within and between hospitals, and from hospitals to the community is only becoming clear with WGS studies, and is more complex and convoluted than widely appreciated. Also, WGS can exclude cross-transmission, when isolates are different. The challenges now are to make WGS technology more amenable for routine use, and to develop an evidence-based consensus for sequence difference thresholds for isolates that are deemed to be part of the same outbreak, including protracted outbreaks. Using such data in a timely way will provide increased sensitivity in detecting cross-transmission events at an earlier stage, with the potential to prevent outbreaks, and have a positive impact on infection prevention and control."

Background
Enterobacteriaceae are recognized as leading pathogens of healthcare-associated infections.
Aim
To report the investigation of a nosocomial outbreak of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacter cloacae affecting cardiothoracic surgery patients in a Belgian academic hospital.
Methods
Cases were defined based on epidemiological and microbiological investigations, including molecular typing using repetitive element-based polymerase chain reaction and multi-locus sequence typing. Case–control studies followed by field evaluations allowed the identification of a possible reservoir, and the retrospective assessment of human and financial consequences.
Findings
Over a three-month period, 42 patients were infected or colonized by CTX-M-15-producing E. cloacae strains that belonged to the same clonal lineage. Acquisition mainly occurred in the intensive care unit (N = 23) and in the cardiothoracic surgery ward (N = 16). All but one patient had, prior to acquisition, undergone a cardiothoracic surgical procedure, monitored by the same transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) probe in the operating room. Despite negative microbiological culture results, the exclusion of the suspected probe resulted in rapid termination of the outbreak. Overall, the outbreak was associated with a high mortality rate among infected patients (40%) as well as significant costs (€266,550).
Conclusion
The outbreak was indirectly shown to be associated with the contamination of a manually disinfected TOE probe used per-operatively during cardiothoracic surgery procedures, because withdrawal of the putative device led to rapid termination of the outbreak."

abstract = "Summary
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) affect hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide. Performing hand hygiene is widely accepted as a key strategy of infection prevention and control (IPC) to prevent HAIs, as healthcare workers' contaminated hands are the vehicle most often implicated in the cross-transmission of pathogens in health care. Over the last 20 years, a paradigm shift has occurred in hand hygiene: the change from handwashing with soap and water to using alcohol-based hand rubs. In order to put this revolution into context and understand how such a change was able to be implemented across so many different cultures and geographic regions, it is useful to understand how the idea of hygiene in general, and hand hygiene specifically, developed. This paper aims to examine how ideas about hygiene and hand hygiene evolved from ancient to modern times, from a ubiquitous but local set of ideas to a global phenomenon. It reviews historical landmarks from the first known documented recipe for soap by the Babylon civilization to the discovery of chlorine, and significant contributions by pioneers such as Antoine Germain Labarraque, Alexander Gordon, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Ignaz Philip Semmelweis, Louis Pasteur and Joseph Lister. It recalls that handwashing with soap and water appeared in guidelines to prevent HAIs in the 1980s; describes why alcohol-based hand rub replaced this as the central tool for action within a multi-modal improvement strategy; and looks at how the World Health Organization and other committed stakeholders, governments and dedicated IPC staff are championing hand hygiene globally."

Background
Presurgical hand washing is crucial for preventing surgical site infections (SSIs). Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and povidone-iodine (PI) products have been conventionally used as hand scrubs for presurgical hand preparation. However, waterless hand rub (WHR) products have been developed for operating room staff.
Aim
The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the antiseptic efficacies of WHR, CHG, and PI in surgical settings.
Methods
PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases as well as the ClinicalTrials.gov registry were searched for studies published before October 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the clinical outcomes of the use of WHRs, CHG, or PI for presurgical hand washing were included. A random effects model was used for meta-analysis. Colony-forming unit (cfu) counts, SSI rates, and preference and compliance were determined to measure efficacies.
Findings
Eleven RCTs involving 5135 participants were included. Residual cfu counts were significantly lower in the WHR and CHG groups than in the PI group. The differences in cfu counts between the WHR and CHG groups were non-significant. No significant differences were observed in the SSI rates between the WHR and traditional hand scrub groups. Moreover, WHRs were considered most favourable and were associated with higher compliance rates than the other products.
Conclusion
WHRs and CHG exhibited higher antiseptic efficacies than PI. However, additional studies with consistent outcome measurements and accurate grouping are required to obtain comprehensive results. Moreover, preference, compliance, and the cost determine the selection of hand wash products."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hand hygiene plays a vital role in the prevention of transmission of micro-organisms. Ozone (O3) is a highly reactive gas with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial effects on bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. It can easily be produced locally in small generators, and dissolved in tap water, and quickly transmits into ordinary O2 in the surrounding air.
Aim
To compare ozonized tap water and alcohol rub in decontamination of bacterially contaminated hands.
Methods
A cross-over study among 30 nursing students. Hands were artificially contaminated with Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), then sanitized with ozonized tap water (0.8 or 4 ppm) or 3 mL standard alcohol-based rub (Antibac 85%). The transient microbes from fingers were cultivated and colony-forming units (cfu)/mL were counted. The test procedure was modified from European Standard EN 1500:2013.
Findings
All contaminated hands before disinfection showed cfu >30,000/mL. The mean (SD) bacterial counts in (cfu/mL) on both hands combined were 1017 (1391) after using ozonized water, and 2337 (4664) after alcohol hand disinfection. The median (range) values were 500 (0–6700) and 250 (0–16,000) respectively (non-significant difference). Twenty per cent of participants reported adverse skin effects (burning/dryness) from alcohol disinfection compared with no adverse sensations with ozone.
Conclusion
Ozonized tap water is an effective decontaminant of E. coli, and it could be an alternative to traditional alcohol-fluid hand disinfectants both in healthcare institutions and public places. Ozonized water may be especially valuable for individuals with skin problems."

Background
Several studies have compared the incidence of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) between simultaneous bilateral total joint arthroplasty (SBTJA) and staged bilateral total joint arthroplasty (StBTJA) patients following primary total joint arthroplasty. However, these studies lacked statistical power.
Aim
To determine by meta-analysis whether SBTJA increases deep infection risk compared to StBTJA.
Methods
All studies were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, Web of Science, PEDro, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and Scopus. A meta-analysis was conducted to compare PJI rate between SBTJA and StBTJA patients.
Findings
Overall, there were 16 studies with 36,765 patients who underwent SBTJA and 71,558 patients who underwent StBTJA. The pooled data showed that the PJI rate of SBTJA was lower than that of StBTJA (0.84% vs 1.57%; odds ratio (OR): 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49–0.66; heterogeneity, I2 = 0%; P = 0.74). In subgroup analysis, the pooled data revealed that there was no significant difference between SBTJA and StBTJA groups for PJI if the two groups had similar baseline demographics (four studies; OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.21–1.40; heterogeneity, I2 = 0%; P = 0.77). The pooled data showed that the PJI rate of SBTJA patients was comparable with that of StBTJA patients within a three-month staging interval (three studies; OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.38–3.88; heterogeneity, I2 = 0%; P = 0.42).
Conclusion
SBTJA does not increase the risk of subsequent PJI compared to StBTJA. Further studies are needed to provide higher quality evidence to evaluate the two modes of procedure."

Background
Many regional and remote (‘regional’) hospitals are without the specialist services that support antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes in hospitals in major cities. This can impact their ability to implement AMS activities.
Aim
To identify factors that impact on the delivery of AMS programmes in regional hospitals.
Methods
Healthcare clinicians who have primary AMS responsibilities or provide AMS support to a health service or across health services with an Australian Statistical Geography Standard Remoteness classification of inner regional, outer regional, remote or very remote were recruited purposively and via snowballing. A series of focus groups and interviews were held, and the discussions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were coded by two researchers, and thematic analysis was undertaken using a framework method.
Findings
Four focus groups and one interview were conducted (22 participants). Six main themes that impacted on AMS programme delivery were identified: culture of independence and self-reliance by local clinicians, personal relationships, geographical location of the hospital influencing antimicrobial choice, local context, inability to meaningfully benchmark performance, and lack of resources. Possible strategies to support the delivery of AMS programmes in regional hospitals proposed by participants were categorized into two main themes: those that may be best developed or managed centrally, and those that should be a local responsibility.
Conclusion
AMS programme delivery in regional hospitals is influenced by factors that are not present in hospitals in major cities. These findings provide a strong basis for the development of strategies to support regional hospitals to implement sustainable AMS programmes."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Sink drains in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequently colonized with bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Aim
To study the influence of installing disinfecting devices on sink drains on colonization of sinks and patients in an ICU during a prolonged outbreak of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa.
Methods
From 2010, there was a clonal outbreak of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDR-PA). In April 2013, in ICU subunit A, the siphons draining these sinks were replaced by devices applying heat and electromechanical vibration to disinfect the draining fluid. In the other units, siphons were replaced by new polyvinyl chloride plastic siphons (control). In February 2016 the disinfecting devices were also placed at ICU subunit B.
Findings
Baseline colonization rate of sinks was 51% in ICU A and 46% in ICU B. In ICU A colonization decreased to 5% (P < 0.001) after the intervention whereas it was 62% in ICU B (control). After installing the disinfection devices in ICU B, colonization rate was 8.0 and 2.4% in ICU A and B, respectively (both P < 0.001 compared with baseline). Colonization in ICU patients decreased from 8.3 to 0 per 1000 admitted patients (P < 0.001) and from 2.7 to 0.5 per 1000 admitted patients (P = 0.1) in ICU A and B respectively.
Conclusion
Colonization with MDR-PA in sink drains in an ICU was effectively managed by installing disinfection devices to the siphons of sinks. Colonization of patients was also significantly reduced, suggesting that sink drains can be a source of clinical outbreaks with P. aeruginosa and that disinfecting devices may help to interrupt these outbreaks."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Increasing evidence indicates that combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation reduces the infectious complications of colorectal surgery. Anecdotal evidence suggests the combination is rarely used in the UK and Europe.
Aim
To establish colorectal surgeons' current use and awareness of the benefits of such bowel preparation, and to identify decision-making influences surrounding preoperative bowel preparation.
Method
An electronic survey was emailed to all members of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland, and promoted via Twitter.
Findings
A total of 495 respondents completed the survey: 413 (83.2%) UK, 39 (7.9%) other European, 43 (8.7%) non-European. Respondents used oral antibiotics for 12–20% of cases. Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP), phosphate enema, and no preparation, respectively, ranged between 9 and 80%. Combined MBP and oral antibiotic bowel preparation ranged between 5.5 and 18.6%. Fifty-three percent (260/495) agreed that combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation reduces surgical site infection; 32% (157/495) agreed that the combination reduces risk of anastomotic leak. Kappa statistics between 0.06 and 0.27 indicate considerable incongruity between surgeons' awareness of the literature, and day-to-day practice. Twenty-four percent (96/495) believed MBP to be incompatible with enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS); 41% (204/495) believed that MBP delays return to normal intestinal function.
Conclusions
Few UK and European colorectal surgeons use mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation, despite evidence of its efficacy in reducing infectious complications. The influence of ERAS pathways and UK and European guidelines may explain this. In contradiction to the UK and Europe, North American guidelines recommend incorporating combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation into ERAS programmes. This study suggests that future UK and European guidelines incorporate combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation into the ERAS pathway."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Following the alarming outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia (CRKP) in five intensive care units (ICUs) of a tertiary care hospital in China, a prospective investigation of CRKP colonized/infected patients was conducted.
Aim
To describe the diffusion and transmission of CRKP among epidemiologically linked ICU patients, staff and environment.
Methods
Enhanced CRKP infected/colonized case monitoring was performed by the real-time nosocomial infection surveillance system (RT-NISS). The immediate surroundings of each CRKP patient bed unit and the staff hands/gloves/gowns were sampled and then evaluated for the presence of CRKP. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were used to identify and to characterize these isolates.
Findings
Among 2750 patients monitored, 67 CRKP patients were newly labeled and 11 patients' CRKP isolates were available. A total of 31.34% (21/67) bed units were positive at one or more surrounding surfaces, 7.99% (49/613) environmental samples and 3.57% (4/112) ICU staff samples were CRKP positive. The selected CRKP isolates (N = 64) exhibited intermediate to high resistance levels to the antibiotics tested apart from colistin and tigecycline. RT-NISS data combined with MLST and PFGE revealed nine likely transmission clusters. WGS analysis of these CRKP isolates revealed extensive sharing of multiple antimicrobial resistance genes and plasmid replicons among these isolates. Two carbapenemase genes blaKPC-2 (62/64) and blaOXA-48 (2/64) were identified. These CRKP isolates carried one or more plasmid replicons.
Conclusions
The contamination of ICU environment and staff's hands, gloves or gowns is frequent with CRKP patients. Our study also supports the hypothesis that an association between environmental contamination and transmission of CRKP bacteria in ICUs."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Invasive mucormycosis (IM) is a rare invasive fungal infection with a high mortality rate. However, data concerning the clinical and economic burden of IM are scarce.
Aim
To evaluate the direct treatment costs and additional expenditures of patients with IM.
Methods
A retrospective cost-of-illness analysis of cases with IM extracted from FungiScope – Global Registry for Emerging Fungal Infections, accessible through the epidemiological research platform www.ClinicalSurveys.net, was undertaken. Results of patients with IM were compared with those of matched patients with similar underlying conditions based on the German Diagnosis Related Group (G-DRG) coding.
Findings
Out of 46 patients with probable/proven IM, 31 (67%) patients were male and the median age was 53 years (range 11–88 years). Forty-two patients (92%) had haematological diseases as the most common risk factor. Analysis of cost factors identified antifungal treatment due to IM as the primary cost driver [€22,816, 95% confidence interval (CI) €15,036–32,346], with mean overall direct treatment costs of €53,261 (95% CI €39,660–68,825). Compared with matched patients, patients with IM were treated in hospital for 26.5 additional days (standard deviation 31.8 days; P < 0.001), resulting in mean additional costs of €32,991 (95% CI €21,558–46,613; P < 0.001). Probable IM, as well as absence of chemotherapy, surgical measures due to IM, and antifungal prophylaxis were associated with lower overall costs. Nineteen patients (41.3%) died during hospitalization.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates the considerable healthcare burden of IM. The choice of antifungal agent for treatment of IM had no impact on overall cost."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Gram-negative complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) can have serious consequences for patients and hospitals.
Aim
To examine the clinical and economic burden attributable to Gram-negative carbapenem-non-susceptible (C-NS; resistant/intermediate) infections compared with carbapenem-susceptible (C-S) infections in 78 US hospitals.
Methods
All non-duplicate C-NS and C-S urine source isolates were analysed. A subset had principal diagnosis ICD-9-CM codes denoting cUTI. Collection time (<3 vs ≥3 days after admission) determined isolate classification as community or hospital onset. Mortality, 30-day re-admissions, length of stay (LOS), hospital cost and net gain/loss in US dollars were determined for C-NS and C-S cases, with the C-NS-attributable burden estimated through propensity score matching. Three subgroups with adequate patient numbers were analysed: cUTI principal diagnosis, community onset; other principal diagnosis, community onset; and other principal diagnosis, hospital onset.
Findings
The C-NS-attributable mortality risk was significantly higher (58%) for the other principal diagnosis, hospital-onset subgroup alone (odds ratio 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.14–2.20; P < 0.01). The C-NS-attributable risk for 30-day re-admission ranged from 29% to 55% (all P < 0.05). The average attributable economic impact of C-NS was 1.1–3.9 additional days LOS (all P < 0.05), US$1512–10,403 additional total cost (all P < 0.001) and US$1582–11,848 net loss (all P < 0.01); overall burden and C-NS-attributable burden were greatest in the other principal diagnosis, hospital-onset subgroup.
Conclusion
Greater clinical and economic burden was observed in propensity-score-matched patients with C-NS infections compared with C-S infections, regardless of whether cUTI was the principal diagnosis, and this burden was most severe in hospital-onset infections."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Colonization by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) may persist for several months after hospital discharge, especially in patients with altered microbiota.
Aim
To identify how many previously OXA-48 CPE-positive patients identified during an outbreak period were readmitted; to evaluate their CPE-positive or -negative digestive tract colonization at hospital readmission and during readmission stay; and to assess the role of antibiotic exposure on their CPE colonization status during readmission.
Methods
All CPE cohort patients from June 2013 to May 2016 (N = 189) were registered in a survey database and were systematically identified at readmission by a daily informatics and alert program using specific hospital population number. Each cohort patient was systematically screened for CPE colonization on the day of readmission and then weekly if the length of stay was more than six days.
Findings
In all, 114 (60.3%) patients previously CPE-colonized were readmitted to our hospital. Excluding the 12 patients who were not screened because their period of readmission was <24 h, 88 patients were negative (86.3%) and 14 were positive (13.7%) for CPE colonization at first hospital readmission. The 14 CPE-positive patients did not change their infectious status and remained CPE-positive during the study period. Of the 88 negative patients, 65 remained negative during the study period, and 23 subsequently became CPE-positive after the negative readmission screening. CPE-positive colonization was significantly associated with antibiotic exposure during readmission periods (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
Negative screens at hospital readmission did not necessarily predict resolution of CPE carriage. Antibiotic exposure appears to influence the risk of remaining CPE positive."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The usefulness of colonization pressure as a working model and proxy for infection transmission is limited due to the inability to grade or quantify the specific risk within environments that are subject to change.
Aim
To elaborate on the colonization pressure model by comparing the molecular epidemiology of two bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, among residents in a nursing home and people in unassisted living situations.
Methods
A cross-sectional study of 73 elderly residents from a village in south-central Sweden was conducted. Of these, 35 were residents of a nursing home, and 34 lived in an own place of residence in the same geographical area. Samples of two representative bacterial species were collected from multiple body sites and analysed for molecular diversity.
Findings
Combining all body sites, 47% of the participants were colonized with S. aureus and 93% with E. coli. The nursing home group, the group in unassisted living situations, and both units combined, held 16, 17, and 29 different S. aureus spa types, respectively. The corresponding numbers of different E. coli serogenotypes were 34, 28, and 48. Diabetes mellitus was associated with more frequent colonization with S. aureus.
Conclusion
The molecular diversity of bacteria found within different forms of accommodation was within the same range. Hospital quality hygiene might have contributed to the absence of homogenization of the molecular diversity within the nursing home group. Diabetes mellitus might have played a role in a patient selection characterized by advanced age."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Escherichia coli bacteraemia rates in the UK have risen; rates are highest among older adults. Previous urinary tract infections (UTIs) and catheterization are risk factors.
Aim
To examine effectiveness of behavioural interventions to reduce E. coli bacteraemia and/or symptomatic UTIs for older adults.
Methods
Sixteen databases, grey literature, and reference lists were searched. Titles and/or abstracts were scanned and selected papers were read fully to confirm suitability. Quality was assessed using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme guidelines and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network grading.
Findings
Twenty-one studies were reviewed, and all lacked methodological quality. Six multi-faceted hospital interventions including education, with audit and feedback or reminders reduced UTIs but only three supplied statements of significance. One study reported decreasing catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) by 88% (F (1,20) = 7.25). Another study reported reductions in CAUTI from 11.17 to 10.53 during Phase I and by 0.39 during Phase II (χ2 = 254). A third study reported fewer UTIs per patient week (risk ratio = 0.39). Two hospital studies of online training and catheter insertion and care simulations decreased CAUTIs from 33 to 14 and from 10.40 to 0. Increasing nursing staff, community continence nurses, and catheter removal reminder stickers reduced infection. There were no studies examining prevention of E. coli bacteraemias.
Conclusion
The heterogeneity of studies means that one effective intervention cannot be recommended. We suggest that feedback should be considered because it facilitated reductions in UTI when used alone or in multi-faceted interventions including education, audit or catheter removal protocols. Multi-faceted education is likely to be effective. Catheter removal protocols, increased staffing, and patient education require further evaluation."

Aim
To report an outbreak of patient-to-patient transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) through the repeated use of a multi-dose saline flask during the rinsing of central venous catheters.
Methods
Blood samples were taken from each patient for the comparative analysis of their HCV RNA strains. No samples were available for one patient who died before the investigation started. Despite the known lability of HCV RNA, the body was exhumed four months after burial and postmortem samples were collected. HCV RNA was extracted successfully from liver and spleen samples. Genotyping of all the HCV strains was performed by sequence analysis of the 5′NC untranslated region, the E1 core conserved region and the E1/E2 hypervariable region.
Findings
Forensic investigators retraced the route used by two ward nurses, when saline catheter flushes were given to 14 patients with each nurse administering to seven patients. The comparative phylogenetic analysis of all case strains identified the deceased patient as the source of contamination to five patients.
Conclusions
This study highlights the value of sequence analysis as a tool for solving medico-legal conflicts. The High Court of Justice found that a health worker's re-use of a contaminated needle resulted in the nosocomial transmission of HCV."

Background
Hospital outbreaks of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria should be detected and controlled as early as possible.
Aim
To develop a framework for automatic detection of AMR outbreaks in hospitals.
Methods
Japan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (JANIS) is one of the largest national AMR surveillance systems in the world. For this study, all bacterial data in the JANIS database were extracted between 2011 and 2016. WHONET, a free software for the management of microbiology data, and SaTScan, a free cluster detection tool embedded in WHONET, were used to analyse 2015–2016 data of eligible hospitals. Manual evaluation and validation of 10 representative hospitals around Japan were then performed using 2011–2016 data.
Findings
Data from 1031 hospitals were studied; mid-sized (200–499 beds) hospitals accounted for 60%, followed by large hospitals (≥500 beds; 24%) and small hospitals (<200 beds; 16%). More clusters were detected in large hospitals. Most of the clusters included five or fewer patients. From the in-depth analysis of 10 hospitals, ∼80% of the detected clusters were unrecognized by infection control staff because the bacterial species involved were not included in the priority pathogen list for routine surveillance. In two hospitals, clusters of more susceptible isolates were detected before outbreaks of more resistant pathogens.
Conclusion
WHONET-SaTScan can automatically detect clusters of epidemiologically related patients based on isolate resistance profiles beyond lists of high-priority AMR pathogens. If clusters of more susceptible isolates can be detected, it may allow early intervention in infection control practices before outbreaks of more resistant pathogens occur."

abstract = "Summary
Aim
To describe a hospital outbreak of influenza B virus (InfB) infection during season 2015/2016 by combining clinical and epidemiological data with molecular methods.
Methods
Twenty patients diagnosed with InfB from a hospital outbreak over a four-week-period were included. Nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) positive for InfB by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction were sent for lineage typing and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Medical records were reviewed retrospectively for data regarding patient characteristics, localization, exposure and outcome, and assembled into a timeline. In order to find possible connections to the hospital outbreak, all patients with a positive NPS for influenza from the region over an extended time period were also reviewed.
Findings
All 20 cases of InfB were of subtype B/Yamagata, and 17 of 20 patients could be linked to each other by either shared room or shared ward. WGS was successful or partially successful for 15 of the 17 viral isolates, and corroborated the epidemiological link supporting a close relationship. In the main affected ward, 19 of 75 inpatients were infected with InfB during the outbreak period, resulting in an attack rate of 25%. One probable case of influenza-related death was identified.
Conclusion
InfB may spread within an acute care hospital, and advanced molecular methods may facilitate assessment of the source and extent of the outbreak. A multi-faceted approach, including rapid diagnosis, early recognition of outbreak situations, simple rules for patient management and the use of regular infection control measures, may prevent nosocomial transmission of influenza virus."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Endoscopic procedures are vital to gastrointestinal disease diagnosis and management, but risk infection transmission. In Australia, endoscopes undergo monthly-to-quarterly microbiological testing, to prevent patient infection. Endoscopes are used more frequently, meaning contamination may not be detected by this surveillance before infection transmission occurs.
Aim
To evaluate the use of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) measurement, alongside standard microbiological cultures, in detecting endoscope contamination before high-level disinfection. Using these results, we also aimed to confirm the efficacy of manual cleaning in reducing levels of ATP and cfu/mL.
Methods
Seventeen in-clinical-use gastroscopes and 24 in-clinical-use colonoscopes from the Liverpool Hospital Endoscopy unit were sampled across three separate cleaning stages before high-level disinfection. Colony counts and ATP measurements were then performed on these samples.
Findings
The correlation between the cfu/mL and RLU of samples collected from colonoscopes was 0.497 (95% confidence interval: 0.28–0.66; P < 0.0001). The correlation between cfu/mL and RLU for samples collected from gastroscopes was 0.377 (0.08–0.61; P = 0.0138). RLU and cfu/mL values were shown to fall significantly (P < 0.005) following precleaning and manual cleaning.
Conclusion
There was a significant correlation between ATP and cfu/mL measured from samples collected before high-level disinfection. Precleaning and manual cleaning were shown to reduce ATP and microbiological load significantly. ATP measurement can be performed within minutes with little training and produces results that are easy to interpret. These findings warrant further research on the utility of ATP measurement as a screening tool for detecting endoscope contamination after high-level disinfection."

Association between bioburden and presence of pathogens of high clinical relevance (PHCR) in a tertiary care centre and urban environment.
Methods
The overall bioburden measured by total colony count (TCC) was assessed using tryptic soy agar contact plates and two selective agars to improve detection of PHCR. Isolates were routinely identified to species level using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization – time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). The definition of PHCR was based on listings outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Findings
In total, 1431 contact plates were processed from 477 surfaces: 153 from hospitals and 324 from publicly accessible institutions or devices. At least one PHCR was identified from cultures from 73 samples. TCC was found to be poorly correlated with the presence of PHCR.
Conclusion
TCC poorly predicted the presence of PHCR, rendering the results from environmental sampling difficult to interpret. MALDI-TOF enables the identification of large numbers of isolates from the environment at low cost. Further studies on environmental contamination should use MALDI-TOF to identify all pathogens grown."

Following the first point-prevalence study in Dutch nursing homes conducted each November from 2007 to 2009, we conducted a follow-up point-prevalence study of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) each November from 2010 to 2017. Similar methods and criteria were used. Resident characteristics were recorded, data collection was performed by the attending elderly care physicians via an online survey, as well as via a specifically designed App from 2012. As of the same year, information on incontinence was added. Between 2010 until 2017 on average 1786 residents per year were included, ranging from 1571 to 2185. HCAI prevalence with respect to age (mean: 83 years) and sex (31% men and 69% women) were similar over all the years. The overall mean prevalence rate in the first four years was 6.7% versus 2.2% in the last six years. Urinary tract infection was the most prevalent HCAI (1.5%). Most HCAIs occurred among residents of rehabilitation units. The prevalence of HCAI varied by nursing home (0.0–37.0%). The average use of antibiotics was stable over the years (6.0%) irrespective of HCAI rate. Use of incontinence materials was on average 73.5% with 64.3% of residents being reported as incontinent. Those implementing improvement of infection control and surveillance within a new setting do need to continue for multiple years before seeing the success of their endeavour."

Background
In 2016–17 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) organized the second point prevalence survey (PPS) of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals. This survey included a validation study to maximize the accuracy of case identification and classification.
Aim
ECDC developed case vignettes to assess the performance of the national validation teams.
Methods
Case vignettes were developed by two medical doctors with experience in the management of HCAIs and antimicrobial stewardship. The case vignettes were based on actual clinical cases. The distribution of HCAIs among the case vignettes reflected the distribution of HCAIs in the previous PPS. All case vignettes were pilot-tested by three expert raters. Agreement among the expert raters was measured using kappa statistics.
Findings
Sixty case vignettes were developed. Twenty-nine of them were HCAI cases and 31 were cases without an HCAI. The inter-rater reliability using kappa statistics was 0.78 for the presence of HCAI and 0.89 for the antimicrobial use, respectively.
Conclusion
The agreement between the expert raters was very good for antimicrobial use and good for the presence of HCAI. Case vignettes can be a tool to support standardization of surveillance, improving the validity and comparability of the data."

Background
Evidence suggests that doffing and possibly disposal of used personal protective equipment (PPE) can lead to environmental contamination.
Aim
To ascertain the potential for site and floor contamination when medical gloves are inappropriately disposed.
Methods
Fifteen healthcare workers (HCWs) disposed of gloves inoculated with bacteriophage and a chemical dye into a wastebasket, located 1.22 m away. Following each trial, designated sample areas were visually inspected with a blacklight for fluorescent dye stains and swabbed with a 3M Letheen Broth sponge to quantify the bacteriophage.
Findings
The area closest to the participant (<0.30 m) had the highest bacteriophage concentrations (geomean: 6.9 × 103 pfu/100 cm2; range: 8.07 to 3.93 × 107 pfu/100 cm2). Bacteriophage concentrations were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in areas ≤0.61 m compared to >0.61 m from the HCWs. Although the farthest distances (1.22–1.52 m) resulted in 14% bacteriophage- and 4% fluorescent dye-positive occurrences, there was no significant difference (P = 0.069) between the tracers. The bacteriophage and chemical dye indicate highest environmental contamination nearest the HCWs and both tracers could be appropriate for PPE disposal training.
Conclusion
HCWs use gloves every workday and potentially could contaminate surrounding surfaces and floors, during improper disposal practices. Therefore, proper disposal techniques are required to minimize pathogen transmission by establishing industry-wide policies, adequate training, and education to HCWs."

Background
The healthcare burden of Clostridium (Clostridioides) difficile infection (CDI) is high but not fully characterized.
Aim
To assess hospitalization costs, length of hospital stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality attributable to CDI in the USA by analysing nationwide hospital discharge records over the 2012–2016 period.
Methods
A retrospective, observational study based on the Truven Health MarketScan Hospital Drug Database was conducted, in which 46,097 inpatient stays with a diagnosis of CDI were analysed. Costs, LOS and in-hospital mortality were studied for patients with either a principal or secondary (comorbidity) diagnosis of CDI, and for patients re-admitted because of CDI. If CDI was a comorbidity, its attributable burden was estimated by coarsened exact matching, comparing 17,273 CDI stays with 84,164 stays in a control group without a CDI diagnosis.
Findings
Inpatients for whom CDI was the main reason for hospitalization incurred mean costs of US$10,528 and an average LOS of 5.9 days. For CDI as a comorbidity, the mean additional cost was US$11,938 and the additional LOS was 4.4 days. CDI also increased the in-hospital mortality rate by 4.1%, on average.
Conclusion
This study is consistent with previous publications which demonstrated the high economic burden of CDI for healthcare settings and health insurance systems. When recorded as a comorbidity, CDI significantly increased hospital costs and LOS. These results highlight the need for innovative therapeutic approaches in the prevention and treatment of CDI."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antimicrobial resistance is a global health threat, partly driven by inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for acute medical patients in hospitals.
Aim
To provide a systematic review of qualitative research on antibiotic prescribing decisions in hospitals worldwide, including broad-spectrum antibiotic use.
Methods
A systematic search of qualitative research on antibiotic prescribing for adult hospital patients published between 2007 and 2017 was conducted. Drawing on the Health Belief Model, a framework synthesis was conducted to assess threat perceptions associated with antimicrobial resistance, and perceived benefits and barriers associated with antibiotic stewardship.
Findings
The risk of antimicrobial resistance was generally perceived to be serious, but the abstract and long-term nature of its consequences led physicians to doubt personal susceptibility. While prescribers believed in the benefits of optimizing prescribing, the direct link between over-prescribing and antimicrobial resistance was questioned, and prescribers' behaviour change was frequently considered futile when fighting the complex problem of antimicrobial resistance. The salience of individual patient risks was a key barrier to more conservative prescribing. Physicians perceived broad-spectrum antibiotics to be effective and low risk; prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics involved low cognitive demand and enabled physicians to manage patient expectations. Antibiotic prescribing decisions in low-income countries were shaped by a context of heightened uncertainty and risk due to poor microbiology and infection control services.
Conclusions
When tackling antimicrobial resistance, the tensions between immediate individual risks and long-term collective risks need to be taken into account. Efforts to reduce diagnostic uncertainty and to change risk perceptions will be critical in shifting practice."

Infection and malnutrition are interconnected. UK and Irish guidelines recommend the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) for nutritional risk screening. Patients with a MUST score of ≥2 are considered at high risk of malnutrition and referral for nutritional assessment is recommended.
Aim
To explore the association between healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) and the MUST score categories of patients.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study in May 2017 on ten representative wards in our institution. Patient demographics, MUST score, presence of medical devices, HCAI and antimicrobial use were collected.
Findings
Of 240 patients, the HCAI prevalence was 10.4% (N = 25) and 26% (N = 63) were at high risk of malnutrition (MUST score ≥2). Patients with HCAI were more likely to have had surgery (odds ratio (OR): 5.5; confidence interval (CI): 2.1–14.3; P < 0.001), a central vascular catheter (OR: 10.0; CI: 3.6–27.2; P < 0.001), or a urinary catheter in situ (OR: 7.5; CI: 2.8–20.0; P < 0.001), and to have a high risk of malnutrition (OR: 4.3; CI: 1.7–11.2; P < 0.001). A higher MUST score remained a significant predictor of a patient having HCAI on multivariate regression analysis (CI: 0.2–0.6; P < 0.001).
Conclusion
Patients at risk of malnutrition when assessed with the MUST were more likely to have HCAI. However, prospective studies are required to investigate the temporal association between MUST and HCAI and which interventions best address malnutrition risk and HCAI reduction in different settings."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hand hygiene (HH) plays an important role in infection prevention but is often suboptimal.
Aim
To test the potential of goal setting and performance feedback in improving HH.
Methods
A prospective controlled intervention study was conducted at a German hospital. The study involved four phases: habituation to novel count dispensers and observers (T0), baseline (T1), intervention (T2) and postintervention (T3). Four non-intensive-care units were assigned to one of four conditions: goal setting, performance feedback, both goal setting and performance feedback, or none (control). During all phases, dispenser usage was electronically recorded 24/7. In addition, randomly sampled direct observation was conducted by trained external observers during each phase. The main outcome measure was the daily average of electronically counted hand hygiene events (HHEs) per patient room.
Findings
In the feedback condition, a marginally significant increase in HHEs was found from T1 to T2 (MT1 = 7.3, MT2 = 10.3, MT3 = 8.2). In the goal-setting condition, HHEs increased only descriptively from T1 to T2 (MT1 = 6.8, MT2 = 8.7, MT3 = 7.8). In the combined condition, HHEs increased significantly from T1 to T2, and were still significantly elevated at T3 (MT1 = 7.9, MT2 = 17.0, MT3= 12.9). Over all wards and study phases, count dispenser usage frequency was highly correlated with HH compliance (ρ = 0.766, P<0.001).
Conclusion
This study suggests that combining goal setting and feedback is a useful approach for improving HH."

Background
An electronic reporting system (ERS) for the enhanced surveillance of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria (CPGNB) was launched by Public Health England in May 2015.
Aim
This evaluation aimed to assess uptake, timeliness and completeness of data provided and explore potential barriers and facilitators to adopting the system.
Methods
The evaluation comprised a retrospective analysis of surveillance data and semi-structured interviews with ERS users.
Findings
The proportion of organisms referred for investigation of carbapenem resistance via ERS increased over the first 12 months post-implementation from 35% to 73%; uptake varied widely across regions of England. Completeness of enhanced data fields was poor in 78% of submitted isolates. The median number of days to report confirmatory test results via ERS was 1 day for the regional service and nine days for the national reference laboratory, which additionally conducts phenotypic testing to confirm carbapenemase negativity. Hindrances to ERS utility included: a lack of designated, ongoing resource for system maintenance, technical support and development; uncertainty about how and when to use ERS and workload. Incomplete data prevented gaining a better understanding of important risk factors and transmission routes of CPGNB in England.
Conclusion
The ERS is the only surveillance system in England with the potential to gather intelligence on important risk factors for CPGNB to inform public health measures to control their spread. Although the ERS captures more information on CPGNB than other surveillance systems, timeliness and completeness of the enhanced data require substantial improvements in order to deliver the desired health benefits."

Background
To understand healthcare personnel's infection prevention behaviour has long been viewed as a key factor in preventing healthcare-associated infections. Suboptimal hand hygiene compliance and handling of materials, equipment, and surfaces present the main risks for potential organism transmission. Further exploration is needed regarding the role of context-specific conditions and the infection prevention behaviours of healthcare personnel. Such knowledge could enable the development of new intervention strategies for modifying behaviour.
Aim
To describe risk behaviours for organism transmission in daily care activities over time.
Methods
Unstructured observations of healthcare personnel carrying out patient-related activities were performed on 12 occasions over a period of 18 months.
Findings
Risk behaviours for organism transmission occur frequently in daily care activities and the results show that the occurrence is somewhat stable over time. Interruptions in care activities contribute to an increased risk for organism transmission that could lead to subsequent healthcare-associated infection.
Conclusion
Interventions aimed at reducing the risks of healthcare-associated infections need to focus on strategies that address: hand hygiene compliance; the handling of materials, equipment, work clothes and surfaces; the effects of interruptions in care activities if they are to alter healthcare personnel's infection prevention behaviour sufficiently."

Background
Skin antisepsis is performed before surgery to minimize the risk of surgical site infections. Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) is routinely used in this application, but it may be removed during surgery when prepped areas are exposed to fluid and repeated blotting.
Aim
This work evaluated the effect of adding a film-forming acrylate copolymer to a CHG-containing skin preparation on minimizing CHG loss during a simulated surgical irrigation and wiping procedure. The results were compared with those obtained with a commercially available water-soluble CHG preparation.
Methods
Two studies using excised porcine skin and one study on human volunteers were performed. In each study, the CHG preparations were applied and the treated sites were challenged with repetitive saline soaks and gauze dabbing to simulate surgical conditions. Challenged and unchallenged sites were analysed either for CHG content by high-performance liquid chromatography, or for bacterial log recovery after seeding an indicator organism (reflecting remaining CHG activity).
Findings
After irrigation and wiping, skin treated with the film-forming CHG preparation had more CHG remaining both on excised pig skin and in the human model. In the pig model, there was a lower recovery of inoculated bacteria with the CHG preparation containing the film-forming copolymer. No skin irritation or adverse events were reported in the human study.
Conclusions
The addition of a film-forming copolymer has the potential to improve the retention of CHG on skin throughout a surgical procedure compared to a water-soluble preparation. This improved retention may lead to better antimicrobial activity."

Background
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) surveillance is an essential part of any infection prevention and control programme. Repeated point prevalence surveys (PPSs) according to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) protocol have been implemented in all Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) region (Italy) acute hospitals to reduce and control HAIs.
Aim
Using the repeated PPSs within a regional-healthcare system (RHS) to promote and evaluate infection prevention and control (IPC) programmes.
Methods
The standard versions of the ECDC PPS protocols were used in all four surveys (2011, 2013, 2015, 2017). All RHS public and private accredited hospitals were involved within the ‘safe care network’ programme.
Findings
The numbers of surveyed patients in the four PPSs were 3172, 3253, 2969 and 3036, respectively. Prevalence of HAIs and antimicrobial use (AU) decreased significantly from 2011: HAIs (P<0.05) 7.1%, 6.3%, 5.5%, 5.8% and AU (P<0.01) 40.4%, 39.2%, 36.0%, 37.2%, respectively. The appropriateness of duration of surgical prophylaxis increased significantly (<24 h increased through surveys related to one in 2011: odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29, 0.92–1.81; 1.95, 1.31–2.91; 1.78, 1.20–2.64, respectively). The most frequently detected HAIs were: bloodstream, urinary tract, pneumonia and surgical site (more than the 70% of HAIs in each PPS).
Conclusion
The FVG regional approach to HAIs and AU surveillance was able to contribute to reduce prevalence over a 7-year period. Furthermore, it was able to keep hospital attention on HAIs and AU through the years and to guarantee a standardized and comparable evaluation of HAIs and AU burden in all RHS hospitals, as well as impacting on HAIs and AU regional programmes."

Background
The role of specific scoring systems in predicting risk of surgical site infections (SSIs) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has not been established.
Aim
To validate the most relevant predictive systems for SSIs after CABG.
Methods
Five predictive systems (eight models) for SSIs after CABG were evaluated retrospectively in 7090 consecutive patients undergoing isolated (73.9%) or combined (26.1%) CABG. For each model, accuracy of prediction, calibration, and predictive power were assessed with area under receiver–operating characteristic curve (aROC), the Hosmer–Lemeshow test, and the Goodman–Kruskal γ-coefficient, respectively. Six predictive scoring systems for 30-day in-hospital mortality after cardiac operations were evaluated as to prediction of SSIs. The models were compared one-to-one using the Hanley–McNeil method.
Findings
There were 724 (10.2%) SSIs. Whereas all models showed satisfactory calibration (P = 0.176–0.656), accuracy of prediction was low (aROC: 0.609–0.650). Predictive power was moderate (γ: 0.315–0.386) for every model but one (γ: 0.272). When compared one-to-one, the Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group mediastinitis score had a higher discriminatory power both in overall series (aROC: 0.634) and combined CABG patients (aROC: 0.648); in isolated CABG patients, both models of the Fowler score showed a higher discriminatory power (aROC: 0.651 and 0.660). Accuracy of prediction for SSIs was low (aROC: 0.564–0.636) even for six scoring systems devised to predict mortality after cardiac surgery.
Conclusion
In this validation study, current predictive models for SSIs after CABG showed low accuracy of prediction despite satisfactory calibration and moderate predictive power."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most frequent complication after colorectal surgery and have a major impact on length of stay and costs.
Aim
To analyse the incidence, timing, and treatment of SSIs within 30 days after colonic surgery.
Methods
This was a quality improvement project through retrospective analysis of consecutive colonic surgeries between February 2012 and October 2017 at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). SSIs were prospectively assessed by an independent national surveillance programme (www.swissnoso.ch) up to 30 postoperative days. Treatment strategies including drainage of infection (direct wound opening or percutaneous) and surgical management were reviewed.
Findings
The study cohort included 1263 patients with 532 procedures (42%) performed as emergencies. SSIs were observed in 271 patients (21%), occurring at median postoperative day (POD) 9 (interquartile range (IQR): 4–16). Specifically, 53 (4%) were superficial incisional, 65 (5%) deep incisional, and 153 (12%) organ space infections (anastomotic insufficiency included). Superficial incisional SSI occurred at a median of POD 10.5 (IQR: 7–15), deep incisional at a median of POD 10 (8–15) and organ space at a median of POD 8 (5–11). Diagnosis was performed post discharge in 64 cases (24%). Whereas 47% of organ space infections were detected by POD 7, this rate was only 26% for superficial and deep incisional infections (P = 0.003). Surgical management was necessary in 133 cases (49%), and the remaining cases were managed by drainage without general anaesthesia (138 cases, 51%).
Conclusion
Organ space infections occurred early in the postoperative course, whereas incisional infections were mostly detected post discharge over the entire 30-day observation period, emphasizing the importance of proper follow-up using a systematic, complete and independent surveillance programme."

Background
Staphylococcus aureus meningitis is an uncommon nosocomial infection usually associated with neurosurgical procedures, but spontaneous infections may occasionally appear.
Aims
To compare the features of meningitis caused by meticillin-resistant (MRSA) and meticillin-susceptible (MSSA) S. aureus and examine the prognostic factors for mortality, including MRSA infection and combined antimicrobial therapy.
Methods
Retrospective cohort study of 350 adults with S. aureus meningitis admitted to 11 hospitals in Spain (1981–2015). Logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to analyse prognostic factors.
Results
There were 118 patients (34%) with MRSA and 232 (66%) with MSSA. Postoperative infection (91% vs 73%) and nosocomial acquisition (93% vs 74%) were significantly more frequent in MRSA than in MSSA meningitis (P < 0.001). Combined therapy was given to 118 (34%) patients. Overall 30-day mortality rate was 23%. On multivariate analysis, mortality was associated with severe sepsis or shock (odds ratio (OR) 9.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.5–22.0, P < 0.001), spontaneous meningitis (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.9–9.1, P < 0.001), McCabe–Jackson score rapidly or ultimately fatal (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.4–5.4, P = 0.002), MRSA infection (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3–5.3, P = 0.006), and coma (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1–6.1, P < 0.029). In postoperative cases, mortality was related to retention of cerebrospinal devices (OR 7.9, 95% CI 3.1–20.3, P < 0.001).
Conclusions
Clinical and epidemiological differences between MRSA and MSSA meningitis may be explained by the different pathogenesis of postoperative and spontaneous infection. In addition to the severity of meningitis and underlying diseases, MRSA infection was associated with increased mortality. Combined antimicrobial therapy was not associated with increased survival."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Surveillance of surgical site infections (SSIs) is a core component of effective infection control practices, though its impact has not been quantified on a large scale.
Aim
To determine the time-trend of SSI rates in surveillance networks.
Methods
SSI surveillance networks provided procedure-specific data on numbers of SSIs and operations, stratified by hospitals' year of participation in the surveillance, to capture length of participation as an exposure. Pooled and procedure-specific random-effects Poisson regression was performed to obtain yearly rate ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and including surveillance network as random intercept.
Findings
Of 36 invited networks, 17 networks from 15 high-income countries across Asia, Australia and Europe participated in the study. Aggregated data on 17 surgical procedures (cardiovascular, digestive, gynaecological-obstetrical, neurosurgical, and orthopaedic) were collected, resulting in data concerning 5,831,737 operations and 113,166 SSIs. There was a significant decrease in overall SSI rates over surveillance time, resulting in a 35% reduction at the ninth (final) included year of surveillance (RR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.63–0.67). There were large variations across procedure-specific trends, but strong consistent decreases were observed for colorectal surgery, herniorrhaphy, caesarean section, hip prosthesis, and knee prosthesis.
Conclusion
In this large, international cohort study, pooled SSI rates were associated with a stable and sustainable decrease after joining an SSI surveillance network; a causal relationship is possible, although unproven. There was heterogeneity in procedure-specific trends. These findings support the pivotal role of surveillance in reducing infection rates and call for widespread implementation of hospital-based SSI surveillance in high-income countries."

Background
Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) occur only sporadically in Slovenia.
Aim
To describe the first Slovenian carbapenemase-producing (CP) Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli outbreak which occurred at the tertiary teaching hospital University Medical Centre Ljubljana from October 2014 to April 2015.
Methods
A CPE-positive case was defined as any patient infected or colonized with CPE. A strict definition of a contact patient was adopted. Measures to prevent cross-transmission included cohorting of all CPE carriers with strict contact precautions and assignment of dedicated healthcare workers, cohorting of all contact patients until obtaining the result of screening cultures, systematic rectal screening of contact patients, and tagging of all CPE-positive cases and their contacts. Educational campaigns on CPEs were implemented. Clinical specimens were processed using standard procedures. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to determine relatedness. Multi-locus sequence typing was performed on CP K. pneumoniae isolates that belonged to different pulsotypes.
Findings
Before the outbreak was brought under control, 40 patients were colonized or infected with OXA-48 and/or New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-producing CPE; in 38 patients OXA-48 and/or NDM-producing K. pneumoniae was detected, in seven OXA-48 and/or NDM-producing E. coli was found together with K. pneumoniae, and in two patients only CP E. coli was isolated. The outbreak was oligoclonal with two major CP K. pneumoniae clusters belonging to ST437 and ST147 in epidemiologically linked patients.
Conclusion
Initial standard control measures failed to prevent the outbreak. Once the problem had been recognized, strict infection control measures and the education of healthcare workers contributed to the successful control of the outbreak."

Background
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) helps to better investigate the transmission and characterization of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains.
Aim
We describe the detection and unfolding of a prolonged and spatially distributed nosocomial outbreak of Panton–Valentine leucocidin (PVL)-positive MRSA ST8 (USA300).
Methods
The outbreak was detected by the combination of whole genome sequence (WGS)-based typing, which is implemented for routine surveillance of multidrug-resistant bacteria in our institution, and in-depth epidemiological investigation. To investigate the source, processes were observed and environmental sampling performed. To contain the outbreak, regular and direct personal contact with the healthcare workers (HCWs) was maintained and staff education implemented.
Findings
The outbreak took place between October 2016 and November 2017 and included five patients who were treated in two different departments as inpatients and outpatients; three were infected, two were colonized. Additionally, three HCWs carried the outbreak strain. The strain was not found in the hospital environment. Only through non-mediated communication did the source become apparent. Decolonization of HCWs and infection control measures led to a resolution of the outbreak.
Conclusion
WGS helped to reveal an outbreak that otherwise might have stayed undetected. Nonetheless, epidemiological investigation is needed to trace the nosocomial transmission. The importance of personal communication in infection control cannot be overstated."

Background
Preterm infants and critically ill neonates are predisposed to nosocomial infections as sepsis. Moreover, these infants acquire commensal bacteria, which might become potentially harmful. On-ward transmission of these bacteria can cause outbreaks.
Aim
To report the findings of a prospective surveillance of bacterial colonization and primary sepsis in preterm infants and neonates.
Methods
The results of the surveillance of bacterial colonization of the gut and the respiratory tract, targeting meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and Gram-negative bacteria from November 2016 to March 2018 were analysed. Bacterial colonization was compared to surveillance of sepsis.
Findings
Six-hundred and seventy-one patients were admitted and 87.0 % (N=584) of the patients were screened; 48.3% (N=282) of the patients screened were colonized with at least one of the bacteria included in the screening; 26.2% of them (N=74) had multi-drug-resistant strains. A total of 534 bacterial isolates were found. The most frequently found species were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Three MRSA but no VRE were detected. The surveillance detected a K. pneumoniae cluster involving nine patients. There were 23 blood-culture-confirmed sepsis episodes; 60.9% (N=14) were caused by staphylococci. Gram-negative bacteria (one Klebsiella aerogenes and two E. cloacae) caused three sepsis episodes which were preceded by colonization with the respective isolates.
Conclusions
Surveillance of colonization provided a comprehensive overview of species and antibiotic resistance patterns. It allowed early detection of a colonization cluster. Knowledge of colonization and surveillance of sepsis is useful for guiding infection control measures and antibiotic treatment."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Point prevalence surveys (PPSs) collect data on hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) at one point in time but do not provide information on incidence over the entire admission or impact on patients or healthcare resources. Retrospective record review examines the entire admission to determine adverse event prevalence, incidence, preventability, physical impairment and additional length of stay.
Aim
To establish whether European HAI surveillance definitions can be applied to the Irish National Adverse Events Study (INAES) retrospective record review data to determine HAI burden.
Methods
In the INAES, 1574 admissions were reviewed using a two-stage methodology and 247 adverse events were found. These were examined against European HAI case definitions to determine whether the event was an HAI. Results were compared with the 2011/12 European PPS data for Ireland.
Findings
The prevalence of HAI adverse events in INAES was 4.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.1–6.1%) with an incidence of 3.8 (95% CI 2.5–5.2) HAI adverse events per 100 admissions. The PPS HAI prevalence for Ireland was 5.2%. HAI types and micro-organisms were similar in INAES and the PPS. Approximately three-quarters of INAES HAI adverse events were preventable, 7% caused permanent impairment and 7% contributed to death. A mean of 10 additional bed days were attributed to HAI adverse events, equivalent to €9400 per event.
Conclusion
Retrospective record review is an accurate source of information on HAI incidence, preventability and impact that complements PPS prevalence rates. HAI adverse events result in higher costs to the healthcare system than other adverse events."

abstract = "Summary
Background
To reduce the risk of transmission of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), international guidelines recommend admission screening to identify hospital patients at risk of colonization. However, routine monitoring indicates that optimum screening compliance levels are not always achieved. In order to enhance compliance, we must better understand those factors which influence staff screening behaviours.
Aim
To identify factors which influence staff compliance with hospital MRSA screening policies.
Methods
A sequential two-stage mixed-methods design applied constructs from normalization process theory and the theoretical domains framework to guide data collection and analysis. Initial qualitative findings informed subsequent development of a national cross-sectional survey of nursing staff (N = 450). Multiple regression modelling identified which barriers and enablers best predict staff compliance.
Findings
Three factors were significant in predicting optimum (>90%) compliance with MRSA screening: having MRSA screening routinized within the admission process; category of clinical area; feedback of MRSA screening compliance within the clinical area. Integration of data-sets indicated that organizational systems which ‘make doing the right thing easy’ influence compliance, as does local ward culture. Embedded values and beliefs regarding the relative (de)prioritization of MRSA screening are important.
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide original evidence of barriers and enablers to MRSA screening, applying both sociological and psychological theory. As antimicrobial resistance is a global health concern, these findings have international relevance for screening programmes. Future policy recommendations or behaviour change interventions, based on the insights presented here, could have significant impact upon improving screening compliance."

Since hand hygiene might prevent the risk of bacterial transmission from healthcare personnel attire (HCPA), the present study investigates the effect of alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) use on bacterial load and pathogenic species on HCPA.
Methods
HCPA from doctors and nurses was investigated for bacterial contamination post duty. Samples from distinct areas of HCPA were obtained and analysed for bacterial load and species. A standardized questionnaire was performed regarding time of duty and profession, and ABHR from each ward was calculated according to a national standard.
Findings
Bacterial load on HCPA (700 samples from 200 HCPA) was found to be up to four-fold higher when wearing for more than one shift. Moreover, doctors had a lower bacterial load on attire compared to nurses. In a multivariate linear regression model, negative correlations with bacterial load on HCPA were found for ABHR (t = –2.080, P = 0.0379) and being a doctor (t = –6.009, P < 0.0001), and a positive correlation for the time of duty (t = 10.572; P < 0.0001). Detection of Staphylococcus aureus as the most prominent pathogen found on HCPA was influenced by the time of duty (odds ratio: 3.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.93–5.72; P < 0.0001) but not by ABHR (1.22; 0.30–3.42).
Conclusion
ABHR, profession, and time of duty significantly affect the bacterial load on HCPA. Since the time of duty has the strongest impact on bacterial load, a daily change of HCPA is recommended."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Now that cleaning and decontamination are recognized as integral to infection control, it is timely to examine the process in more detail. This is because cleaning practices vary widely within healthcare districts, and it is likely that both time and energy are needlessly wasted with ill-defined duties. Furthermore, inadequate cleaning will not reduce the risk of infection but may even enhance it. The process would benefit from a systematic appraisal, with each component placed within an evidence-based and ordered protocol.
Methods
A literary search was performed on ‘hospital cleaning’, focusing on manual aspects of cleaning, pathogen reservoirs and transmission, hand hygiene, staff responsibilities and patient comfort.
Results
No articles providing an evidence-based practical approach to systematic cleaning in hospitals were identified. This review therefore proposes a simple four-step guide for daily cleaning of the occupied bed space. Step 1 (LOOK) describes a visual assessment of the area to be cleaned; Step 2 (PLAN) argues why the bed space needs preparation before cleaning; Step 3 (CLEAN) covers surface cleaning/decontamination; and Step 4 (DRY) is the final stage whereby surfaces are allowed to dry.
Conclusion
Given the lack of articles providing practical cleaning guidance, this review proposes a four-step protocol based on evidence if available, or justified where not. Each step is presented, discussed and risk-assessed. It is likely that a systematic cleaning process would reduce the risk of healthcare-associated infection for everyone, including outbreaks, in addition to heightened confidence in overall quality of care."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Burns patients are at high risk of nosocomial infection, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common causes of wound and systemic infections resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in burns patients.
Aim
To describe an outbreak of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDR-Pa) at a specialist burns service and highlight the challenges in identifying the reservoir of infection despite extensive epidemiological, microbiological, and environmental investigations.
Methods
Multi-disciplinary outbreak control investigation.
Findings
Following an inter-hospital transfer of a burns patient from another country, an admission screen revealed that the patient was colonized with MDR-Pa. Subsequently nine more patients contracted MDR-Pa in the period from November 2015 to September 2017. Given the relatively long gap between confirmation of the index and subsequent cases, it was not possible to identify with certainty the reservoirs and mechanisms of spread of infection, although contamination of the burns service environment and equipment are likely to be contributory factors.
Conclusion
Preventing infection transmission in specialist burns services is highly challenging, and it may not always be possible to identify and eradicate the reservoirs of infection for P. aeruginosa outbreaks. Our study supports the literature, providing additional evidence that inanimate, common contact surfaces play an important role in nosocomial transmission of P. aeruginosa. These surfaces should either be decontaminated efficiently between patient contacts or be single patient use. Enhanced vigilance is crucial, and, with strict adherence to infection prevention and control procedures, it is possible to reduce the risk of acquisition and spread of infection in patients."

Background
Large imaging systems in hybrid operating rooms are used increasingly. However, the effect of these ceiling-mounted imaging systems on air quality during surgical procedures has not been studied to date.
Aim
To evaluate the level of colony-forming units (cfu)/m3 near the surgical wound and near the instrument table during surgery.
Methods
Measurements were performed in four hybrid operating rooms at four different hospitals. During surgical procedures, at least three samples were taken with active slit air samplers. At the end of the day's surgical schedule, simulations involving movement of the ceiling-mounted system were also performed. The threshold value for the average cfu level during a surgical procedure was set at ≤10 cfu/m3, and for individual samples was set at ≤30 cfu/m3.
Results
The median value near the surgical wound was 1 cfu/m3 and at the instrument table was 2 cfu/m3. However, in one hybrid operating room (two procedures out of 16) where the instrument table was not positioned directly under the unidirectional flow (UDF) system, the threshold value for the average cfu level at the instrument table was exceeded. For one of these procedures, the maximum value for an individual sample was also exceeded.
Conclusions
A ceiling-mounted imaging system in combination with a UDF system can result in cfu levels near the surgical wound and at the instrument table that are well below the threshold value of 10 cfu/m3 during surgery. If the instrument table is not positioned directly under the UDF system, the cfu level is higher."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Handwashing is a key barrier to cross-infection performed at a handwash station (HWS). Elbow-operated outlets, if used incorrectly (with hands), become highly touched objects, potentially providing a route for cross-infection.
Aim
To study how elbow-operated outlets were used by staff in this hospital, whether the correct type of HWS had been installed in the various ward areas according to the Health Building Note (HBN) 00-10 Part C: Sanitary Assemblies (hands-free outlets in clinical, food preparation and laboratory areas), and factors impinging on design/setup which may affect compliance with correct use.
Methods
Observation of outlet use was performed by mounting a video camera above four HWSs. Review of suitability of outlet was conducted by two of the authors by visiting ward areas and assessing compliance against HBN recommendations. Angle of elbow-operated lever setup was measured using a protractor and water temperature in relation to angle of movement of elbow lever was measured using a calibrated thermocouple.
Findings
Ninety-two percent of staff used hands to turn on the outlet and 68% used hands to turn the outlet off, potentially re-contaminating their hands. More than 70% of users moved the lever ≤45°. Almost half of elbow levers were set up incorrectly, being flush or within 3.5 cm of the rear panel, making elbow operation extremely difficult. Selection of outlet type according to HBN was most incorrect in the intensive treatment unit but also occurred in the newly built parts of the hospital.
Conclusions
Although handwashing is a key barrier to cross-infection, poor selection and incorrect use of outlet undermines its effectiveness. Design and incorrect instalment further compromise the intended means of operation of elbow levers. Of equal concern is that this risk mostly goes unrecognized. There is an opportunity to improve handwashing safety, but it requires engagement across a broad stratum from Government Departments of Health and manufacturers down to the user."

Aims
To examine trends in the incidence, characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) hospitalizations from 2001 to 2015, to compare clinical variables among patients according to the diagnosis position (primary or secondary) of CDI, and to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality (IHM).
Methods
A retrospective study was performed using the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database, 2001–2015. The study population included patients who had CDI as the primary or secondary diagnosis in their discharge report. Annual hospitalization rates were calculated and trends were assessed using Poisson regression models and Jointpoint analysis. Multi-variate logistic regression models were performed to identify variables associated with IHM.
Findings
In total, 49,347 hospital discharges were identified (52.31% females, 33.69% with CDI as the primary diagnosis). The rate of hospitalization increased from 3.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2001–2003 to 12.97 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2013–2015. Severity of CDI and mean cost per patient increased from 6.36% and 3750.11€ to 11.19% and 4340.91€, respectively, while IHM decreased from 12.66% to 10.66%. Age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, severity, length of hospital stay and mean cost were significantly higher in patients with a primary diagnosis of CDI. Irrespective of the CDI diagnosis position, IHM was associated with male sex, older age, comorbidities, readmission and severity of CDI. Primary diagnosis of CDI was associated with lower IHM (odds ratio 0.60; 95% confidence interval 0.56–0.65).
Conclusion
CDI-related hospitalization rates are increasing, leading to a high cost burden, although IHM has decreased in recent years. Factors associated with IHM should be considered in strategies for the prevention and management of CDI."

To compare the effect of conventional wound dressings (CD) with vitamin E and silicone (E-Sil) dressings on incisional surgical site infection (SSI) in patients undergoing elective colorectal laparoscopic surgery.
Patients and methods
A prospective, randomized study was performed. Patients were assigned at random into two groups: an E-Sil group and a CD group. Incisional SSI, postoperative pain and acute phase reactants were investigated.
Results
In total, 120 patients were included in this study (60 in each group). The incisional SSI rate was 3.4% in the E-Sil group and 17.2% in the CD group (P = 0.013). Bacteroides fragilis alone grew in the cultures of infected wounds in the E-Sil group, while cultures for infected wounds in the CD group were polymicrobial. Mean postoperative pain 48 h after surgery was 27.1 [standard deviation (SD) 10.7] mm in the E-Sil group and 41.6 (SD 16.9) mm in the CD group (P < 0.001). White blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP) level were lower in the E-Sil group, even after the exclusion of patients presenting with postoperative complications.
Conclusion
Use of an E-sil dressing to cover the Pfannestiel wound after elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery leads to a reduction in the incisional SSI rate, lower postoperative pain, and a decrease in CRP level and WBC count."

Background
Effective alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) and healthcare worker compliance with hand hygiene guidelines are important in the prevention of infection transmission in healthcare settings. Compliance to hand hygiene guidelines is affected by many factors including education, ABHR availability, time pressure, skin health, and user acceptance of the sensory properties of ABHRs during and after application.
Aim
To examine the effect of ABHR format (gel/foam/liquid) and dose (0.7 mL, 1.5 mL, 3 mL) on its sensory properties and acceptability, and to consider how this might affect healthcare workers' hand hygiene compliance.
Methods
Sensory descriptive analysis established key sensory differences between ten market-leading ABHRs (three gels, four foams, two liquids, one aerosol foam). Focus groups reinforced these differences.
Findings
All formats were less desirable at the highest dose as they were more difficult to handle than the lower doses. Foams and gels became stickier, less clean-feeling and slower to dry at higher doses. Liquids gave a cleaner, smoother, more moisturized feel, but the increased difficulty in handling and applying the product negated these benefits. Overall, the gel and foam formats were more desirable than the liquid. The key desirable properties include: fast absorption, soft/moisturized hand feel, not sticky, clean feel, and low smell.
Conclusion
The 1.5 mL dose yielded the most acceptable properties with no extreme negative consequences. The foam provided the benefits of both the liquid and gel and combined them into a more widely acceptable format that may lead to greater hand hygiene compliance."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Multi-modal interventions are effective in increasing hand hygiene (HH) compliance among healthcare workers, but it is not known whether such interventions are cost-effective outside high-income countries.
Aim
To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of multi-modal hospital interventions to improve HH compliance in a middle-income country.
Methods
Using a conservative approach, a model was developed to determine whether reductions in meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (MRSA-BSIs) alone would make HH interventions cost-effective in intensive care units (ICUs). Transmission dynamic and decision analytic models were combined to determine the expected impact of HH interventions on MRSA-BSI incidence and evaluate their cost-effectiveness. A series of sensitivity analyses and hypothetical scenarios making different assumptions about transmissibility were explored to generalize the findings.
Findings
Interventions increasing HH compliance from a 10% baseline to ≥20% are likely to be cost-effective solely through reduced MRSA-BSI. Increasing compliance from 10% to 40% was estimated to cost US$2515 per 10,000 bed-days with 3.8 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained in a paediatric ICU (PICU) and US$1743 per 10,000 bed-days with 3.7 QALYs gained in an adult ICU. If baseline compliance is not >20%, the intervention is always cost-effective even with only a 10% compliance improvement.
Conclusion
Effective multi-modal HH interventions are likely to be cost-effective due to preventing MRSA-BSI alone in ICU settings in middle-income countries where baseline compliance is typically low. Where compliance is higher, the cost-effectiveness of interventions to improve it further will depend on the impact on hospital-acquired infections other than MRSA-BSI."

Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a daily concern in intensive care units. However, few data are available concerning the clinical consequences of in-vitro-defined resistance.
Aim
To compare the mortality of patients with nosocomial infections according to bacterial resistance profiles.
Methods
The prospective surveillance registry in 29 French intensive care units (ICUs) participating during the years 2000–2013 was retrospectively analysed. All patients presenting with a nosocomial infection in ICU were included.
Findings
The registry contained 88,000 eligible patients, including 10,001 patients with a nosocomial infection. Among them, 3092 (36.7%) were related to resistant micro-organisms. Gram-negative bacilli exhibited the highest rate of resistance compared to Gram-positive cocci (52.8% vs 48.1%; P < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher in cases of patients with antibiotic-resistant infectious agents (51.9% vs 45.5%; P < 0.001), and critical care length of stay was longer (33 ± 26 vs 29 ± 22 days; P < 0.001). These results remained significant after SAPS II matching (P < 0.001) and in the Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci subgroups.

Background
Hospital sinks, waste traps and drains can harbour carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE).
Aim
To investigate the dispersal of CRE from sinks in which water delivered from the tap flows directly into the drain and from clinical handwash basins with the drain at the rear. The effect of fast and slow drainage rates was also assessed.
Methods
Waste traps, known to be colonized with CRE, were taken from a hospital and installed within a model laboratory system. New waste traps were also installed and artificially inoculated with CRE. The potential for bacteria to be dispersed from sinks was assessed using cyclone air samplers and/or settle plates.
Findings
When the waste traps were artificially contaminated and CRE colonization was confined to the waste trap water, significantly fewer bacteria were dispersed from sinks that drained quickly (P = 0.004) and/or from rear-draining sinks (P = 0.002). When the waste traps were naturally contaminated and CRE colonized the trap, pipework and drain, there was significant interaction between sink drainage and position of the drain (P < 0.001). When drainage was slow, dispersal from rear-draining sinks was almost 30-fold less than from sinks with the drain underneath the tap (P < 0.001). When drainage was fast, rear-draining sinks again released comparatively fewer CRE, although, in this case, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.7). Contaminated splashes travelled up to 1 m from the sink.
Conclusion
Slow drainage rates and sink designs with the drain directly underneath the tap increase the risk of CRE present in waste traps and drains contaminating the ward environment."

Background
Dental handpieces undergo a decontamination process before reutilization. Thorough cleaning is a prerequisite to effective sterilization, to guarantee safety and prevent cross-infections.
Aim
To assess the cleaning efficacy offered by devices dedicated to dental handpieces.
Methods
PIDTests©, which are patented tubes made of transparent material and designed to replace handpieces in cleaning devices, were artificially stained by Soil Test© (Browne/STERIS). Three cycles were performed with PIDTests© connected to every handpiece adapter in the four different machines tested: X-Cid 2© (Micro-Mega) with a total of nine PIDTests©; iCare+© (NSK) with nine PIDTests©; DAC Universal© (W&H) with 18 PIDTests©; and BioDA 80© (VR2M) with 24 PIDTests©. A visual evaluation and a biuret reaction test were performed.
Findings
In three of the tested cleaning devices (X-Cid2©, iCare+© and DAC Universal©), all of the PIDTests© showed Soil Test© residues, on the internal and external surfaces indicating cleaning was ineffective. Only the BioDA 80© showed no residual stains on all the PIDTests© and negative biuret reaction test results, making the cleaning effective.
Conclusions
Manufacturers should optimize the cleaning device parameters, based on the Sinner circle (grouping compensatory parameters which influence the effectiveness of a cleaning process, such as pressure, temperature, time, detergent concentration), to improve cleaning efficacy and enable dental surgeons to ensure the safety. Although PIDTests© are the only tool to provide visual indications on the cleaning efficacy of washer-disinfectors dedicated to handpieces, manufacturers should continue with the development of improved and validated tools to assess cleaning efficacy."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Healthcare worker (HCW) hand hygiene compliance is key to patient safety; however, compliance is suboptimal. Nevertheless hand hygiene compliance is not well studied in the long-term care setting.
Aim
To apply a behaviour change framework, the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), to identify modifiable facilitators and barriers for HCW hand hygiene compliance in long-term care settings.
Methods
HCW hand hygiene compliance facilitators and barriers were examined using a questionnaire for HCWs from long-term care homes in Ontario, Canada. The questionnaire was informed by the TDF, which is based on a synthesis of constructs from a number of relevant psychological theories of behaviour change.
Findings
Barriers identified from the questionnaire aligned with the TDF domain environmental context and resources (time pressure, workload, and environmental controls). Facilitators identified from questionnaire results aligned with the TDF domains social/professional role and identity (it is what is expected of HCWs), and beliefs about consequences (risk of transmission of micro-organisms to self or others).
Conclusion
There are several barriers to hand hygiene compliance that persist in long-term care. A behaviour change theory-informed framework such as the TDF can be helpful to identify those barriers. This study identified several key behavioural constructs aligned with the TDF that can be targeted when developing novel hand hygiene interventions."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Healthcare-acquired Clostridium difficile infection (HA-CDI) is a common infection and a financial burden on the healthcare system.
Aim
To estimate the hospital-based financial costs of HA-CDI by comparing time-fixed statistical models that attribute cost to the entire hospital stay to time-varying statistical models that adjust for the time between admission, diagnosis of HA-CDI, and discharge and that only attribute HA-CDI costs post diagnosis.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted (April 2008 to March 2011) using clinical and administrative costing data of inpatients (≥15 years) who were admitted to The Ottawa Hospital with stays >72 h. Two time-fixed analyses, ordinary least square regression and generalized linear regression, were contrasted with two time-dependent approaches using Kaplan–Meier survival curve.
Findings
A total of 49,888 admissions were included and 366 (0.73%) patients developed HA-CDI. Estimated total costs (Canadian dollars) from time-fixed models were as high as $74,928 per patient compared to $28,089 using a time-varying model, and these were 1.47-fold higher compared to a patient without HA-CDI (incremental cost $8,997 per patient). The overall annual institutional cost at The Ottawa Hospital associated with HA-CDI was as high as $10.07 million using time-fixed models and $1.62 million using time-varying models.
Conclusion
When calculating costs associated with HA-CDI, accounting for the time between admission, diagnosis, and discharge can substantially reduce the estimated institutional costs associated with HA-CDI."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Widespread antibiotic resistance has led to fears that we are entering a post-antibiotic era and the relatively simple premise of hand washing to reduce transfer of bacteria and viruses has never been more important. Much of the emphasis has been on hand-washing technique, type of soap, and maintaining compliance but effective drying of the hands is just as important.
Aim
To compare the efficacy of drying washed hands with a jet air dryer or paper towels to remove transient bacterial contamination and to determine the effect on residential flora.
Methods
Eighty volunteers were recruited. The entire surfaces of volunteers' hands were artificially contaminated with Escherichia coli before being washed and dried; then bacteria remaining on the skin were recovered and enumerated. In the second part of the study the number and types of bacteria comprising the natural flora remaining on washed and dried hands were determined.
Findings
Significantly fewer transient and residential bacteria remained on the skin if hands were dried with a jet air dryer (P < 0.001). Drying hands with paper towels increased the number of resident bacteria, including potentially pathogenic species, released from the volunteers' skin, compared to a jet air dryer.
Conclusion
The number and types of bacteria remaining on washed hands were affected by the drying method. Hands dried with a jet air dryer harboured fewer viable bacteria, reducing the risk of infection transmission via touch. This could be especially important for healthcare workers who are constantly in contact with large numbers of vulnerable patients."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The incidence of Escherichia coli bacteraemia in England is increasing amid concern regarding the roles of antimicrobial resistance and nosocomial acquisition on burden of disease.
Aim
To determine the relative contributions of hospital-onset E. coli bloodstream infection and specific E. coli antimicrobial resistance patterns to the burden and severity of E. coli bacteraemia in West London.
Methods
Patient and antimicrobial susceptibility data were collected for all cases of E. coli bacteraemia between 2011 and 2015. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association between the category of infection (hospital or community-onset) and length of stay, intensive care unit admission, and 30-day all-cause mortality.
Findings
E. coli bacteraemia incidence increased by 76% during the study period, predominantly due to community-onset cases. Resistance to quinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides also increased over the study period, occurring in both community- and hospital-onset cases. Hospital-onset and non-susceptibility to either quinolones or third-generation cephalosporins were significant risk factors for prolonged length of stay, as was older age. Rates of mortality were 7% and 12% at 7 and 30 days, respectively. Older age, a higher comorbidity score, and bacteraemia caused by strains resistant to three antibiotic classes were all significant risk factors for mortality at 30 days.
Conclusion
Multidrug resistance, increased age, and comorbidities were the main drivers of adverse outcome. The rise in E. coli bacteraemia was predominantly driven by community-onset infections, and initiatives to prevent community-onset cases should be a major focus to reduce the quantitative burden of E. coli infection."

Background
Haemodialysis is a risk factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission. Two patients receiving haemodialysis in a Dutch dialysis unit in The Hague were found to seroconvert to HCV in December 2016 after the yearly routine control for blood-borne viruses. Following the presumed time of infection, three chronically infected HCV patients were identified as possible index cases.
Aim
To confirm inter-patient transmission and to identify the source.
Methods
Molecular investigation and review of medical records were performed.
Findings
Both of the incident cases and one of the three possible index cases were demonstrated to be infected with HCV genotype 2b based on 5′UTR sequencing. Epidemiological relatedness between these viruses was further investigated by sequencing of the NS5A region. Phylogenetic analysis clearly identified the incident cases and the index case to represent a cluster distinct from unrelated controls with HCV genotype 2b. Detailed review of the medical records identified two possible incidents that might have resulted in the HCV transmission cases: contamination of the venous pressure-sensing port due to high venous pressures or incomplete compliance with infection control precautions of the unit staff during handling of two incidents, that occurred at the same time in a single haemodialysis session with the index patient as well as both incident cases present.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that detailed incident recording in combination with state-of-the-art molecular investigations such as sequencing of the NS5A region resulted in unravelling a set of two HCV transmissions that occurred at a haemodialysis unit."

Background
Nurse understaffing and increased nursing workload have been associated with increased risk of adverse patient outcomes and even mortality.
Aim
To determine whether nurse staffing and nursing workload are associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia and mortality.
Methods
This prospective, observational cohort study was conducted in a single tertiary-level teaching hospital in Finland during 2014–2015. The association between nurse staffing, nursing workload and prognosis was determined using daily nurse-to-patient ratios, Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System and Intensive Care Nursing Scoring System scores, and Intensive Care Nursing Scoring System indices. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was defined according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.
Findings
Evaluable data was available for 85 patients. The overall ventilator-associated pneumonia and 28-day mortality rates were 23.5% and 35.3%, respectively. Nurse staffing, measured as the daily lowest nurse-to-patient ratio (P = 0.006) and median Intensive Care Nursing Scoring System index (P = 0.046), were significantly lower in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. In addition, nursing workload, measured as median scores obtained by the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (P = 0.009) and Intensive Care Nursing Scoring System (P = 0.03), was significantly higher in infected patients. The median (P = 0.02) and daily highest (P = 0.03) Intensive Care Nursing Scoring System scores were significantly higher in non-survivors.
Conclusions
Lower nurse staffing and increased nursing workload are associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia and mortality, demonstrating that adequate staffing is a prerequisite for the availability and quality of critical care services."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) is emerging in German intensive care units (ICUs). On a 32-bed surgical ICU at a university hospital, increasing numbers of nosocomial cases occurred despite enforcement of hand hygiene and environmental disinfection.
Aim
To introduce universal octenidine-based bathing in order to reduce the burden of VRE.
Methods
Between January 2012 and March 2014, patients were screened for VRE on admission and twice weekly. Active surveillance was undertaken for VRE infections and colonizations, and for bloodstream infections (BSI) with any pathogen. Intervention in this before–after study comprised of standardized octenidine-based bathing. Distinct subgroups of VRE colonizations or infections were defined and used for statistical analysis of frequency, prevalence and incidence density.
Findings
In the pre-intervention period (January 2012 to April 2013), the admission prevalence of VRE was 4/100 patients and the mean incidence density of nosocomial cases was 7.55/1000 patient-days (PD). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed prevalence of three vanA and two vanB clusters. In the post-intervention period (August 2013 to March 2014), the admission prevalence of VRE was 2.41/100 patients and the mean incidence density of nosocomial cases was 2.61/1000 PD [P = 0.001 (pre- vs post-intervention)]. Thirteen nosocomial VRE infections were identified in the pre-intervention period, compared with one nosocomial VRE infection in the post-intervention period. Incidence densities of BSI pre- and post-intervention were 2.98 and 2.06/1000 PD (P = 0.15), respectively.
Conclusion
The epidemiology of emerging VRE appeared as a complex mix of admitted cases and transmissions in small clusters, challenging infection control measures. The implementation of universal octenidine-based bathing combined with a standardized washing regime led to a significant reduction in nosocomial VRE."

Background
Five cases of multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii (MRA) producing OXA-23 and OXA-51 occurred in a regional burn intensive care unit (BICU). Three were repatriated from other parts of the world (Dubai and Mumbai) and colonized on admission. Despite optimal precautions, two patients acquired MRA. Both had been nursed in the same room.
Methods
Multi-disciplinary outbreak investigation of MRA in a regional BICU.
Findings
The mechanism of transfer for the first case is thought to have been contaminated air from theatre activity releasing MRA bacteria into the communal corridor. No MRA patients went to theatre between the first and second acquired cases. The mechanism of transfer for the second case is thought to have been via a shower unit that was decontaminated inadequately between patients.
Conclusion
In an outbreak where contact precautions and environmental cleaning are optimal, it is important to give careful consideration to other mechanisms of spread. If there is a failure to do this, it is likely that the true causes of transmission will not be addressed and the problem will recur. It is recommended that burn theatres within burn facilities should be designed to operate at negative pressure; this is the opposite of normal operating theatre ventilation. Where showers are used, both the shower head and the hose should be changed after a patient with a resistant organism. The role of non-contact disinfection (e.g. hydrogen peroxide dispersal) should be reconsidered, and constant vigilance should be given to any ‘trojan horse’ item in the room."

Background
β-Lactamase resistance among certain Gram-negative bacteria has been associated with increased mortality, length of hospitalization, and hospital costs.
Aim
To identify and critically appraise existing clinical prediction models of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-EKP) infection or colonization.
Methods
Electronic databases, reference lists, and citations were searched from inception to April 2018. Papers were included in any language describing the development or validation, or both, of models and scores to predict the risk of ESBL-EKP infection or colonization.
Findings
In all, 1795 references were screened, of which four articles were included in the review. The included studies were carried out in different geographical locations with differing study designs, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most if not all studies lacked external validation and blinding of reviewers during the evaluation of the predictor variables and outcome. All studies excluded missing data and most studies did not report the number of patients excluded due to missing data. Fifteen predictors of infection or colonization with ESBL-EKP were identified. Commonly included predictors were previous antibiotic use, previous hospitalization, transfer from another healthcare facility, and previous procedures (urinary catheterization and invasive procedures).
Conclusion
Due to limitations and variations in the study design, clinicians would have to take these differences into consideration when deciding on how to use these models in clinical practice. Due to lack of external validation, the generalizability of these models remains a question. Therefore, further external validation in local settings is needed to confirm the usefulness of these models in supporting decision-making."

Background
The spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) in healthcare environments has become a major public health threat in recent years.
Aim
To assess how healthcare workers (HCWs) manage excreta and the possible association with the incidence of ESBL-PE.
Methods
Eight hundred HCWs and 74 nurse-supervisors were questioned through two self-report questionnaires in order to assess their knowledge and practices, and to determine the equipment utilized for excreta management in 74 healthcare departments. Performance on equipment utilized, knowledge and practices were scored as good (score of 1), intermediate (score of 2) or poor (score of 3) on the basis of pre-established thresholds. Linear regression was performed to evaluate the association between HCWs' knowledge/practices and the incidence of ESBL-PE.
Findings
Six hundred and eighty-eight HCWs (86%) and all nurse-supervisors participated in the survey. The proportions of respondents scoring 1, 2 and 3 were: 14.8%, 71.6% and 17.6% for equipment; 30.1%, 40.6 % and 29.3% for knowledge; and 2.0%, 71.9% and 26.1% for practices, respectively. The single regression mathematic model highlighted that poor practices (score of 3) among HCWs was significantly associated with increased incidence of ESBL-PE (P = 0.002).
Conclusions
A positive correlation was found between HCWs' practices for managing excreta and the incidence of ESBL-PE, especially in surgical units. There is an urgent need for development of public health efforts to enhance knowledge and practices of HCWs to better control the spread of multi-drug-resistant bacteria, and these should be integrated within infection control programmes."

Background
During high-incidence influenza seasons, a robust infection prevention and control policy is imperative to reduce nosocomial transmission of influenza.
Aim
To assess the impact of influenza point-of-care testing (POCT) in an emergency department (ED) and patient cohorting on an influenza ward on infection prevention and control and clinical outcomes.
Methods
Influenza POCT was operational in the study ED from 21st January 2018 and patient cohorting was operational on an influenza ward from 25th January 2018. A retrospective ‘before–after’ analysis was performed with pre-intervention defined as 1st November 2017 to 20th January 2018 and post-intervention defined as 21st January 2018 to 30th April 2018. The primary outcome was the rate of hospital-acquired influenza. Secondary outcomes included antiviral prescription and length of stay. The length of time that inpatients remained influenza-positive was estimated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Findings
There were 654 inpatients with confirmed influenza during the 2017/18 influenza season: 223 pre- and 431 post-intervention. Post-intervention, there were fewer cases of hospital-acquired influenza per day (0.66 vs 0.95, P < 0.0001), median length of stay was shorter (5.5 vs 7.5 days, P = 0.005) and antiviral prescription was more frequent (80% vs 64.1%, P < 0.0001). Cohorting released 779 single rooms for use elsewhere in the trust. The fixed probability of being PCR-negative by the next day (P) was 0.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12–0.16] for immunocompetent patients. This implies that half of immunocompetent patients are PCR-negative by five days post-diagnosis (95% CI 5–6).
Conclusion
Influenza POCT in an ED and patient cohorting on an influenza ward were associated with reduced nosocomial transmission of influenza and improved patient flow. A policy of retesting immunocompetent patients five days post-diagnosis could allow half of these patients to come out of respiratory isolation earlier."

Background
Nurses are considered as the key to infection prevention as they play a major role in treatment as well as taking care of patients.
Aim
To assess the role of a multi-modal intervention (MMI) in improving nurses' competency and adherence to standard infection control practices in Bangladesh.
Methods
The study adopted a pretest–post-test intervention approach, in three different periods (from 2012 to 2017) in five hospitals (two public, two private, and one autonomous) in Bangladesh. Each study period was divided into three phases: pretest, MMI, and post-test. Data were collected on 642 nurses using direct observation method through a structured checklist.
Findings
After implementing the MMI, overall hand hygiene compliance significantly increased before patient contact (from 1.3% to 50.2%; P < 0.000) and after patient contact (from 2.8% to 59.6%; P < 0.000). Remarkable improvements were also achieved in adherence to use of gloves (from 14.6% to 57.6%; P < 0.000), maintaining sterility of equipment during aseptic techniques (from 34.9% to 86%; P < 0.000), biomedical waste segregation (from 1.8% to 81.3%; P < 0.000) and labelling of procedural sites (from 0% to 85.7%; P < 0.000). Moreover, needlestick injury rate notably decreased (from 6.2% to 0.6%; P < 0.000).
Conclusion
MMI can play a vital role in improving nurses' compliance with the standard infection control practices. Such context-specific interventions, which are crucial for preventing healthcare-associated infections and for decreasing occupational hazards, should be replicated in resource-poor countries for achieving universal health coverage by 2030."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Biofilms that develop on dry surfaces in the healthcare environment have increased tolerance to disinfectants. This study compared the activity of formulated oxidizing disinfectants with products containing active ingredients against Staphylococcus aureus dry-surface biofilm (DSB) alone.
Methods
DSB was grown in the CDC bioreactor with alternating cycles of hydration and dehydration. Disinfectant efficacy was tested before and after treatment with neutral detergent for 30 s, and in the presence or absence of standardized soil. Biofilms were treated for 5 min with peracetic acid (Surfex and Proxitane), hydrogen peroxide (Oxivir and 6% H2O2 solution) and chlorine (Chlorclean and sodium dichloroisocyanurate tablets). Residual biofilm viability and mass were determined by plate culture and protein assay, respectively.
Findings
Biofilm viability was reduced by 2.8 log10 for the chlorine-based products and by 2 log10 for Proxitane, but these products failed to kill any biofilm in the presence of soil. In contrast, Surfex completely inactivated biofilm (6.3 log10 reduction in titre) in the presence of soil. H2O2 products had little effect against DSB. Biofilm mass removed in the presence and absence of soil was <30% by chlorine and approximately 65% by Surfex. Detergent treatment prior to disinfection had no effect.
Conclusion
The additives in fully formulated disinfectants can act synergistically with active ingredients, and thus increase biofilm killing whilst decreasing the adverse effect of soil. It is suggested that purchasing officers should seek efficacy testing results, and consider whether efficacy testing has been conducted in the presence of biological soil and/or biofilm."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The Japanese healthcare system has been based on universal health coverage since 1961. Nationwide antimicrobial use on a hospital-by-hospital basis has not previously been recorded.
Objectives
To determine the nationwide distribution of carbapenem use on a hospital-by-hospital basis and to build predictive models using available hospital data from Japan.
Methods
An ecological study was conducted using open data released from the Government of Japan. The distribution of days of therapy with carbapenem (per 1000 patient-days) was analysed and predictive models built. The top 1% heavy users by crude distribution and observed-per-predicted ratio distribution were listed and compared. The analysis was conducted in three subcategories stratified by hospital characteristics (tertiary, secondary acute care, and fee-for-service) and among patients in two age groups (16–65 and >65 years).
Findings
The median days of therapy in the group aged 16–65 years were 7.24 for tertiary hospitals, 3.28 for secondary acute care hospitals, and 1.42 for fee-for-service hospitals. The median days of therapy of the group aged >65 years were 17.28 for tertiary hospitals, 14.43 for secondary acute care hospitals, and 8.21 for fee-for-service hospitals. For multivariable linear regression analyses, each model selected a different combination of covariates from the potential predictors based on hospital characteristics.
Conclusion
Because a single predictive model was not appropriate for all hospitals, tailored models are needed to identify hospitals that are heavy users of carbapenem. These findings may serve as a reference to support further research on antibiotic use in healthcare and aid future policies."

abstract = "Summary
Background
At present, reprocessing of sterilizable medical equipment is recommended to be initiated within 6 h after completion of surgery, to ensure that the quality of the instruments does not deteriorate. A literature search showed a lack of evidence for consequences that may occur if medical personnel deviate from the standard 6 h sterilization protocol.
Aim
To evaluate the 6 h recommendation for reprocessing sterilizable medical equipment by determining whether residual protein increased proportional to holding time before reprocessing was initiated, and likewise whether an increase in corrosion was present on surgical scissors proportional to holding time.
Methods
Residual protein was identified on surgical instruments contaminated with human blood after different holding times and before washes using the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) method. Corrosion was identified on surgical scissors contaminated with human blood after different holding times and after reprocessing using light stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy.
Findings
Protein residues ranged between 14.0 and 51.9 μg and thus below the accepted threshold of 100 μg per instrument surface. Corrosion corresponding to 0.05% of the surface was identified on 22 of 30 scissors. Pitting corrosion was seen on four of 30 scissors.
Conclusion
No association was identified between residual protein and holding time, nor between incidence of corrosion and holding time. The study thereby challenges the relevance of upholding the recommendation of a maximum wait of 6 h prior to reprocessing. The findings will potentially have an impact on the organization of reprocessing of surgical instruments in Denmark and internationally."

Background
Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal units worldwide. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a leading causative pathogen. Many neonatal units experience endemic colonization and infection of their infants, which is often very challenging to successfully eradicate.
Aim
To assess the impact of neonatal unit refurbishment and redesign on endemic MRSA colonization and infection.
Methods
A retrospective review was carried out over an eight-year period in a 14-cot, level 2–3 neonatal unit in University Hospital Galway, a large university teaching hospital in the West of Ireland. Surveillance, colonization, and infection data for a four-year period pre and four-year period post neonatal unit refurbishment are described. Clinical and microbiological data were collected on all MRSA-colonized and -infected infants between 2008 and 2015. Molecular typing data are available for MRSA isolates. An interrupted time-series design was used, with unit refurbishment as the intervention.
Findings
Our neonatal unit had a pattern of sustained transmission of endemic resident MRSA strains which we could not eradicate despite repeated standard infection control interventions. Complete unit refurbishment led to successful termination of sustained transmission of these strains. Colonization decreased and no infants were actively infected post refurbishment of the unit.
Conclusion
We report successful termination of sustained transmission of endemic strains of MRSA from our neonatal unit following complete unit redesign and refurbishment."

Multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative organisms (MDRGNO) are an emerging global threat, reflected in the increasing incidence of infections in Ireland and elsewhere. The response to this threat has been the development of Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) guidelines. A survey of IPC teams in Ireland was undertaken to assess compliance with national guidelines. To place these survey results in context, IPC guidelines from the Irish Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) are compared with guidelines from Healthcare Infection Society (HIS), European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and Centre for Disease Control (CDC). Thirty-three percent of hospitals responded across a range of hospital types. The results highlight the variability in implementation of guidelines across Ireland, as well as the variability between guidelines internationally. Respondents are less than 90% compliant with the majority of MDRGNO screening guidelines. Hospitals have variable access to isolation facilities with an average of 29% single rooms available (range 2.6–100%), resulting in some patients with MDRGNO not being isolated. Broad variability in application of guidance on personal protective equipment was demonstrated. This survey gives an insight into the real-life applicability of HPSC guidelines. Survey results are placed in context with a comparison of five MDRGNO IPC guidelines. Although core tenets of IPC are standard across guidelines, research into which practices are efficient in reducing MDRGNO transmission while being cost-effective would be worthwhile."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Handwashing sink drains are increasingly implicated as a potential reservoir of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospital outbreaks; however, usage patterns that may promote this source remain unknown.
Aim
To understand behaviours in the intensive care unit (ICU) that may facilitate establishment and nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant Gram negatives from a sink-trap reservoir to a patient.
Methods
Motion-sensitive cameras captured anonymized activity paired with periodic in-person observations during a quality investigation from four ICU sinks (two patient rooms and two patient bathrooms) in a university hospital.
Findings
We analysed 4810 sink videos from 60 days in patient rooms (3625) and adjoining bathrooms (1185). There was a false-positive rate of 38% (1837 out of 4810) in which the camera triggered but no sink interaction occurred. Of the 2973 videos with analysed behaviours there were 5614 observed behaviours which were assessed as: 37.4% medical care, 29.2% additional behaviours, 17.0% hand hygiene, 7.2% patient nutrition, 5.0% environmental care, 4.2% non-medical care. Handwashing was only 4% (224 out of 5614) of total behaviours. Sub-analysis of 2748 of the later videos further categorized 56 activities where a variety of nutrients, which could promote microbial growth, were disposed of in the sink.
Conclusion
Several non-hand hygiene activities took place regularly in ICU handwashing sinks; these may provide a mechanism for nosocomial transmission and promotion of bacterial growth in the drain. Redesigning hospital workflow and sink usage may be necessary as it becomes apparent that sink drains may be a reservoir for transmission of multidrug-resistant bacteria."

Emergency departments (EDs) carry a high risk of infectious disease transmission and have also been implicated in tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks.
Aim
To determine if patients who visit EDs have an increased risk of TB infection. Using South Korean inpatient sample data (2012), the risk of TB occurrence during 90 days after hospitalization for patients admitted via EDs was compared with that for patients admitted via outpatient clinics.
Methods
The data of the 2012 Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service – National Inpatient Sample were used. TB diagnosis was based on International Classification of Diseases Version 10 [all TB (A15–A19), pulmonary TB (A15-A16) and extrapulmonary TB (A17–A18)].
Findings
After propensity score matching using the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, 191,997 patients (64,017 patients admitted via EDs and 127,908 patients admitted via outpatient clinics) were included in this study. There was no significant difference in baseline patient characteristics between the two groups. The percentage of patients with TB admitted via EDs was higher than that of patients admitted via outpatient clinics. The likelihood of active TB occurrence was 30% higher for all TB [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12–1.52] and pulmonary TB (HR 1.30; 95% CI 1.10–1.53) in patients admitted via EDs compared with patients admitted via outpatient clinics; this difference was significant.

Background
Recent studies reported seasonality in healthcare-associated infections (HCAI). The association of this phenomenon with other risk factors for HCAI is not clear.
Aim
To analyse the interplay of season, weather and usual predictors of healthcare-associated bloodstream infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli (GNB-BSI).
Methods
A case-only study was conducted in a teaching hospital in Brazil. The study enrolled 446 subjects with GNB-BSI diagnosed from July 2012 to June 2016. Demographic data, comorbidities, invasive procedures and use of antimicrobials were reviewed in medical charts. The season in which GNB-BSI occurred, and weather parameters on the day of diagnosis were recorded. Factors associated with occurrence of GNB-BSI in different seasons (reference category: winter) and caused by different GNB (reference category: Escherichia coli) were analysed. Uni- and multi-variable models of multi-nomial logistic regression were used for analysis.
Findings
GNB-BSI diagnosed in summer was more likely to be caused by Klebsiella spp. [odds ratio (OR) 5.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.04–13.96] or Acinetobacter baumannii (OR 2.69; 95% CI 1.04–6.96), and there was an association between Klebsiella spp. and spring (OR 2.86; 95% CI 1.14–7.18). Average temperature on the day of diagnosis was associated with Klebsiella spp. (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.07–1.33) and A. baumannii (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.07–1.34).
Conclusion
Warm seasons and daily temperature impact on the aetiology of GNB-BSI, even in models adjusted for usual risk factors. One possible explanation for these findings is that seasonality of healthcare-associated pathogens is intrinsic to micro-organisms, and not associated with comorbidities, procedures or use of antimicrobials."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) affects millions of patients worldwide. HCAI is associated with increased healthcare costs, owing primarily to increased hospital length of stay (LOS) but calculating these costs is complicated due to time-dependent bias. Accurate estimation of excess LOS due to HCAI is essential to ensure that we invest in cost-effective infection prevention and control (IPC) measures.
Aim
To identify and review the main statistical methods that have been employed to estimate differential LOS between patients with, and without, HCAI; to highlight and discuss potential biases of all statistical approaches.
Methods
A systematic review from 1997 to April 2017 was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, ProQuest and EconLit databases. Studies were quality-assessed using an adapted Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS). Methods were categorized as time-fixed or time-varying, with the former exhibiting time-dependent bias. Two examples of meta-analysis were used to illustrate how estimates of excess LOS differ between different studies.
Findings
Ninety-two studies with estimates on excess LOS were identified. The majority of articles employed time-fixed methods (75%). Studies using time-varying methods are of higher quality according to NOS. Studies using time-fixed methods overestimate additional LOS attributable to HCAI. Undertaking meta-analysis is challenging due to a variety of study designs and reporting styles. Study differences are further magnified by heterogeneous populations, case definitions, causative organisms, and susceptibilities.
Conclusion
Methodologies have evolved over the last 20 years but there is still a significant body of evidence reliant upon time-fixed methods. Robust estimates are required to inform investment in cost-effective IPC interventions."

Background
Needlestick injuries (NSIs) are one of the most common health hazards facing healthcare workers (HCWs) across the globe. Needles with safety engineered devices (SEDs) have been developed to minimize the risk of exposure to blood-borne infections, such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus, associated with NSIs.
Aim
To assess the effect of the introduction of SEDs in preventing NSIs among HCWs at Jeroen Bosch Hospital, the Netherlands.
Methods
The incidence rates of reported NSIs before and after the introduction of SEDs were compared. All HCWs who reported an NSI with an SED were interviewed in order to understand the underlying causes of the NSIs. Findings: Despite the introduction of SEDs, the incidence of NSIs increased from 1.9 per 100 HCWs before the introduction of SEDs to 2.2 per 100 HCWs after the introduction of SEDs. The registration of reported SED-related NSIs showed a significant decrease in the number of NSIs related to injection needles and blood sugar needles, while an unexpected significant increase in NSIs with nadroparin calcium needles and infusion needles was found. The most common causes reported for NSIs were unsafe disposal of the needles and problems with the safety feature.
Conclusion
The application of SEDs has not led to a reduction in NSIs. The majority of NSIs caused by a needle with an SED can be prevented by stimulation of safe needle disposal, proper use of SEDs, and provision of feedback to manufacturers to keep improving product design."

Background
In all, there have been 178 variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) patients diagnosed in the UK, with an estimated maximum 1:2000 carriage rate based on archived appendix and tonsil tissue, implying that infection may be rare but carriage relatively frequent. Previous workers have identified that maintenance of surgical instruments in a humid atmosphere after use and prior to cleaning assists cleaning efficacy. Recently the Department of Health/Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens UK have recommended a surgical instrument cleanliness threshold post cleaning of <5 μg protein per instrument side.
Aim
To quantify cleanliness of neurosurgical instruments and to investigate cost-effective measures for improved cleaning.
Methods
Two instrument protein quantification methods were used: one based on the International Standard (15883 series) using sodium dodecyl sulphate elution and ortho-phthalaldehyde reaction, and a second in-situ protein fluorescence detection system (ProReveal) providing results per instrument side. In-vitro investigation of the efficacy of some commercial and in-house pre-clean wetting agents was undertaken using artificial test soil and stainless steel discs under standard conditions.

ProReveal technology demonstrated that 163 out of 187 (87%) neurosurgical instruments had <5 μg residual protein per instrument side. The use of proprietary National Health Service plastic bags and sterile water-soaked wound pads were equivalent in efficacy to commercial pre-cleaning wetting products and significantly less expensive.
Conclusion
Although we demonstrate low in-situ protein levels on neurosurgical instruments and the beneficial effects of keeping instruments moist, other cleaning critical-control points such as instrument loading patterns should also be monitored."

Background
Healthcare professionals are involved in an array of patient- and medicine-related stewardship activities, for which an understanding and engagement with antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is important. Undergraduate education provides an ideal opportunity to prepare healthcare professionals for these roles and activities.
Aim
To provide UK national consensus on a common set of antimicrobial stewardship competencies appropriate for undergraduate healthcare professional education.
Methods
A modified Delphi approach comprising two online surveys delivered to a UK national panel of 21 individuals reflecting expertise in prescribing and medicines management with regards to the education and practice of nurses and midwives, pharmacists, physiotherapists, and podiatrists; and antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship. Data collection took place between October and December 2017.
Findings
A total of 21 participants agreed to become members of the expert panel, of whom 19 (90%) completed round 1 questionnaire, and 17 (89%) completed round 2. Panelists reached a consensus, with consistently high levels of agreement reached, on six overarching competency statements (subdivided into six domains), and 54 individual descriptors essential for antimicrobial stewardship by healthcare professionals.
Conclusion
Due to the consistently high levels of agreement reached on competency statements and their associated descriptors, this competency framework should be used to direct education for undergraduate healthcare professionals, and those working in new clinical roles to support healthcare delivery where an understanding of, and engagement with, AMS is important. Although the competencies target basic education, they can also be used for continuing education."

Background
Cardiac surgical site infections (SSIs) have devastating consequences and present several challenges for patients and healthcare providers. Adult cardiac SSI surveillance commenced in 2009 at our hospitals, Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, as a patient safety initiative amid reported increased incidence of SSIs. Before this time, infection incidence was unclear because data collection was not standardized.
Aim
To standardize SSI data collection and establish baseline SSI rates to facilitate deployment of evidence-based targeted interventions within clinical governance structures to improve quality, safety, and efficiency in line with our organizational targets.
Methods
We standardized local data collection protocols in line with Public Health England recommendations and identified local champions. We undertook prospective SSI surveillance collaboratively to enable us to identify potential practice concerns and address them more effectively through a series of initiatives. Clinical staff completed dedicated surveillance forms intraoperatively and postoperatively.
Findings
Overall adult cardiac SSI rates fell from 5.4% in 2009 to 1.2% in 2016 and coronary artery bypass graft rates from 6.5% in 2009 to 1.7% in 2016 (P < 0.001). Gram-negative bacteria were recognized as important SSI causative organisms and were better controlled after introducing stringent infection control measures.
Conclusion
Comprehensive, evidence-based infection control practices were successfully implemented through a multidisciplinary collaborative approach, which may have great potential to reduce Gram-negative, Staphylococcus aureus, polymicrobial and overall SSI burden and/or associated costs. We now investigate all SSIs using an established SSI detailed investigation protocol to promote continual quality improvement that aligns us perfectly with global efforts to fight antimicrobial resistance."

Background
Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and with excess costs. Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are the most common HCAIs in neonates and children.
Aim
To establish national benchmark data for rates of CLABSI in neonatal and paediatric intensive care units (NICUs and PICUs) and paediatric oncology units (ONCs).
Methods
Active surveillance for CLABSI was conducted from June 2016 to February 2017. A collaborative of 14 NICUs, four PICUs, and six ONCs participated in the programme. Surveillance definitions of central line (CL), central line utilization (CLU) ratio, CLABSI event, and CLABSI rate were based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2014 National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. Medical records were assessed daily for calculating CL-days, patient-days, and susceptibility of isolated organisms.
Findings
A total of 111 CLABSI episodes were recorded. The overall mean CLABSI rate was 4.41 infections per 1000 CL-days, and the CLU ratio was 0.31. CLABSI rates were 6.02 in NICUs, 6.09 in PICUs, and 2.78 per 1000 CL-days in ONCs. A total of 123 pathogens were isolated. The most common pathogens were Enterobacteriaceae (36%), followed by Gram-positive cocci (29%), non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria (16%), and fungi (16%). Overall, 37% of Gram-negative pathogens were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 37% to carbapenems.
Conclusion
Nationally representative CLABSI rates were determined for paediatric patients. These data could be used to benchmark and serve as baseline data for the design and evaluation of infection control and antimicrobial stewardship interventions."

Background
Hand antiseptics are of great importance in the prevention of nosocomial infections. Due to the frequent occurrence of adenoviral epidemic keratoconjunctivitis outbreaks in the study hospital, it was necessary to investigate the efficiency of alcohol-based solutions on adenoviruses.
Aim
To investigate the efficacy of alcohol-based solutions commonly found in hand antiseptics against adenovirus serotypes 8, 19 and 37.
Methods
The efficacy of ethanol, isopropanol, chlorhexidine-digluconate, n-butanol and different combinations of these antiseptics on adenovirus serotypes that typically cause epidemic keratoconjunctivitis was investigated. The effect of antiseptic substances was investigated using a quantitative suspension test technique according to EN-14476. Antiseptics were prepared as follows: 70% ethanol, 70% isopropanol, 70% ethanol+0.5% chlorhexidine-digluconate, 70% isopropanol+0.5% chlorhexidine-digluconate, 60% ethanol+10% isopropanol, 60% ethanol+10% isopropanol+0.5% chlorhexidine-digluconate and 60% ethanol+10% isopropanol+1% n-butanol. The effect of antiseptics was evaluated at 30, 60 and 120 s.
Findings
The highest reduction in virus titre was detected with 60% ethanol+10% isopropanol+1% n-butanol. This caused a reduction of 2.5log10, 3 log10 and 2.5log10 in adenovirus serotypes 8, 19 and 37, respectively. The lowest reduction in virus titre was detected with 70% ethanol+0.5% chlorhexidine-digluconate and 70% isopropanol+0.5% chlorhexidine-digluconate. These combinations caused a reduction of 1.62log10 in adenovirus serotypes 19 and 37. All antiseptics showed efficacy levels below 4log10 which is regarded as the efficiency limit by EN-14476.
Conclusion
The alcohol-based solutions tested in this study were not found to be sufficiently effective against adenovirus serotypes. Further studies to investigate the efficiency of different alcohol-based solutions are required."

Background
The Japanese government adopted a national action plan on antimicrobial resistance, which aims to reduce drug-resistant pathogens and antimicrobial use. A point-prevalence survey (PPS) is a useful surveillance method to gain information about hospital epidemiology; however, no multi-centre PPS has previously been performed in Japan.
Aim
To investigate general information about hospital epidemiology, healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs), and antimicrobial use in multiple Japanese university hospitals.
Methods
In July 2016, a multi-centre PPS was conducted using a standardized protocol at four university hospitals in Japan.
Findings
A total of 3199 patients were included. Median age and duration of hospital stay were 64 years and 10 days, respectively. A total of 246 (7.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.8–8.7) patients had 256 active HCAIs, and 933 (29.2%; 95% CI: 27.6–30.8) patients received 1318 antimicrobials. Pneumonia and gastrointestinal system infection were the most common HCAIs (N = 42, 16.4%), and Enterobacteriaceae (N = 49, 30.8%) were the predominant causative organisms. Carbapenems (N = 52, 17.8%), anti-MRSA medications, and cephems with antipseudomonal activity were the most frequently prescribed antimicrobials for HCAIs. As surgical prophylaxis, 46 of 278 antimicrobials (16.5%) were administered orally. Proportions of HCAI and antimicrobial use in each hospital ranged from 4.8% to 9.5% and 19.3%–35.0%, respectively.
Conclusion
This multi-centre PPS recorded detailed HCAI data and distinct antimicrobial use in Japanese university hospitals. Further surveillance is necessary to reduce HCAIs and formulate feasible plans to achieve the national action plan on antimicrobial resistance."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) causes 4% of all healthcare-associated infections in the USA. The process by which the local hospital milieu contributes to VRE acquisition is not fully understood.
Aim
To determine the importance of specific factors within the local hospital environment for healthcare-associated VRE acquisition.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study included patients admitted to six intensive care units at an academic medical centre from January 2012 to December 2016 with negative rectal VRE cultures on admission. VRE acquisition was defined as a positive surveillance swab performed at any time after the initial negative swab during the index hospitalization. The exposures of interest were VRE colonization pressure, VRE importation pressure, and use of vancomycin. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modelling was performed, with patients followed until VRE acquisition, death, or for up to 30 days.
Findings
Of 8485 patients who were initially VRE negative, 161 patients acquired VRE. On univariate analysis, patients with VRE acquisition were more likely to have received vancomycin, to have had a neighbouring patient who received vancomycin, to have high VRE importation pressure, or to have high VRE colonization pressure. On multivariable analysis, only high VRE colonization pressure was an independent predictor of VRE acquisition (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.79; 95% confidence interval: 1.19–2.70).
Conclusion
VRE colonization pressure was the most important risk factor for healthcare-associated VRE acquisition, regardless of VRE importation pressure. Interventions seeking to reduce VRE acquisition should focus on minimizing transmission between patients with known VRE and the local hospital environment."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antibiotic optimization is an urgent international issue. Regulatory frameworks, including the requirement to have a functioning antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programme, are now ubiquitous across the hospital sector nationally and internationally. However, healthcare is ultimately delivered in a diverse range of institutional settings and social contexts. There is emerging evidence that implementation of antibiotic optimization strategies may be inappropriate or even counterproductive to attempts to optimize in atypical healthcare settings.
Aim
To document the experiences and perspectives of clinical staff in a remote healthcare setting in Australia with respect to antimicrobial use, and strategies for optimization in that environment.
Methods
Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 30 healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses and pharmacists, from a remote hospital in Queensland, Australia.
Findings
Four themes were identified from the analysis as key challenges to antibiotic optimization: (i) AMS as externally driven, and local knowledge sidelined; (ii) perceptions of heightened local population risks, treatment failure and the subsequent pressure to over-use of antimicrobials; (iii) interprofessional relationship dynamics including medical hierarchical structures perceived as a barrier to AMS; (iv) a clinical workforce dominated by transient locum staff and other process issues were perceived as significant barriers.
Conclusion
The perceptions of healthcare professionals in this site lead to the conclusion that antimicrobial regulations and practice improvement strategies more generally are unlikely to succeed if they fail to accommodate and respect the context of care, the resource and structural constraints of the setting, and the specificities of particular populations (and subsequent clinical ‘know-how’)."

Background
Ethanol-based lock therapy (LT) solutions are used as an alternative to antibiotics for the conservative management of catheter-related bloodstream infection. However, no clear consensus on regimen or dose has been reached.
Aim
To find the ethanol-based lock solution containing a sufficiently low concentration of ethanol for reduction of the metabolic activity of bacterial and fungal biofilms.
Methods
Using an in-vitro model, three concentrations of ethanol (25%, 40%, 70%) were tested, with and without 60 IU of heparin, at six different time-points and against 24 h preformed biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213, Staphylococcus epidermidis (clinical isolate), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC33186, Candida albicans ATCC14058, and Escherichia coli ATCC25922. The reduction in the metabolic activity of the biofilm was measured using the tetrazolium salt assay and LT was considered to be successful when metabolic activity fell by >90%. Regrowth inhibition was then tested within 24 h and seven days after each LT regimen only at the ethanol concentration of the most successful LT regimen.
Findings
The most successful LT was achieved with 40% ethanol + 60 IU of heparin only at 24, 72, and 24 h for seven-day regimens (P < 0.05). However, none of the regimens reached 45% RI within seven days of therapy.
Conclusion
According to our in-vitro data, an ethanol-based lock solution with 40% ethanol + 60 IU heparin administered daily for 72 h is sufficient to almost eradicate the metabolic activity of bacterial and fungal biofilms. Future studies are needed to study cell regrowth after LT."

Background
Various measures are considered to reduce the risk of surgical site infection (SSI), including preoperative decolonization. Details of preoperative decolonization practices in surgical departments have not been investigated in Austria.
Aim
To analyse the current situation of pre-surgical patient decolonization in national hospitals and to assess the current knowledge on this procedure among surgeons of different surgical disciplines.
Methods
A 12-point structured questionnaire was distributed to all Austrian hospitals with at least one surgical department.
Findings
Two-thirds (103/158; 65%) of responding surgeons stated that any type of preoperative decolonization is implemented in their surgical department. There was heterogeneity of different protocols, ranging from decolonization of only known S. aureus carriers, of a subgroup of patients, or universal decolonization of all patients before elective surgery. Octenidine was the most frequently used antimicrobial compound (60.2%), followed by mupirocin (38.8%), triclosan (14.6%), polyhexanide (12.6%), chlorhexidine (11.7%), and didecyldimonium chloride (7.8%).
Conclusion
Preoperative decolonization seems to be performed in Austrian hospitals on a routine basis. However, this measure is implemented using a variety of modalities, antimicrobial compounds, and staff. Since our survey also demonstrated that those who are better informed about preoperative decolonization are also those who are more convinced of the usefulness of the preventive measure, future activities should not only focus on generating more comparable studies in this field, but should also include targeted education."

Background
Dry surface biofilms (DSBs) persist for extended periods in hospital, and may play a significant role in transmission of healthcare-associated infections.
Aim
To determine whether DSBs may be transferred from hospital surfaces to healthcare workers' hands.
Method
Twelve-day Staphylococcus aureus DSB was grown on polycarbonate and glass coupons in a CDC Biofilm Reactor®. A total of 1.8 × 106 and 8.8 × 105 bacteria grew on the polycarbonate and glass coupons respectively. Transmission was tested by lifting the coupon with forefinger and thumb of ungloved hands to a height of 30 cm, then touching horse blood agar (HBA) plates 19 sequential times. Transferred bacterial number was determined by colony-forming units. The effect of DSB wetting on biofilm transfer was tested with 5% neutral detergent treatment for 5 s.
Findings
Between 5.5 and 6.6% of the DSB bacteria were transferred to hands with one touch and ∼20% were then transferred to HBA with one touch, giving an overall transfer rate of 1.26% and 1.04% for polycarbonate and glass coupons, respectively. Detergent treatment had little effect on bacterial removal from coupons, but, for biofilm grown on polycarbonate, significantly increased transferral to HBA (P < 0.001) to 5.2%. Large numbers of bacteria were transferred by bare hands to multiple fomites. One-third of polycarbonate coupons transferred >1000 colonies during the first five sequential touches. Sufficient bacteria to cause infection were transmitted up to 19 times following one touch of the DSB.
Conclusion
DSB bacteria are transferred by hands from one fomite to multiple fomites, suggesting that DSB may serve as a persistent environmental source of pathogens."

Background
Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (CRGNB) infections constitute a global threat for critically ill patients and the outcome of their hospitalization. Early identification of CRGNB through rectal surveillance cultures and routine infection control measures including contact precautions, use of appropriate disinfectants, staff education on cleaning, and hand hygiene may reduce the dissemination of CRGNB.
Aim
To assess the impact of enhanced infection control measures on CRGNB infections in a nine-bed polyvalent intensive care unit in a tertiary level hospital in an endemic area.
Methods
A quasi-experimental study, which included patients with CRGNB infection retrospectively for six months and those participating in an active surveillance programme prospectively for the subsequent 22 months. Active surveillance programme (weekly rectal swabs) was implemented including two sub-periods with infection control measures and enhanced infection control measures. CRGNB incidence, prevalence, colonization pressure, infections and compliance with infection control measures and enhanced infection control measures were recorded. Analysis was performed through time-series and interrupted time-series.
Findings
During the active surveillance programme, enhanced infection control measures led to a steeper downwards trend in incidence, prevalence, and colonization pressure for CRGNB compared to the infection control measures sub-period. The linear trend was for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) infections to decrease from 19.6 to 8.1 infections per 1000 bed-days (IBD) (P = 0.001) and from 5.1 to 1.79 IBD (P = 0.043), respectively. By contrast, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections increased from 5.2 to 15.3 IBD (P = 0.001).
Conclusion
Enhanced infection control measures including enhanced hand hygiene, active surveillance combined with contact precautions, education, audits and feedback policies and interventions could reduce CRKP and CRPA in endemic areas."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Infection is a rare complication following implantation of prosthetic material into a joint. The impact of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) before elective operations and the subsequent risk of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) are not well understood.
Aims
To assess the prevalence of ASB amongst patients undergoing total arthroplasty of the hip and knee; and to determine the rates of PJI diagnosed within two years of the arthroplasty and if ASB is an independent risk factor for developing PJI.
Methods
Patients who had total/unicondylar knee or total hip arthroplasty were reviewed retrospectively over a five-year period. Pre-operative urine samples within one year of surgery were analysed, and those with ASB were identified. The primary outcome was PJI within the first postoperative year.
Findings
In total, 5542 patients were included. Of these, 4368 had a pre-operative urine culture recorded. The prevalence of ASB was 140 of 4368 (3.2%). The overall PJI rate was 56 of 5542 (1.01%). Of those with PJI, 33 had a pre-operative urine sample recorded. The infection rates were 5% (seven of 140) in the ASB group, 0.61% (26 of 4228) in the no-ASB group and 1.96% (23 of 1174) in the group without a urine sample (P < 0.001). The ASB isolate was the same micro-organism as the PJI isolate in one of the seven cases.
Conclusion
The association between ASB and PJI is statistically significant, but the urine isolates did not relate to the isolates in the prosthetic joint, suggesting that the relationship is unlikely to be causal."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) is changing rapidly worldwide; knowledge on the genotypes of C. difficile circulating in specialized geriatric hospitals and their resistance to antibiotics is scarce or non-existent.
Methods
Prospective study of the molecular epidemiology of CDI, conducted in a national geriatric hospital in Costa Rica for a period of 11 months.
Results
The study patients exhibited a diverse range of comorbidities, but none were associated with CDI. Polyclonality, including three new ribotypes, and a high level of resistance to antibiotics were determined by analysing the 32 isolates obtained in these cases. Despite the diversity in strains observed, the most frequent types were NAP6/RT002 and NAP2/RT001. NAP9/RT017 was associated with community acquisition. Nineteen types of antimicrobials were used before the onset of diarrhoea in the patients; no particular genotype was associated with the onset of infection or severity.
Conclusion
Based on the abundance of strain types observed and their resistance to antibiotics in this geriatric hospital, these results contribute to a better overall understanding of the epidemiology of CDI worldwide, and to surveillance programmes targeting geriatric populations."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The rise in antimicrobial resistance has highlighted the importance of surgical site infection (SSI) prevention with effective surveillance strategies playing a key role in improving patient safety.
Aim
To map national needs and priorities for SSI surveillance against current national surveillance activity.
Methods
This study analysed SSI surveillance in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England covering 23 surgical procedures. Data collected were: (i) annual number of procedures, (ii) SSI rates from national reports, (iii) national reporting requirement (mandatory, voluntary, not offered), (iv) priority ranking from a survey of 84 English NHS hospitals, (v) excess length of stay and costs from the literature. The relationships between estimated SSI burden, national surveillance activity, and hospital-reported priorities were explored with descriptive and univariate analyses.
Findings
Among the 23 surgical categories analysed, top priority ranking by hospitals was associated only with current surveillance (r = 0.76, P < 0.01) and mandatory reporting (33% vs 8 and 4%, P = 0.04). Percentage of hospitals undertaking surveillance, mandatory reporting, and the selection of priorities did not match SSI burden. Large bowel surgery (LBS, voluntary) and caesarean section (not offered) were the two highest contributors of total SSIs per annum, with 39,000 (38%) and 17,000 (16%) respectively, while the four orthopaedic categories (all mandatory) contributed 5000 (5%). LBS also had the highest associated costs (£119 million per annum).
Conclusion
Current surveillance and future priorities were not associated with SSI rate, volume, or cost to hospitals. The two highest contributors of SSIs and related costs have no (caesarean section) or limited (LBS) coverage by national surveillance."

abstract = "Summary
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is capable of causing acute respiratory illness. Laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases may be asymptomatic, have mild disease, or have a life-threatening infection with a high case fatality rate. There are three patterns of transmission: sporadic community cases from presumed non-human exposure, family clusters arising from contact with an infected family index case, and healthcare-acquired infections among patients and from patients to healthcare workers. Healthcare-acquired MERS infection has become a well-known characteristic of the disease and a leading means of spread. The main factors contributing to healthcare-associated outbreaks include delayed recognition, inadequate infection control measures, inadequate triaging and isolation of suspected MERS or other respiratory illness patients, crowding, and patients remaining in the emergency department for many days. A review of the literature suggests that effective control of hospital outbreaks was accomplished in most instances by the application of proper infection control procedures. Prompt recognition, isolation and management of suspected cases are key factors for prevention of the spread of MERS. Repeated assessments of infection control and monitoring of corrective measures contribute to changing the course of an outbreak. Limiting the number of contacts and hospital visits are also important factors to decrease the spread of infection."

Background
Bloodstream infections (BSI) are a major complication in the early phase of a haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).
Aim
To describe the incidence and risk factors for BSI occurring in the pre-engraftment phase of HSCT, and its impact on mortality.
Methods
Clinical variables of 232 HSCT patients were analysed retrospectively between 2014 and 2015. Univariate Cox regression analyses were performed to test the association between each covariate and the outcome. Covariates with P < 0.10 on univariate analysis were included in a multiple Cox regression analysis using a backward elimination method.
Findings
The cumulative incidence of BSI was 25.4%, mainly caused by Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) (55.2%). Approximately 40.5% of the patients had gut colonization by multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and carbapenem-resistant GNB). Among patients colonized by MDR GNB, 20% developed an overt BSI due to MDR bacteria with the same pattern of sensitivity. Of the 13 deaths related to infection, 10 were patients with BSI caused by MDR GNB. The independent risk factors for BSI were gut colonization by MDR bacteria including GNB (P < 0.001) and duration of neutropenia >10 days (P = 0.005), and those associated with BSI caused by MDR bacteria were age >62 years (P = 0.03), use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (P < 0.001) and previous gut colonization by MDR GNB (P = 0.002).
Conclusions
Previous gut colonization by MDR was an independent risk factor for BSI, together with TPN and age, and had an impact on outcome. These findings suggest that gut decolonization may be a potential strategy to prevent BSI."

Background
Infection occurs in 2–4% of arthroplasty cases, and identifying potential sources of infection can help to reduce infection rates. The aim of this study was to identify the impact and potential for the contamination of hands and gowns whilst scrubbing using sterile surgical helmet systems (SSHSs).
Methods
A colony-forming unit (cfu) is a pathogenic particle of 0.5–5 μm. Standard arthroplasty hoods and SSHSs, with and without the fan switched on, were tested for a 3-min exposure (to represent scrubbing time) on three subjects and a mannequin with concurrent particle counts and culture plates.
Results
All SSHSs were positive for Gram-positive cocci, with a mean colony count of 410 cfu/m2. Background counts were lower for laminar flow areas [mean 0.7 particles/m3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0–1.4] than scrub areas (mean 131.5 particles/m3; 95% CI 123.5–137.9; P=0.0003). However, neither grew any bacteria with a 2-min exposure. The background count increased 3.7 times with the fan switched on (total P=0.004, cfu P=0.047), and all helmets had positive cultures (mean 36 cfu/m2). There were no positive cultures with the standard arthroplasty hood or the SSHS with the fan switched off. In laminar flow areas, all cultures were negative and particle counts were low.
Conclusions
Sterile gloves and gowns can be contaminated when scrubbing with the SSHS fan switched on. It is recommended that the fan should remain switched off when scrubbing until the hood and gown are in place, ideally in a laminar flow environment."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hospital linens and patient gowns are frequently touched and contaminated, and may contribute to endogenous, indirect-contact, and aerosol transmission of nosocomial-related pathogens. Recently Sentara Healthcare adopted biocidal copper oxide-impregnated linens across its hospitals.
Aim
To assess whether the replacement of the linens resulted in the reduction of healthcare-associated infection (HCAI).
Methods
Rates of HCAI caused by Clostridium difficile and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) were compared in six Sentara Healthcare hospitals with similar patient demo-graphics (total of 1019 beds) in three parallel periods (90, 180 and 240 days) before and after (periods A1, A2 and A3, and periods B1, B2, and B3, respectively), replacing all the regular non-biocidal linens with the copper oxide-impregnated biocidal linens.
Findings
During periods B1, B2, and B3, compared with periods A1, A2 and A3, there were 61.2% (P < 0.05), 41.1% (P < 0.05) and 42.9% (P < 0.01) reductions in HCAI per 10,000 patient-days in hospital caused by C. difficile, respectively; 48.3% (P > 0.05), 36.4% (P > 0.05), and 19.2% (P > 0.05) reductions in HCAI per 1000 patient-days caused by MDROs; and 59.8% (P < 0.01), 39.9% (P < 0.05), and 37.2% (P < 0.05) in the reduction of HCAI per 1000 patient-days caused by C. difficile and MDROs combined.
Conclusion
The use of biocidal copper oxide-impregnated linens in the six analysed Sentara Healthcare hospitals resulted in significant reduction in both HCAI caused by C. difficile, and the combined metric of C. difficile or MDRO infection. Similar reductions in HCAI caused by MDROs were observed, although these reductions did not reach statistical significance, probably due to very low HCAI rates caused by these pathogens in the study facilities."

Background
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous and important opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised or critically ill patients. Nosocomial P. aeruginosa outbreaks have been associated with hospital water sources.
Aim
To describe engineering interventions to minimize contamination of water outlets and the subsequent clinical impact.
Methods
New tap outlets were fitted at selected outlets across the intensive care unit (ICU). Laboratory testing demonstrated that, following artificial contamination with P. aeruginosa, these taps could be effectively decontaminated using a thermal washer-disinfector. Water samples were collected weekly from new outlets on the ICU over an eight-month period and tested for the enumeration of P. aeruginosa via membrane filtration. Surveillance of P. aeruginosa from clinical specimens was routinely undertaken.
Findings
Prior to the interventions, water sampling on ICU indicated that 30% of the outlets were positive for P. aeruginosa at any one time, and whole genome sequencing data suggested at least 30% transmission from water to patient. Since their installation, weekly sampling of the new tap outlets has been negative for P. aeruginosa, and the number of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates has fallen by 50%.
Conclusion
Installation and maintenance of tap outlets free of P. aeruginosa can substantially reduce the number of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates in an ICU."

Background
Candida parapsilosis is a common agent of fungaemia, but few outbreaks of Candida parapsilosis infection have been reported in China.
Aim
To elaborate an outbreak of nosocomial Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto fungaemia in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a comprehensive hospital in China from July to October 2017.
Methods
Epidemics and characteristics of fungaemia cases were investigated. Surveillance samples were collected. Vitek 2 Compact System, internal transcribed spacer sequencing, and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) typing were conducted to identify the isolates. Antifungal susceptibility test was performed for all bloodstream isolates.
Findings
Sixteen neonates were diagnosed as Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto fungaemia during this period. Presenting symptoms included leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and respiratory crackles. Fifteen cases were cured whereas one case who suffered from severe concomitant diseases died. The isolates were susceptible to fluconazole, amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole, and 5-fluorocytosine. A total of 313 surveillance samples were collected, and Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto was identified from 16 environmental samples and one sample from an ultrasonographer's hand. The colonized locations included wiping cloths, faucets, sinks, operating table, puddles in the bathroom, a ventilator, and an ultrasonic probe. The RAPD patterns of all the Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto isolates from bloodstream and surveillance samples were identical. The outbreak was controlled after a series of infection control measures.
Conclusion
Contaminated environment was associated with this outbreak. Close attention to immunocompromised patients, thorough environmental disinfection and hand hygiene should be strengthened in NICU."

Background
The clinical manifestations of group A streptococcus (GAS) (Streptococcus pyogenes) are diverse, ranging from asymptomatic colonization to devastating invasive disease. Maternity-related clusters of invasive GAS (iGAS) infection are complex to investigate and control, especially if recurrent.
Aim
To investigate three episodes of emm 75 GAS/iGAS infection in maternity patients at one hospital site over a four-year period (two with monophyletic ancestry).
Methods
The episodes are described, together with whole-genome sequence (WGS) isolate analyses. Single nucleotide polymorphism differences were compared with contemporaneous emm 75 genomes.
Findings
Over the four-year study period, seven mothers had emm 75 GAS/iGAS and one mother had emm 3 iGAS (in year 4) (subsequently discounted as linked). Three (clinical/screening samples) of the seven babies of emm-75-positive mothers and three screened healthcare workers were positive for emm 75 GAS. WGS similarity suggested a shared ancestral lineage and a common source transmission, but directionality of transmission cannot be inferred. However, the findings indicate that persistence of a particular clone in a given setting may be long term.
Conclusions
Occupational health procedures were enhanced, staff were screened, and antibiotic therapy was provided to GAS-positive staff and patients. The definitive source of infection could not be identified, although staff–patient transmission was the most likely route. The pattern of clonal GAS transmission over the four-year study period suggests that long-term persistence of GAS may have occurred."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Antibiotic resistance will cause about 10 million deaths per year by 2050. Fighting antimicrobial resistance is a health priority. Interventions aimed to reduce antimicrobial resistance, such as antibiotic stewardship programmes (ASPs), must be implemented. To be effective, those interventions, and the implementation process, should be matched with social–cultural context. The complexity of ASPs can no longer be developed without considering both organizational and information systems.
Aim
To support ASPs through the co-design and implementation, in collaboration with healthcare workers, of a surveillance and clinical decision-support system to monitor antibiotic resistance and improve antibiotic prescription.
Methods
The surveillance and clinical decision-support system was designed and implemented in three Portuguese hospitals, using a participatory approach between researchers and healthcare workers following the Design Science Research Methodology.
Findings
Based on healthcare workers' requirements, we developed HAITooL, a real-time surveillance and clinical decision-support system that integrates visualizations of patient, microbiology, and pharmacy data, facilitating clinical decision. HAITooL monitors antibiotic usage and rates of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, allowing early identification of outbreaks. It is a clinical decision-support tool that integrates evidence-based algorithms to support proper antibiotic prescription. HAITooL was considered valuable to support monitoring of antibiotic resistant infections and an important tool for ASP sustainability.
Conclusion
ASP implementation can be leveraged through a surveillance and clinical decision-support system such as HAITooL that allows antibiotic resistance monitoring and supports antibiotic prescription, once it has been adapted to the context and specific needs of healthcare workers and hospitals."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Following hospital outbreaks of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), Public Health England published a toolkit in December 2013 to promote the early detection, management, and control of CPE colonization and infection in acute hospital settings.
Aim
To examine awareness, uptake, implementation and usefulness of the CPE toolkit and identify potential barriers and facilitators to its adoption in order to inform future guidance.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey of National Health Service (NHS) acute trusts was conducted in May 2016. Descriptive analysis and multivariable regression models were conducted, and narrative responses were analysed thematically and informed using behaviour change theory.
Findings
Most (92%) acute trusts had a written CPE plan. Fewer (75%) reported consistent compliance with screening and isolation of CPE risk patients. Lower prioritization and weaker senior management support for CPE prevention were associated with poorer compliance. Awareness of the CPE toolkit was high and all trusts with patients infected or colonized with CPE had used the toolkit either as provided (32%), or to inform (65%) their own local CPE plan. Despite this, many respondents (80%) did not believe that the CPE toolkit guidance offered an effective means to prevent CPE or was practical to follow.
Conclusion
CPE prevention and control requires robust IPC measures. Successful implementation can be hindered by a complex set of factors related to their practical execution, insufficient resources and a lack of confidence in the effectiveness of the guidance. Future CPE guidance would benefit from substantive user involvement, processes for ongoing feedback, and regular guidance updates."

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the burden of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) is not known due to a lack of national surveillance systems, standardized infection definitions, and paucity of infection prevention and control (IPC) organizations and legal infrastructure.
Aim
To determine the status of IPC bundle practice and the most frequent interventional variables in LMICs.
Methods
A questionnaire was emailed to Infectious Diseases International Research Initiative (ID-IRI) Group Members and dedicated IPC doctors working in LMICs to examine self-reported practices/policies regarding IPC bundles. Responding country incomes were classified by World Bank definitions into low, middle, and high. Comparison of LMIC results was then made to a control group of high-income countries (HICs).
Findings
This survey reports practices from one low-income country (LIC), 16 middle-income countries (MICs) (13 European), compared to eight high-income countries (HICs). Eighteen (95%) MICs had an IPC committee in their hospital, 12 (63.2%) had an annual agreed programme and produced an HCAI report. Annual agreed programmes (87.5% vs 63.2%, respectively) and an annual HCAI report (75.0% vs 63.2%, respectively) were more common in HICs than MICs. All HICs had at least one invasive device-related surveillance programme. Seven (37%) MICs had no invasive device-related surveillance programme, six (32%) had no ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention bundles, seven (37%) had no catheter-associated urinary tract infection prevention bundles, and five (27%) had no central line-associated bloodstream infection prevention bundles.
Conclusion
LMICs need to develop their own bundles with low-cost and high-level-of-evidence variables adapted to the limited resources, with further validation in reducing infection rates."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Gastric acid suppressants increase the risk of gastroenteritis by allowing ingested pathogens to survive passage through the stomach. It is not known whether the same mechanism affects transmission of Enterobacteriaceae. A case–control study was undertaken to answer this question.
Aim
To determine whether use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) increases the risk of infection with Enterobacteriaceae in hospital patients.
Methods
Retrospective case–control study in a teaching hospital in South West England. Cases were 126 patients infected with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae between April 2014 and March 2015. Use of PPIs, H2 receptor antagonists or antacids at the time of admission or in the preceding six months was compared with 126 demographically matched controls infected with non-ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and 126 uninfected controls, matched by primary diagnosis.
Findings
Sixty-six of 126 ESBL cases, 62 of 126 non-ESBL controls and 34 of 126 uninfected controls were prescribed PPIs on or within six months of admission. Multi-variable logistic regression analysis gave an odds ratio of 3.37 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.84–6.18] for PPI exposure vs uninfected controls and 1.15 (95% CI 0.68–1.95) for ESBL infection vs non-ESBL infection. H2 receptor antagonists and antacids were not significantly associated with infection.
Conclusion
PPI exposure within the previous six months is significantly associated with infection with both ESBL- and non-ESBL-producing bacteria. Reducing inappropriate use of PPIs may be a novel way to reduce transmission, which might reduce antibiotic use and help control antimicrobial resistance."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Surveillance for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) is a commonplace infection prevention strategy, yet the optimal frequency with which to monitor the unit is unknown.
Aim
To compare various surveillance frequencies using simulation modelling.
Methods
One hundred NICU networks of 52 infants were simulated over a six-month period to assess MRSA transmission. Unit-wide surveillance occurred every N weeks where N={1,2,3,4}, and was compared with the current NICU policy of dynamic surveillance (i.e. weekly when at least one positive screen, otherwise every three weeks). For each surveillance period, colonized infants received a decolonization regimen (56% effective) and were moved to isolation rooms, if available.
Findings
As the surveillance frequency increased, the mean number of MRSA-colonized infants decreased, from a high of 2.9 (four-weekly monitoring) to a low of 0.6 (weekly monitoring) detected per episode. The mean duration of colonization decreased from 307 h (four-weekly monitoring) to 61 h (weekly monitoring). Meanwhile, the availability of isolation rooms followed an inverse relationship: as surveillance frequency increased, the availability of isolation rooms decreased (61% isolation success rate for four-weekly monitoring vs 49% success rate for weekly monitoring). The dynamic policy performed similar to a biweekly programme.
Conclusions
An effective MRSA surveillance programme needs to balance resource availability with potential for harm due to longer colonization periods and opportunity for development of invasive disease. While more frequent monitoring led to greater use of a decolonization regimen, it also reduced the likelihood of isolation rooms being available."

Background
Whereas Clostridium difficile has been extensively studied in acute care facilities (ACFs), there is limited information about long-term care facilities (LTCFs), despite the high occurrence of putative risk factors (e.g. age, antimicrobial use, healthcare system contact).
Aim
To evaluate C. difficile colonization in elderly patients and residents from one ACF and its associated LTCF.
Methods
Stool swabs were collected from 884 LTCF and elderly (>65 years) hospital patients. Selective culture, polymerase chain reaction ribotyping and toxin gene characterization were performed.
Findings
C. difficile was isolated from 92/410 (22.4%) ACF and 89/474 (18.8%) LTCF samples. Ribotypes 027 (35%) and 020 (10.4%) predominated in the LTCF whereas ribotypes AI-82/1 (20.7%) and ribotype O (14.1%) predominated at the ACF (P = 0.031). In the LTCF, C. difficile colonization was associated with a history of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, and the interaction terms of male residents with prior medical leave of absence, and a prior history of C. difficile infection (CDI) combined with fluoroquinolone use. In the ACF, C. difficile colonization was associated with length of stay, feeding through a tube, antibiotic use, immunosuppressive therapy and VRE colonization, as well as the interaction terms for cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone use, prior CDI and cephalosporin use, and prior CDI and fluoroquinolone use.
Conclusion
C. difficile colonization by ACF and LTCF residents was common, despite a low apparent incidence of CDI. The association with PPI provides further evidence of the potential importance of this widely used drug class in C. difficile colonization. Wide genetic diversity was present, highlighting the likelihood of multiple unidentified routes of C. difficile acquisition."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Information on the role of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in adult patients with influenza-like syndrome is scarce.
Aim
To assess the clinical characteristics of RSV in adult patients with respiratory manifestations during a regular influenza season.
Methods
Prospective study in a tertiary Spanish hospital from December 2015 to February 2016. The study population included only adult patients with either community-acquired or hospital/healthcare-associated influenza-like illness, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control criteria. Samples were analysed using a rapid molecular assay (Xpert® Flu/RSV). RSV-positive patients were compared with a randomly negative control group and with an influenza-positive control group.
Findings
Twelve hundred patients with influenza-like respiratory infection were included. Overall, 114 of the samples (9%) were positive for influenza and 95 (8%) were positive for RSV. When RSV-positive and influenza-positive patients were compared, RSV-positive patients were older (57.7 vs 48.9 years; P = 0.03), and their disease was more frequently healthcare-related (26/95, 27.3% vs 5/114, 1.7%; P < 0.001). They also had significantly more antibiotics prescribed (77/95, 81.0% vs 70/114, 61.4%; P < 0.001) and more frequently needed hospital admission (93/95, 97.8% vs 69/114, 60.5%; P < 0.001). Mortality was also significantly higher in RSV-positive patients (14/95, 14.7% vs 7/114, 6.1%; P = 0.04).
Conclusion
RSV is a major cause of moderate-to-severe respiratory infection during the influenza season; acquisition is frequently nosocomial or healthcare-related; and mortality is significantly higher than with influenza virus infection. The use of a rapid molecular test as a first-step diagnostic technique is necessary to ensure that isolation measures are implemented and that spread is prevented."

Background
National responses to healthcare-associated infections vary between high-income countries, but, when analysed for contextual comparability, interventions can be assessed for transferability.
Aim
To identify learning from country-level approaches to addressing meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Japan and England.
Methods
A longitudinal analysis (2000–2017), comparing epidemiological trends and policy interventions. Data from 441 textual sources concerning infection prevention and control (IPC), surveillance, and antimicrobial stewardship interventions were systematically coded for: (a) type: mandatory requirements, recommendations, or national campaigns; (b) method: restrictive, persuasive, structural in nature; (c) level of implementation: macro (national), meso (organizational), micro (individual) levels. Healthcare organizational structures and role of media were also assessed.
Findings
In England significant reduction has been achieved in number of reported MRSA bloodstream infections. In Japan, in spite of reductions, MRSA remains a predominant infection. Both countries face new threats in the emergence of drug-resistant Escherichia coli. England has focused on national mandatory and structural interventions, supported by a combination of outcomes-based incentives and punitive mechanisms, and multi-disciplinary IPC hospital teams. Japan has focused on (non-mandatory) recommendations and primarily persuasive interventions, supported by process-based incentives, with voluntary surveillance. Areas for development in Japan include resourcing of dedicated data management support and implementation of national campaigns for healthcare professionals and the public.
Conclusion
Policy interventions need to be relevant to local epidemiological trends, while acceptable within the health system, culture, and public expectations. Cross-national learning can help inform the right mix of interventions to create sustainable and resilient systems for future infection and economic challenges."

Introduction
Despite the high reported rates of surgical site infections (SSIs) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae (EPE) in low-income countries, including Tanzania, the role of EPE carriage in subsequent occurrence of SSIs is not known. This study investigated the rates of EPE carriage among surgical patients at the time of admission and discharge, and linked EPE genotype with SSIs.
Methods
EPE were confirmed among isolates from rectal and wound/pus swabs using VITEK-2. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were performed to detect beta-lactamase genes. Multi-locus sequence typing was used to determine the genotypes of EPE isolates.
Results
Among 930 patients enrolled, EPE carriage was significantly higher on discharge than admission (36.4% vs 23.7%, P<0.001). Of 272 patients who tested negative on admission, 78 (28.7%) acquired EPE during hospitalization. History of hospital stay within the previous three months was an independent predictor of EPE acquisition [hazard ratio 2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–3.98, P=0.038]. Of the 536 patients who were successfully followed-up after surgery, 78 (14.6%, 95% CI 11.6–17.5) developed SSIs. Of 57 SSIs investigated, 33 (58%) were caused by enteric Gram-negative bacteria, of which 63.6% (21/33) were EPE. Escherichia coli sequence type (ST)131 pandemic clone and Klebsiella pneumoniae ST391 predominated among wound isolates. The blaCTX-M-15 gene was detected in 37 (97.3%) of 38 ESBL isolates. Male sex was an independent predictor of SSI (odds ratio 2.92, 95% CI 1.73–4.91, P<0.001).
Conclusion
These findings warrant implementation of strict infection control measures, antimicrobial stewardship and exploration of the transmission dynamics of EPE in surgical wards."

Background
The prevalence of nosocomial meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was previously estimated as 23% in a paediatric hospital in Luanda, Angola and 18% in a general hospital in São Tomé and Príncipe.
Aim
To evaluate the prevalence of S. aureus/MRSA colonization among hospitalized children and their parents at two hospitals in Angola and São Tomé and Príncipe.
Methods
In 2017, 127 hospitalized children and 129 of their parents had nasal swabs for S. aureus/MRSA carriage in the two countries. The isolates were tested for the presence of the mecA and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes, and characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), spa typing, multi-locus sequence typing and SCCmec typing.
Findings
Twenty of 127 children (15.7%) and 13 of 129 parents (10.1%) were MRSA nasal carriers. Three lineages comprised 88% of the MRSA isolates: (i) PFGE A-ST5-SCCmec IVa (N=15; 45%), associated with spa type t105, recovered in Angola alone; (ii) PFGE N-ST8-IV/V (N=7; 21%), associated with spa types t008/t121, recovered in São Tomé and Príncipe alone; and (iii) PFGE B-ST88-IVa (N=7; 21%), associated with spa types t325/t786, present in both countries. Fifteen child/guardian pairs were colonized with identical MRSA (N=8) or meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (N=7) strains. PVL was detected in 25% of isolates, including two MRSA (ST30-V and ST8-IVa).
Conclusion
Hospitalized children and their parents are important reservoirs of MRSA. Infection control measures should focus on parents in order to minimize the spread of MRSA to the community."

Background
The World Health Organization has identified antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as one of the most significant global risks facing modern medicine. Interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing have so far had limited impact.
Aim
To understand the barriers to effective antibiotic prescribing.
Methods
Mixed methodologies were used to investigate prescribing behaviours to identify the critical points in the antibiotic prescribing pathway for hospital inpatients. We assessed knowledge, experience or empowerment of prescribers, organizational factors, and use of the laboratory. Phase 1 was an online survey to map barriers and facilitators to antibiotic prescribing (56 participants). Phase 2 consisted of focus groups and interviews to gain more understanding of prescribing behaviours (10 participants). Phase 3 was an online survey to obtain opinions on possible solutions (22 participants).
Findings
Barriers to prescribing were: laboratory factors 71.6%, resource issues 40%, time constraints 17.5%, pressure from others 52%. Ninety-three percent of prescribers were concerned about AMR. In three scenarios only 9% were confident not to prescribe antibiotics for a patient without bacterial infection; 53% would prescribe unnecessarily broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia. Only 5% would de-escalate antibiotics in a microbiologically confirmed bacteraemia. Despite concerns about AMR, prescribers did not perceive that continuing antibiotics for individual patients might promote resistance. Prescribers were unwilling to change antibiotics out of hours and reported that they preferred professional support for antibiotic prescribing.
Conclusion
There was a marked disparity between prescribers, self-reporting of prescribing behaviour and responses to clinical scenarios. It was not clear whether training alone would change behaviours. Prescribers desired a directive mechanism to support antibiotic prescribing and stewardship."

Background
The incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in hospitalized children and adolescents has been increasing year-on-year. Paediatric CDAD places a significant economic burden on healthcare systems. Probiotics are live organisms thought to improve the microbial balance of the host, counteract disturbances in intestinal flora, and reduce the risk of colonization by pathogenic bacteria.
Aim
A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to assess the economy of probiotics for the prevention of CDAD in children and adolescents receiving antibiotics.
Methods
A decision tree model combining clinical effectiveness, utility and cost data was used. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the robustness of the model outcomes.
Finding
The ‘oral probiotics’ strategy and ‘no probiotics’ strategy offered patients 0.05876 and 0.056 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost of $16,668.70 and $20,355.28, respectively. The oral probiotics strategy exhibited higher QALY and lower cost, and represents the cost-saving strategy. The results were robust for sensitivity analyses.

Background
A thorough understanding of the local sources, risks, and antibiotic resistance for Escherichia coli bloodstream infection (BSI) is required to focus prevention initiatives and therapy.
Aim
To review the sources and antibiotic resistance of healthcare-associated E. coli BSI.
Methods
Sources and antibiotic resistance profiles of all 250 healthcare-associated (post 48 h) E. coli BSIs that occurred within our secondary and tertiary care hospital group from April 2014 to March 2017 were reviewed. Epidemiological associations with urinary source, gastrointestinal source, and febrile neutropenia-related BSIs were analysed using univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression models.
Findings
E. coli BSIs increased 9% from 4.0 to 4.4 per 10,000 admissions comparing the 2014/15 and 2016/17 financial years. Eighty-nine cases (36%) had a urinary source; 30 (34%) of these were classified as urinary catheter-associated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Forty-five (18%) were related to febrile neutropenia, and 38 (15%) had a gastrointestinal source. Cases were rarely associated with surgical procedures (11, 4%) or indwelling vascular devices (seven, 3%). Female gender (odds ratio: 2.3; 95% confidence interval: 1.2–4.6) and older age (1.02; 1.00–1.05) were significantly associated with a urinary source. No significant associations were identified for gastrointestinal source or febrile neutropenia-related BSIs. Forty-seven percent of the isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 37% to third-generation cephalosporins, and 22% to gentamicin.
Conclusion
The gastrointestinal tract and febrile neutropenia together accounted for one-third of E. coli BSI locally but were rare associations nationally. These sources need to be targeted locally to reduce an increasing trend of E. coli BSIs."

Background
At neonatal intensive care units, sepsis due to Gram-negative bacteria is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The benefits of routine microbiological screening of neonatal body surface to predict and prevent sepsis are controversial.
Aim
To evaluate the prognostic value of neonatal body surface screening for colonization with Gram-negative bacteria for the prediction of late-onset sepsis.
Methods
A systematic review was performed, including studies of any design that reported data to calculate prognostic accuracy of surface screening for the prediction of late-onset sepsis. Risk of bias was assessed and a meta-analysis performed. Evidence quality was appraised using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology.
Findings
Eight studies (all cohort design) were identified as eligible. Studies were performed in six countries in Europe, Asia, and North America and comprised a total of 4829 participants. All studies were at high risk of bias. Pooled sensitivity of body surface screening to predict late-onset sepsis was 41% (95% confidence interval: 17–70), whereas pooled specificity was 56% (34–76) (hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (HSROC) model). Subgroup analyses showed higher pooled estimates for specificity but not sensitivity when screening focused on Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. GRADE evidence quality was very low.
Conclusion
Limited evidence of very low quality exists regarding the prognostic value of neonatal screening for late-onset sepsis. Carefully planned and conducted prospective studies, including randomized trials, are needed to clarify the potential value of this measure for the prediction and prevention of late-onset sepsis."

abstract = "Summary
Background
To assess the impact of the incidental relocation of an intensive care unit (ICU) on the risk of colonizations/infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibiting OprD-mediated resistance to imipenem (PA-OprD).
Aim
The primary aim was to compare the proportion of PA-OprD among P. aeruginosa samples before and after an incidental relocation of the ICU. The role of tap water as a route of contamination for colonization/infection of patients with PA-OprD was assessed as a secondary aim.
Methods
A single-centre, observational, before/after comparison study was conducted from October 2013 to October 2015. The ICU was relocated at the end of October 2014. All P. aeruginosa-positive samples isolated from patients hospitalized ≥48 h in the ICU were included. Tap water specimens were collected every three months in the ICU. PA-OprD strains isolated from patients and tap water were genotyped using pulse-field gel electrophoresis.
Findings
A total of 139 clinical specimens of P. aeruginosa and 19 tap water samples were analysed. The proportion of PA-OprD strains decreased significantly from 31% to 7.7% after the relocation of the ICU (P = 0.004). All PA-OprD clinical specimens had a distinct genotype. Surprisingly, tap water was colonized with a single PA-OprD strain during both periods, but this single clone has never been isolated from clinical specimens.
Conclusion
Relocation of the ICU was associated with a marked decrease in P. aeruginosa strains resistant to imipenem. The polyclonal character of PA-OprD strains isolated from patients and the absence of tap-water-to-patient contamination highlight the complexity of the environmental impact on the endogenous colonization/infection with P. aeruginosa."

abstract = "Summary
Aim
To describe the phenotypic and genotypic profiles of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) strains isolated from patients with invasive infections at an Italian university hospital in order to assess the epidemiological trend.
Methods
An observational prospective study was undertaken at the University Hospital of Sassari, Italy to detect KPC-Kp strains in patients with invasive bacteraemia. Isolates were identified phenotypically; carbapenemase production was assessed using phenotypic and genotypic methods. Sequencing of blaKPC genes, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multi-locus sequence typing were performed.
Results
During the period 2015–2017, 46 cases of invasive infection with K. pneumoniae were recorded. Two-thirds (67.4%) of the patients were male, and the mean age was 69.4 years. Most patients had at least one comorbidity (56.5%) and/or had been hospitalized previously (70.5%), 81.8% had current or recent medical device use, and 85.4% had recent antibiotic exposure. The mortality rate was 52.3%. A multi-drug-resistant pattern (including carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, third-/fourth-generation cephalosporins) was shown for all K. pneumoniae isolates. KPC-3 and -2 were produced by all strains. The most common sequence types were 512 (91.3%) and 101 (8.7%), grouped into three clusters (A, A1 and B).
Conclusions
A high incidence of KPC-Kp in patients with invasive infections was recorded at an Italian university hospital compared with the incidence measured before 2015. This study confirmed the importance of the KPC-3 carbapenemase variant, as reported by other Italian studies. High mortality and comorbidity rates appear to be associated with KPC-Kp infection."

Handwashing is a key barrier to cross-infection performed at a handwash station (HWS, an interface between water and drainage systems). Widespread and often uncritical placement/design and use of HWSs is not without attendant risks. Recognition of the associated hazards went unheeded for over 45 years despite warnings in the literature, until the neonatal outbreak of pseudomonas in Belfast in 2012 forced change. Minimizing risk requires a holistic approach beyond the mere testing of water from the outlet of a HWS for the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other pathogens. Literature reports of outbreaks linked to HWSs outside of neonatal units are over-represented by multi-resistant organisms, and increasingly by carbapenemase-producing organisms. Evidence suggests that a large proportion of waterborne transmissions go undetected. Much could be done to improve current design, use and placement of HWSs, and this is assessed critically in this article."

Background
Various technologies have been developed to improve hand hygiene (HH) compliance in inpatient settings; however, little is known about the feasibility of machine learning technology for this purpose in outpatient clinics.
Aim
To assess the effectiveness, user experiences, and costs of implementing a real-time HH notification machine learning system in outpatient clinics.
Methods
In our mixed methods study, a multi-disciplinary team co-created an infrared guided sensor system to automatically notify clinicians to perform HH just before first patient contact. Notification technology effects were measured by comparing HH compliance at baseline (without notifications) with real-time auditory notifications that continued till HH was performed (intervention I) or notifications lasting 15 s (intervention II). User experiences were collected during daily briefings and semi-structured interviews. Costs of implementation of the system were calculated and compared to the current observational auditing programme.
Findings
Average baseline HH performance before first patient contact was 53.8%. With real-time auditory notifications that continued till HH was performed, overall HH performance increased to 100% (P < 0.001). With auditory notifications of a maximum duration of 15 s, HH performance was 80.4% (P < 0.001). Users emphasized the relevance of real-time notification and contributed to technical feasibility improvements that were implemented in the prototype. Annual running costs for the machine learning system were estimated to be 46% lower than the observational auditing programme.
Conclusion
Machine learning technology that enables real-time HH notification provides a promising cost-effective approach to both improving and monitoring HH, and deserves further development in outpatient settings."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Early onset prosthetic valve endocarditis (EO-PVE) is an infrequent complication of cardiac valve surgery. It is considered a healthcare-associated infection due to contamination of the prosthesis during the implant or in the early postoperative period.
Aim
To evaluate which factors may be related to the acquisition of EO-PVE.
Methods
A nested case–control study was conducted from 2006 to 2016. Cases were patients who had definite prosthetic endocarditis by the modified Duke criteria up to 12 months of heart valve replacement. Cases and controls were matched by age, gender, date and type of surgery.
Findings
There were 26 cases and 78 controls, in 2496 valve surgeries. The median incidence of EO-PVE was 1.1%. Risk factors identified during surgery were: use of ≥2 cryoprecipitate units (odds ratio (OR): 5.95; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31–27.0) and ≥2 plasma units (OR: 2.73; 95% CI: 1.0–7.5). In the postoperative period, associated factors were bloodstream infection (OR: 14.00; CI: 1.49–131.77), pneumonia (4.38; 1.21–15.84), any infection (4.46; 1.63–12.21), central line for ≥2 weeks (5.33; 2.06–13.78), presence of dialysis catheter (3.22; 1.15–9.03), and new open chest surgery (3.89; 1.28–11.78). Mortality at 12 months was 34.6% in cases and 6.4% in controls (OR: 7.73; CI: 2.3–26.06).
Conclusion
Cases had more infections, invasive procedures and surgical re-interventions in the early postoperative period, which favoured contamination of the newly implanted prosthesis. A preventive approach, with reinforcement of infection control practices, may curb the incidence of this condition."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Surgical site infections (SSIs) after neurosurgery are potentially life-threatening and entail great costs. SSIs may occur from airborne bacteria in the operating room, and ultraclean air is desired during infection-prone cleaning procedures. Door openings and the number of persons present in the operating room affect the air quality. Mobile laminar airflow (MLAF) units, with horizontal laminar airflow, have previously been shown to reduce airborne bacterial contamination.
Aim
To assess the effect of MLAF units on airborne bacterial contamination during neurosurgical procedures.
Methods
In a quasi-experimental design, bacteria-carrying particles (colony-forming units: cfu) during neurosurgical procedures were measured with active air-sampling in operating rooms with conventional turbulent ventilation, and with additional MLAF units. The MLAF units were shifted between operating rooms monthly. Colony-forming unit count and bacterial species detection were conducted after incubation. Data was collected for a period of 18 months.
Findings
A total of 233 samples were collected during 45 neurosurgical procedures. The use of MLAF units significantly reduced the numbers of cfu in the surgical site area (P < 0.001) and above the instrument table (P < 0.001). Logistic regression showed that the only significant predictor affecting cfu count was the use of MLAF units (odds ratio: 41.6; 95% confidence interval: 11.3–152.8; P < 0.001). The most frequently detected bacteria were coagulase-negative staphylococci.
Conclusion
MLAF successfully reduces cfu during neurosurgery to ultraclean air levels. MLAF units are valuable when the main operating room ventilation system is unable to produce ultraclean air in infection-prone clean neurosurgery."

Background
Detection of healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) clusters is crucial in limiting disease transmission.
Aim
To investigate whether data on antibiotic use can be an alternative indicator for the identification of HCAI clusters caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs).
Methods
We retrospectively analysed MDRO-related HCAIs and the 10 indicators of antibiotic use from four independent high-risk units at a tertiary hospital in China from January 2014 to January 2017. Spearman's correlation test was used to evaluate the correlations between the variables, and Shewhart chart algorithm was used to evaluate the performances of cluster identification.
Findings
We identified 856 MDRO-related HCAI cases. All indicators of antibiotic use were positively correlated with the incidence of MDRO-related HCAIs (r = 0.2–0.5; P < 0.05), except for the antibiotics utilization rate (AUR) for single-agent use (r = –0.191; P = 0.017) and the AUR of unrestricted drugs (r = –0.042, P = 0.601). Shewhart chart algorithm identified 22 clusters of MDRO-related HCAI. The AUR of special-grade antibiotics, the AUR for three agents used in combination, and the number of antibiotic varieties per patient displayed the optimal predictive values for detecting these 22 MDRO-related HCAI clusters. At an acceptable specific level of 75%, these three indicators were considered as the optimal surveillance indicators for detecting MDRO-related HCAI clusters, with sensitivities from 80.00% to 95.00%, and positive predictive values from 71.05% to 77.50%.
Conclusion
The use of data on antibiotic use is a sensitive method for identifying clusters of MDRO-related HCAIs in high-risk units and may be a useful adjunctive method for HCAI surveillance."

Background
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a major health burden worldwide. The disease may present as an individual case, community outbreak, or more rarely as a nosocomial outbreak. Even in countries with a low prevalence such as the UK, tuberculosis (TB) presents a risk to healthcare workers (HCWs).
Aim
To report an outbreak which manifested 12 months after a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham.
Methods
We present the epidemiological and outbreak investigations; the role of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in identifying the outbreak and control measures to prevent further outbreaks.
Findings
Subsequent to a diagnosis of open TB in a patient, transmission was confirmed in one HCW who had active TB; HCWs with latent TB infection (LTBI) were also identified among seven HCW contacts of the index patient. Of note, all the LBTI patients had other risk factors for TB. Routine use of WGS identified the outbreak link between the index patient and the HCW with active TB disease, and informed our investigations.
Conclusion
Exposure most likely occurred during an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP) which was done in accordance with national guidance at that time without using respiratory protection. Enhanced control measures were implemented following the outbreak."

Introduction
Antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) serve as the primary method to prevent and manage the development of antimicrobial resistance. Rural settings may lack the recommended personnel and resources needed to provide antimicrobial stewardship services.
Methods
An electronic survey was distributed via e-mail to pharmacy directors or antimicrobial stewardship programme directors of licensed hospitals within Public Health Region 4/5N of East Texas.
Results
Sixty percent of ASPs were established <12 months prior to the survey administration. All ASPs had pharmacist involvement, with only one (5%) having formal infectious diseases (ID) training through postgraduate education. Ninety percent of ASPs had a physician champion, with five (27.8%) physicians having formal ID training. Most institutions lacked one or more recommended antimicrobial stewardship practices. When compared with ASPs established for <12 months, ASPs existing for at least 12 months were more likely to have protocols to change antimicrobials from intravenous to enteral forms (100% vs 50%, P = 0.042), provide education to patients and families on appropriate antimicrobial use (87.5% vs 33.3%, P = 0.028), and track antimicrobial purchasing costs (87.5% vs 33.3%, P = 0.028).

abstract = "Summary
Background
Increased antimicrobial resistance has been observed among many bacteria leading to treatment failures in human and veterinary medicine. Disinfection is a prerequisite for infection control and prevention in healthcare settings. Chlorine compounds are cost-effective and accessible worldwide.
Aim
To determine the efficacy of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB).
Methods
Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using broth macro-dilution. Bactericidal efficacy was measured by qualitative and quantitative suspension tests followed by practical tests without mechanical action on stainless steel carriers. The guidelines of the German Association for Applied Hygiene were followed.
Findings
Results varied remarkably depending on the method. MICs were 0.1% or 0.2% NaOCl. Qualitative suspension tests revealed up to 500-fold lower bactericidal concentrations. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P = 0.0025) was significantly less susceptible in these tests whereas quantitative suspension tests revealed no significant differences between strains (P > 0.05). Practical tests determined bactericidal concentrations of 0.8–0.32% NaOCl at 1 min of contact and even lower concentrations for longer contact times. At 1 min, five Klebsiella were significantly less susceptible (P = 0.0124), whereas the lower susceptibility of P. aeruginosa was not confirmed. Organic load inhibited bactericidal activity significantly, whereas contact time had a marginal effect. Differing test results underline that MIC determination and qualitative suspension tests may be insufficient approaches to evaluate bacterial susceptibility or resistance.
Conclusion
NaOCl efficiently reduced Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., and Klebsiella spp., most notably in the absence of organic matter. Strain- and species-specific differences in susceptibility were noticed, but in general MDR-GNB revealed no higher tolerance to NaOCl."

Background
Periprosthetic joint infection is a major complication of total joint replacement surgery and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and financial burden. Surgical body suits (space suits), originally designed to reduce the incidence of infection, have paradoxically been implicated in increased periprosthetic joint infection rates recently. Air exhausted from space suits may contribute to this increased rate of periprosthetic joint infection.
Aim
To investigate the flow of air exhausted from space suits commonly used in modern operating theatres.
Methods
The exhaust airflow patterns of four commercially available space suit systems were compared using a fog machine and serial still photographs.
Findings
The space suit systems tested all air exhausted into the operating room. The single fan systems with a standard surgical gown exhausted air laterally from the posterior gown fold at approximately the level of the surgical field. The single fan system with a dedicated zippered suit exhausted air at a level below the surgical field. The dual fan system exhausted air out of the top of the helmet at a level above the surgical field.
Conclusions
Space suit systems currently in use in joint replacement surgery differ significantly from traditional body exhaust systems; rather than removing contaminated air from the operating environment, modern systems exhaust this air into the operating room, in some cases potentially towards the sterile instrument tray and the surgical field."

Successful decolonization was determined by at least two consecutive negative rectal swabs [polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture] on Days 7, 14, 21 and 28, and monthly for three months following FMT.
Results
Seventeen patients were included, with a median age of 73 years [interquartile range (IQR) 64.3–79.0]. Median duration of carriage of CRE or VRE before FMT was 62.5 days (IQR 57.0–77.5). One week after FMT, three of eight patients were free of CRE colonization and three of nine patients were free of VRE colonization. After three months, four of eight patients were free of CRE colonization and seven of eight patients were free of VRE colonization. Qualitative PCR results were concordant with culture. Six patients received antibiotics during follow-up, three in each group. No adverse events were reported.
Conclusion
CRE and VRE clearance rates were not significantly different in this study, possibly due to the small sample size, but a trend was observed. These data should be confirmed by larger cohorts and randomized trials."

Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) is a widely used biocidal agent in health care, mainly in surface disinfectants and disinfectant cleaners. The aim of this review was to evaluate the potential of bacteria to adapt to low-level BAC exposure. A maximum four-fold increase in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was found in most of the 57 bacterial species evaluated. A strong adaptive, mostly stable, change in MIC was described in strains or isolates of Pantoea spp., Enterobacter spp., Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Escherichia coli (up to 500-fold, 300-fold, 200-fold and 100-fold, respectively). The highest MIC values after adaptation were 3000 mg/L (Salmonella typhimurium), 2500 mg/L (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), 1500 mg/L (Enterobacter spp.) and 1000 mg/L (E. coli and S. saprophyticus). Cross-resistance to selected antibiotics (e.g. ampicillin, cefotaxime and ceftazidime) and biocidal agents (e.g. didecyldimethylammonium bromide, didecyldimethylammonium chloride, triclosan and chlorhexidine) was found in some isolates. A significant upregulation of transporter and efflux pump genes was found in Burkholderia cepacia complex and E. coli. It is probable that adapted isolates are not killed by BAC-based disinfectants at the recommended concentration. The use of BAC in patient care and all other settings, such as consumer products and households, should be critically assessed and restricted to indications with a proven health benefit or justifiable public health benefits. Other biocidal agents with a lower or no selection pressure should be preferred if the efficacy, acceptance and skin or material compatibility are at least as good for the intended use."

Background
The spread of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KPN) is a major concern, but data on CR-KPN infection/colonization in paediatric populations are limited.
Aim
To analyse epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, and therapeutic options for CR-KPN infections in neonates in China.
Methods
A retrospective study was performed at the Children's Hospital of Fudan University, including 88 neonates with CR-KPN admitted between November 2015 and October 2016. Forty-seven CR-KPN isolates were chosen at random for further study, including antimicrobial susceptibility testing, potential β-lactamase screening and homology analysis.
Findings
In total, 44.3% (39/88) of the neonates with CR-KPN were infected, and 71.8% (28/39) were nosocomial infections. Of these, pneumonia and urinary tract infection accounted for 50.0% (14/28) and 42.9% (12/28), respectively. All infected patients were cured or improved with fosfomycin and/or carbapenem-containing combination therapy, except one case in whom treatment was withdrawn. All 47 cases of CR-KPN were resistant to ertapenem and 95.7% were resistant to imipenem/meropenem. Overall, 87.2% (41/47) were positive for blaNDM-1, and belonged to 11 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types; 53.7% (22/41) were designated as ST278 and 17.1% (7/41) were designated as ST2735 by multi-locus sequence typing.
Conclusions
Most of the CR-KPN isolated from neonates produced New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 and were highly homologous. Fosfomycin-containing regimens and meropenem-/panipenem-containing combination therapy were efficient for CR-KPN infection in neonates."

Background
In some countries, a relationship between hospital ownership and the occurrence of healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) rates has been described.
Aim
To investigate the association between hospital ownership and occurrence of HCAI in Germany.
Methods
Five different components of the German national nosocomial infection surveillance system were analysed with regard to the influence of hospital ownership in the period 2014–2016. Endpoints included ventilator-associated pneumonia, central-venous-catheter-associated bloodstream infections, urinary-catheter-associated urinary tract infections, surgical site infections (SSI) following hip prosthesis and colon surgery, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) and hand rub consumption per 1000 patient-days. Three hospital ownership types (public, non-profit and private) were analysed using univariate and multi-variate methods.
Findings
The distribution of hospitals according to the three ownership types was similar in all components. In total, 661 intensive care units (ICUs), 149 departments performing colon procedures, and 349 departments performing hip prosthesis were included. In addition, 568 hospitals provided their MRSA rates and 236 provided their CDI rates, and 1833 ICUs and 12,934 non-ICUs provided their hand rub consumption data. In general, the differences between the hospital types were rather small and not significant for the ICUs. In the multi-variate analysis, public hospitals had a lower SSI rate following hip prosthesis (odds ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.65–0.99).
Conclusion
Hospital ownership was not found to have a major influence on the incidence of HCAI in Germany."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Short-term peripheral venous catheters are a significant source of healthcare-acquired bloodstream infections and a preventable cause of death.
Aim
To assess the effectiveness of interventions applied to reduce the incidence and mortality associated with short-term peripheral venous catheter-related bloodstream infections (PVCR-BSIs).
Methods
The intervention included continuous PVCR-BSI surveillance, implementation of preventive measures related to catheter insertion and maintenance in accordance with evidence-based recommendations and the hospital's own data, front-line staff educational campaigns, and assessment of adherence to hospital guidelines by ward rounds. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate the trend of rate per year.
Findings
From January 2003 to December 2016, 227 episodes of PVCR-BSI were identified among hospitalized patients at a university hospital. The mean age of patients was 67 years (standard deviation 14 years), 69% were male and the median Charlson score was 3 (interquartile range 2–5). Staphylococcus aureus caused 115 (50.7%) episodes. Thirty-day mortality was 13.2%. After implementation of the intervention, the incidence of PVCR-BSIs decreased significantly from 30 episodes in 2003 (1.17 episodes/10,000 patient-days) to eight episodes in 2016 (0.36/10,000 patient-days). The number of episodes caused by S. aureus decreased from 18 episodes in 2003 (0.70/10,000 patient-days) to three episodes in 2016 (0.14/10,000 patient-day), and mortality decreased from seven cases in 2003 (0.27/10,000 patient-days) to zero cases in 2016 (0.00/10,000 patient-days).
Conclusions
Surveillance, implementation of a multi-modal strategy and periodical assessment of healthcare workers' adherence to hospital guidelines led to a sustained reduction in PVCR-BSIs. This reduction had a major impact on S. aureus BSI rates and associated mortality."

Background
While the utilization of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis has been increasing, in-hospital infective endocarditis (IE) following TAVR has not been well described.
Aim
To identify in-hospital IE following TAVR.
Methods
All patients who underwent TAVR between 2012 and 2014 were identified using the National Inpatient Sample database. Multi-variate logistic regression was performed to identify the predictors of in-hospital IE after TAVR.
Findings
Of the 41,025 patients who received TAVR, 120 patients (0.3%) developed in-hospital IE. Viridans group streptococci (20.8%) was the most frequent causative organism for in-hospital IE, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (16.7%) and enterococci (8.3%). Patients who developed in-hospital IE after TAVR had significantly higher rates of death (20.8% vs 4.1%, P<0.001), septic shock (16.7% vs 0.8%, P<0.001), cardiogenic shock (12.5% vs 3.4%, P=0.02), acute kidney injury requiring haemodialysis (16.7% vs 1.6%, P<0.001), bleeding requiring transfusion (29.2% vs 11.3%, P=0.01), myocardial infarction (12.5% vs 2.1%, P<0.001) and permanent pacemaker removal (4.2% vs 0.05%, P<0.001) compared with patients without IE. Independent predictors of in-hospital IE after TAVR include younger age [odds ratio (OR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89–0.95], drug abuse (OR 48.9, 95% CI 6.9–347.3) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (OR 7.8, 95% CI 1.4–44.4).
Conclusion
IE occurred in 0.3% of patients after TAVR during the same hospitalization, resulting in higher rates of adverse outcomes including mortality. Patients with younger age, a history of drug abuse or HIV infection are at greater risk of in-hospital IE following TAVR, and would benefit from vigilant preventive measures perioperatively."

abstract = "Summary
Background
There are few data and no accepted standards for air quality in the intensive care unit (ICU). Any relationship between airborne pathogens and hospital-acquired infection (HAI) risk in the ICU remains unknown.
Aim
First, to correlate environmental contamination of air and surfaces in the ICU; second, to examine any association between environmental contamination and ICU-acquired staphylococcal infection.
Methods
Patients, air, and surfaces were screened on 10 sampling days in a mechanically ventilated 10-bed ICU for a 10-month period. Near-patient hand-touch sites (N = 500) and air (N = 80) were screened for total colony count and Staphylococcus aureus. Air counts were compared with surface counts according to proposed standards for air and surface bioburden. Patients were monitored for ICU-acquired staphylococcal infection throughout.
Findings
Overall, 235 of 500 (47%) surfaces failed the standard for aerobic counts (≤2.5 cfu/cm2). Half of passive air samples (20/40: 50%) failed the ‘index of microbial air’ contamination (2 cfu/9 cm plate/h), and 15/40 (37.5%) active air samples failed the clean air standard (<10 cfu/m3). Settle plate data were closer to the pass/fail proportion from surfaces and provided the best agreement between air parameters and surfaces when evaluating surface benchmark values of 0–20 cfu/cm2. The surface standard most likely to reflect hygiene pass/fail results compared with air was 5 cfu/cm2. Rates of ICU-acquired staphylococcal infection were associated with surface counts per bed during 72h encompassing sampling days (P = 0.012).
Conclusion
Passive air sampling provides quantitative data analogous to that obtained from surfaces. Settle plates could serve as a proxy for routine environmental screening to determine the infection risk in ICU."

Background
National surveillance of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in Scotland enables the monitoring of trends in incidence rates but not mortality.
Aim
To assess factors associated with mortality for all CDI cases aged ≥15 years in Scotland between 2010 and 2016.
Methods
All CDI cases aged ≥15 years in Scotland between 2010 and 2016 were linked to hospital admission and mortality datasets. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with mortality (30-day all-cause). A case–control study of a hospitalized subset of cases and matched hospitalized controls assessed the impact of CDI on mortality and length of stay.
Findings
Thirty-day all-cause mortality decreased over the seven-year period (from 20.5% to 15.6%; P < 0.001), mainly among healthcare-associated CDI (HA-CDI). Increased age, higher Charlson score, HA-CDI, as well as liver, heart and malignancy comorbidities were associated with higher mortality. No association was observed between polymerase chain reaction ribotype and higher mortality, though 015 and 078 were associated with lower mortality. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) for 30-day mortality in hospitalized CDI cases compared to controls was 2.67 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.42–2.94; P < 0.001). Whereas mortality declined over time in cases and controls, the trend in ORs remained relatively stable. Having CDI increased additional mean length of stay beyond infection by 22.3% (95% CI: 18.0–26.8%; P < 0.001).
Conclusion
CDI is associated with an almost three-fold increase in 30-day mortality and places an increased burden on hospital resources by increasing mean LOS beyond the infection date by 22.3%. The decreasing CDI mortality trends may be due to overall improvements in mortality among the general and hospital population of Scotland. Therefore, despite large declines in incidence rates, CDI remains a serious healthcare problem."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Carbapenem-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are on the rise worldwide. National guidelines for the prevention and control of CPE recommend screening for the detection of asymptomatic carriers on admission.
Aim
To evaluate the benefit of serial screens for detecting the carriage of CPE and other antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria following hospital admission.
Methods
All CPE screens, which were cultured on chromogenic media and the presence of a carbapenemase confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, were analysed for a six-month period. National guidelines in England recommend three serial screens for CPE separated by 48 h for admission screening for ‘at-risk’ patients, during which the patient is isolated. Two screening scenarios were tested. In scenario A, patients received three screens at the specified timepoints, in line with English national guidelines; in scenario B, patients received three consecutive screens, but not necessarily within the specified timepoints, during one admission. General linear models or conditional logistic regression were used to detect any significant change in the rate of carriage.
Findings
There was no significant increase in the detected carriage rate of CPE across any of the three timepoints in the scenarios tested. However, there was a significant increase in the detected rate of carriage of Gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and resistant Enterobacteriaceae (excluding CPE) in scenario B.
Conclusion
Three serial screens were not useful for the detection of CPE carriage on admission. The increase in the carriage rate of other Gram-negative bacteria may be explained by ‘unmasking’ of pre-existing carriage, or acquisition. This argues for regular screening of long-stay patients."

Background
Repeated outbreaks of salmonellosis caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis at a rehabilitation clinic in Germany were investigated microbiologically from August 2002 to August 2009.
Aim
To identify the sources of transmission and characterize the S. enterica serovar Infantis isolates.
Methods
Associated with these outbreaks, isolates from 98 patients, two kitchen staff, five food samples, four swabs of kitchen facilities, three samples of chicken faeces and one sample of sewage water were evaluated by phage typing. All S. enterica serovar Infantis isolates investigated (N=113) were related to phage type (PT) 29. Additionally, 44 of the 113 isolates were selected at random for typing by XbaI macrorestriction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
Findings
Typing of the 44 isolates showed that the recurrent infections were caused by the single clone PT 29/XB27+44 (42/44, 95.5%). The most likely route of transmission was only identified in the last outbreak in 2009 within the present study. It was found to be cross-contamination in the kitchen facilities (emanating from a contaminated wooden panel), in combination with carriers among the kitchen staff.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated important details of hospital-specific epidemiological processes, and alludes to a long-term reservoir of an epidemic clone of S. enterica serovar Infantis either in a backyard flock of poultry or in an inanimate kitchen reservoir."

Background
Outbreaks of group A streptococcus (GAS) infections may occur in healthcare settings. Transmission to patients is sometimes linked to colonized healthcare workers (HCWs) and/or a contaminated environment.
Aim
To describe the investigation and control of an outbreak of healthcare-associated GAS on an elderly care medical ward, over six months.
Methods
Four patients developed septicaemia due to GAS infection without a clinically obvious site of infection. The outbreak team undertook an investigation involving a retrospective review of GAS cases, prospective case finding, HCW screening and environmental sampling using both swabs and settle plates. Immediate control measures included source isolation and additional cleaning of the ward environment with a chlorine disinfectant and hydrogen peroxide.
Findings
Prospective patient screening identified one additional patient with throat GAS carriage. Settle plate positivity for GAS was strongly associated with the presence of one individual HCW on the ward, who was subsequently found to have GAS perineal carriage. Contamination of a fabric-upholstered chair in an office adjacent to the ward, used by the HCW, was also detected. In total, three asymptomatic HCWs had throat GAS carriage and one HCW had both perineal and throat carriage. All isolates were typed as emm 28.
Conclusion
This is the first outbreak report demonstrating the use of settle plates in a GAS outbreak investigation on a medical ward, to identify the likely source of the outbreak. Based on this report we recommend that both throat and perineal sites should be sampled if HCW screening is undertaken during an outbreak of GAS. Fabric, soft furnishings should be excluded from clinical areas as well as any adjacent offices because pathogenic bacteria such as GAS may contaminate this environment."

Sixty-one terminally cleaned items were received from three different UK hospitals. The presence of dry biofilm was investigated using culture-based methods and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacterial diversity within biofilms was investigated using ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer analysis (RISA)–polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing.
Findings
Multi-species dry biofilms were recovered from 95% of 61 samples. Abundance and complexity of dry biofilms were confirmed by SEM. All biofilms harboured Gram-positive bacteria including pathogens associated with HCAI; 58% of samples grew meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Dry biofilms had similar physical composition regardless of the type of items sampled or the ward from which the samples originated. There were differences observed in the dominance of particular species: dry biofilms from two hospitals contained mostly staphylococcal DNA, whereas more Bacillus spp. DNA was found on surfaces from the third hospital.
Conclusion
The presence of dry biofilms harbouring bacterial pathogens is virtually universal on commonly used items in healthcare settings. The role of dry biofilms in spreading HCAIs may be underestimated. The risk may be further exacerbated by inefficient cleaning and disinfection practices for hospital surfaces."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are a major public health concern and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. A robust and current evidence base that is specific to local, national and Europe-wide settings is necessary to inform the development of strategies to reduce HCAI and contain antimicrobial resistance.
Aim
To measure the prevalence of HCAI and antimicrobial prescribing and identify key priority areas for interventions to reduce the burden of infection.
Methods
A national rolling point-prevalence survey (PPS) in National Health Service (NHS) acute, NHS non-acute, NHS paediatric, and independent hospitals was carried out between September and November 2016 using the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control protocol designed for the European PPS.
Findings
The prevalence of HCAI was 4.6%, 2.7%, and 3.2% in acute adults, paediatric and non-acute patient groups, respectively. The most frequent HCAI types reported in adult patients were urinary tract infection and pneumonia. The prevalence of antimicrobial prescribing was 35.7%, 29.3%, and 13.8% in acute adults, paediatric, and non-acute patient groups, respectively. Respiratory, skin and soft tissue, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract infections were the most common infections being treated at the time of survey.
Conclusion
HCAI continues to be a public health concern in Scotland. Urinary tract infection and pneumonia continue to place a significant burden on patients and on healthcare delivery, including those that develop in the community and require hospital admission. A broader population health approach which focuses on reducing the risk of infection upstream would reduce these infections in both community and hospital settings."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Desiccation tolerance increases Staphylococcus aureus survival and risk of transmission. A better understanding of factors driving intraoperative transmission of S. aureus pathogens may lead to innovative improvements in intraoperative infection control.
Aims
To determine whether desiccation tolerance is associated with intraoperative S. aureus transmission, and to examine typical transmission dynamics for desiccation-tolerant isolates in the operating room in order to provide the impetus for development of improved intraoperative infection control strategies.
Methods
S. aureus isolates (N=173) were collected from anaesthesia work area reservoirs in 274 operating room environments. Desiccation tolerance was assessed and the potential association with sequence type (ST) and clonal transmission was evaluated. Whole cell genome analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis were used to compare desiccation-tolerant isolates with causative organisms of infection.
Findings
S. aureus ST 5 isolates had greater desiccation tolerance than all other intraoperative STs [ST 5, N=34, median Day 2 colony-forming unit (cfu) survival 0.027% ± 0.029%; other STs, N=139, median Day 2 cfu survival 0.0091% ± 1.41%; corrected P=0.0001]. ST 5 was associated with increased risk of clonal transmission (relative risk 1.82, 95% confidence interval 1.23–2.71, P=0.003). ST 5 transmission was linked by whole cell genome analysis to postoperative infection.
Conclusions
Increased desiccation tolerance is associated with intraoperative transmission of S. aureus ST 5 isolates that are linked to postoperative infection. Future work should determine whether attenuation of desiccation-tolerant, intraoperative ST 5 strains can impact the incidence of healthcare-associated infections."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Although a large number of studies have identified obesity as an independent risk factor for the development of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), the synergistic impacts of obesity with other factors on PJI remain unknown. Additionally, few studies have specifically explored the risk factors of PJI within a Chinese population.
Aims
To investigate the association between obesity and PJI in a Chinese population, and identify synergistic impacts of obesity with other risk factors on the development of PJI.
Methods
Three hundred and seven patients at a single institution with a diagnosis of PJI following primary total hip or knee arthroplasty, treated from 2008 to 2015, were identified. Each case was matched with two controls who did not develop PJI after primary total hip or knee arthroplasty in the study period using propensity score matching for several important parameters. Multi-variable logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between body mass index (BMI) and the risk of developing PJI. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted according to age, sex, type of surgery, smoking status, alcohol use, diabetes, inflammatory arthritis, liver disease and renal disease.
Findings
The multiple logistic analyses showed that obesity was associated with increased risk of PJI [odds ratio (OR) 2.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.66–3.69]. When analysed as a continuous variable, BMI was also associated with increased risk of PJI (OR per 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI 1.08; 95% CI 1.02–1.14). In the interaction analysis, patients who were obese and smoked had a higher OR of developing PJI than non-smokers who were obese (OR 3.54 vs 1.55, P-value for interaction=0.031). Similarly, the OR was much higher for patients with both obesity and inflammatory arthritis than for patients who were obese with no history of inflammatory arthritis (OR 3.9 vs 1.55, P-value for interaction=0.029). No other significant interactions were found in the association between obesity and PJI.
Conclusion
Obesity is an independent risk factor for the development of PJI in the Chinese Han population. Surgeons should be aware that obese patients who smoke or have inflammatory arthritis are at additional increased risk of PJI."

abstract = "Summary
Background
There have been few studies exploring implementation strategies to central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) in low- or middle-income countries.
Aim
To implement tailored interventions to reduce CLABSI rates in adult intensive care units.
Methods
The implementation strategy of the State Health Department was performed in São Paulo State, Brazil, over two cycles. Cycle 1 (56 hospitals) was exploratory and cycle 2 (77 hospitals) was designed to confirm the hypothesis generated by the first cycle, with three phases each (pre-intervention, intervention, post-intervention). Cycles included: evaluation of healthcare workers' knowledge, observation of practices, and CLABSI rates monthly report. In cycle 1, a log–normal mixed model was used to select variables significantly associated with the reduction of CLABSI. In cycle 2, CLABSI rates were evaluated.
Findings
Healthcare workers' practices improved after intervention. In cycle 1, reduction of CLABSI rates was more pronounced in hospitals with initial CLABSI rates >7.4 per 1000 catheter-days (P < 0.001) and those that introduced the use of peripherally inserted central catheters (P = 0.01). For hospitals with high CLABSI initial rates, simulation demonstrated that the rates were expected to decrease by 36% (95% CI: 9–63), no matter the type of intervention. In cycle 2, there was an overall decrease in CLABSI rates during the intervention period; whereas the mean rate fell further post-intervention, rates at the 90th percentile increased.
Conclusion
The implementation strategy may have had an effect on infection rates independently of the specific interventions implemented; however, the sustainability of reduction in the post-intervention period remains a challenge."

Background
Since 1990, several studies have focused on safety and patient satisfaction in connection with day surgery. However, to date, no meta-analysis has investigated the overall prevalence of surgical site infections (SSI).
Aim
To estimate the overall prevalence of SSI following day surgery, regardless of the type of surgery.
Method
A systematic review and a meta-analysis of the prevalence of SSI following day surgery, regardless of the type of surgery, was conducted, seeking all studies before June 2016. A pooled random effects model using the DerSimonian and Laird approach was used to estimate overall prevalence. A double arcsine transformation was used to stabilize the variance of proportions. After performing a sensitivity analysis to validate the robustness of the method, univariate and multi-variate meta-regressions were used to test the effect of date of publication, country of study, study population, type of specialty, contamination class, time of postoperative patient visit after day surgery, and duration of hospital care.
Findings
Ninety articles, both observational and randomized, were analysed. The estimated overall prevalence of SSI among patients who underwent day surgery was 1.36% (95% confidence interval 1.1–1.6), with a Bayesian probability between 1 and 2% of 96.5%. The date of publication was associated with the prevalence of SSI (coefficient −0.001, P = 0.04), and the specialty (digestive vs non-digestive surgery) tended to be associated with the prevalence of SSI (coefficient 0.03, P = 0.064).

Background
Evidence of sustained improvement in hand hygiene compliance at the institutional level is scarce.
Aim
To assess the impact and sustainability of a hospital-wide improvement programme on hand hygiene compliance of staff.
Methods
Analysis of trends of hand hygiene compliance for all clinical staff, measured through direct observation by trained observers, within a 450-bed multi-centre teaching hospital in the county of Neuchâtel, Switzerland.
Intervention
Implementation of a multi-modal improvement programme based on the World Health Organization (WHO) strategy, with the goal of reaching overall compliance of at least 80%. The strategy content included increasing access to alcohol hand rub; healthcare worker education; two-month interval compliance measurement; and hospital-wide open communication about ward-level results, point-of-care reminders, communication via a dedicated in-house newsletter and leadership engagement. The implementation phase was followed by a consolidation phase.
Findings
In total, 33,476 observations were collected from September 2012 to March 2014 (mean >3000 opportunities per audit). Overall compliance improved from 61.4% at baseline to 83.6% after the 18-month improvement programme (P<0.001), and was sustained at 85.3% 18 months later (i.e. 18 months after the programme finished) (P=0.08). The same trend (significant and clinically relevant improvement during the intervention, sustained after 18 months) was measured for all professional categories.

Background
Healthcare-associated infection (HAI) represents a major problem for patient safety worldwide.
Aim
To provide an up-to-date picture of the extent, aetiology, risk factors and patterns of infections in intensive care units (ICUs) in 28 Brazilian hospitals of different sizes.
Methods
A one-day point prevalence survey in 2016 enrolled the ICUs of hospitals from the 12 meso-regions in Minas Gerais state, south-east Brazil. Hospitals were classified as university or non-university hospitals. All patients with >48 h of admission to the study ICUs at the time of the survey were included.
Findings
In total, 303 patients were studied; of these, 155 (51.2%) were infected and 123 (79.4%) had at least one ICU-acquired infection. The most common ICU-acquired infections were pneumonia (53.0%) and bloodstream infection (27.6%). One hundred and nineteen bacterial isolates were cultured; the most common were Acinetobacter baumannii (27.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (27.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (39.0%). According to type of infection, the most common pathogens were P. aeruginosa (30.4%) in pneumonia, coagulase-negative staphylococci (23.4%) and Enterobacteriaceae (23.4%) in bloodstream infections, and Enterobacteriaceae (47.6%) in urinary tract infections.
Conclusion
This study found that the overall prevalence of ICU-acquired infections in surveyed Brazilian hospitals was higher than that reported in most European countries and the USA. A greater proportion of infections were caused by non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria. These observations, along with a high rate of antimicrobial use, illustrate the urgent need for HAIs to be a priority in the public health agenda of Brazil."

Background
Invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients has been associated with demolition in or adjacent to hospitals. In recent years, azole-resistant clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus, the most common agent of IA, have emerged in Western Europe and are spreading globally.
Aim
To determine the potential risk of IA, including azole resistance, in patients caused by demolition of a hospital building.
Methods
Air sampling before, during and after demolition, screening for azole resistance, genotyping of non-susceptible isolates, and comparing those with strains from patients with azole-resistant IA during demolition.
Findings
Mean concentrations of A. fumigatus spores did not differ significantly between the three periods before [17.5 colony-forming units (cfu)/m³], during (20.8 cfu/m³) (P=0.26) and after (17.7 cfu/m³) demolition (P=0.33). No significant difference in IA cases documented by clinicians was found when comparing the timeframe of demolition with the previous year (44 vs 42 cases). Thirty of 200 A. fumigatus isolates (15%) showed azole resistance. Genotyping by microsatellite polymerase chain reaction of the azole-resistant environmental and clinical isolates showed a polyclonal distribution.
Conclusions
The results suggest that with implemented preventive measures, there is no increased risk for IA, including azole resistance, in immunocompromised patients during outdoor demolition work. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings."

Background
Since the launch of the national Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Surveillance Service in 1997, successive expansions of the programme provided hospitals with increasing flexibility in procedures to target through surveillance. Ensuring that the programme continues to meet hospitals' needs remains essential.
Aim
As a means to inform the future direction of the service, a survey of all acute National Health Service trusts was undertaken to assess and understand priorities for surveillance.
Methods
A web-based survey was circulated to acute NHS trust infection control teams in England, asking them to identify and rank (i) reasons for undertaking current SSI surveillance, (ii) priority surgical categories for future SSI surveillance, and (iii) reasons for prioritizing these categories.
Findings
Of the 161 trusts surveyed, 84 (52%) responded. Assessment of quality of care was identified as the most common driver for SSI surveillance activity. Considerable heterogeneity in priority areas was observed, with 24 different surgical categories selected as top priority. Of the procedures undertaken by 15 or more trusts, caesarean section (2.7), hip replacement (2.8) and coronary artery bypass graft (2.9) were highest ranked. All 17 categories in the current surveillance programme were selected as a top priority by one or more trusts.
Conclusion
Whereas the majority of hospitals' priorities for SSI surveillance are included in the current programme, the top-ranked priority, caesarean section, is not included. Given the diversity of priority areas, maintaining a comprehensive spectrum of categories in the national programme is essential to assist hospitals in addressing local priorities."

Background
The shedding of epithelial squames (skin scales) by staff in operating theatre air is an important source of deep infection following joint replacement surgery. This is a serious complication, resulting in significant morbidity for the patient and substantial cost implications for healthcare systems. Much effort has been put into providing clean air in operating theatres, yet little attention has been given to reducing the shedding of surface skin scales at source.
Aim
To develop a novel method for calculating surface skin scale density using surface microscopy, and to use it to evaluate the effect of a skincare regimen on operating theatre staff.
Methods
Surface microscopy with Z-stacked imaging was used to visualize the effect of a skincare regimen involving three stages: washing with soap; exfoliation; and application of emollient. A USB microscope was then used in a field study to take images of the skin of operating theatre staff who applied the regimen to one lower limb the night before testing. The other limb was used as a control. Two blinded assessors analysed scale density.
Results
Z-stack images from the surface microscope enabled observations of the skincare regimen. The USB microscope also provided adequate images that enabled assessment of skin scale density. In the operating theatre staff, a 72.1% reduction in visible skin scales was observed following application of the skincare regimen.
Conclusions
Further work is required to demonstrate how this effect correlates with dispersion of skin particles in a cleanroom, and subsequently in live operating theatre studies."

Background
The incidence of infectious complications has not been previously compared for two types of common urinary catheters used in the long-term care setting: indwelling urethral catheters and suprapubic catheters.
Aim
To compare catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) rates and multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) colonization between nursing home residents with indwelling urethral and suprapubic catheters.
Methods
Participants included 418 nursing home residents with an indwelling device enrolled in a previously published prospective targeted infection prevention study conducted between 2010 and 2013. Resident age, gender, function, comorbidities, and information on infections, antibiotic use, and recent hospitalizations were obtained at study enrolment, day 14, and every 30 days thereafter for up to one year. Microbiological samples were obtained from several anatomic sites at each visit. Cox proportional hazard models were adjusted for facility-level clustering and other covariates.
Findings
In all, 208 study participants had an indwelling urinary catheter, contributing 21,700 device-days; 173 (83%) with a urethral catheter, 35 (17%) with a suprapubic catheter. After covariate adjustment, the suprapubic group had a lower incidence of CAUTI (6.6 vs 8.8 per 1000 device-days; P = 0.05), were half as likely to be hospitalized (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.46; P < 0.01) and were 23% less likely to have had antibiotics in the past 30 days (HR = 0.77; P = 0.02). Among residents catheterized ≥90 days, the mean number of MDROs isolated in the suprapubic group was significantly higher than in the urethral group (0.57 vs 0.44; P = 0.01). Ciprofloxacin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli were frequent in both groups.
Conclusion
Residents with a suprapubic catheter may have fewer CAUTIs, less hospitalization and less antibiotic use, but are more likely colonized with MDROs."

Background
Deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) is a dreaded complication of cardiac surgery with considerable consequences in terms of mortality, morbidity and treatment costs. In addition to standard surgical site infection prevention guidelines, multiple specific measures in the prevention of DSWI have been developed and evaluated in the past decades. This review focuses on these specific measures to prevent DSWI.
Methods
An extensive literature search was performed to assess interventions in the prevention of DSWI. Articles describing results of a randomized controlled trial were categorized by type of intervention. Results were yielded and, if possible, pooled.
Results
From a total of 743 articles found, 48 randomized controlled trials were selected. Studies were divided into 12 categories, containing pre-, peri- and postoperative preventive measures. Specific measures shown to be effective were: antibiotic prophylaxis with a first-generation cephalosporin for at least 24 h, application of local gentamicin before chest closure, sternal closure with figure-of-eight steel wires, and postoperative chest support using a corset or vest.
Conclusion
This study identified several measures that prevent DSWI after cardiac surgery that are not frequently applied in current practice. It is recommended that the guidelines on prevention of surgical site infection in cardiac surgery should be updated."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Regimens containing topical polymyxin appear to be more effective in preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) than other methods.
Aim
To benchmark the incidence rates of Acinetobacter-associated VAP (AAVAP) within component (control and intervention) groups from concurrent controlled studies of polymyxin compared with studies of various VAP prevention methods other than polymyxin (non-polymyxin studies).
Methods
An AAVAP benchmark was derived using data from 77 observational groups without any VAP prevention method under study. Data from 41 non-polymyxin studies provided additional points of reference. The benchmarking was undertaken by meta-regression using generalized estimating equation methods.
Results
Within 20 studies of topical polymyxin, the mean AAVAP was 4.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0–6.9] and 3.7% (95% CI 2.0–5.3) for control and intervention groups, respectively. In contrast, the AAVAP benchmark was 1.5% (95% CI 1.2–2.0). In the AAVAP meta-regression model, group origin from a trauma intensive care unit (+0.55; +0.16 to +0.94, P = 0.006) or membership of a polymyxin control group (+0.64; +0.21 to +1.31, P = 0.023), but not membership of a polymyxin intervention group (+0.24; -0.37 to +0.84, P = 0.45), were significant positive correlates.
Conclusions
The mean incidence of AAVAP within the control groups of studies of topical polymyxin is more than double the benchmark, whereas the incidence rates within the groups of non-polymyxin studies and, paradoxically, polymyxin intervention groups are more similar to the benchmark. These incidence rates, which are paradoxical in the context of an apparent effect against VAP within controlled trials of topical polymyxin-based interventions, force a re-appraisal."

Background
There is a paucity of data describing hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) in Africa.
Objective
To describe the prevalence and distribution of HAIs in acute care hospitals in Ghana.
Methods
Between September and December 2016, point-prevalence surveys were conducted in participating hospitals using protocols of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Medical records of eligible inpatients at or before 8am on the survey date were reviewed to identify HAIs present at the time of the survey.
Findings
Ten hospitals were surveyed, representing 32.9% of all acute care beds in government hospitals. Of 2107 inpatients surveyed, 184 HAIs were identified among 172 patients, corresponding to an overall prevalence of 8.2%. The prevalence values in hospitals ranged from 3.5% to 14.4%, with higher proportions of infections in secondary and tertiary care facilities. The most common HAIs were surgical site infections (32.6%), bloodstream infections (19.5%), urinary tract infections (18.5%) and respiratory tract infections (16.3%). Device-associated infections accounted for 7.1% of HAIs. For 12.5% of HAIs, a micro-organism was reported; the most commonly isolated micro-organism was Escherichia coli. Approximately 61% of all patients surveyed were on antibiotics; 89.5% of patients with an HAI received at least one antimicrobial agent on the survey date. The strongest independent predictors for HAI were the presence of an invasive device before onset of infection and duration of hospital stay.
Conclusion
A low HAI burden was found compared with findings from other low- and middle-income countries."

Background
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a Gram-negative environmental organism that can cause severe infection in immunosuppressed patients, including preterm neonates. In recent years, it has become common practice to screen neonates for PA colonization.
Aim
To assess the value of screening neonates for PA in (1) predicting the risk of developing severe PA infection and (2) directing infection control practice.
Methods
Between August 2012 and September 2015, babies admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at North Bristol NHS Trust were screened routinely for PA colonization on admission and weekly thereafter. Data were also collected on babies who developed PA infection. Environmental samples from the NICU were tested for the presence of PA. Variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) typing was performed on all strains of PA from babies and the environment.
Findings
No babies with positive screens subsequently developed PA infection. There was no VNTR strain evidence supporting cross-infection from the environment or other babies. Conclusion: Screening neonates for PA did not identify babies who subsequently developed PA infection. Following cessation of screening in September 2015, there was no increase in the number of babies identified with PA infection."

abstract = "Summary
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has become the leading healthcare-associated infection and cause of outbreaks around the world. Although various innovative treatments have been developed, preventive strategies using multi-faceted infection control programmes have not been successful in reducing CDI rates. The major risk factor for CDI is the disruption of the normally protective gastrointestinal microbiota, typically by antibiotic use. Supplementation with specific probiotics has been effective in preventing various negative outcomes, including antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and CDI. However, a consensus of which probiotic strains might prevent CDI has not been reached and meta-analyses report high degrees of heterogeneity when studies of different probiotic products are pooled together. We searched the literature for probiotics with sufficient evidence to assess clinical efficacy for the prevention of CDI and focused on one specific probiotic formulation comprised of three lactobacilli strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, Lactobacillus casei LBC80R, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CLR2, Bio-K+) for its ability to prevent CDI in healthcare settings. A literature search on this probiotic formulation was conducted using electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar), abstracts from infectious disease and infection control meetings, and communications from the probiotic company. Supporting evidence was found for its mechanisms of action against CDI and that it has an excellent safety and tolerability profile. Evidence from randomized controlled trials and facility-level interventions that administer Bio-K+ show reduced incidence rates of CDI. This probiotic formulation may have a role in primary prevention of healthcare-associated CDI when administered to patients who receive antibiotics."

Background
The index case of Mycobacterium chimaera infection in a patient following open cardiac surgery in the state of Queensland, Australia prompted a centralized coordinated response to mitigate the risk.
Aim
To describe the public health response to M. chimaera contamination of heater-cooler units (HCUs) and patient infection.
Methods
A public health sector strategy was developed with national and international consultation to respond to the threat of HCUs contaminated with M. chimaera. Data linkage of non-tuberculous mycobacterium notifications and selected procedures was undertaken where potential use of HCUs was identified through hospitalization records. Water sampling and testing protocols were standardized. Public disclosure and patient notification were undertaken.
Findings
A single case of disseminated M. chimaera infection in a patient has been diagnosed to date in Queensland, Australia. Ten of 12 (83%) LivaNova Stockert 3T HCUs from five hospitals tested positive for M. chimaera. In total, 5650 patients were notified by post of their potential risk of exposure. Use of the telehealth call centre was modest. M. chimaera was also found in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation heater units produced by two other device manufacturers, four of which tested positive prior to commissioning for use.
Conclusions
Rapid international collaboration optimized the Queensland Health response to potential M. chimaera exposure during cardiac surgery. State-wide collaboration ensured a transparent, consistent approach to contacting patients and informing the public of the potential risk. A framework for ongoing risk management, clinical awareness and laboratory diagnosis was established. No further cases of M. chimaera infection have been identified in Queensland."

Background
Antimicrobial resistance has become an urgent global health priority. Basic hygiene practices and cleaning and disinfection of the hospital environment are key in preventing pathogen cross-transmission.
Aim
To our knowledge no studies have assessed the worldwide differences in cleaning and disinfection practices in healthcare facilities. The electronic survey described here was developed in order to evaluate differences in healthcare facility cleaning practices around the world.
Methods
The International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (ISAC, formerly ISC), Infection Prevention and Control work group developed a survey with 30 multiple-choice questions. The questions were designed to assess the current cleaning practices in healthcare settings around the world.
Findings
A total of 110 healthcare professionals, representing 23 countries, participated in the online survey. In 96% of the facilities a written cleaning policy was present. Training of cleaning staff occurred in 70% of the facilities at the start of employment. Cleaning practices and monitoring of these practices varied.
Conclusions
The survey enabled assessment and recognition of widely differing global practices in approaches to environmental cleaning and disinfection. Development of guideline recommendations for cleaning and disinfection could improve practices and set minimum standards worldwide."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Long-term acute care rehabilitation facilities (LTACRFs) are affected by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in endemic areas. However, the contribution of different subpopulations of patients has not been investigated in these settings.
Aim
To study the epidemiology of CRE in an LTACRF, and the effect of an infection control intervention.
Methods
A surveillance programme was implemented in a large Italian LTACRF. The intervention included screening for CRE carriage at admission and weekly (for negative patients), and enforcement of contact precautions plus cohorting (in wards and rehabilitation areas) for presumed and confirmed carriers. Prevalence and incidence of CRE colonization and the number of CRE bacteraemias were monitored over one year.
Findings
Overall, 1084 patients underwent screening (adherence 89.8%). At admission, 11.6% of patients were colonized, and 9.9% of those negative at admission subsequently became colonized. These percentages were significantly higher among patients with severe brain injuries (SBIs) who were exposed to a higher intensity of care (44.1% vs 8.6% and 63.5% vs 6.8%, respectively). The majority of CRE bacteraemias occurred in the SBI ward. The intervention was associated with a decline in the incidence of CRE colonization in the SBI ward (from 17.7 to 7.2 acquisitions/100 at-risk patient-weeks), but not in other wards. All CRE isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae.
Conclusions
A peculiar CRE epidemiology was observed in a LTACRF from Italy, with very high rates of carriage and cross-transmission in SBI patients. A simplified infection control bundle was effective at reducing the incidence of CRE colonization in the SBI ward."

Escherichia coli bacteraemia reduction targets are challenging but, in West Wales, this was the key infection surrogate measure set by the local health board in 2013, prior to the introduction of a Welsh Government target. The initial plateau of cases was not maintained and prompted this review.
Aim
To review all blood cultures submitted between 2002 and 2016, both positive and negative.
Methods
With access to a microbiology data warehouse in Wales, all blood culture results were collected, extracted to Excel tables and analysed using change point analysis.
Findings
Just under 200,000 blood culture results were examined. This study found an increase in blood culture submissions, but the positivity rate remained constant throughout the period and the increased number of E. coli reflected the increased number of blood cultures taken. This demonstrated the success of sepsis awareness and the use of sepsis bundles for rapid diagnosis and management.
Conclusion
Success in one area (sepsis management) conflicts with ‘failure’ in reducing E. coli bacteraemia. It is argued that targets need to be considered carefully in the light of all available information, which have currently set the National Health Service up to fail."

Background
Hand hygiene compliance among healthcare workers (HCWs) in intensive care units (ICUs) is disconcertingly low.
Aim
To identify the effective intervention(s) for increasing HH compliance among HCWs in adult ICUs.
Methods
Two major electronic databases, OVID Medline and CINAHL, were searched by using a combination of MeSH terms and text words (e.g. hand hygiene, hand washing, compliance, adher*, improve*, develop* and intensive care unit) for relevant articles. This was supplemented by Google Scholar and hand searching of included bibliographies. Data from identified articles were then abstracted, quality-assessed, and combined into a summary effect.
Findings
Of 89 titles and abstracts that were identified, 14 articles were finally included. Overall study quality was good. However, variations in design, setting, sample size, and intervention(s) tested precluded a meta-analysis; hence a narrative synthesis was conducted. The interventions included education, observation, provision of supplies, improving access and directive support; tested singly or in combination; resulted in positive outcomes in all but one study. A combination of administrative support, ‘supplies’, education and training, reminders, surveillance, and performance feedback raised the compliance from a baseline of 51.5% to a record 80.1%; but no set of intervention(s) could improve the compliance to the desired near-100% level.
Conclusion
Available data suggest that multi-modal interventions are effective in raising the compliance to a ‘plateau’ level but not up to the desired standard. Methodologically appropriate trials of combined interventions could enhance the evidence about interventions to improve hand hygiene compliance among ICU staff."

Background
Hand hygiene is a fundamental component of infection prevention, but few studies have examined whether hand-drying method affects the risk of dissemination of potential pathogens.
Aim
To perform a multi-centre, internal-crossover study comparing bacterial contamination levels in washrooms with hand-drying by either paper towels (PT) or jet air dryer (JAD; Dyson).
Methods
A total of 120 sampling sessions occurred over 12 weeks in each of three hospitals (UK, France, Italy). Bacteria were cultured from air, multiple surfaces, and dust. Washroom footfall (patients/visitors/staff) was monitored externally.
Findings
Footfall was nine times higher in UK washrooms. Bacterial contamination was lower in PT versus JAD washrooms; contamination was similar in France and the UK, but markedly lower in Italian washrooms. Total bacterial recovery was significantly greater from JAD versus PT dispenser surfaces at all sites (median: 100–300 vs 0–10 cfu; all P < 0.0001). In the UK and France, significantly more bacteria were recovered from JAD washroom floors (median: 24 vs 191 cfu, P < 0.00001). UK meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus recovery was three times more frequent and six-fold higher for JAD vs PT surfaces (both P < 0.0001). UK meticillin-resistant S. aureus recovery was three times more frequent (21 vs 7 cfu) from JAD versus PT surfaces or floors. Significantly more enterococci and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria were recovered from UK JAD versus PT washroom floors (P < 0.0001). In France, ESBL-producing bacteria were recovered from dust twice as often during JAD versus PT use.

abstract = "Summary
Introduction
Sternal wound infection (SWI) after cardiac surgery is a severe complication. Among preventive measures, pre-operative decolonization of nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus has recently been shown to be beneficial. This quasi-experimental study assessed the effect of decolonization on the incidence of S. aureus-associated SWI based on 19 years of prospective surveillance.
Methods
Segmented negative binomial regression was used to analyse the change over time in the incidence of S. aureus mediastinitis requiring re-operation after cardiac surgery in a French university hospital between 1996 and 2014. Universal nasal decolonization with mupirocin was introduced in December 2001. The association between pre-operative nasal carriage and SWI due to S. aureus was analysed between 2006 and 2012.
Results
Among 17,261 patients who underwent a cardiac surgical procedure, 565 developed SWI (3.3%), which was caused by S. aureus in 181 cases (1%). The incidence of mediastinitis caused by S. aureus decreased significantly over the study period (1.43% in 1996–2001 vs 0.61% and 0.64% in 2002–2005 and 2006–2014, respectively; P<0.001). In segmented analysis, there was a significant break in 2002, corresponding to the introduction of decolonization. Despite this intervention, pre-operative nasal carriage remained a significant risk factor for S. aureus mediastinitis (adjusted odds ratio 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.2–4.2), as were obesity, critical pre-operative status, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and combined surgery with valve replacement and CABG.
Conclusion
Universal nasal decolonization before cardiac surgery was effective in decreasing the incidence of mediastinitis caused by S. aureus. Nasal carriage of S. aureus remained a risk factor for S. aureus-associated SWI."

Background
Octenidine is frequently used for infection prevention in neonatal and burn intensive care units, where Pseudomonas aeruginosa has caused nosocomial outbreaks.
Aim
To investigate the efficacy and impact of using octenidine against P. aeruginosa.
Methods
Seven clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were exposed to increasing concentrations of octenidine over several days. Fitness, minimum bactericidal concentrations after 1 min, 5 min and 24 h, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of a variety of antimicrobials were measured for the parental and octenidine-adapted P. aeruginosa strains. Octenidine and chlorhexidine MICs of a population of P. aeruginosa isolated from a hospital drain trap, exposed to a diluted octenidine formulation four times daily for three months, were also tested.
Findings
Some planktonic cultures of P. aeruginosa survived >50% of the working concentration of an in-use octenidine formulation at the recommended exposure time. Seven strains of P. aeruginosa stably adapted following continuous exposure to increasing concentrations of octenidine. Adaptation increased tolerance to octenidine formulations and chlorhexidine up to 32-fold. In one strain, it also led to increased MICs of antipseudomonal drugs. Subsequent to continuous octenidine exposure of a multi-species community in a simulated clinical setting, up to eight-fold increased tolerance to octenidine and chlorhexidine of P. aeruginosa was also found, which was lost upon removal of octenidine.
Conclusion
Incorrect use of octenidine formulations may lead to inadequate decontamination, and even increased tolerance of P. aeruginosa to octenidine, with resulting cross-resistance to other biocides."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Nosocomial infections place a heavy burden on the healthcare system. However, quantifying the burden raises many questions, ranging from the way to accurately estimate the extra length of stay at hospital to defining and costing the preventive methods among the different care providers.
Aim
To estimate the cost of nosocomial infection by C. difficile to inform the hospital managers.
Methods
Multi-state modelling based on Markov processes and bootstrapping was used to derive individual estimates of the prolongation of stay at hospital associated with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Indicators of cost for hospitals were then computed, including an estimation of the productivity losses derived from diagnosis-related group (DRG)-based payment systems. Patients were aged ≥55 years, admitted in two hospital facilities in Lille, with and without an episode of CDI from January 1st, 2013 to September 15th, 2014.
Findings
A total of 52 episodes were screened during the study period. The estimated mean cost of CDI was approximately €23,909 (SD: 17,458) for an extended length of hospital stay (N = 27). In the case of a reduced length of hospital stay (N = 25), the mean cost was approximately €−14,697 (SD: 16,936), which represents net savings for the hospitals. The main cost/savings driver was the productivity losses/gains resulting from the nosocomial infection. A sensitivity analysis showed that the main factor explaining the amount of costs or savings due to nosocomial infections was the length of the hospital stay.
Conclusion
The notion of productivity gains in the case of deaths as a factor revealing the incompleteness of the payment systems is discussed, followed by the methodological issues associated with the statistical method used to control for temporality bias."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Prevention of legionellosis remains a critical issue in healthcare settings where monochloramine (MC) disinfection was recently introduced as an alternative to chlorine dioxide in controlling Legionella spp. contamination of the hospital water network. Continuous treatments with low MC doses in some instances have induced a viable but non-culturable state (VBNC) of Legionella spp.
Aim
To investigate the occurrence of such dormant cells during a long period of continuous MC treatment.
Methods
Between November 2010 and April 2015, 162 water and biofilm samples were collected and Legionella spp. isolated in accordance with standard procedures. In sampling sites where MC was <1.5mg/L, VBNC cells were investigated by ethidium monoazide bromide (EMA)–real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and ‘resuscitation’ test into Acanthamoeba polyphaga CCAP 1501/18. According to the Health Protection Agency protocol, free-living protozoa were researched in 60 five-litre water samples.
Findings
In all, 136 out of 156 (87.2%) of the samples taken from sites previously positive for L. pneumophila ST269 were negative by culture, but only 47 (34.5%) negative by qPCR. Although no positive results were obtained by EMA-qPCR, four out of 22 samples associated with MC concentration of 1.3 ± 0.5mg/L showed VBNC legionella resuscitation. The presence of the amoeba A. polyphaga in the hospital water network was demonstrated.
Conclusion
Our study is the first report evidencing the emergence of VNBC legionella during a long period of continuous MC treatment of a hospital water network, highlighting the importance of keeping an appropriate and uninterrupted MC dosage to ensure the control of legionella colonization in hospital water supplies."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Acute infectious gastroenteritis requires contact precautions to prevent spread. On acute admission, the cause of diarrhoea is unknown, so the decision regarding which patients to isolate has to be made on clinical information with a risk of inexpedient use of contact precautions.
Aim
To investigate how often gastroenteritis occurs (and therefore how often the need for isolation has to be assessed) in Danish emergency departments, and how often patients have to remain on contact precautions according to the results of faecal samples.
Methods
This Danish register-based retrospective cohort study on adults in Danish emergency departments used three data sources: discharge diagnoses from the Danish National Patient Register; microbiological results from faecal samples provided in the emergency department; and the causes of hospital admission based on the chief complaint.
Findings
Among 66,885 acute admissions, 4.3% of patients had at least one feature of gastroenteritis: admission with diarrhoea as the chief complaint (1.6%); microbiological examination of faecal sample (2.8%); and discharged with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis (1.7%). Nineteen percent of those who had a faecal sample tested were found to have norovirus or Clostridium difficile, and needed to remain on strict contact precautions.
Conclusion
The initiation of contact precautions has to be assessed for 4.3% of all emergency department patients; 19% of the patients who had a faecal sample tested had highly contagious gastroenteritis and required strict contact precautions. Further studies are needed to develop tools to determine which patients to isolate."

Background
Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been reported worldwide and are associated with high mortality rates. Intestinal colonization acts as a reservoir and fosters exchange of resistance mechanisms.
Aim
To investigate the prevalence of patients harbouring CRE on hospital admission, risk factors associated, and the acquisition rate within the emergency department (ED).
Methods
This was a cross-sectional survey with 676 patients consecutively admitted to the ED study during the months of May to July 2016. A questionnaire was performed and rectal swabs were collected from patients on admission, for culture and for multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). If the patient was hospitalized for more than one week in the ED, samples were taken again to determine the acquisition rate of CRE.
Findings
Forty-six patients were colonized; all positive PCR were Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase. The acquisition rate was 18%. Previous exposure to healthcare in the last year, liver disease, and use of antibiotics in the last month were risk factors for colonization. Six patients with no previous exposure to healthcare were CRE-colonized on admission, suggesting transmission of CRE within the community.
Conclusion
Screening of high-risk patients on admission to the ED is a strategy to early identify CRE carriage and may contribute to control CRE dissemination."

Background
An ultraviolet C (UVC) decontamination device that delivers germicidal UVC radiation to the soles of shoes has become available recently.
Aim
To demonstrate that shoe soles can be vectors for healthcare-associated infection, and to investigate if a UVC shoe sole decontamination device would decrease this risk effectively.
Methodology
Three bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli) and a non-toxigenic strain of Clostridium difficile were spiked on to standardized rubber-soled shoe soles and then selected at random for UVC exposure or no UVC exposure. Experiments were performed to test the efficacy of the UVC device to decontaminate shoe soles and flooring. E. faecalis was spiked on to shoes to assess colonization of a simulated healthcare environment and patient.
Results
The UVC device decreased shoe sole contamination significantly for all tested bacterial species, and decreased floor contamination significantly for all floor types and species tested (P<0.01 for all experiments). The log10 reduction was the highest for E. coli (mean±standard deviation 2.6±0.79), followed by E. faecalis (2.19±0.68), S. aureus (1.74±0.88) and C. difficile (0.42±0.54) (P<0.0001 for all analyses). Exposure of shoe soles to the UVC device decreased contamination significantly (mean log10 reduction 2.79±1.25; P<0.0001). Proportions of samples from furniture, bed and patient dummy samples decreased from 96–100% positive in controls to 5–8% positive in UVC device experiments (P<0.0001 for all analyses).

Background
Multidrug-resistant Candida auris infection has been reported from five continents in recent years. The prevalence of C. auris invasive infection has been estimated at 5.3% for intensive-care-acquired candidaemia in India. The transmission of the organism between the patients and from environment to patients is rapid.
Aim
To understand the intra-hospital dynamics of C. auris transmission and to determine the possible interventions to prevent its spread.
Methods
Surveillance of intensive care units was carried out to assess patient colonization, environmental contamination and hand carriage of the yeast among healthcare workers. Interventions including chlorhexidine washing of patients and decontamination of environmental surfaces with stabilized hydrogen peroxide disinfectant (Ecoshield) were undertaken. We further evaluated the effectiveness of frequently used disinfectants in the hospital against C. auris on various inanimate surfaces, and its persistence on hospital fabrics.
Findings
Three cases of C. auris bloodstream infection were detected over a period of three months. Many patients admitted at the same time, in the same area, were colonized by C. auris. Surveillance detected C. auris contamination of environmental surfaces and hands of healthcare workers. Interventions such as chlorhexidine washing and appropriate use of disinfectants could eradicate C. auris from patients and hospital environment.
Conclusion
The frequently used disinfectants in our hospital and current hand hygiene practices were efficient against C. auris if proper contact time and procedures were followed. Evaluation of possible persistence of C. auris on dry fabrics showed that they can persist for up to seven days."

Infections are one of the main reasons for removal of implants from patients, and usually need difficult and expensive treatments. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the most frequently detected pathogens. We reviewed the epidemiology and pathogenesis of implant-related infections. Relevant studies were identified by electronic searching of the following databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Academic Google, and CAPES Journal Portal. This review reports epidemiological studies of implant infections caused by S. aureus and S. epidermidis. We discuss some methodologies used in the search for new compounds with antibiofilm activity and the main strategies for biomaterial surface modifications to avoid bacterial plaque formation and consequent infection. S. aureus and S. epidermidis are frequently involved in infections in catheters and orthopaedic/breast implants. Different methodologies have been used to test the potential antibiofilm properties of compounds; for example, crystal violet dye is widely used for in-vitro biofilm quantification due to its low cost and good reproducibility. Changes in the surface biomaterials are necessary to prevent biofilm formation. Some studies have investigated the immobilization of antibiotics on the surfaces of materials used in implants. Other approaches have been used as a way to avoid the spread of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials, such as the functionalization of these surfaces with silver and natural compounds, as well as the electrical treatment of these substrates."

Background
Approximately 19% of morbidity in peripheral vascular surgery is attributable to wound complications, which can result in delayed healing, and also arterial or graft infection leading to limb loss and even mortality in extreme cases.
Aim
To determine whether groin wound complications were reduced following the routine introduction of PICO negative pressure wound therapy dressings in patients who underwent peripheral vascular surgery.
Methods
Patients who underwent peripheral vascular surgery from 2011 to 2016 were identified and divided into PICO and non-PICO groups. Patient, procedure and wound characteristics were tabulated and analysed. Patients were followed-up for at least six weeks postoperatively. Wound complication rates, infection confirmed by microbiology, and requirement for re-admission due to wound complications were noted. Basic cost analysis was performed.
Findings
In total, 151 patients were analysed (N = 73 PICO, N = 78 non-PICO). No difference in age (P = 0.862), body mass index (P = 0.673), diabetes (P = 0.339), pre-operative albumin (P = 0.196), use of drain (P = 0.343) and history of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (P = 0.281) was observed between groups. The PICO group contained more smokers than the non-PICO group (45% vs 29%, P = 0.034). Wound complications were seen in 8% (N = 6) of the PICO group and 19% (N = 15) of the non-PICO group (P = 0.042). No significant difference in infection was found between the two groups (3% vs 6%, P = 0.249), but fewer seromas were observed when PICO dressings were used (1.4% vs 7.7%, P = 0.069). Haematoma (2.7% vs 3.8%, P = 0.531) and dehiscence rates (1.4% vs 1.3%, P = 0.735) were similar between the two groups.

abstract = "Summary
Background
Nosocomial infections (NIs) impact care and costs in hospitals across the globe. There are few data on targeted surveillance of NI in intensive care units (ICUs), and data specific to the risk factors for NI are especially limited.
Methods
One hundred and seventy-six secondary and tertiary hospitals performed NI targeted surveillance in their ICUs. The data were collected and summarized by Minke software, then fed back once per quarter.
Findings
The incidence of NI appeared to decrease, and the incidence of NI per 1000 patient-days and adjusted incidence were 25.63‰ and 7.41‰ in 2010, and 9.73‰ and 2.76‰ in 2015, respectively. The NI incidence in general hospitals was higher than in specialized hospitals. The incidence of central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) appeared to decrease, and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) decreased markedly from 20.33‰ to 2.76‰. There was no statistically significant difference among ICUs. The six most frequently found pathogen-caused NIs were Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). The isolation rate of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli were carbapenem-resistant AB 80.53%, carbapenem-resistant PA 39.94%, carbapenem-resistant KP (CRKP) 24.86%, and carbapenem-resistant E. coli 9.23%. The isolation rate of meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 66.30%. The increasing trend of CRKP was statistically significant as analysed by the regression model.
Conclusion
The incidences of VAP, CAUTI, and CLABSI were high in ICUs, and multidrug-resistant organisms were the primary pathogens of NI. The implementation of targeted surveillance may determine the risk factors of NI so that effective intervention measures can be taken to reduce the incidence of NI in ICU patients."

Background
The epidemiological landscape of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has changed over the past 30 years.
Aim
To review studies of CDI in the community setting.
Methods
Electronic databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Databases were searched for human studies performed between 2000 and 2017 that assessed the epidemiology, risk factors, ribotypes, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes, and management of community-acquired CDI. In addition, references were searched manually to identify other relevant studies.
Findings
In total, 39 articles met the inclusion criteria. The incidence of community-acquired CDI has almost doubled in the past decade. Approximately half of all cases of CDI are attributed to community origin. Individuals who are younger, female, in the presence of infants, frequently use proton pump inhibitors or specific classes of antibiotics, or live near farms and livestock are at higher risk for community-acquired CDI. Additionally, approximately 40% of all community-acquired cases require hospitalization, where severity has been linked to hypervirulent ribotypes 027 and 078 with poor outcomes. Emerging data on treatment paradigms have led to the revision of clinical guidelines and two potential vaccines in phase three clinical trials. However, ribotype-specific responses to current treatment strategies are lacking.
Conclusion
Community-acquired CDI represents a growing public health threat and burden on healthcare systems. A multi-disciplinary approach will be required to stem the tides."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) screening and contact precautions on patients at high risk for ESBL carriage are considered important infection control measures. Since contact precautions are costly and may negatively impact patient care, rapid exclusion of ESBL carriage and therefore earlier discontinuation of contact precautions are desired.
Aim
In the present study, the performance of an ESBL polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting blaCTX-M genes was evaluated as a screening assay for ESBL carriage.
Methods
Two methods were assessed: PCR performed directly on rectal swabs and PCR on enrichment broth after incubation overnight. The reference standard was culture of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae on selective agar after overnight enrichment and confirmation by the combination disc diffusion method. Microarray was used for discrepancy analysis. A secondary analysis was performed to evaluate the added value of including a blaSHV target in the PCR.
Findings
A total of 551 rectal swabs from 385 patients were included, of which 28 (5%) were ESBL positive in culture. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were 86%, 98%, 67%, and 99%, respectively, for PCR directly on swabs, and 96%, 98%, 75%, and 100%, respectively, for PCR on enrichment broth. Adding a blaSHV target to the assay resulted in a lower PPV without increasing the sensitivity and NPV.
Conclusion
Screening for ESBL by PCR directly on rectal swabs has a high negative predictive value, is up to 48h faster than traditional culture and therefore facilitates earlier discontinuation of contact precautions, thereby improving patient care and saving valuable resources in the hospital."

A registry-based study on notified MRSA infections and colonizations was conducted in Norway between 2006 and 2015. The diversity and abundance of CA- and HA-MRSA spa types were compared using novel ecological diversity measures (Hill numbers).
Findings
During the study period, the monthly notification rate increased 6.9-fold and 1.8-fold among CA- and HA-MRSA, respectively; the increase was steeper among colonizations than infections. In both settings, the distribution of spa types was uneven, with a few dominant spa types and many singletons. The spa-type diversity of CA-MRSA was higher than HA-MRSA in terms of different types (685 vs 481), and increased during the study period. However, the diversity associated with the dominant spa types was similar and remained stable. A high overlap of spa types was estimated between the settings; spa-t002, t019 and t008 were the most common.
Conclusion
The present findings suggest a strong connection between CA- and HA-MRSA epidemiology in Norway. If the fast-growing trend of CA-MRSA continues in the years to come, it may challenge current guidelines and infection control of MRSA in healthcare environments."

Background
Healthcare workers (HCWs) may be the inadvertent interface between the healthcare setting and the community for infectious diseases transmission.
Aim
To investigate HCWs' contacts during a work day and compare these against working adults from the general population.
Methods
Prospective survey of contacts through 24 h self-reported diary in three public sector tertiary care hospitals and community-based working adults in Singapore. Participants were HCWs and working adults from the community.
Findings
In all, 211 HCWs and 1028 working adults reported a total of 4066 and 9206 contacts. HCWs reported more work-related contacts than community-based working adults (median of 13 versus 4), and more contacts that were neither household nor work-related (1 versus 0) but fewer household contacts (2 versus 3). HCWs reported more work-related contacts involving physical contacts, and more new contacts particularly with short duration (≤15 min) compared to community-based working adults. Among different HCW types, doctors reported the highest whereas ward-based nurses reported the lowest total work-related contacts. Around half of ward-based and clinic-based nurses' contacts involved physical touch. Work-related contacts reported by clinic-based nurses, doctors, and assorted HCWs were shorter than in ward-based nurses, with a substantial number effectively occurring with new contacts. Institutional effects significant on univariate analyses were much reduced and non-significant after adjusting for confounding by HCW type.
Conclusion
HCWs' contacts differ substantially from those of community-based working adults. HCWs may thus be at higher risk of acquiring and spreading contact-transmissible and respiratory infections due to the nature of their work. Whereas total number of contacts was fairly similar between HCW types, the characteristics of their contacts differed substantively."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Contaminated handwashing sinks have been identified as reservoirs that can facilitate colonization/infection of patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in intensive care units (ICUs).
Aim
To assess the impact of removing patients' sinks and implementing other water-safe strategies on the annual rates of ICU-acquired MDR-GNB.
Methods
This six-year quasi-experimental study was conducted from January 2011 to December 2016. The intervention was carried out in August 2014 in two adult ICU wards with 12 rooms each. To assess the changes in annual MDR-GNB rates before and after the intervention, we used segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time-series. Crude relative risk (RR) rates were also calculated.
Findings
The incidence rates of MDR-GNB were 9.15 and 2.20 per 1000 patient-days in the pre- and post-intervention periods, respectively. This yielded a crude RR of acquiring MDR-GNB of 0.24 (95% confidence interval: 0.17–0.34). A significant change in level was observed between the MDR-GNB rate at the first point of the post-intervention period and the rate predicted by the pre-intervention time trend.
Conclusion
The implementation of a new water-safe policy, which included the removal of sinks from all patient rooms, successfully improved the control of MDR-GNB spread in an ICU with endemic infection. Our results support the contribution of sink use with the incidence of MDR-GNB in endemic environments."

Background
Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death in the UK.
Aims
To identify the rate of inactive antimicrobial therapy (AMT) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and whether inactive AMT has an effect on in-hospital mortality, ICU mortality, 90-day mortality and length of hospital stay. A further aim was to identify risk factors for receiving inactive AMT.
Methods
This was a retrospective observational study conducted at Glasgow Royal Infirmary ICU between January 2010 and December 2013. In total, 12,000 blood cultures were taken over this time period, of which 127 were deemed clinically significant. Multi-variate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors independently associated with mortality. Univariate analysis followed by multi-variate analysis was performed to identify risk factors for receiving inactive AMT.
Results
The rate of inactive AMT was 47% (N = 60). Multi-variate analysis showed that receiving antibiotics within the first 24h of ICU admission led to reduced mortality [relative risk 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19–2.44]. Furthermore, it showed that severity of illness (as defined by SIRS criteria sepsis vs septic shock) increased mortality [odds ratio (OR) 9.87, 95% CI 1.73–55.5]. However, inactive AMT did not increase mortality (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.47–2.41) or length of hospital stay (53.2 vs 69.1 days, P = 0.348). Fungal bloodstream infection was found to be a risk factor for receiving inactive AMT (OR 5.10, 95% CI 1.29–20.14).
Conclusion
Mortality from sepsis is influenced by multiple factors. This study was unable to demonstrate that inactive AMT had an effect on mortality in sepsis."

Background
Ultraviolet (UV) light decontamination systems are being used increasingly to supplement terminal disinfection of patient rooms. However, efficacy may not be consistent in the presence of soil, especially against Clostridium difficile spores.
Aim
To demonstrate in-use efficacy of two whole-room UV decontamination systems against three hospital pathogens with and without soil.
Methods
For each system, six patient rooms were decontaminated with UV irradiation (enhanced disinfection) following manual terminal cleaning. Total aerobic colony counts of surface contamination were determined by spot-sampling 15 environmental sites before and after terminal disinfection and after UV irradiation. Efficacy against biological indicator coupons (stainless-steel discs) was performed for each system using test bacteria (106 cfu EMRSA-15 variant A, carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae) or spores (105 cfu C. difficile 027), incorporating low soiling [0.03% bovine serum albumin (BSA)], heavy soiling (10% BSA) or synthetic faeces (C. difficile only) placed at five locations in the room.
Findings
UV disinfection eliminated contamination after terminal cleaning in 8/14 (57%) and 11/14 (79%) sites. Both systems demonstrated 4–5 log10 reductions in meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and K. pneumoniae at low soiling. Lower and more variable log10 reductions were achieved when heavy soiling was present. Between 0.1 and 4.8 log10 reductions in C. difficile spores were achieved with low but not heavy soil challenge.
Conclusion
Terminal disinfection should be performed on all surfaces prior to UV decontamination. In-house validation studies should be considered to ensure optimal positioning in each room layout and sufficient cycle duration to eliminate target pathogens."

Background
Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are an important agent of colonization and infection in haematology patients. However, the role of virulence on VRE colonization and infection is controversial.
Aim
To characterize the lineage, virulence and resistance profile of VRE infection and colonization isolates; as well as their impact on outcome of haematology patients using a regression logistic model.
Methods
Eighty-six isolates (80 Enterococcus faecium and six E. faecalis) from 76 patients were evaluated. Polymerase chain reaction for resistance and virulence genes, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and whole genome sequencing of the major clusters, were performed. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to evaluate the role of virulence genes on outcome.
Findings
All isolates harboured the vanA gene. Regarding the virulence genes, 96.5% of isolates were positive for esp, 69.8% for gelE and asa1 genes. VRE infection isolates were more virulent than colonization isolates and harboured more often the gelE gene (P = 0.008). Infections caused by VRE carrying asa1 gene resulted more frequently in death (P = 0.004), but only the predominant clone remained as protector in the multivariate model. The E. faecium strains were assigned to seven STs (ST78, ST412, ST478, ST792, ST896, ST987, ST963) that belonged to CC17. The E. faecalis sequenced belonged to ST9 (CC9).
Conclusion
E. faecium was predominant, and infection isolates were more virulent than colonization isolates and harboured more often the gene gelE. Infections caused by VRE carrying the asa1 gene appeared to be associated with a fatal outcome."

Background
Twenty-five patients, of whom 22 were renal transplant recipients, developed Pneumocystis jirovecii infections at the nephrology department of Reims University Hospital (France) from September 2008 to October 2009, whereas only four sporadic cases had been diagnosed in this department over the 14 previous years.
Aim
This outbreak was investigated by analysing patient encounters and P. jirovecii types.
Methods
A transmission map was drawn up. P. jirovecii typing at DHPS, ITS and mtLSU rRNA sequences was performed in the patients of the cluster (18 patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and seven colonized patients), 10 unlinked control patients (six PCP patients and four colonized patients), as well as 23 other patients diagnosed with P. jirovecii (nine PCP patients and 14 colonized patients) in the same department over a three-year post-epidemic period.
Findings
Eleven encounters between patients harbouring the same types were observed. Three PCP patients and one colonized patient were considered as possible index cases. The most frequent types in the cluster group and the control group were identical. However, their frequency was significantly higher in the first than in the second group (P < 0.01). Identical types were also identified in the post-epidemic group, suggesting a second outbreak due to the same strain, contemporary to a disruption in prevention measures.
Conclusions
These results provide additional data on the role of both PCP and colonized patients as infectious sources. Longitudinal screening of P. jirovecii types in infected patients, including colonized patients, is required in the investigation of the fungus's circulation within hospitals."

Surgical use of 4% chlorhexidine soap (CHX-4) and 10% povidone iodine (PVP-I-10) does not meet the standards defined by EN 12791.
Aim
To investigate the possibility of increasing the immediate and residual effects of these antiseptics.
Methods
Over three consecutive weeks, n-propanol, standard CHX-4 and PVP-I-10 were tested in two experimental groups of volunteers. The new method for applying the antiseptic substances involved standard hand rub and rinse of CHX-4 or PVP-I-10, followed by application of an aqueous solution based on 5% chlorhexidine or PVP-I-10 with no further rinsing of the hands prior to donning gloves. Samples were taken to assess immediate and residual effects, analysing the logarithmic reduction of colony-forming units.
Findings
At t=0 h, n-propanol was superior in bactericidal effect to standard CHX-4 (P<0.05), but the new chlorhexidine protocol was superior to both standard CHX-4 (P<0.01) and n-propanol (P<0.05); the same effect was observed at t=3 h (residual effect). At t=0 h, n-propanol was significantly superior to standard PVP-I-10, but the new PVP-I-10 protocol was superior, although not significantly, to n-propanol. There was no significant residual effect at t=3 h.
Conclusion
The new protocol for chlorhexidine application permits surgical hand preparation with chlorhexidine, as a safe alternative to alcohol solutions, because it meets the standards defined by EN 12791."

Background
The prevalence of nasopharyngeal colonization with Staphylococcus aureus can reach 20–30% among the population, which can lead to invasive infection.
Aim
To investigate the prevalence of colonization among different age groups, and analyse S. aureus strain-specific virulence patterns.
Method
For analysis of the prevalence of colonization, groups consisting of newborns, healthy volunteers aged 5–60 years, and nursing home residents aged >80 years were examined with nasopharyngeal swabs. After S. aureus was cultured, genetic analysis and phenotypic virulence testing were performed by cell-based assays.
Findings
Among 924 volunteers, the overall colonization rate was approximately 30%, with a peak in subjects aged 5–10 years (49%). Neonates and subjects aged >80 years showed different distributions of clonal clusters. Overall, the strains of all age groups exhibited virulence characteristics that can contribute to the development of infection. In particular, the neonatal strains exhibited a high incidence of toxin genes that resulted in increased cytotoxic effects compared with the other strains tested.
Conclusions
Colonizing strains showed a virulence profile in all age groups, which may lead to the establishment of invasive infection. Consequently, decolonization measures could be considered for selected patients depending on the risk of infection."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A growing number of Mycobacterium chimaera infections after cardiosurgery have been reported by several countries. These potentially fatal infections were traced back to contaminated heater–cooler devices (HCDs), which use water as a heat transfer medium. Aerosolization of water contaminated with M. chimaera from HCDs enables airborne transmission to patients undergoing open chest surgery. Infection control teams test HCD water samples for mycobacterial growth to guide preventive measures. The detection limit of M. chimaera in water samples, however, has not previously been investigated.
Aim
To determine the detection limit of M. chimaera in water samples using laboratory-based serial dilution tests.
Methods
An M. chimaera strain representative of the international cardiosurgery-associated M. chimaera outbreak was used to generate a logarithmic dilution series. Two different water volumes, 50 and 1000mL, were inoculated, and, after identical processing (centrifugation, decantation, and decontamination), seeded on mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) and Middlebrook 7H11 solid media.
Findings
MGIT consistently showed a lower detection limit than 7H11 solid media, corresponding to a detection limit of ≥1.44 × 104cfu/mL for 50mL and ≥2.4cfu/mL for 1000mL water samples. Solid media failed to detect M. chimaera in 50mL water samples.
Conclusion
Depending on water volume and culture method, major differences exist in the detection limit of M. chimaera. In terms of sensitivity, 1000mL water samples in MGIT media performed best. Our results have important implications for infection prevention and control strategies in mitigation of the M. chimaera outbreak and healthcare water safety in general."

Background
Antimicrobial stewardship programmes are considered essential for optimizing antimicrobial use in order to improve patient outcomes, reduce the number of adverse sequelae, prevent resistance, and ensure cost-effective therapy.
Aim
To assess the efficacy and the limitations of antifungal antimicrobial stewardship programmes.
Methods
A bundle to manage infectious diseases was implemented in our hospital in October 2010. Data regarding antimicrobial use density (AUD) from April 2006 to May 2016 were collected. Trends in AUD were assessed using an interrupted time-series model for three separate periods: the pre-bundle, the bundle implementation, and the long-term follow-up periods. The primary and secondary outcomes were AUD (defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 patient-days) of intravenous antifungals and expenditure on antifungals per fiscal year, respectively.
Findings
The AUD for all intravenous antifungals decreased from 26.1 in 2006 to 9.9 in 2015. Whereas the change in the trend during the pre-bundle period was not significant (slope: 0.062; 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.180 to 0.305), a significant decrease was observed in the bundle implementation period (slope: −0.535; 95% CI: −0.907 to −0.164). The trend slowed during the long-term follow-up period (slope: −0.040; 95% CI: −0.218 to 0.138).

Background
Intracameral cefuroxime as prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis (POE) following cataract surgery was introduced in 1996 at St Erik Eye Hospital. Soon after the introduction of intracameral cefuroxime, the rate of POE fell dramatically and a shift in the aetiology was noticed.
Aim
To analyse bacteriology and susceptibility to cefuroxime before and after the introduction of intracameral cefuroxime.
Methods
All culture-proven cases of endophthalmitis at St Erik Eye Hospital after cataract surgery performed over a 20-year period were included in a retrospective observational study.
Findings
Sixty-two cases of endophthalmitis occurred in 34,390 (0.18%) cataract surgeries before the introduction of intracameral cefuroxime (Period 1), while 33 cases occurred in 75,144 (0.044%) operations after the introduction of intracameral cefuroxime (Period 2), showing a significant difference between the periods (P < 0.001). The incidence of coagulase-negative staphylococci (1/1400 vs 1/15,000; P < 0.001), Staphylococcus aureus (1/2000 vs 1/30,000; P < 0.001), streptococci other than enterococci (1/2500 vs 1/25,000; P < 0.001) and Propionibacterium acnes (1/16,000 vs 0/75,000; P = 0.04) fell sharply in Period 2. Cefuroxime-sensitive strains became less frequent in Period 2 (P < 0.001). Enterococci became the predominant species, albeit not significantly (P = 0.13), whereas the rate of cefuroxime-resistant strains almost reached significance (P = 0.05) in Period 2.
Conclusions
Intracameral cefuroxime leads to a reduction of the rate of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery, and brings about a shift in pathogens from cefuroxime-sensitive to cefuroxime-resistant organisms."

Background
Infection may complicate surgical patients' hospital admission. The effect of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) on processes of care among surgical patients who died is unknown.
Aim
To investigate the effect of HAIs on processes of care in surgical patients who died in hospital.
Methods
Surgeon-recorded infection data extracted from a national Australian surgical mortality audit (2012–2016) were grouped into HAIs and no infection. The audit included all-age surgical patients, who died in hospital. Not all patients had surgery. Excluded from analysis were patients with community-acquired infection and those with missing timing of infection. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the adjusted effects of HAIs on the processes of care in these patients. Costs associated with HAIs were estimated.
Findings
One-fifth of surgical patients who died did so with an HAI (2242 out of 11,681; 19.2%). HAI patients had increased processes of care compared to those who died without infection: postoperative complications [51.0% vs 30.3%; adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.20; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.98–2.45; P < 0.001]; unplanned reoperations (22.6% vs 10.9%; aOR: 2.38; 95% CI: 2.09–2.71; P < 0.001) and unplanned intensive care unit admission (29.3% vs 14.8%; aOR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.94–2.45; P < 0.001). HAI patients had longer hospital admissions and greater hospital costs than those without infection.
Conclusion
HAIs were associated with increased processes of care and costs in surgical patients who died; these outcomes need to be investigated in surgical patients who survive."

Background
Influenza A(H1N1) causes serious complications in immunocompromised patients. The efficacy of seasonal vaccination in these patients has been questioned.
Aim
To describe two outbreaks of influenza A(H1N1) in immunocompromised patients.
Methods
Two outbreaks of influenza A(H1N1) occurred in our institution: on the kidney transplant ward in 2014 including patients early after kidney or simultaneous pancreas–kidney transplantation, and on the oncology ward in 2016 including patients receiving chemotherapy for malignant tumours. Factors leading to these outbreaks and the clinical efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccination were analysed.
Findings
Altogether 86 patients were exposed to influenza A(H1N1) during the outbreaks, among whom the seasonal influenza vaccination status was unknown in 10. Only three out of 38 vaccinated patients were infected with influenza A(H1N1), compared with 20 out of 38 unvaccinated patients (P = 0.02). The death of one out of 38 vaccinated patients was associated with influenza, compared with seven out of 38 unvaccinated patients (P = 0.06). Shared factors behind the two outbreaks included outdated facilities not designed for the treatment of immunosuppressed patients. Vaccination coverage among patients was low, between 40% and 70% despite vaccination being offered to all patients free of charge. Vaccination coverage of healthcare workers on the transplant ward was low (46%), but, despite high coverage on the oncology ward (92%), the outbreak occurred.
Conclusion
Seasonal influenza vaccination was clinically effective with both a reduced risk of influenza infection and a trend towards reduced mortality in these immunocompromised patients. Several possible causes were identified behind these two outbreaks, requiring continuous awareness in healthcare professionals to prevent further outbreaks."

Background
Approximately 20–50% of antimicrobial therapy in hospitalized patients is considered inappropriate, which may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The best method for evaluation of appropriateness is not well defined.
Aim
To evaluate the rate of appropriate antimicrobial therapy in a secondary hospital using three different methods, and determine the rate of agreement between the different methods.
Methods
A point prevalence study included all adult hospitalized patients receiving systemic antimicrobial therapy during 2016, screened on a single day. Clinical, laboratory and therapeutic data were collected from patient files, and appropriateness was rated with a qualitative evaluation by expert opinion. In addition, a quantitative evaluation was performed according to 11 quality indicators (QIs) rated for each patient. A strict definition of appropriateness was fulfilled if six essential QIs were met, and a lenient definition was fulfilled if at least five QIs were met. Agreement between methods was analysed using kappa statistic.
Findings
Among 106 patients included, rates of appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy ranged from 20% to 75%, depending on the method of evaluation. Very low agreement was found between the strict definition and expert opinion (kappa=0.068), and medium agreement was found between the lenient definition and expert opinion (kappa=0.45).
Conclusions
Rates of appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy varied between evaluation methods, with low to moderate agreement between the different methods."

Background
Length of stay (LOS) in hospital is an important component of describing how costs change in relation to healthcare-associated infection and this variable underpins models used to evaluate cost. It this therefore imperative that estimations of LOS associated with infections are performed accurately.
Aim
To test the relationships between the size of hospital, age, and patient comorbidity on days from admission to infection and days from infection to discharge in patients with a healthcare-associated urinary tract infection (HAUTI), using structural equation modelling (SEM).
Methods
A non-current cohort study in eight hospitals in New South Wales, Australia. All patients admitted to the hospital for >48 h and who acquired a HAUTI were included.
Findings
From the 162,503 eligible patient admissions, 2821 (1.73%) acquired a HAUTI. SEM showed that the proposed model had acceptable fit indices for the combined sample (GFI = 1.00; AGFI = 1.00; NFI = 1.00; CFI = 1.00; RMSEA = 0.000). The main findings showed that age of patient had a direct association with days from admission to infection and with days from infection to discharge. Patient comorbidity had direct links to the variables days from admission to infection and days from infection to discharge. Multi-group analysis indicated that the age of male patients was more influential on the factor days from admission to infection when compared to female patients. Furthermore, the number of comorbidities was significantly more influential on days from admission to infection in male patients than in female patients.
Conclusion
As the first published study to use SEM to explore a healthcare-associated infection and the predictors of days from infection to discharge in hospital, we can confirm that accounting for the timing of infection during hospitalization is important and that patient comorbidity influences the timing of infection."

Background
Rapid detection of AmpC-producing strains of Gram-negative bacteria is beneficial for patient care. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a novel method that has demonstrated the resistance of a strain to β-lactam antibiotics by determining the molecular structure of an antibiotic and its degradation products.
Aim
To study the detection of AmpC-producing Gram-negative bacteria by MALDI-TOF MS and to determine whether the method can be used in clinical practice.
Methods
A total of 105 strains were detected by determining their phenotypes and sequence analysis. Sixty-nine well-characterized AmpC-producing and 36 non-AmpC-producing strains were studied. The bacteria were incubated in different reaction buffer solutions (10 mM NH4HCO3/0.005% sodium dodecyl sulphate at pH 8.0) containing cefotaxime (0.50 mg/mL), ceftazidime (0.25 mg/mL), ceftriaxone (0.50 mg/mL), cefepime (0.50 mg/mL), and cefoxitin (0.25 and 0.50 mg/mL), respectively. The mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 2 min, and the supernatant analysed by MALDI-TOF MS after incubation for 30, 60, 90, 120, and 240 min. Antibiotic hydrolysed and decarboxylated peaks were identified.
Findings
When incubated for 90 min, hydrolysed cefotaxime formed peaks at 434 and 494 Da, and the sensitivity and specificity for detection of AmpC-producing strains were 85.5% (59/69) and 88.9% (32/36). When incubated for 4 h, hydrolysed ceftazidime formed peaks at 563 and 587 Da, and the sensitivity and specificity were 89.9% (62/69) and 94.5% (34/36), respectively. For hydrolysed ceftriaxone (0.5 mg/mL), cefepime (0.5 mg/mL) and two concentrations of cefoxitin (0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL), no peaks amenable to analysis were identified.
Conclusion
This study demonstrated that MALDI-TOF MS can rapidly detect AmpC-producing strains."

Background
Healthcare-associated infections in neonatal and paediatric populations are associated with poorer outcomes and healthcare costs, and surveillance is a necessary component of prevention programmes.
Aim
To evaluate burden of illness, aetiology, and time-trends for central and peripheral line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI and PLABSI) in Australian neonatal and paediatric intensive care units (ICUs) between July 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2016.
Methods
Using National Healthcare Safety Network methods, surveillance in neonatal and paediatric units was performed by hospitals participating in the Victorian Healthcare Associated Infection Surveillance System. Mixed effects Poisson regression was used to model infections over time.
Findings
Overall, 82 paediatric CLABSI events were reported during 37,125 CVC-days (2.21 per 1000 CVC-days), 203 neonatal CLABSI events were reported during 92,169 CVC-days (2.20 per 1000 CVC-days), and 95 neonatal PLABSI events were reported during 142,240 peripheral line-days (0.67 per 1000 peripheral line-days). Over time, a significant decrease in quarterly risk for neonatal CLABSI events was observed (risk ratio (RR): 0.98; 95% confidence interval: 0.97–0.99; P = 0.023) and this reduction was significant for the 751–1000 g birth weight cohort (RR: 0.97; P = 0.015). Most frequently, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (24.2%) and Staphylococcus aureus (16.1%) were responsible for CLABSI events. A significant reduction in Gram-negative neonatal infections was observed (annual RR: 0.85; P < 0.001).
Conclusion
CLABSI rates in neonatal and paediatric ICUs in our region are low, and neonatal infections have significantly diminished over time. Evaluation of infection prevention programmes is required to determine whether specific strategies can be implemented to further reduce infection risk."

abstract = "Summary
Aim
To evaluate three types of ventilation systems for operating rooms with respect to air cleanliness [in colony-forming units (cfu/m3)], energy consumption and comfort of working environment (noise and draught) as reported by surgical team members.
Methods
Two commonly used ventilation systems, vertical laminar airflow (LAF) and turbulent mixed airflow (TMA), were compared with a newly developed ventilation technique, temperature-controlled airflow (TcAF). The cfu concentrations were measured at three locations in an operating room during 45 orthopaedic procedures: close to the wound (<40cm), at the instrument table and peripherally in the room. The operating team evaluated the comfort of the working environment by answering a questionnaire.
Findings
LAF and TcAF, but not TMA, resulted in less than 10cfu/m3 at all measurement locations in the room during surgery. Median values of cfu/m3 close to the wound (250 samples) were 0 for LAF, 1 for TcAF and 10 for TMA. Peripherally in the room, the cfu concentrations were lowest for TcAF. The cfu concentrations did not scale proportionally with airflow rates. Compared with LAF, the power consumption of TcAF was 28% lower and there was significantly less disturbance from noise and draught.
Conclusion
TcAF and LAF remove bacteria more efficiently from the air than TMA, especially close to the wound and at the instrument table. Like LAF, the new TcAF ventilation system maintained very low levels of cfu in the air, but TcAF used substantially less energy and provided a more comfortable working environment than LAF. This enables energy savings with preserved air quality."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Postneurosurgical ventriculitis is mainly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. The rate of linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (LRSE) is increasing worldwide.
Aims
To report clinical, epidemiological and microbiological data from a series of ventriculitis cases caused by LRSE in a Spanish hospital between 2013 and 2016.
Methods
Cases of LRSE ventriculitis were reviewed retrospectively in a Spanish hospital over a four-year period. Clinical/epidemiological data of the infected patients were reviewed, the isolates involved were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing, and the molecular bases of linezolid resistance were determined.
Findings
Five cases of LRSE ventriculitis were detected. The patients suffered from cerebral haemorrhage or head trauma that required the placement of an external ventricular drain; spent a relatively long time in the intensive care unit (ICU) (10–26 days); and three out of the five patients had previously been treated with linezolid. All LRSE had the same PFGE pattern, belonged to ST2, and shared an identical mechanism of linezolid resistance. Specifically, all had the G2576T mutation in the V domain of each of the six copies of the 23S rRNA gene, together with the Q136L and M156T mutations and the 71GGR72 insertion in the L3 and L4 ribosomal proteins, respectively.
Conclusion
The high ratio of linezolid consumption in the ICU (7.72–8.10 defined daily dose/100 patient-days) could have selected this resistant clone, which has probably become endemic in the ICU where it could have colonized admitted patients. Infection control and antimicrobial stewardship interventions are essential to prevent the dissemination of this difficult-to-treat pathogen, and to preserve the therapeutic efficacy of linezolid."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Preterm infants are at high risk for extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) sepsis and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) outbreaks. Maternal colonization with ESBL-E may be precursory to mother-to-child transmission. However, there is no consensus regarding surveillance of pregnant women for ESBL-E colonization.
Aim
To identify pairs of mothers and infants harbouring same-strain ESBL-E colonization and to determine whether maternal transmission may play a role in increasing ESBL-E carriage in preterm infants.
Methods
This was a one-year analysis from an ongoing, prospective ESBL-E surveillance of mothers of premature infants and their offspring. Mother–infant pairs colonized with the same bacteria underwent strain analysis using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Clinical parameters were collected from the hospital computerized records.
Findings
Between January 2015 and January 2016, 313/409 (76.5%) mothers and all 478 (100%) infants were screened for ESBL-E colonization; carriage rates were 21.5% and 14.8%, respectively. Four (5.6%) colonized infants developed late-onset sepsis and two (2.8%) died. Twenty-five mother–infant pairs colonized with the same bacterial strain were identified; a subgroup of 10 pairs of isolates underwent PFGE, and 70% displayed an identical PFGE fingerprint. No similarities were found between isolates recovered from unrelated neonates and mothers. ESBL-E colonization was found significantly earlier in infants of mothers colonized at birth (P<0.001) compared with infants of non-colonized mothers.
Conclusions
ESBL-E carriage rates in mothers and NICU infants with non-negligible maternal–neonatal ESBL-E transmission in the study region indicate that maternal colonization surveillance and/or further infection control interventions should be considered."

abstract = "Summary
Objectives
Differential time to positivity of cultures of blood drawn simultaneously from central venous catheter and peripheral sites is widely used to diagnose catheter-related bloodstream infections without removing the catheter. However, the accuracy of this technique for some pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, is debated in routine practice.
Methods
In a 320-bed reference cancer centre, the charts of patients with at least one blood culture positive for S. aureus among paired blood cultures drawn over a six-year period were studied retrospectively. Microbiological data were extracted from the prospectively compiled database of the microbiology unit. Data concerning the 149 patients included were reviewed retrospectively by independent physicians blinded to the absolute and differential times to positivity, in order to establish or refute the diagnosis of catheter-related sepsis. Due to missing data, 48 charts were excluded, so 101 cases were actually analysed. The diagnosis was established in 62 cases, refuted in 15 cases and inconclusive in the remaining 24 cases.
Results
For the 64 patients with both central and peripheral positive blood cultures, the differential positivity time was significantly greater for patients with catheter-related bloodstream infections due to S. aureus (P<0.02). However, because of the high number of false-negative cases, the classic cut-off limit of 120 min showed 100% specificity but only 42% sensitivity for the diagnosis of catheter-related bloodstream infection due to S. aureus.
Conclusions
These results strongly suggest that despite its high specificity, the differential time to positivity may not be reliable to rule out catheter-related bloodstream infection due to S. aureus."

Background
Vascular catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are highly preventable hospital-acquired infections and a major threat to patient safety. While there is significant information regarding CRBSI outcome among intensive care unit (ICU) patients, data regarding non-ICU patients are scarce.
Aim
To determine the risk factors associated with 30-day mortality among non-ICU patients with nosocomial CRBSIs.
Methods
Prospective cohort study of non-ICU patients with nosocomial CRBSIs in a tertiary care centre between January 2004 and December 2014. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, defined as death from any cause within 30 days of CRBSI. Follow-up was performed 30 days after CRBSI onset. Time until death was the dependent variable in Cox regression analysis.
Findings
In total, 546 cases of CRBSI were identified. The mean age of patients was 64.5 years [interquartile range (IQR) 55–75 years], 66% were male, and the mean Charlson score was 3.59 (IQR 2–5). Of the 546 cases, 58.4% resulted from central venous catheters and 41.6% from peripheral venous catheters. The causative agents were Gram-positive cocci (70.1% of cases), Gram-negative bacilli (31.1%) and Candida spp. (1%). Mortality within 30 days was 13.9%, with no significant changes over the study period. Independent risk factors for 30-day mortality were Charlson score ≥4 [hazard ratio (HR) 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19–2.73], Staphylococcus aureus infection (HR 2.67, 95% CI 1.61–4.43) and Candida spp. infection (HR 6.1, 95% CI 2.08–18.04). Age; area of admission; type, use and site of vascular catheter; and administration of appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment were not independent risk factors for 30-day mortality.
Conclusion
Nosocomial CRBSIs outside ICUs are associated with high risk of mortality, particularly among patients with a higher Charlson score and bloodstream infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp."

abstract = "Summary
The spread of infections in healthcare environments is a persistent and growing problem in most countries, aggravated by the development of microbial resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants. In addition to indwelling medical devices (e.g. implants, catheters), such infections may also result from adhesion of microbes either to external solid–water interfaces such as shower caps, taps, drains, etc., or to external solid–gas interfaces such as door handles, clothes, curtains, computer keyboards, etc. The latter are the main focus of the present work, where an overview of antimicrobial coatings for such applications is presented. This review addresses well-established and novel methodologies, including chemical and physical functional modification of surfaces to reduce microbial contamination, as well as the potential risks associated with the implementation of such anticontamination measures. Different chemistry-based approaches are discussed, for instance anti-adhesive surfaces (e.g. superhydrophobic, zwitterions), contact-killing surfaces (e.g. polymer brushes, phages), and biocide-releasing surfaces (e.g. triggered release, quorum sensing-based systems). The review also assesses the impact of topographical modifications at distinct dimensions (micrometre and nanometre orders of magnitude) and the importance of applying safe-by-design criteria (e.g. toxicity, contribution for unwanted acquisition of antimicrobial resistance, long-term stability) when developing and implementing antimicrobial surfaces."

abstract = "Summary
Attention has recently been directed toward a plausible link between Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). However, the results of studies on the association between CDI and PPI remain controversial. We searched the literature databases from their inception to December 2016, without restriction of language, including all controlled observational studies examining the association between acid-suppressive therapy and CDI. Pooled analysis of 50 studies showed a significant association between PPI use and risk of developing CDI (odds ratio: 1.26; 95% confidence interval: 1.12–1.39) as compared with non-users. When stratified by study patients, the relative risk of hospital-acquired CDI and community-associated CDI were 1.29 (1.14–1.44) and 1.17 (0.74–1.59). After restricting the studies according to hospital department, the relative risks of hospital-acquired CDI in ICUs and general wards were 1.43 (0.74–2.11) and 1.29 (1.13–1.45). By implementing cumulative meta-analysis, it was clear that earlier trials of CDI conducted in the early 2000s demonstrated a high degree of heterogeneity and a high percentage of negative results. Since 2011, the overall association between PPI use and risk of developing CDI has remained relatively stable within an effect size between OR 1.20 and 1.26. Our findings indicate a significant associated risk of incident CDI among PPI users, especially in general ward patients. The totality of evidence, when using cumulative meta-analysis, showed that further trials are unlikely to overturn this positive result. Therefore establishing a guideline for the use of PPIs may help in future with the control of CDI."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Successful laboratory detection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in patient surveillance samples is a diagnostic challenge. In the absence of a reference standard for screening rectal swabs for CPE, many phenotypic, genotypic, culture- and non-culture-based assays have been proposed for identifying these bacteria.
Aim
To develop and optimize a CPE screening protocol capable of identifying all frequently encountered CPE, including those producing OXA-48-like carbapenemases.
Methods
Faropenem susceptibility testing was performed on 507 presumptive CPE isolated from diagnostic samples and CPE rectal screens between March and August 2016. Results from this CPE screening method were compared to those from direct culture on mSuperCARBA™, temocillin enrichment culture, and use of an antibiotic resistance algorithm, to determine the optimal method to employ in the detection of CPE.
Findings
Faropenem was a poor predictor of carbapenemase production (58% true positives). The combination of a temocillin enrichment stage and interpretive reading of antibiotic resistance phenotypes improved the recovery and identification of CPE significantly (91% true positives), especially for OXA-48 producers (P = 0.03).
Conclusion
The combination of temocillin enrichment, a selective chromogenic medium, and an antibiotic resistance-based algorithm significantly improved the detection of all CPE recovered from routine and targeted surveillance samples."

Background
Several reports have been published regarding cost increases attributable to surgical site infections (SSIs) in Europe and the USA. However, such studies have been limited in Japan.
Aim
To evaluate the economic burden of colorectal SSIs on hospitals in Japan.
Methods
This study was undertaken at a Japanese university hospital. Amongst 265 patients who had undergone colorectal surgery in the Department of Coloproctological Surgery between November 2014 and March 2016, 16 patients who developed SSIs and could be allocated a diagnosis procedure combination code were selected as SSI cases. Individual SSI cases were matched to non-SSI cases based on a combination of surgical category, age band, sex, wound class, presence of stoma and risk index. Median length of stay (LOS) and piecework reference cost were compared between SSI episodes and non-SSI episodes.
Findings
The median LOS for patients with SSI and without SSI was 25.5 [interquartile range (IQR) 21.5–39.3] and 16.5 (IQR 12.5–18.5) days, respectively (P<0.01). The median piecework reference cost for patients with SSI and without SSI was ¥842,155 (IQR ¥716,423–1,388,968) and ¥575,795 (IQR ¥529,638–680,105), respectively (P<0.01).
Conclusion
SSIs led to a significant increase in LOS and economic burden. Although the SSI episodes appear to be more profitable than the non-SSI episodes, the economic profit for SSI episodes was less than that for non-SSI episodes in the observation period, when opportunity costs were taken into account."

Background
The costs and laboratory workload arising from meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screening could be reduced markedly by processing nose, throat and skin swabs from one person in a single culture broth (specimen pooling). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivities and times for MRSA detection using a variety of approaches to processing of individual and pooled swabs.
Methods
Four hundred and seventeen swabs from 139 subjects with a history of MRSA colonization (three swabs per subject – nose, throat and skin) were submitted. Swabs were suspended in 200-μL sterile saline, and these suspensions were used individually and as pooled samples to inoculate two different chromogenic media [MRSA SMART (bioMėrieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, Paris, France) and CHROMagar MRSA (CHROMagar, Paris, France)] and Todd-Hewitt Broth; the latter cultures were then subcultured on to the same chromogenic media.
Results
MRSA was detected from at least one specimen in 75 subjects (50.4%). The diagnostic sensitivities of pooled surveillance cultures compared with single cultures were 97% and 93% for direct and enrichment cultures, respectively. Enrichment culture of either individual or pooled samples had no benefit compared with direct culture (P>0.05).
Conclusions
Pooling of MRSA screening swabs for either direct culture on chromogenic agar or enrichment culture is suitable for routine use."

Background
Mupirocin is used specifically for the eradication of nasal meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but increasing mupirocin resistance restricts its repeated use. The antibacterial effects of manuka honey have been established in vitro; antibacterial activity of other honeys has also been reported.
Aim
To describe the learning experience from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the efficacy of medical-grade honey (MGH) with mupirocin 2% for the eradication of nasal MRSA.
Methods
Patients colonized in the nose with MRSA and age ≥18 years were recruited. Participants received either one or two courses of MGH or mupirocin 2%, three times per day for five consecutive days.
Findings
The proportion of patients who were decolonized after one or two courses of treatment was not significantly different between MGH [18/42; 42.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 27.7–59.0] and mupirocin 2% (25/44; 56.8%; 95% CI: 41.0–71.7). Non-nasal MRSA colonization was significantly associated with persistent nasal colonization (odds ratio: 5.186; 95% CI: 1.736–5.489; P = 0.003). The rate of new acquisition of mupirocin resistance was 9.75%.
Conclusion
Although not significant, a decolonization rate of 42.8% for MGH was impressive. Our findings suggest that this strategy, which has the potential to combat antimicrobial resistance, should be assessed in similar but larger studies."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Much attention has focused on hand decontamination for healthcare workers, but little attention has been paid to patient hand hygiene. Patients confined to bed are often unable to access handwashing facilities. They could use an alcohol hand rub, but these are not advised for soiled hands or social hand hygiene. One alternative is the use of a hand wipe. However, it is important to ascertain the effectiveness of hand wipes for removal of transient micro-organisms from the hands.
Aim
To develop a method to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of hand wipes compared with handwashing, and thus determine if a hand wipe can be acceptable for patient hand hygiene.
Methods
The methodology was based on European Standards EN 1499 (2013) and EN 1500 (2013) as there is no standard for hand wipes. The hands of 20 healthy volunteers were contaminated artificially by immersion in Escherichia coli, and then sampled before and after the use of a reference soft soap or hand wipes for 60 s. The counts obtained were expressed as log10, and the log10 reductions were calculated.
Findings
The hand wipe with no antimicrobial agent (control wipe) was inferior to the soft soap. However, the antimicrobial hand wipe was statistically non-inferior to the soft soap. A log10 reduction of 3.54 was obtained for the soft soap, 2.46 for the control hand wipe, and 3.67 for the antimicrobial hand wipe.
Conclusion
The evidence suggests that the antimicrobial hand wipe, when applied for 60 s, is at least as good as soap and water, representing an acceptable alternative to handwashing from a bactericidal perspective."

Ethanol is used worldwide in healthcare facilities for hand rubbing. It has been reported to have a stronger and broader virucidal activity compared with propanols. The aim of this review was to describe the spectrum of virucidal activity of ethanol in solution or as commercially available products. A systematic search was conducted. Studies were selected when they contained original data on reduction of viral infectivity from suspension tests (49 studies) and contaminated hands (17 studies). Ethanol at 80% was highly effective against all 21 tested, enveloped viruses within 30 s. Murine norovirus and adenovirus type 5 are usually inactivated by ethanol between 70% and 90% in 30 s whereas poliovirus type 1 was often found to be too resistant except for ethanol at 95% (all test viruses of EN 14476). Ethanol at 80% is unlikely to be sufficiently effective against poliovirus, calicivirus (FCV), polyomavirus, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). The spectrum of virucidal activity of ethanol at 95%, however, covers the majority of clinically relevant viruses. Additional acids can substantially improve the virucidal activity of ethanol at lower concentrations against, e.g. poliovirus, FCV, polyomavirus and FMDV although selected viruses such as HAV may still be too resistant. The selection of a suitable virucidal hand rub should be based on the viruses most prevalent in a unit and on the user acceptability of the product under frequent-use conditions."

Background
Effective countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases require an understanding of transmission rate and basic reproduction number (R0). R0 for severe acute respiratory syndrome is generally considered to be >1, whereas that for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is considered to be <1. However, this does not explain the large-scale outbreaks of MERS that occurred in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and South Korean hospitals. Aim: To estimate R0 in nosocomial outbreaks of MERS.
Methods
R0 was estimated using the incidence decay with an exponential adjustment model. The KSA and Korean outbreaks were compared using a line listing of MERS cases compiled using publicly available sources. Serial intervals to estimate R0 were assumed to be six to eight days. Study parameters [R0 and countermeasures (d)] were estimated by fitting a model to the cumulative incidence epidemic curves using Matlab.
Findings
The estimated R0 in Korea was 3.9 in the best-fit model, with a serial interval of six days. The first outbreak cluster in a hospital in Pyeongtaek had an R0 of 4.04, and the largest outbreak cluster in a hospital in Samsung had an R0 of 5.0. Assuming a six-day serial interval, the KSA outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh had R0 values of 3.9 and 1.9, respectively.
Conclusion
R0 for the nosocomial MERS outbreaks in KSA and South Korea was estimated to be in the range of 2–5, which is significantly higher than the previous estimate of <1. Therefore, more comprehensive countermeasures are needed to address these infections."

Objective
The global burden of invasive fungal disease is increasing. Candida albicans remains the leading cause of fungal bloodstream infections, although non-albicans candidal infections are emerging. Areas of controversy regarding diagnosis and management are hampering our ability to respond effectively to this evolving threat. The purpose of this narrative review is to address current controversies and provide recommendations to supplement guidelines.
Diagnosis of invasive candidiasis
Diagnosis of invasive candidiasis requires a combination of diagnostic tests and patient risk factors. Beta-D glucan and Candida albicans germ tube antibody are both used as biomarkers as adjuncts to diagnosis, although direct culture remains the gold standard. Scoring systems are available to help distinguish between colonization and invasive disease.
Treatment of invasive candidiasis
Echinocandins are recommended as first-line therapy in candidaemia, with de-escalation to fluconazole when clinical stability is achieved. Empirical therapy is highly recommended in high-risk patients, but a more targeted pre-emptive approach is now being favoured. The evidence for prophylactic therapy remains weak.
Summary
Mortality attributable to invasive candidiasis may be as high as 70%. Prompt diagnosis and treatment, in conjunction with source control, are the key to improving outcomes."

Background
Gram-negative bacteria are increasingly the cause of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), and the prevalence of multi-drug-resistant strains is rising rapidly. This study evaluated the impact of delayed central venous catheter (CVC) removal on clinical outcomes in patients with Gram-negative CRBSI.
Methods
Between January 2007 and December 2016, patients with Gram-negative bacteraemia and CVC placement, from two tertiary care hospitals, were included retrospectively. Cases with CVC removal more than three days after onset of bacteraemia or without CVC removal were classified as having delayed CVC removal.
Results
In total, 112 patients were included. Of these, 78 had CRBSI (43 definite and 35 probable) and 34 had Gram-negative bacteraemia from another source (non-CRBSI). Enterobacteriaceae were less common pathogens in patients with CRBSI than in patients with non-CRBSI (11.5% vs 41.3%; P<0.001). Delayed CVC removal was associated with increased 30-day mortality (40.5% vs 11.8%; P=0.01) in patients with Gram-negative CRBSI; this was not seen in patients with non-CRBSI (25.0% vs 14.3%; P>0.99). Delayed CVC removal [odds ratio (OR) 6.8], multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteraemia (OR 6.3) and chronic renal failure (OR 11.1) were associated with 30-day mortality in patients with CRBSI. The protective effect of early CVC removal on mortality was evident in the MDR group (48.3% vs 18.2%; P=0.03), but not in the non-MDR group (11.1% vs 0%; P=0.43).
Conclusion
CVCs should be removed early to improve clinical outcomes in patients with Gram-negative CRBSI, especially in settings where MDR isolates are prevalent."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Reducing post-sternotomy mediastinitis (PSM) requires incorporating multiple methods. However, the independent effects of these measures are not well studied.
Aim
To evaluate the independent effect of preoperative disinfection using isopropyl alcohol (IPA)–chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and the topical application of a retrosternal gentamicin collagen sponge at wound closure on reducing PSM.
Methods
From October 2012 to August 2014, 2340 patients were included in this prospective, controlled registry. Patients were divided into four groups. In groups 1 and 2, the skin was disinfected with IPA, and in groups 3 and 4, the skin was disinfected with IPA–CHG. A retrosternal gentamicin collagen sponge was used in groups 2 and 4. Freedom from PSM up to the 30th postoperative day was the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoint was freedom from any surgical site dehiscence. A stepwise regression model was made to reveal the independent factors associated with lower incidence of PSM.
Findings
There were significant differences in outcome among the groups (P < 0.0001). Primary healing was highest in group 4 (91.4%), which showed the lowest rate for mediastinitis (0.9%). Multivariate analysis showed that the use of CHG and a gentamicin sponge was statistically significant (P = 0.026 and 0.013, respectively). The other significant independent factors were valve operation (P = 0.001), body mass index >30 kg/m2 (P = 0.001), preoperative stroke (P = 0.005), and blood transfusion (P = 0.022).
Conclusion
Preoperative skin disinfection with IPA–CHG is superior to only IPA, and it should be recommended. The addition of a retrosternal gentamicin-releasing sponge further reduces the rate of mediastinitis."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hand rubs containing alcohols such as isopropanol (IPA) or ethanol (EtOH) are widely used for hygienic hand disinfection, and are presented in different formats (i.e. liquid, gel or foam).
Aim
To determine if there is any difference in efficacy between these two active ingredients in the three formats. In addition, an assessment of the drying time was undertaken. Two non-commercial, ‘standard’ formulations were tested in each format: one containing 60% IPA, and the other containing 80% EtOH.
Methods
EN 1500 tests were performed with 20 volunteers to assess efficacy. The reference product was 2 x 3 mL of 60% IPA for 60 s, as described in EN 1500 (2013). The test products were 3 mL of liquid, gel or foam format; one full EN 1500 test was performed for each formulation (60% IPA and 80% EtOH). To assess drying time, two different volumes (1.5 and 3.0 mL) of the test formulations in liquid, gel or foam format were applied to the hands of 15 volunteers. Volunteers self-reported when their hands were dry; at the end of the test, the volunteers were asked to rate the time taken to dry on a three-point scale (too short, OK, too long).
Findings
This study found no difference in antibacterial efficacy attributable to formulation or format for the two ‘standard’ ABHR formulations, as assessed by EN 1500. When measured objectively, the EtOH-based formulations dried more rapidly than the IPA-based formulations, and for both formulations, gels took longer to dry than other formats. User perception of drying time broadly agreed with objective measurement.
Conclusion
Given that there was no difference in efficacy and only moderate difference in drying time, it is proposed that ABHR in liquid, foam or gel format may be appropriate, provided that the specific product passes the required efficacy and safety standards."

abstract = "Summary
Background
This report describes an outbreak of gentamicin-resistant, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (GR MSSA) which occurred on a 21-bed neonatal unit (NNU) in Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, UK.
Methods
An outbreak investigation was triggered by two new GR MSSA isolates from babies admitted directly to the NNU who had acquired this organism during their stay. Data on MSSA cases and antibiograms of patient isolates were flagged as an alert, and microbiology records were trawled to detect previous cases.
Findings
Eight babies were affected by the outbreak strain over six months. Typing of all isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and spa typing showed that all were clonal complex 30, spa type t012. None of the outbreak strains were associated with bacteraemia, apart from one baby who was born at 24 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 500 g. Observation of practice and environmental swabbing of an incubator suggested that this was the most likely source of spread of the outbreak strain. Three of 11 surfaces sampled were positive for the outbreak strain. On inspection, it was found that the impeller was not removed routinely during cleaning, and debris was seen in the housing. Swabs that were taken from the impeller and housing yielded the outbreak strain.
Conclusion
GR MSSA isolates from the NNU have been set up as an alert organism on the infection control system. No further cases were detected over one year of follow-up after full compliance with the new guidelines for cleaning and disinfection of incubators was implemented."

Background
Influenza and other respiratory infections can spread rapidly and cause severe morbidity and mortality in care home settings.
Aim
This study describes the characteristics of respiratory outbreaks in care homes in Northern Ireland during a four-year period, and aims to identify factors that predict which respiratory outbreaks are more likely to be positively identified as influenza.
Methods
Epidemiological, virological, and clinical characteristics of outbreaks during the study period were described. Variables collected at notification were compared to identify predictors for an outbreak testing positive for influenza. t-Tests and χ2-tests were used to compare means and proportions respectively; significance level was set at 95%.
Findings
During the four seasons, 95 respiratory outbreaks were reported in care homes, 70 of which were confirmed as influenza. More than 1000 cases were reported, with 135 associated hospitalizations and 22 deaths. Vaccination uptake in residents was consistently high (mean: 86%); however, in staff it was poorly reported, and, when reported, consistently low (mean: 14%). Time to notification and number of cases at notification were both higher than expected according to national recommendations for reporting outbreaks. No clinically significant predictors of a positive influenza outbreak were identified.
Conclusion
Respiratory outbreaks in care homes were associated with significant morbidity and mortality, despite high vaccination uptake. The absence of indicators at notification of an outbreak to accurately predict influenza infection highlights the need for prompt reporting and laboratory testing. Raising staff awareness, training in the management of respiratory outbreaks in accordance with national guidance, and improvement of staff vaccination uptake are recommended."

Background
Pseudomonas aeruginosa healthcare outbreaks can be time consuming and difficult to investigate. Guidance does not specify which typing technique is most practical for decision-making.
Aim
To explore the usefulness of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in the investigation of a P. aeruginosa outbreak, describing how it compares with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis.
Methods
Six patient isolates and six environmental samples from an intensive care unit (ICU) positive for P. aeruginosa over two years underwent VNTR, PFGE and WGS.
Findings
VNTR and PFGE were required to fully determine the potential source of infection and rule out others. WGS results unambiguously distinguished linked isolates, giving greater assurance of the transmission route between wash-hand basin water and two patients, supporting the control measures employed.
Conclusion
WGS provided detailed information without the need for further typing. When allied to epidemiological information, WGS can be used to understand outbreak situations rapidly and with certainty. Implementation of WGS in real-time would be a major advance in day-to-day practice. It could become a standard of care as it becomes more widespread due to its reproducibility and lower costs."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A high proportion of infections acquired in hospitals are caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). The priority in MDRO prevention is to detect high-risk patients and implement preventive intervention as soon as possible.
Aim
To develop an automated risk assessment system for MDROs (autoRAS-MDRO) to screen for patients at MDRO infection risk and evaluate the predictive validity of the autoRAS-MDRO.
Methods
Data for 4200 variables were extracted from the electronic health records (EHRs) for constructing the MDRO risk-scoring algorithm, which was based on a logistic regression model. The autoRAS-MDRO was designed such that the MDRO risk classification (high, moderate, low risk) could be automatically displayed on the nursing Kardex screen in the EHRs system. For the development of the MDRO risk-scoring algorithm, 1000 patients with MDROs and 4000 patients without MDROs were selected; similarly, for the evaluation, 2173 and 8692 patients with and without MDROs, respectively, were selected.
Findings
The predictive validity of the autoRAS-MDRO was as follows: (i) at the 6-month evaluation: sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 79%; positive predictive value (PPV), 49%; negative predictive value (NPV), 94%; and Youden index, 0.60; (ii) at the 12-month evaluation: sensitivity 79%, specificity 78%, PPV 47%, NPV 94%, and Youden index, 0.57.
Conclusion
The autoRAS-MDRO had moderate predictive validity. It could be useful in redirecting nurses’ time and efforts required for MDRO risk assessment and implementation of infection control measures, and in reducing the incidence of MDRO infection in hospitals, thereby contributing to patient safety."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Studies often ignore time-varying confounding or may use inappropriate methodology to adjust for time-varying confounding.
Aim
To estimate the effect of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired bacteraemia on ICU mortality and discharge using appropriate methodology.
Methods
Marginal structural models with inverse probability weighting were used to estimate the ICU mortality and discharge associated with ICU-acquired bacteraemia among patients who stayed more than two days at the general ICU of a London teaching hospital and remained bacteraemia-free during those first two days. For comparison, the same associations were evaluated with (i) a conventional Cox model, adjusting only for baseline confounders and (ii) a Cox model adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders.
Findings
Using the marginal structural model with inverse probability weighting, bacteraemia was associated with an increase in ICU mortality (cause-specific hazard ratio (CSHR): 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02–1.63) and a decrease in discharge (CSHR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.45–0.60). By 60 days, among patients still in the ICU after two days and without prior bacteraemia, 8.0% of ICU deaths could be prevented by preventing all ICU-acquired bacteraemia cases. The conventional Cox model adjusting for time-varying confounders gave substantially different results [for ICU mortality, CSHR: 1.08 (95% CI: 0.88–1.32); for discharge, CSHR: 0.68 (95% CI: 0.60–0.77)].
Conclusion
In this study, even after adjusting for the timing of acquiring bacteraemia and time-varying confounding using inverse probability weighting for marginal structural models, ICU-acquired bacteraemia was associated with a decreased daily ICU discharge risk and an increased risk of ICU mortality."

Background
Contact precautions are required to prevent transmission of multi-drug-resistant organisms; however, reports on adherence rates vary. This study used video monitoring to evaluate adherence to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by different types of healthcare workers.
Methods
This observational study was conducted in a 781-bed tertiary hospital from July 2016 to March 2017. Cameras were installed in areas where staff don PPE. Infection control teams observed the videos and assessed adherence rates.
Results
In total, 1097 opportunities for donning PPE were observed. Most staff observed were nurses and nursing assistants (Ns/Nsas) (880/1097, 80.2%). Overall, the adherence rate to appropriate PPE use was 34.0%. The adherence rate among Ns/Nsas was lower (239/858, 27.9%) compared with infectious disease doctors (18/18, 100%) and cleaning staff (42/49, 85.7%). The adherence rate for PPE use for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) with toxin detection was significantly higher than that for CDI without toxin detection and multi-drug-resistant organisms (P<0.001 for both). The adherence rate for patients with an independent functional status was higher than that for patients with a dependent functional status (P=0.018). The adherence rate was lower in the intensive care unit (ICU) than in non-ICU wards (27.6% vs 36.5%; P=0.006).
Conclusion
Video monitoring is a useful tool for monitoring adherence to PPE use, facilitating observation of more PPE opportunities than direct observation. Adherence to contact precautions varied by occupation; however, overall adherence was insufficient. The lower adherence rate in nurses might be due to more frequent care visits."

Background
Surveillance of healthcare-associated infections is fundamental for infection prevention. The methods and practices for surveillance have evolved as technology becomes more advanced. The availability of electronic surveillance software (ESS) has increased, and yet adoption of ESS is slow. It is argued that ESS delivers savings through automation, particularly in terms of human resourcing and infection prevention (IP) staff time.
Aim
To describe the findings of a systematic review on the impact of ESS on IP resources.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted of electronic databases Medline and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature published between January 1st, 2006 and December 31st, 2016 with analysis using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.
Findings
In all, 2832 articles were reviewed, of which 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. IP resources were identified as time undertaken on surveillance. A reduction in IP staff time to undertake surveillance was demonstrated in 13 studies. The reduction proportion ranged from 12.5% to 98.4% (mean: 73.9%). The remaining three did not allow for any estimation of the effect in terms of IP staff time. None of the studies demonstrated an increase in IP staff time.
Conclusion
The results of this review demonstrate that adopting ESS yields considerable dividends in IP staff time relating to data collection and case ascertainment while maintaining high levels of sensitivity and specificity. This has the potential to enable reinvestment into other components of IP to maximize efficient use of scarce IP resources."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Information on the natural duration of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) carriage and factors associated with persistence of carriage is limited.
Aim
To evaluate the clinical variables associated with persistent carriage of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing CRE.
Methods
Data for patients admitted between June 2015 and December 2016 who were identified as KPC-producing CRE carriers by either rectal swabs or clinical cultures were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with follow-up culture data for three months after initial acquisition were included. Regression models were used to evaluate the clinical variables associated with persistence of carriage.
Findings
Of the 100 eligible patients, 50 patients (50%) experienced spontaneous decolonization within three months. Among the 50 patients (50%) who remained culture positive after three months, 26 patients carried KPC-producing CRE after six months. Multi-variable analysis revealed that re-admission [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 9.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13–87.98; P=0.039], duration of hospitalization (aOR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01–1.05; P=0.003), positive clinical culture (aOR 6.26; 95% CI 1.28–30.54; P=0.023) and carbapenem use (OR 9.15; 95% CI 1.85–45.27; P=0.007) were predictive for persistent carriage after six months.
Conclusion
The results suggest that patients with KPC-producing CRE in clinical specimens who are using carbapenem, particularly those with multiple and prolonged hospitalizations, are more likely to remain carriers after six months of initial acquisition. This information is useful for coordinating strategies for pre-emptive isolation by predicting the CRE carriage status appropriately, and ensuring active surveillance through risk factor stratification."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hand hygiene is paramount to prevent healthcare-associated infections, but improving compliance is challenging. When healthcare workers seldom encounter healthcare-associated infections, they will consider the odds of causing infections through poor hand hygiene negligible. Cognitive biases such as these may induce non-compliance. Nudging, ‘a friendly push to encourage desired behaviour’, could provide an easily implemented, inexpensive measure to address cognitive biases and thus support hand hygiene interventions.
Aim
To investigate whether behavioural nudges, displayed as posters, can increase the use of alcohol-based hand rub.
Methods
We developed nudges based on a systematic review of previously described cognitive biases, and tested these through a cross-sectional survey among the target audience. We then conducted a controlled before–after trial on two hospital wards, to assess the effect of these nudges on the use of alcohol-based hand rub, measured with electronic dispensers.
Findings
Poisson regression analyses adjusted for workload showed that nudges displayed next to dispensers increased their overall use on one ward [poster 1: relative risk: 1.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.2–2.2); poster 2: 1.7 (1.2–2.5)] and during doctor's rounds on both wards [poster 1: ward A: 1.7 (1.1–2.6); ward B: 2.2 (1.3–3.8)]. Use of dispensers without adjacent nudges did not increase.
Conclusion
Nudges based on cognitive biases that play a role in hand hygiene, and displayed as posters, could provide an easy, inexpensive measure to increase use of alcohol-based hand rub. When applying nudges to change behaviour, it is important to identify the right nudge for the right audience."

Background
Burkholderia cepacia is an important opportunistic organism in hospitalized and immunocompromised patients, particularly in cystic fibrosis.
Aims
To describe the epidemiological investigation of an outbreak of B. cepacia bacteraemia.
Methods
The study examined 14 patients during their admission to three intensive care units in a tertiary care hospital between January and June 2016. The outbreak involved nine (57%) female and six (43%) male patients. All patients were adults of ages ranging from 19 to 85 years with a median age of 52 years. Patients' medical charts, laboratory cultures, exposures, and central line insertion procedures were reviewed.
Findings
B. cepacia was isolated from the blood cultures of 14 patients resulting from contamination of the gel applied to the ultrasound probe used to guide the insertion of a central venous catheter. Molecular pathogen typing using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed 95% similarity between the B. cepacia isolates from the blood of these patients and those isolated from the ultrasound gel.

Background
Clostridium difficile infections occur frequently among hospitalized patients, with some infections acquired in hospital and others in the community. International guidelines classify cases as hospital-acquired if symptom onset occurs more than two days after admission. This classification informs surveillance and infection control, but has not been verified by empirical or modelling studies.
Aim
To assess current classification of C. difficile acquisition using a simulation model as a reference standard.
Methods
C. difficile transmission was simulated in a range of hospital scenarios. The sensitivity, specificity and precision of classifications that use cut-offs ranging from 0.25 h to 40 days were calculated. The optimal cut-off that correctly estimated the proportion of cases that were hospital acquired and the balanced cut-off that had equal sensitivity and specificity were identified.
Findings
The recommended two-day cut-off overestimated the incidence of hospital-acquired cases in all scenarios and by >100% in the base scenario. The two-day cut-off had good sensitivity (96%) but poor specificity (48%) and precision (52%) to identify cases acquired during the current hospitalization. A five-day cut-off was balanced, and a six-day cut-off was optimal in the base scenario. The optimal and balanced cut-offs were more than two days for nearly all scenarios considered (ranges: four to nine days and two to eight days, respectively).
Conclusion
Current guidelines for classifying C. difficile infections overestimate the proportion of cases acquired in hospital in all model scenarios. To reduce misclassification bias, an infection should be classified as being acquired prior to admission if symptoms begin within five days of admission."

This study aimed to assess the rate of ESBL-PE faecal carriage among hospitalized patients according to type of hospital ward, and to identify risk factors associated with carriage.
Methods
A point prevalence study was conducted in five different types of hospital ward [medical, surgical, intensive care unit (ICU), after care and rehabilitation, and geriatric] in eight French hospitals. All patients included in the study provided a fresh stool sample.
Results
In total, 554 patients were included in the study, with a median age of 73 years (range 60–82 years). The overall faecal carriage rate of ESBL-PE was 17.7%. The most frequently encountered species among ESBL-PE was Escherichia coli (71.4%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.3%). Risk factors associated with ESBL-PE faecal carriage on univariate analysis were: living in the Paris region (P<0.01) and hospitalization on a geriatric ward (P<0.01). Interestingly, the cumulative duration of hospital stay before screening was not associated with a significantly higher prevalence of ESBL-PE carriage, regardless of ward type. The ESBL-PE colonization rate was much higher for patients hospitalized on geriatric wards (28.1%) and ICUs (21.7%) compared with those for patients hospitalized on surgical wards (14.8%), medical wards (12.8%) or aftercare and rehabilitation (11.2%).
Conclusion
The overall prevalence of ESBL-PE faecal carriage was 17.7%, with only 21% of patients identified previously as carriers. The delay between admission and screening was not associated with an increase in ESBL-PE faecal carriage."

Background
Transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the healthcare setting is rare. Routine infection prevention and control measures mean that this should be a preventable ‘never event’.
Aim
To investigate the diagnosis of acute healthcare-associated HCV infection.
Methods
Epidemiological and molecular investigation of a case of acute HCV infection associated with nosocomial exposure.
Findings
Detailed investigation of the treatment history of a patient with acute HCV infection identified transmission from a co-attending patient in an emergency department as the likely source; this possibility was confirmed by virus sequence analysis. The precise route of transmission was not identified, though both patient and source had minimally invasive healthcare interventions. Review of infection, prevention and control identified potentially contributory factors in the causal pathway including hand hygiene, inappropriate use of personal protective equipment, and blood contamination of the surface of the departmental blood gas analyser.
Conclusion
We provide molecular and epidemiological evidence of HCV transmission between patients in an emergency department that was made possible by environmental contamination. Patients with HCV infection are higher users of emergency care than the general population and a significant proportion of those affected remain unknown and/or infectious. Equipment, departmental design, staff behaviour, and patient risk require regular review to minimize the risk of nosocomial HCV transmission."

The United Nations and the World Health Organization have designated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a major health priority and developed action plans to reduce AMR in all healthcare settings. Establishment of institutional antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) is advocated as a key intervention to reduce antibiotic consumption in hospitals and address high rates of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. PUBMED and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (January 2007–March 2017) were searched to identify studies reporting the effectiveness of ASPs in general paediatric wards and paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) for reducing antibiotic consumption, use of broad-spectrum/restricted antibiotics, and antibiotic resistance and healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Neonatal units and antifungal agents were excluded. Of 2509 titles and abstracts, nine articles were eligible for inclusion in the final analysis. All studies reported a reduction in the use of broad-spectrum/restricted antibiotics or antibiotic consumption. One study reported a reduction in HAIs in a PICU, and another study evaluated bacterial resistance, showing no effect following ASP implementation. Prospective audit on antibiotic use was the most common ASP core component (eight of nine studies). Antibiotic pre-authorization was described in two studies. Other described interventions were the provision of guidelines or written information (five of nine studies), and training of healthcare professionals (one study). There is limited evidence for a reduction in antibiotic consumption and use of broad-spectrum/restricted agents following ASP implementation specifically in PICUs. Data evaluating the impact of ASPs on HAIs and AMR in PICUs are lacking. In addition, there is limited information on effective components of a successful ASP in PICUs."

Background
The importance of biofilms to clinical practice is being increasingly realized. Biofilm tolerance to antibiotics is well described but limited work has been conducted on the efficacy of heat disinfection and sterilization against biofilms.
Aim
To test the susceptibility of planktonic, hydrated biofilm and dry-surface biofilm forms of Staphylococcus aureus, to dry-heat and wet-heat treatments.
Methods
S. aureus was grown as both hydrated biofilm and dry-surface biofilm in the CDC biofilm generator. Biofilm was subjected to a range of temperatures in a hot-air oven (dry heat), water bath or autoclave (wet heat).
Findings
Dry-surface biofilms remained culture positive even when treated with the harshest dry-heat condition of 100°C for 60min. Following autoclaving samples were culture negative but 62–74% of bacteria in dry-surface biofilms remained alive as demonstrated by live/dead staining and confocal microscopy. Dry-surface biofilms subjected to autoclaving at 121°C for up to 30min recovered and released planktonic cells. Recovery did not occur following autoclaving for longer or at 134°C, at least during the time-period tested. Hydrated biofilm recovered following dry-heat treatment up to 100°C for 10min but failed to recover following autoclaving despite the presence of 43–60% live cells as demonstrated by live/dead staining.
Conclusion
S. aureus dry-surface biofilms are less susceptible to killing by dry heat and steam autoclaving than hydrated biofilms, which are less susceptible to heat treatment than planktonic suspensions."

Background
In intensive care units (ICUs), inanimate surfaces and equipment may be contaminated by nosocomial pathogens, including multi-drug-resistant micro-organisms.
Aims
To assess the degree of environmental contamination close to and distant from patients, and contamination of healthcare workers' (HCWs) hands with nosocomial pathogens under real-life conditions and to investigate potential transmission events.
Methods
Over the course of three weeks, agar contact samples were taken close to and distant from patient areas and from HCWs' hands in eight ICUs of a tertiary care hospital in Innsbruck, Austria. Each ICU was visited once without announcement. Species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed according to standard methods, and corresponding strains from patient, environment and hand samples were genotyped using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
Findings
Among 523 samples, HCWs' hands were most frequently contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria (15.2%), followed by areas close to patients (10.9%) and areas distant from patients (9.1%). Gram-positive bacteria were identified most often (67.8%), with Enterococcus spp. being the most prevalent species (70% vancomycin sensitive and 30% vancomycin resistant) followed by Staphylococcus aureus, of which 64% were classified as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Molecular typing documented identical strains among patient, environment and hand isolates.
Conclusion
This study found widespread contamination of the ICU environment with clinically relevant pathogens, including multi-drug-resistant micro-organisms, despite cleaning and disinfection. The bioburden might not be restricted to areas close to patients. The role of extended environmental disinfection of areas distant from patients in order to improve infection prevention needs further discussion."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Healthcare workers caring for patients with high-consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs) require protection from pathogen exposure, for example by wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Protection is acquired through the inherent safety of the PPE components, but also their safe and correct use, supported by adequate training and user familiarity. However, the evidence base for HCID PPE ensembles and any associated training is lacking, with subsequent variation between healthcare providers.
Aim
To develop an evidence-based assessment and training tool for evaluating PPE ensembles and doffing protocols, in the assessment of patients with suspected HCIDs.
Methods
VIOLET (Visualising Infection with Optimised Light for Education and Training) comprises a healthcare mannequin adapted to deliver simulated bodily fluids containing UV-fluorescent tracers. On demand and remotely operated, the mannequin projectile vomits (blue), coughs (red), has diarrhoea (yellow) and is covered in sweat (orange). Wearing PPE, healthcare staff participate in an HCID risk assessment and examination of the ‘patient’, thereby becoming exposed to these bodily fluids. Contamination of PPE is visualized and body-mapped under UV light before and after removal. Observational findings and participant feedback, around its use as a training exercise, is also recorded.
Findings
Significant contamination from different exposure events was seen, enabling evaluation of PPE and doffing procedures used. Observational data and participant feedback demonstrated its strengths and success as a training technique.
Conclusion
Simulation exercises using VIOLET provide evidence-based assessment of PPE ensembles, and are a valuable resource for training of healthcare staff in wearing and safe doffing of PPE."

Background
Current literature examining the relationship between door-opening rate, number of people present, and microbial air contamination in the operating room is limited. Studies are especially needed from low- and middle-income countries, where the risk of surgical site infections is high.
Aim
To assess microbial air contamination in operating rooms at a Ghanaian teaching hospital and the association with door-openings and number of people present. Moreover, we aimed to document reasons for door-opening.
Methods
We conducted active air-sampling using an MAS 100® portable impactor during 124 clean or clean-contaminated elective surgical procedures. The number of people present, door-opening rate and the reasons for each door-opening were recorded by direct observation using pretested structured observation forms.
Findings
During surgery, the mean number of colony-forming units (cfu) was 328 cfu/m3 air, and 429 (84%) of 510 samples exceeded a recommended level of 180 cfu/m3. Of 6717 door-openings recorded, 77% were considered unnecessary. Levels of cfu/m3 were strongly correlated with the number of people present (P = 0.001) and with the number of door-openings/h (P = 0.02). In empty operating rooms, the mean cfu count was 39 cfu/m3 after 1 h of uninterrupted ventilation and 52 (51%) of 102 samples exceeded a recommended level of 35 cfu/m3.
Conclusion
The study revealed high values of intraoperative airborne cfu exceeding recommended levels. Minimizing the number of door-openings and people present during surgery could be an effective strategy to reduce microbial air contamination in low- and middle-income settings."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Dental handpieces are used in critical and semi-critical operative interventions. Although some dental professional bodies recommend that dental handpieces are sterilized between patient use there is a lack of clarity and understanding of the effectiveness of different steam sterilization processes. The internal mechanisms of dental handpieces contain narrow lumens (0.8–2.3 mm) which can impede the removal of air and ingress of saturated steam required to achieve sterilization conditions.
Aim
To identify the extent of sterilization failure in dental handpieces using a non-vacuum process.
Methods
In-vitro and in-vivo investigations were conducted on widely used UK bench-top steam sterilizers and three different types of dental handpieces. The sterilization process was monitored inside the lumens of dental handpieces using thermometric (TM; dataloggers), chemical indicator (CI), and biological indicator (BI) methods.
Findings
All three methods of assessing achievement of sterility within dental handpieces that had been exposed to non-vacuum sterilization conditions demonstrated a significant number of failures [CI: 8/3024 (fails/no. of tests); BI: 15/3024; TM: 56/56] compared to vacuum sterilization conditions (CI: 2/1944; BI: 0/1944; TM: 0/36). The dental handpiece most likely to fail sterilization in the non-vacuum process was the surgical handpiece. Non-vacuum sterilizers located in general dental practice had a higher rate of sterilization failure (CI: 25/1620; BI: 32/1620; TM: 56/56) with no failures in vacuum process.
Conclusion
Non-vacuum downward/gravity displacement, type N steam sterilizers are an unreliable method for sterilization of dental handpieces in general dental practice. The handpiece most likely to fail sterilization is the type most frequently used for surgical interventions."

Background
Identification of factors that confer an increased risk of mortality in hospital-acquired sepsis (HAS) is necessary to help prevent, and improve the outcome of, this condition.
Aim
To evaluate the clinical characteristics and factors associated with mortality in patients with HAS.
Methods
Retrospective study of patients with HAS in a major Spanish Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Data from adults receiving any of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes associated with sepsis were collected. Those fulfilling the SEPSIS-2 definition with no evidence of infection during the first 48 h following hospitalization were included (N = 196). Multivariate analysis was employed to identify the risk factors of mortality.
Findings
HAS patients were found to have many of the risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease (male sex, ageing, antecedent of cardiac disease, arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking habit) and cancer. Vascular disease or chronic kidney disease were associated with 28-day mortality. Time from hospital admission to sepsis diagnosis, and the presence of organ failure were risk factors for 28-day and hospital mortality. Experiencing more than one episode of sepsis increased the risk of hospital mortality. ‘Sepsis code’ for the early identification of sepsis was protective against hospital mortality.
Conclusion
This study identifies several major factors associated with mortality in patients suffering from HAS. Implementation of surveillance programmes for the early identification and treatment of sepsis translate into a clear benefit."

Twelve strains of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated during a suspected outbreak in a paediatric intensive care unit were analysed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
Aim
To define the clonality of MRSA strains to a high discriminative power, and to evaluate the presence of genetic determinants responsible for antibiotic resistance and virulence.
Results
Ten out of 12 strains belonged to multi-locus sequence type ST2625, while the other two strains were ST8. Among the ST2625 strains, analysis based on 1126 genes showed that they were clonal, sharing more than 98.3% of allelic identities, and one strain was isolated from a healthcare worker. All ST2625 strains were characterized by the SCC-Mec cassette IVa, and resistoma analysis indicated correspondence between phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. The study of 63 genes associated with virulence was correlated with the pattern of clonality shown.
Conclusion
This analysis confirmed the occurrence of an outbreak. As such, standard infection control measures were strictly enforced, and this led to prompt termination of the outbreak."

Background
The current increase in nosocomial infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) warrants improvement of detection methods and hygiene measures. Knowledge of the local epidemiology is important for monitoring compliance of medical personnel with hygiene measures.
Aim
To evaluate semi-automated repetitive element palindromic polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) for rapid molecular typing of VRE.
Methods
Primary VRE isolates were collected during an observation period of one year and retrospectively typed by rep-PCR. Molecular typing was performed on isolates from two departments with elevated VRE rates and patients with increased risk for systemic VRE infections. Typing results were correlated with temporal and spatial information on patient moves, VRE laboratory results and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST).
Findings
Approximately 70% of VRE isolates within a department could be assigned to similarity clusters. Spread of VRE was limited to the individual departments. There was no evidence for spread of endemic VRE strains within the geographical catchment area of the hospital. Our results demonstrate the utility of rep-PCR typing on a department level. However, a Diversilab® threshold of ≥98% had to be applied to claim similarity, and suspected transmissions needed to be confirmed by vanA/B genotyping and compiled information on spatial and temporal patient contact. MLST verified the findings.
Conclusion
Spread of predominantly detected vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium was limited to the department level with no evidence for wider dissemination within the hospital. Well-standardized and validated (semi-)automated rep-PCR systems are useful for rapid detection of possible VRE transmission. However, suspected transmissions need to be confirmed by clinical and microbiological parameters."

Methods
DURs from 2006 to 2015 in 190 intensive care units (ICUs) participating in KONIS were included in this study. DURs were calculated as the ratio of device-days to patient-days. The pooled incidences of DAIs and DURs were calculated for each year of participation, and the year-wise trends were analysed.
Findings
Year-wise ventilator utilization ratio (V-DUR) increased significantly from 0.40 to 0.41 (F = 6.27, P < 0.01), urinary catheter utilization ratio (U-DUR) increased non-significantly from 0.83 to 0.84 (F = 1.66, P = 0.10), and C-line utilization ratio (CL-DUR) decreased non-significantly from 0.55 to 0.51 (F = 1.62, P = 0.11).

Background
Bloodstream infections (BSIs) associated with insertion and maintenance of central venous catheters (CRBSIs) are the most frequent causes of healthcare-associated infections in intensive care units (ICUs). They are responsible for increased length of hospital stay and additional healthcare costs.
Aim
To investigate whether an educational programme aimed at healthcare workers resulted in a significant change in the level and trend of infections.

The research was conducted in five Italian ICUs from July 2012 to August 2014. Surveillance and educational interventions to control infections were applied. Compliance with hand hygiene procedures was assessed via relative risk and 95% confidence interval. Interrupted time-series analysis was used to investigate the change in level and trend of infection during the intervention.
Findings
Compliance with hand hygiene procedures improved during the intervention for all staff groups, but physicians showed the lowest compliance rates (nurses from 52.4% to 92.1%; nurse aides from 71.0% to 92%; physicians from 71.0% to 92%; P < 0.001). Significant reductions of 21–55% in CRBSI were observed during the intervention. Small improvements in the monthly infection trend were also observed, but these were not statistically significant.
Conclusion
An educational programme focusing on general good infection control practice, rather than CVC care bundles, led to a decreased CRBSI rate, even if the improvement was not sustained over time. Continuous performance feedback should be provided to promote long-term adherence to guidelines among all health workers."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A large outbreak of three epidemic vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) clones affected the study hospital for almost two years.
Aim
To describe the strategy to successfully control this outbreak and eradicate VRE from the study hospital.
Methods
Infection control interventions started after detection of VRE in three patients. Hospital-wide surveillance was started after ongoing transmission despite isolation precautions, cleaning and contact tracing. Hygiene education and discipline were enhanced. Despite these interventions, additional measures were required to control the outbreak, such as ward disinfection with hydrogen peroxide vapour and the introduction of a VRE quarantine ward. Ultimately, ciprofloxacin prophylaxis for haematological patients on chemotherapy was abandoned.
Findings
Over a 22-month period, 242 VRE carriers were identified. Of these, 128 (53%) patients were detected by hospital-wide surveillance alone. Three epidemic clones were detected: ST494-vanA (N = 160), ST78-vanA (N = 23) and ST117-vanB (N = 32). In total, 5614 possible contacts were identified. VRE transmission occurred on 13 out of 23 wards. VRE was cultured from clinical specimens in 22 patients (seven with bacteraemia). Since January 2014, no further transmission of these VRE clones has been observed.
Conclusion
Infection control measures according to international guidelines were insufficient to expose the outbreak to its full extent and control it. Its full extent only became apparent after sustained hospital-wide screening. Successful control of this hospital-wide VRE outbreak was feasible, but required great effort. Final containment and eradication of the epidemic clones was achieved by environmental decontamination with hydrogen peroxide vapour, strict isolation precautions, a VRE quarantine ward and antimicrobial stewardship."

Background
Variations currently exist across the UK in the choice of personal protective equipment (PPE) used by healthcare workers when caring for patients with suspected high-consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs).
Aim
To test the protection afforded to healthcare workers by current PPE ensembles during assessment of a suspected HCID case, and to provide an evidence base to justify proposal of a unified PPE ensemble for healthcare workers across the UK.
Methods
One ‘basic level’ (enhanced precautions) PPE ensemble and five ‘suspected case’ PPE ensembles were evaluated in volunteer trials using ‘Violet’; an ultraviolet-fluorescence-based simulation exercise to visualize exposure/contamination events. Contamination was photographed and mapped.
Findings
There were 147 post-simulation and 31 post-doffing contamination events, from a maximum of 980, when evaluating the basic level of PPE. Therefore, this PPE ensemble did not afford adequate protection, primarily due to direct contamination of exposed areas of the skin. For the five suspected case ensembles, 1584 post-simulation contamination events were recorded, from a maximum of 5110. Twelve post-doffing contamination events were also observed (face, two events; neck, one event; forearm, one event; lower legs, eight events).
Conclusion
All suspected case PPE ensembles either had post-doffing contamination events or other significant disadvantages to their use. This identified the need to design a unified PPE ensemble and doffing procedure, incorporating the most protective PPE considered for each body area. This work has been presented to, and reviewed by, key stakeholders to decide on a proposed unified ensemble, subject to further evaluation."

Background
Cutaneous mucormycoses, mainly due to Lichtheimia (Absidia), have occurred on several occasions in the Burn Unit of the University Hospital of Lille, France.
Aim
To investigate the potential vector role of non-sterile bandages used to hold in place sterile gauze used for wound dressing.
Methods
Mycological analysis by conventional culture, Mucorales real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and Lichtheimia species-specific qPCR were performed on eight crepe and six elasticized bandages that were sampled on two independent occasions in March 2014 and July 2016. Characteristics of the seven Lichtheimia mucormycoses which occurred in burn patients between November 2013 and July 2016 were also collected to assess the epidemiological relationship between potentially contaminated bandages and clinical infections.
Findings
One Lichtheimia corymbifera strain was isolated from a crepe bandage by culture, and Lichtheimia spp. qPCR was positive in six out of eight crepe and four out of six elasticized bandages. Using species-specific qPCR, Lichtheimia ramosa, Lichtheimia ornata, and L. corymbifera were identified in six out of ten, five out of ten, and four out of ten bandages, respectively. In patients with mucormycosis, L. ramosa and L. ornata were present in five and two cases, respectively.
Conclusion
Our data support the utility of Mucorales qPCR for epidemiological investigations, the potential role of these bandages in cutaneous mucormycoses in burn patients in our centre, and, consequently, the need for sterile bandages for the dressing of extensive wounds."

Background
Norovirus is frequently introduced to the hospital and is a frequent cause of hospital outbreaks. Recognition of the factors that facilitate or impede norovirus transmission is an important step to effectively prevent hospital outbreaks.
Aim
To investigate risk factors for norovirus outbreaks in hospital settings.
Methods
Clinical data, ward setting, and norovirus genotype were collected from all 65 norovirus-positive index cases in outbreaks and all 186 sporadic norovirus cases at 192 wards in southern Sweden during 2010–2012 in a nested case–control study. Uni- and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted.
Findings
Outbreak was independently associated with the number of patients sharing a room with the norovirus case (odds ratio (OR): 1.9 per additional patient in the room; P < 0.01), vomiting (OR: 2.6; P = 0.04), age >80 years (OR: 3.2; P < 0.01), comorbidity (OR: 2.3; P = 0.05), and onset of symptoms after admission to the ward (OR: 3.5; P < 0.01) in the multivariate analysis. Infection with genotype GII.4 was found to be strongly associated with outbreak in the univariate analysis (OR: 5.7; P < 0.01). Moreover, associations between GII.4 and vomiting (OR: 2.5; P = 0.01) and old age (OR: 4.3: P < 0.01) were found.
Conclusion
This is the first study to investigate clinical, ward and genotype risk factors for norovirus hospital outbreaks. Recognition of these factors may help direct and prioritize infection control actions based on the outbreak risk. The results also suggest that the outbreak association with GII.4 partly may be explained by an enhanced ability to induce vomiting."

Background
Adult long-term care (LTC) facilities have high rates of antibiotic use, raising concerns about antimicrobial resistance. Few studies have examined antibiotic use in paediatric LTC facilities.
Aim
To describe antibiotic use in three paediatric LTC facilities and to describe the factors associated with use.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted from September 2012 to December 2015 in three paediatric LTC facilities. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), antimicrobial use and diagnostic testing. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors for antibiotic use. The association between susceptibility testing results and appropriate antibiotic coverage was determined using Chi-squared test.
Findings
Fifty-eight percent (413/717) of residents had at least one HAI, and 79% (325/413) of these residents were treated with at least one antibiotic course, totalling 2.75 antibiotic courses per 1000 resident-days. Length of enrolment greater than one year, having a neurological disorder, having a tracheostomy, and being hospitalized at least once during the study period were significantly associated with receiving antibiotics when controlling for facility (all P < 0.001). Diagnostic testing was performed for 40% of antibiotic-treated HAIs. Eighty-six percent of antibiotic courses for identified bacterial pathogens (201/233) provided appropriate coverage. Access to susceptibility testing was not associated with appropriate antibiotic choice (P = 0.26).
Conclusion
Use of antibiotics in paediatric LTC facilities is widespread. There is further need to assess antibiotic use in paediatric LTC facilities. Evaluation of the adverse outcomes associated with inappropriate antibiotic use, including the prevalence of resistant organisms in paediatric LTC facilities, is critical."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Uptake of annual influenza vaccination of healthcare workers (HCWs) varies, and remains at a suboptimal level in many countries. As HCWs are often exposed to a variety of information about vaccination, the pattern of exposure may impact their decision; this deserves further investigation.
Methods
Practising nurses in Hong Kong were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey in February 2016, after the winter seasonal peak. The questionnaire covered demographics, work nature and experiences, vaccination uptake history and reasons for vaccination decisions. Two behavioural categories for access to information were defined – passive exposure to information and active information-seeking – differentiated by the source, type and nature of information accessed. Chi-squared test, Mann–Whitney U-test and logistic regression were performed to compare vaccinated and unvaccinated nurses.
Results
In total, 1177 valid returns were received from nurses. The median age of respondents was 32 years and 86% were female. The overall vaccination rate was 33%. Passive exposure to information from the workplace, professional body and social network was not predictive of vaccination decision, but passive exposure to information from mass media was predictive [odds ratio (OR) 1.78]. Active information-seeking, such as consulting a senior (OR 2.46), organizing promotional activities (OR 2.85) and undertaking an information search (OR 2.43), was significantly associated with increased vaccination uptake. A cumulative effect could be demonstrated for active information-seeking (OR 1.86), but not for passive exposure to information.
Conclusion
The current strategy of promotions and campaigns for seasonal influenza vaccination in HCWs may not be effective in increasing vaccination coverage. Measures targeting information-seeking behaviours may serve as an alternative approach."

Background
Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the leading cause of healthcare-associated infections in acute care hospitals in Europe. However, the risk factors for the development of early-onset (EO) and late-onset (LO) SSI have not been elucidated.
Aim
This study investigated the predictive factors for EO-SSI and LO-SSI in a large cohort of patients undergoing colorectal surgery.
Methods
We prospectively followed-up adult patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery in 10 hospitals (2011–2014). Patients were divided into three groups: EO-SSI, LO-SSI, or no infection (no-SSI). The cut-off defining EO-SSI and LO-SSI was seven days (median time to SSI development). Different predictive factors for EO-SSI and LO-SSI were analysed, comparing each group with the no-SSI patients.
Findings
Of 3701 patients, 320 (8.6%) and 349 (9.4%) developed EO-SSI and LO-SSI, respectively. The rest had no-SSI. Patients with EO-SSI were mostly males, had colon surgery and developed organ-space SSI whereas LO-SSI patients frequently received chemotherapy or radiotherapy and had incisional SSI. Male sex (odds ratio (OR): 1.92; P < 0.001), American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status >2 (OR: 1.51; P = 0.01), administration of mechanical bowel preparation (OR: 0.7; P = 0.03) and stoma creation (OR: 1.95; P < 0.001) predicted EO-SSI whereas rectal surgery (OR: 1.43; P = 0.03), prolonged surgery (OR: 1.4; P = 0.03) and previous chemotherapy (OR: 1.8; P = 0.03) predicted LO-SSI.
Conclusion
We found distinctive predictive factors for the development of SSI before and after seven days following elective colorectal surgery. These factors could help establish specific preventive measures in each group."

Background
Although fomites or contaminated surfaces have been considered as transmission routes, the role of environmental contamination by human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV-3) in healthcare settings is not established.
Aim
To describe an hPIV-3 nosocomial outbreak and the results of environmental sampling to elucidate the source of nosocomial transmission and the role of environmental contamination.
Methods
During an hPIV-3 outbreak between May and June 2016, environmental surfaces in contact with clustered patients were swabbed and respiratory specimens used from infected patients and epidemiologically unlinked controls. The epidemiologic relatedness of hPIV-3 strains was investigated by sequencing of the haemagglutinin–neuraminidase and fusion protein genes.
Findings
Of 19 hPIV-3-infected patients, eight were haematopoietic stem cell recipients and one was a healthcare worker. In addition, four had upper and 12 had lower respiratory tract infections. Of the 19 patients, six (32%) were community-onset infections (symptom onset within <7 days of hospitalization) and 13 (68%) were hospital-onset infections (≥7 days of hospitalization). Phylogenetic analysis identified two major clusters: five patients, and three patients plus one healthcare worker. Therefore, seven (37%) were classified as nosocomial transmissions. hPIV-3 was detected in 21 (43%) of 49 environmental swabs up to 12 days after negative respiratory polymerase chain reaction conversion.
Conclusion
At least one-third of a peak season nosocomial hPIV-3 outbreak originated from nosocomial transmission, with multiple importations of hPIV-3 from the community, providing experimental evidence for extensive environmental hPIV-3 contamination. Direct contact with the contaminated surfaces and fomites or indirect transmission from infected healthcare workers could be responsible for nosocomial transmission."

Background
Given the importance of monitoring healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) and the consumption of antibiotics, a regional point prevalence survey was conducted in Liguria between March and April 2016.
Aim
To measure the overall prevalence of HCAI and describe the use of antibiotics in all public hospitals.
Methods
Data on risk factors and use of antibiotics were collected for each hospitalized patient. To define the variables significantly associated with HCAI, univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Standardized infection ratio and standardized antimicrobial use ratio were measured for each participating hospital.
Findings
A total of 3647 patients were enrolled. In all, 429 HCAIs were diagnosed in 376 patients, giving a prevalence of HCAI of 10.3%. Respiratory tract (21.7%) and urinary tract (20%) were the most frequent sites of infection. High rates of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (47.4%) and Enterobacteriaceae resistant to carbapenems (26.3%) were isolated. Forty-six percent of patients received at least one antibiotic. Combinations of penicillins including β-lactamase inhibitors (24.1%) were the most widely used; the main indication (46.7%) was the treatment of a community-acquired infection.
Conclusion
There was an increase in HCAI prevalence compared to a similar survey conducted in 2007; however, the performance of overlapping investigations will enable more reliable considerations. Nevertheless, data on antimicrobial resistance and use of antibiotics are consistent with the national trend. Despite methodological limitations, prevalence studies are useful to monitor HCAI over time and encourage greater awareness of the problem by all stakeholders."

Background
Staphylococcus aureus is the leading pathogen in surgical site infections (SSI).
Aim
To explore trends and risk factors associated with S. aureus SSI.
Methods
Risk factors for monomicrobial S. aureus SSI were identified from the Swiss multi-centre SSI surveillance system using multi-variate logistic regression. Both in-hospital and postdischarge SSI were identified using standardized definitions.
Findings
Over a six-year period, data were collected on 229,765 surgical patients, of whom 499 (0.22%) developed monomicrobial S. aureus SSI; 459 (92.0%) and 40 (8.0%) were due to meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), respectively. There was a significant decrease in the rate of MSSA SSI (P = 0.007), but not in the rate of MRSA SSI (P = 0.70). Independent protective factors for S. aureus SSI were older age [≥75 years vs <50 years: odds ratio (OR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44–0.83], laparoscopy/minimally invasive surgery (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50–0.92), non-clean surgery [OR 0.78 (per increase in wound contamination class), 95% CI 0.64–0.94] and correct timing of pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65–0.98). Independent risk factors were male sex (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.14–1.66), higher American Society of Anesthesiologists' score (per one-point increment: OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.13–1.51), re-operation for non-infectious reasons (OR 4.59, 95% CI 3.59–5.87) and procedure type: cardiac surgery, laminectomy, and hip or knee arthroplasty had two-to nine-fold increased odds of S. aureus SSI compared with other procedures.
Conclusions
SSI due to S. aureus are decreasing and becoming rare events in Switzerland. High-risk procedures that may benefit from specific preventive measures were identified. Unfortunately, many of the independent risk factors are not easily modifiable."

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a saline enema during the first stage of labour in reducing neonatal colonization with C. difficile.
Methods
This study was conducted at Cairo University Hospital, Egypt from January 2016 to July 2016. Asymptomatic mothers with uncomplicated vaginal delivery and their neonates without diarrhoea were included. The study group underwent saline enema, and the control group had no intervention. Stool samples were collected from neonates one week after delivery. The primary outcome was the detection of C. difficile in stool culture and direct detection of C. difficile Toxin A and Toxin B by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Findings
The two groups were comparable (P>0.05) in terms of age, gravidity, parity, body mass index and gestational age. C. difficile was detected in 13.54% and 37.63% of stool cultures from the enema group and the control group, respectively (P<0.001). Direct detection of Toxins A and B was positive in 22.92% of cases in the enema group and 53.76% of cases in the control group (P<0.001).
Conclusion
This study suggests that a saline enema for the mother during the first stage of labour may be useful in reducing the risk of neonatal gut colonization by C. difficile."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Outbreaks of infection associated with microbial biofilm in hospital hand washbasin U-bends are being reported increasingly. In a previous study, the efficacy of a prototype automated U-bend decontamination method was demonstrated for a single non-hospital pattern washbasin. It used two electrochemically activated solutions (ECA) generated from brine: catholyte with detergent properties and anolyte with disinfectant properties.
Aim
To develop and test a large-scale automated ECA treatment system to decontaminate 10 hospital pattern washbasin U-bends simultaneously in a busy hospital clinic.
Methods
A programmable system was developed whereby the washbasin drain outlets, U-bends and proximal wastewater pipework automatically underwent 10-min treatments with catholyte followed by anolyte, three times weekly, over five months. Six untreated washbasins served as controls. Quantitative bacterial counts from U-bends were determined on Columbia blood agar, Reasoner's 2A agar and Pseudomonas aeruginosa selective agar following treatment and 24 h later.
Findings
The average bacterial densities in colony-forming units/swab from treated U-bends showed a >3 log reduction compared with controls, and reductions were highly significant (P<0.0001) on all media. There was no significant increase in average bacterial counts from treated U-bends 24 h later on all media (P>0.1). P. aeruginosa was the most prevalent organism recovered throughout the study. Internal examination of untreated U-bends using electron microscopy showed dense biofilm extending to the washbasin drain outlet junction, whereas treated U-bends were free from biofilm.
Conclusion
Simultaneous automated treatment of multiple hospital washbasin U-bends with ECA consistently minimizes microbial contamination and thus the associated risk of infection."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Burkholderia cepacia is intrinsically resistant to certain antiseptics. The authors noted a sudden increase in the frequency of isolation of B. cepacia from blood cultures in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a university-affiliated hospital.
Aim
To identify the source and intervene in the ongoing infections.
Methods
The cases were defined as patients with positive blood cultures for B. cepacia in an NICU between November 2014 and January 2015. Medical records were reviewed and NICU healthcare workers were interviewed. Samples of suspected antiseptics, blood culture bottles, cotton balls, gauze and a needle used in the NICU were analysed microbiologically.
Findings
During the outbreak period, B. cepacia was identified in 25 blood cultures obtained from 21 patients. The clinical features of the patients were suggestive of pseudobacteraemia. Regarding environmental samples, B. cepacia was cultured from 0.5% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) solution products that had been used as a skin antiseptic during blood drawing in the NICU. The clinical B. cepacia isolate and two strains obtained from 0.5% CHG exhibited identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. After the CHG products were withdrawn, the outbreak was resolved.
Conclusions
The pseudobacteraemia cases were caused by contaminated 0.5% CHG produced by a single manufacturer. Stricter government regulation is needed to prevent contamination of disinfectants during manufacturing. In addition, microbial contamination of antiseptics and disinfectants should be suspected when a B. cepacia outbreak occurs in hospitalized patients."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are a major health issue. Cohorting may help to control spread of CPEs in hospitals, but is expensive and hard to implement.
Aim
To identify ward variables associated with CPE in-hospital transmission in a hospital where cohorting has never been implemented.
Methods
Cohort prospective study, comparing 14-consecutive-day periods regarding in-hospital transmission. Each period met the two following conditions: (i) CPE carriers/infected admitted for ≥48 h; (ii) 80% of relative contact patients were screened at least twice. Periods (a) with no acquired CPE case among relative contact patients were compared to periods (b) during which one or more CPE case acquisition was identified. Variables potentially associated with CPE transmission were assessed: colonization pressure, caregiver:patient ratio, hand hygiene compliance, hydro-alcoholic product consumption, antibiotic consumption, and infection control team (ICT) involvement on the ward.
Findings
Sixty-eight periods of two consecutive weeks were included, 18 (26.5%) included at least one CPE case acquisition. By multivariate analysis, colonization pressure (odds ratio: 1.12; 95% confidence interval: 1.0–1.25; P = 0.042) and antibiotic consumption (2.41; 1.02–5.66; P = 0.044) were associated with CPE in-hospital transmission. Caregiver:patient ratio potentiated both these variables, suggesting a role for understaffing in CPE transmission.
Conclusion
Understanding ward variables associated with CPE spread can help design suitable solutions. Colonization pressure and antibiotic consumption seems to be driving in-hospital transmission, along with caregiver:patient ratio. In presence of high colonization pressure, dedicated healthcare workers for managing CPE patients should be implemented. Co-ordination between ICT and antimicrobial stewardship team is also crucial to prevent CPE spread."

Background
Nosocomial outbreaks of parvovirus B19 (pB19) have been reported, but they rarely occur among healthcare personnel (HCP). Susceptibility among pregnant HCP was the major concern.
Methods
An outbreak of pB19 among HCP is described in a paediatric ward with a cross-sectional serologic study in all HCP and patients exposed to the outbreak. Acute infection was diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction or positive anti-parvovirus B19 IgM.
Findings
Among 48 HCP (three pregnant) and 22 patients included in the outbreak serologic study, 11 (23%) HCP and two (9%) patients had acute infection. Of these, six HCP and no patients were symptomatic. Clinical manifestations included itchy rash (100%) and joint pain following resolution of rash (67%), with median rash duration of four days. Forty percent of HCP and 50% of patients had positive anti-parvovirus IgG, indicating previously immune status. HCP with acute infection and HCP who were susceptible without infection were younger than HCP with previous immunity (mean age 32.2 vs 40.5 years, respectively; P = 0.003). The attack rate was 38% among HCP and 18% among patients who were susceptible, respectively. The outbreak ended within two weeks following strict droplet precaution and segregation of symptomatic HCP.
Conclusion
Parvovirus B19 infection may cause nosocomial outbreak with high attack rate among HCP. Outbreak control with droplet precaution was highly effective."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
A multiplex extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), performed directly on rectal swabs, was compared with a culture-based protocol to study the discrepancies between the two methods, and identify existing challenges to apply this assay in routine clinical practice. The secondary objective was to assess the performance of the qPCR.
Materials and methods
In two Dutch teaching hospitals, 573 rectal swabs were collected prospectively. Culture with additional testing with the Check-MDR CT103XL (Check-Points) was compared with the Check-Direct ESBL Screen for BD MAX (Check-Points), which detects the presence of the ESBL gene families CTX-M1, CTX-M2, CTX-M9 and SHV2/5-ESBL. The culture-based protocol (with Brilliance agar) was considered as the gold standard to assess the performance of the qPCR.
Results
Of the 573 rectal swabs, 74 (12.9%) were culture-positive. Eighty-four (14.7%) were qPCR-positive. There were eight culture-positive/qPCR-negative discrepancies and 18 culture-negative/qPCR-positive discrepancies. Sensitivity and specificity of qPCR vs culture were 87.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 79.7–95.7] and 96.3% (95% CI 94.6–98.0), respectively.
Conclusion
The Check-Direct ESBL Screen for the BD MAX is an easy-to-perform, quick molecular diagnostic test with the potential to significantly speed up screening for rectal ESBL-E carriage. Discrepancies were observed between the culture-based protocol and the qPCR in 4.5% of tested samples. Existing challenges for implementing qPCR are its limited sensitivity, the need for thorough knowledge of the local ESBL-E genes, and interpretation of culture-negative but qPCR-positive samples. It is believed that the limited sensitivity of qPCR could be optimized by including blaTEM as a molecular target, and improving the limit of detection."

Background
Healthcare-associated infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates are increasing and few effective antibiotics are currently available to treat patients.
Aim
To assess the epidemiology, molecular basis, clinical features, and outcomes in the acquisition and dissemination of OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae (OXA48KP) in a tertiary Spanish hospital between October 2013 and December 2015.
Methods
Clinical, demographic, and microbiological data of patients with OXA48KP in clinical samples were collected from medical records. Carbapenemase genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Genetic relationships were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multi-locus sequence typing.
Findings
In all, 116 episodes of OXA48KP in clinical samples were identified. The most frequent types of infection were urinary tract (N = 43, 42%), secondary bloodstream (N = 18, 17%), and surgical site infection (N = 17, 17%). More than one-quarter (28%) of infected patients died in hospital. Among infected patients (N = 90, 78%), infections were mainly classified as hospital-acquired (N = 70, 88%). A high number of OXA48KP isolates showed multidrug resistance, with highest susceptibility to colistin (86%), gentamicin (69%) and amikacin (59%). Most (87%) isolates were included in a main cluster. Seven (N = 8, 88%) isolates showed an identical allelic profile, associated with ST15. Only the isolate from cluster P8 was associated with ST29. The results confirm high dissemination of OXA48KP in our hospital due to the main clone ST15. OXA48KP infection was associated with a high mortality and was mainly hospital-acquired.
Conclusion
This study highlights the importance of active surveillance programmes, especially those focusing on hospital readmissions in order to control the spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae."

Background
Antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) have been effective in optimizing antibiotic use for inpatients. However, an emergency department's fast-paced clinical setting can be challenging for a successful ASP.
Aim
In April 2015, an ASP was implemented in our emergency department and we aimed to determine its impact on antimicrobial use for outpatients.
Methods
This was a single-centre study comparing the quality of antibiotic prescriptions between a one-year period before ASP implementation (November 2012 to October 2013) and a one-year period after its implementation (June 2015 to May 2016). For each period, antimicrobial prescriptions for all adult outpatients (hospitalized for <24h) were evaluated by an infectious disease specialist and an emergency department physician to assess compliance with local prescribing guidelines. Inappropriate prescriptions were then classified.
Findings
Before and after ASP, 34,671 and 35,925 consultations were registered at our emergency department, of which 25,470 and 26,208 were outpatients. Antimicrobials were prescribed in 769 (3.0%) and 580 (2.2%) consultations, respectively (P < 0.0001). There were 484 (62.9%) and 271 (46.7%) (P < 0.0001) instances of non-compliance with guidelines before and after ASP implementation. Non-compliance included unnecessary antimicrobial prescriptions, 197 (25.6%) vs 101 (17.4%) (P<0.0005); inappropriate spectrum, 108 (14.0%) vs 54 (9.3%) (P=0.008); excessive treatment duration, 87 (11.3%) vs 53 (9.1%) (P>0.05); and inappropriate choices, 11 (1.4%) vs 15 (2.6%) (P>0.05).
Conclusion
The implementation of an ASP markedly decreased the number of unnecessary antimicrobial prescriptions, but had little impact on most other aspects of inappropriate prescribing."

Background
Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a significant problem in acute leukaemia patients. Construction work near hospital wards caring for immunocompromised patients is one of the main risk factors for developing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA).
Aim
To assess the impact of environmental control measures used during hospital construction for the prevention of IA in acute leukaemia patients.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was developed to evaluate the IA incidence in acute leukaemia patients with different environmental control measures employed during hospital construction. We used European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criterial diagnosis parameters for definition of IA.
Findings
A total of 175 episodes of inpatient care were evaluated, 62 of which did not have any environmental control measures (when an outbreak occurred), and 113 that were subject to environmental control measures directed to preventing IA. The study showed an IA incidence of 25.8% for the group without environmental control measures vs 12.4% for those who did receive environmental control measures (P=0.024). The relative risk for IA was 0.595 (95% confidence interval: 0.394–0.897) for the group with environmental control measures.

keywords = "Laminar airflow, Surgical site infection, Prosthetic joint infection, Airborne infection",
abstract = "Summary
Background
Effective operating room ventilation is required to reduce the risk of surgical site infection. Vertical laminar airflow from above the surgical field provides a source of ‘ultra-clean’ air, carrying contaminants away from the operative site. An anaesthetic screening drape is often used to shield the operative site from the anaesthetic team, and this defies the principles of vertical laminar airflow.
Methods
A mock theatre set-up for a total knee replacement was constructed with and without the use of an anaesthetic screening drape. A 10×10 grid was set up within the surgical canopy, and the downward air velocities were measured using a hot air anemometer. The average velocity and range of velocities at each grid point were measured in both set-ups. The range was used as the marker of turbulence.
Findings
Within the surgical canopy, the average downward air velocity was 0.35m/s. With the use of an anaesthetic screening drape, the mean downward air velocity in the area above the patient decreased from 0.36m/s to 0.29m/s (P=0.02). In the area immediately above the drape, the average velocity was 0.18m/s. Turbulent air currents were produced in the areas adjacent to the drape near to the mock surgical site. For the area above the patient, the range increased from an average of 0.034m/s to 0.05m/s (P=0.04). In the area directly above the drape, the average range was 0.08m/s.
Conclusion
Use of an anaesthetic screening drape causes disruption to normal vertical laminar airflow."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The use of peripheral venous catheters (PVCs) has increased outside intensive care units, as has the rate of PVC-associated-bloodstream infection (PVC-BSI). PVCs are widely used in internal medicine departments (IMDs), but data on the incidence of PVC-BSI and its characteristics in IMDs are scarce.
Aim
To assess the incidence of PVC-BSI episodes detected in IMDs in Spain.
Methods
A one-year multi-centre prospective observational cohort study in 14 Spanish IMDs was undertaken. Adult patients admitted with at least one PVC and bacteraemia were included in the study. Demographic and clinical data were provided by local coordinators.
Findings
Seventy episodes of PVC-BSI were recorded, representing an overall rate of 1.64 PVC-BSI episodes/1000 IMD admissions. The mean age of patients was 67.44 (standard deviation 16.72) years. It was estimated that 25.7% of PVCs were no longer necessary. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated micro-organism (41.7%). Phlebitis was clinically evident in 44 (62.9%) episodes, and proved to be an independent predictor of catheter insertion in emergency departments (odds ratio 5.44). The crude and attributable mortality rates were 12.9% and 5.7%, respectively.
Conclusions
PVCs carry a significant risk for bacteraemia in Spanish IMDs. Phlebitis is not always clinically evident in patients with bacteraemia in this population. The study findings support the need for educational and interventional preventive measures in both IMDs and emergency departments to reduce the rate of PVC-BSI and associated comorbidities, and costs."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Suboptimal antibiotic use in respiratory infections is widespread in hospital medicine and primary care. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) teams within hospitals, commonly led by infectious diseases physicians, are frequently charged with optimizing the use of respiratory antibiotics, but there is limited information on what drives antibiotic use in this area of clinical medicine, or on how AMS is perceived.
Aim
To explore the perceptions of hospital respiratory clinicians on AMS in respiratory medicine.
Methods
In-depth interviews were conducted with 28 clinicians (13 doctors and 15 nurses) from two hospitals in Australia. Data were analysed thematically using the framework approach.
Findings
Four key barriers to the integration of AMS processes within respiratory medicine, from the participants' perspectives, were identified:1.Clinical ownership of common respiratory infections by the respiratory team is perceived to be challenged by AMS processes.2.AMS processes conflict with traditional hierarchies and consultation etiquette in respiratory medicine.3.Barriers to respiratory nursing engagement in AMS include lack of knowledge/education and perceived restrictions to their role.4.AMS processes result in significant interspecialty and interprofessional challenges that may undermine antibiotic optimization.
Conclusions
AMS processes are introduced in hospitals with established social structures and knowledge bases. This study found that AMS in respiratory medicine challenges and conflicts with many of these dynamics. If the influence of these dynamics is not considered, AMS processes may not be effective in containing antibiotic use in hospital respiratory medicine."

abstract = "SUMMARY
Background
Hospital volume is known to have a direct impact on the outcomes of major surgical procedures. However, it is unclear if the evidence applies specifically to surgical site infections.
Aims
To determine if there are procedure-specific hospital outliers [with higher surgical site infection rates (SSIRs)] for four major surgical procedures, and to examine if hospital volume is associated with SSIRs in the context of outlier performance in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
Methods
Adults who underwent one of four surgical procedures (colorectal, joint replacement, spinal and cardiac procedures) at a NSW healthcare facility between 2002 and 2013 were included. The hospital volume for each of the four surgical procedures was categorized into tertiles (low, medium and high). Multi-variable logistic regression models were built to estimate the expected SSIR for each procedure. The expected SSIRs were used to compute indirect standardized SSIRs which were then plotted in funnel plots to identify hospital outliers.
Findings
One hospital was identified to be an overall outlier (higher SSIRs for three of the four procedures performed in its facilities), whereas two hospitals were outliers for one specific procedure throughout the entire study period. Low-volume facilities performed the best for colorectal surgery and worst for joint replacement and cardiac surgery. One high-volume facility was an outlier for spinal surgery.
Conclusions
Surgical site infections seem to be mainly a procedure-specific, as opposed to a hospital-specific, phenomenon in NSW. The association between hospital volume and SSIRs differs for different surgical procedures."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Biofilm has been suggested as a cause of disinfection failures in flexible endoscopes where no lapses in the decontamination procedure can be identified. To test this theory, the activity of peracetic acid, one of the widely used disinfectants in the reprocessing of flexible endoscopes, was evaluated against both planktonic and sessile communities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Aim
To investigate the ability of P. aeruginosa biofilm to survive high-level peracetic acid disinfection.
Method
The susceptibility of planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa and biofilms aged 24, 48, 96, and 192 h to peracetic acid was evaluated by estimating their viability using resazurin viability and plate count methods. The biomass of the P. aeruginosa biofilms was also quantified using Crystal Violet assay. Planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa were treated with 5–30 ppm concentration of peracetic acid in the presence of 3.0 g/L of bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 5 min. Biofilms of P. aeruginosa were also treated with various peracetic acid concentrations (100–3000 ppm) for 5 min.
Findings
Planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa were eradicated by 20 ppm of peracetic acid, whereas biofilms showed an age-dependent tolerance to peracetic acid, and 96 h biofilm was only eradicated at peracetic acid concentration of 2500 ppm.
Conclusion
Ninety-six-hour P. aeruginosa biofilm survives 5 min treatment with 2000 ppm of peracetic acid, which is the working concentration used in some endoscope washer–disinfectors. This implies that disinfection failure of flexible endoscopes might occur when biofilms build up in the lumens of endoscopes."

Background
Patients receiving haemodialysis are exposed to a large volume of dialysis fluid. The Italian Society of Nephrology (ISN) has published guidelines and microbial quality standards on dialysis water (DW) and solutions to ensure patient safety.
Aim
To identify microbial and chemical hazards, and evaluate the quality of disinfection treatment in DW plants.
Methods
In 2015 and 2016, water networks and DW plants (closed loop and online monitors) of nine dialysis wards of Italian hospitals, hosting 162 dialysis beds overall, were sampled on a monthly basis to determine the parameters provided by ISN guidelines. Chlorinated drinking water was desalinated by reverse osmosis and distributed to the closed loop which feeds all online monitors. Disinfection with peracetic acid was performed in all DW plants on a monthly basis.
Findings
Over the 24-month study period, seven out of nine DW plants (78%) recorded negative results for all investigated parameters. Closed loop contamination with Burkholderia cepacia was detected in a DW plant from January 2015 to March 2015. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from March 2016 to May 2016 in the closed loop of another DW plant. These microbial contaminations were eradicated by shock disinfection with sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid, followed by water flushing.
Conclusion
These results highlight the importance of chemical and physical methods of DW disinfection. The maintenance of control measures in water plants hosted in dialysis wards ensures a microbial risk reduction for all dialysis patients."

Background
Rehabilitation clinics may vary widely in terms of type of care provided, duration of hospital stay, and case severity. Few data are available on prevalence of Clostridium difficile or extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) colonization in rehabilitation clinics in Germany.
Aim
This study investigated the frequency of intestinal colonization by these pathogens among patients in rehabilitation clinics of different specialization.
Methods
In the scope of a point prevalence study, faecal samples and demographic and clinical data were collected in five rehabilitation clinics. Samples were screened for C. difficile and ESBL-E by culture. Isolates were characterized by polymerase chain reaction for C. difficile toxins A and B, for β-lactamase genes, and by molecular typing including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and PCR-based ribotyping.
Findings
Of 305 patients screened, 11.1% were colonized by toxigenic C. difficile and 7.5% by ESBL-E. Colonization rates differed markedly between facilities, ranging from 1.6% to 26.3% for C. difficile and from zero to 23.7% for ESBL-E. Prevalence of colonization by C. difficile and ESBL-E was higher in neurological rehabilitation clinics than in clinics with other specialties (P<0.001). Molecular typing revealed six patients from one neurological rehabilitation clinic harbouring a unique C. difficile strain (ribotype 017). CTX-M-15 was the most prevalent ESBL type. We detected several indistinguishable pairs of ESBL-E isolates within some facilities.
Conclusion
Significant differences were found in the prevalence of C. difficile and ESBL-E between rehabilitation clinics. Facilities providing specialized medical care for critically ill patients had higher prevalence rates. These results may help to delineate the requirements for infection prevention and control in rehabilitation clinics."

Background
In recent years, installation of bidet toilets within hospitals in Japan has raised concerns regarding potential for cross-contamination by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria from patients who are hospitalized over an extended period.
Aim
To investigate the distribution of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria recovered from bidet toilets at a university-affiliated hospital in Japan.
Methods
All 292 electric bidet toilets at a university hospital were sampled for contamination. Swabs for culture were used to sample water-jet nozzles and toilet seats.
Findings
Of the 292 toilet seats sampled, warm-water nozzles of 254 (86.9%) were found to be contaminated by one or more of the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae and non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negative bacteria. S. aureus was recovered from one water-jet nozzle and nine toilet seats; of these, meticillin-resistant S. aureus was recovered from the water-jet nozzle and from one toilet seat. Both the water-jet nozzle and seat of the same toilet were contaminated with a CTX-M-9 group extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. Of the Gram-negative isolates recovered from samples, the organism with the highest frequency of isolation was Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which was recovered from 39 bidet toilets.
Conclusion
Warm-water nozzles of bidet toilets are contaminated with a wide range of bacteria, making them a potential vehicle for cross-infection. In the hospital setting, shared use of bidet toilets must consider the clinical background of patients. Based on these findings, these devices must be part of the risk management programme, and steps should be included for monitoring and disinfection."

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most frequent nosocomial infection in geriatric units. An understanding of risk factors for infection may help to identify prevention strategies.
Aim
Identification of the risk factors for UTI in elderly patients.
Methods
Retrospective analysis of three prospective cohorts. All hospitalized patients present in, or admitted to, a geriatric unit from June 1st to June 28th, for the years 2009, 2012, and 2015 were included and followed until discharge or until June 30th of the year concerned. For each patient, type and dates of stay, type and dates of catheter, risk factors, and nosocomial UTI (NUTI) data were collected. Univariate and multivariate (Cox model) analyses were made using SPSS software.
Findings
A total of 4669 patients were included and were followed for a total of 83,068 days. There were 189 NUTIs (4.0% patients). NUTIs were significantly more frequent among female patients, in rehabilitation units, in immunosuppressed patients, among those with acute retention, post-void residual, history of urinary tract infection in the previous six months, and in case of dependency. NUTIs were significantly more frequent among those who had a catheter (Z-test, P < 0.001). NUTIs were more frequent among patients with intermittent, indwelling, or suprapubic catheters. They were also more frequent in acute/subacute care or rehabilitation units, in women, in immunosuppressed patients, and in those with a history of previous UTI; they were less frequent in dementia patients.
Conclusion
The occurrence of NUTI is an important issue in both catheterized and non-catheterized patients; prevention programmes should be widened to include non-catheterized patients."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Dental handpieces are required to be sterilized between patient use. Vacuum steam sterilization processes with fractionated pre/post-vacuum phases or unique cycles for specified medical devices are required for hollow instruments with internal lumens to assure successful air removal. Entrapped air will compromise achievement of required sterilization conditions. Many countries and professional organizations still advocate non-vacuum sterilization processes for these devices.
Aim
To investigate non-vacuum downward/gravity displacement, type-N steam sterilization of dental handpieces, using thermometric methods to measure time to achieve sterilization temperature at different handpiece locations.
Methods
Measurements at different positions within air turbines were undertaken with thermocouples and data loggers. Two examples of widely used UK benchtop steam sterilizers were tested: a non-vacuum benchtop sterilizer (Little Sister 3; Eschmann, Lancing, UK) and a vacuum benchtop sterilizer (Lisa; W&H, Bürmoos, Austria). Each sterilizer cycle was completed with three handpieces and each cycle in triplicate.
Findings
A total of 140 measurements inside dental handpiece lumens were recorded. The non-vacuum process failed (time range: 0–150 s) to reliably achieve sterilization temperatures within the time limit specified by the international standard (15 s equilibration time). The measurement point at the base of the handpiece failed in all test runs (N = 9) to meet the standard. No failures were detected with the vacuum steam sterilization type B process with fractionated pre-vacuum and post-vacuum phases.
Conclusion
Non-vacuum downward/gravity displacement, type-N steam sterilization processes are unreliable in achieving sterilization conditions inside dental handpieces, and the base of the handpiece is the site most likely to fail."

Background
Little is known about the use of antibiotics and the extent of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) in patients with spinal cord injuries (SCIs).
Aims
To record the use of antibiotics, establish the prevalence of AAD and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and assess if there was any seasonal variation in antibiotic use and incidence of AAD in patients with SCIs.
Methods
A retrospective study was conducted in six European SCI centres between October 2014 and June 2015. AAD was defined as two or more watery stools (Bristol Stool Scale type 5, 6 or 7) over 24 h.
Findings
In total, 1267 adults (median age 54 years, 30.7% female) with SCIs (52.7% tetraplegia, 59% complete SCI) were included in this study. Among the 215 (17%) patients on antibiotics, the top three indications for antibiotics were urinary tract infections (UTIs), infected pressure ulcers and other skin infections. Thirty-two of these 215 (14.9%) patients developed AAD and two patients out of the total study population (2/1267; 0.16%) developed CDI. AAD was more common in summer than in spring, autumn or winter (30.3% vs 3.8%, 7.4% and 16.9%, respectively; P<0.01). AAD was associated with age ≥65 years, tetraplegia, higher body mass index, hypoalbuminaemia, polypharmacy, multiple antibiotic use and high-risk antibiotic use. Summer and winter seasons and male sex were identified as independent predictors for the development of AAD.
Conclusion
This survey found that AAD is common in patients with SCIs, and UTI is the most common cause of infection. Summer and winter seasons and male sex are unique predictors for AAD. Both AAD and UTIs are potentially preventable; therefore, further work should focus on preventing the over-use of antibiotics, and developing strategies to improve hospital infection control measures."

Background
Acinetobacter baumannii is a leading emerging pathogen that is frequently recovered from patients during hospital outbreaks. The role of environmental A. baumannii reservoirs is therefore of great concern worldwide.
Aim
To investigate the connection between A. baumannii causing hospital outbreaks and environmental isolates from hospital wastewater, urban sewage and river water as the final natural recipient of wastewaters.
Methods
Clinical isolates from patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia and environmental isolates from water were collected during a two-month monitoring period. Recovery of A. baumannii was performed using CHROMagar Acinetobacter plates, incubated at 42°C for 48 h. Identification was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and analyses of rpoB gene. The antibiotic resistance profiles were interpreted according to criteria given for clinical isolates of A. baumannii. The sequence types (ST) were retrieved by multi-locus sequence typing.
Results
Fourteen of 19 isolates recovered from patients, hospital wastewaters, urban sewage and river water belonged to ST-195. The remaining five isolates recovered from patients and river water were assigned to ST-1421. All isolates showed very strong relatedness and clustered into CC92, which corresponds to IC2. All isolates were non-susceptible to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories, and thus were classified as ‘extensively-drug-resistant’ (XDR). Heteroresistance to colistin was found in two isolates from hospital wastewater.
Conclusion
Close relatedness of clinical and environmental isolates suggests the emission of XDR A. baumannii via the untreated hospital wastewater in the natural environment."

abstract = "Summary
Introduction
Compliance with hand hygiene (HH) has often not proved satisfactory; high workload is a commonly self-reported reason. Previous studies comparing workload and compliance have not measured workload precisely and have focused on certain times of day. This study aimed to investigate the association between HH compliance and workload, both electronically defined 365/7/24 (primary endpoint). In addition, the quality of commonly used compliance defining methods (hand disinfectant usage, direct observation) was investigated (secondary endpoint).
Materials and methods
Correlation of electronically measured HH compliance (hand-rub activities (HRA)/HH opportunities) with electronically determined workload (nursing time output/nursing time input) was undertaken over one year at a stem cell transplant unit at University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. HRA and procedures requiring HRA according to the five World Health Organization indications were recorded continuously (365/7/24) using electronic dispensers and electronic documentation, and compliance was calculated accordingly. Hand disinfectant usage was calculated using spending records for one year; direct observation was performed for approximately 1800 HH opportunities.
Results
During the investigation, 208,184 HRA, translating into 57 [standard deviation (SD) 10] HRA/patient-day (PD), were performed. Electronically determined compliance ranged from 24% to 66% [mean 42.39% (SD 8%)]. The higher the workload, the lower the compliance (R=-0.411; P<0.001). HRA/PD (r=-0.037), hand disinfectant usage (mean 160mL/PD) and observed compliance (95%; 1734 HRA/1813 HH opportunities) were not found to be associated with workload.
Conclusion
Calculated compliance was inversely associated with nurses’ workload. HRA/PD, observer-determined compliance and amount of disinfectant dispensed were used as surrogates for compliance, but did not correlate with actual compliance and thus should be used with caution."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a frequently encountered pathogen in burn units. Burn patients are especially susceptible to MRSA acquisition and MRSA spread may cause outbreaks in burn units.
Aim
To report the characteristics and successful control of an MRSA outbreak and to demonstrate a multimodal infection control concept.
Methods
In addition to a pre-existing infection control concept, several control measures were implemented including weekly prevalence screenings for MRSA, reinforcement of disinfection, restriction of admissions, and short-term unit closure. Epidemiologic investigation and environmental examinations were performed. The outbreak isolates were analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and spa-typing. A PubMed search was conducted, focusing on MRSA outbreaks in burn units.
Findings
This outbreak of hospital-acquired MRSA affected eight patients during a seven-month period, yielding an attack rate of 8%. Epidemiologic and environmental examinations suggested patient-to-patient transmission, which was confirmed by molecular analysis of bacterial isolates revealing a monoclonal pattern. In accordance with findings from other outbreaks in burn units, the implemented measures including patient screening and temporary unit closure resulted in successful control of the outbreak.
Conclusion
A comprehensive concept is required to control the spread of all multidrug-resistant micro-organisms including MRSA on a burn unit. Where patients colonized or infected with MRSA appear to be the main reservoir, transfer of these patients to other units, or temporary closure of the unit, accompanied by intensive cleaning are very effective measures to stop transmission events."

Background
Analysis of bloodstream infections (BSIs) is valuable for their diagnosis, treatment and prevention. However, limited data are available in Japan.
Aim
To investigate the characteristics of patients with bacteraemia in Japan.
Methods
This study was conducted in five hospitals from October 2012 to September 2013. Clinical, demographic, microbiological and outcome data for all blood-culture-positive cases were analysed.
Findings
In total, 3206 cases of BSI were analysed: 551 community-onset healthcare-associated (CHA)-BSIs, 1891 hospital-acquired (HA)-BSIs and 764 community-acquired (CA)-BSIs. The seven- and 30-day mortality rates were higher in patients with CHA- and HA-BSIs than in patients with CA-BSIs. The odds ratios (ORs) for seven-day mortality were 2.56 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48–4.41] and 2.63 (95% CI 1.64–4.19) for CHA- and HA-BSIs, respectively. The ORs for 30-day mortality were 2.41 (95% CI 1.63–3.57) and 3.31 (95% CI 2.39–4.59) for CHA- and HA-BSIs, respectively. There were 499 cases (15.2%) of central-line-associated BSI and 163 cases (5.0%) of peripheral-line-associated BSI. Major pathogens included coagulase-negative staphylococci (N = 736, 23.0%), Escherichia coli (N = 581, 18.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (N = 294, 9.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (N = 263, 8.2%). E. coli exhibited a higher 30-day mortality rate among patients with HA-BSIs (22.3%) compared with patients with CHA-BSIs (12.3%) and CA-BSIs (3.4%). K. pneumoniae exhibited higher 30-day mortality rates in patients with HA-BSIs (22.0%) and CHA-BSIs (22.7%) compared with patients with CA-BSIs (7.8%).
Conclusion
CHA- and HA-BSIs had higher mortality rates than CA-BSIs. The prognoses of E. coli- and K. pneumonia-related BSIs differed according to the category of bacteraemia."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Water networks in hospitals are frequently contaminated by opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens (OPPPs) leading to installation of antimicrobial filters on water points-of-use (POU) in order to limit patients' exposure.
Aim
To assess the spread of OPPPs through secondary water routes (outside the plumbing system) in an adult haematology unit in which 52 out of 73 water POU were high risk for patients and protected by antimicrobial filters.
Methods
An observational audit identified six secondary water routes for which bacteria tracking and typing were performed in 315 surface samplings. Bacterial isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and compared to the infra-species level by multiplex repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction and/or by restriction fragment length polymorphism in pulse-field gel electrophoresis.
Findings
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, as well as non-pathogenic OPPP indicators, were detected in water collected upstream of antimicrobial filters. P. aeruginosa was the sole OPPP retrieved from tested surfaces (5.1%). The same clone of P. aeruginosa spread from water source to dry surfaces in the same room and cross-contaminated two sinks in different rooms. Three clones of non-pathogenic OPPP indicators spread more widely in different rooms.
Conclusion
A strategy based on filtration of most (but not all) water POU in a haematology unit could be sufficient to limit the spread of OPPPs to the environment, provided a functional mapping of ‘high-risk’ POU has been undertaken. The residual spread of OPPPs and OPPP indicators linked to non-filtered water POU argues for careful monitoring of non-filtered water use."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Conflicting results have been found regarding outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired Enterobacteriaceae bacteraemia and the potentially modifying effect of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy.
Aim
To evaluate these associations while adjusting for potential time-varying confounding using methods from the causal inference literature.
Methods
Patients who stayed more than two days in two general ICUs in England between 2002 and 2006 were included in this cohort study. Marginal structural models with inverse probability weighting were used to estimate the mortality and discharge associated with Enterobacteriaceae bacteraemia and the impact of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy on these outcomes.
Findings
Among 3411 ICU admissions, 195 (5.7%) ICU-acquired Enterobacteriaceae bacteraemia cases occurred. Enterobacteriaceae bacteraemia was associated with an increased daily risk of ICU death [cause-specific hazard ratio (HR): 1.48; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10–1.99] and a reduced daily risk of ICU discharge (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.54–0.80). Appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy did not significantly modify ICU mortality (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.59–1.97) or discharge (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.63–1.32).
Conclusion
ICU-acquired Enterobacteriaceae bacteraemia was associated with an increased daily risk of ICU mortality. Furthermore, the daily discharge rate was also lower after acquiring infection, even when adjusting for time-varying confounding using appropriate methodology. No evidence was found for a beneficial modifying effect of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy on ICU mortality and discharge."

Background
Surgical site infections (SSIs) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, SSIs constitute a financial burden and negatively impact on patient quality of life (QoL).
Aim
To assess, and evaluate the evidence for, the cost and health-related QoL (HRQoL) burden of SSIs across various surgical specialties in six European countries.
Methods
Electronic databases and conference proceedings were systematically searched to identify studies reporting the cost and HRQoL burden of SSIs. Studies published post 2005 in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and the UK were eligible for data extraction. Studies were categorized by surgical specialty, and the primary outcomes were the cost of infection, economic evaluations, and HRQoL.
Findings
Twenty-six studies met the eligibility criteria and were included for analysis. There was a paucity of evidence in the countries of interest; however, SSIs were consistently associated with elevated costs, relative to uninfected patients. Several studies reported that SSI patients required prolonged hospitalization, reoperation, readmission, and that SSIs increased mortality rates. Only one study reported QoL evidence, the results of which demonstrated that SSIs reduced HRQoL scores (EQ-5D). Hospitalization reportedly constituted a substantial cost burden, with additional costs arising from medical staff, investigation, and treatment costs.
Conclusion
Disparate reporting of SSIs makes direct cost comparisons difficult, but this review indicated that SSIs are extremely costly. Thus, rigorous procedures must be implemented to minimize SSIs. More economic and QoL studies are required to make accurate cost estimates and to understand the true burden of SSIs."

Objective
To review studies of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in burn patients.
Methods
Electronic databases were searched for human clinical trials performed between 1966 and 2016 that compared prophylactic systemic antibiotics with placebo or no intervention.
Results
Nineteen trials met the selection criteria. Early postburn prophylaxis was assessed in non-severe burn patients (six trials) and severe burn patients (seven trials). Antimicrobial prophylaxis showed no effectiveness for the prevention of toxic shock syndrome or burn wound infection (Grade 1C), but could be useful in patients with severe burns and requirement for mechanical ventilation (Grade 2B). Perioperative prophylaxis was assessed in six trials. Antimicrobial prophylaxis during resection of devitalized tissue is of no benefit in most burn patients (Grade 2B); however, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for patients with extensive burns. Antibiotic prophylaxis may also be effective in preventing split-thickness skin graft infections in selected procedures (Grade 2B).
Conclusions
The available evidence does not support the role of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in the management of the majority of burn patients. Nevertheless, it may be useful in patients with severe burns who require mechanical ventilation, and in selected split-thickness skin grafting procedures."

abstract = "Summary
The role of heater–cooler units (HCUs) in the transmission of Mycobacterium chimaera during open heart surgery has been recognized since 2013. Subsequent investigations uncovered a remarkable global outbreak reflecting the wide distribution of implicated devices. HCUs are an essential component of cardiopulmonary bypass operations and their withdrawal would severely affect capacity for life-saving cardiac surgery. However, studies have demonstrated that many HCUs are contaminated with a wide range of micro-organisms, including M. chimaera and complex biofilms. Whole genome sequencing of M. chimaera isolates recovered from one manufacturer’s HCUs, worldwide, has demonstrated a high level of genetic similarity, for which the most plausible hypothesis is a point source contamination of the devices. Dissemination of bioaerosols through breaches in the HCU water tanks is the most likely route of transmission and airborne bacteria have been shown to have reached the surgical field even with the use of ultraclean theatre ventilation. Controlling the microbiological quality of the water circulating in HCUs and reducing biofilm formation has been a major challenge for many hospitals. However, enhanced decontamination strategies have been recommended by manufacturers, and, although they are not always effective in eradicating M. chimaera from HCUs, UK hospitals have not reported any new cases of M. chimaera infection since implementing these mitigation strategies. Water safety groups in hospitals should be aware that water in medical devices such as HCUs may act as a vector in the transmission of potentially fatal water-borne infections."

Background
Healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) remains a major international problem.
Aim
The ‘Best Care Always!’ (BCA) campaign was launched in South Africa to reduce preventable HCAI, including central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
Methods
The intervention took place in 43 Netcare Private Hospitals, increasing later to 49 with 958 intensive care units (ICUs) and 439 high-care (HC) beds and 1207 ICUs and 493 HC beds, respectively. Phase 1, April 2010 to March 2011, ICU infection prevention and control (IPC) nurse-driven change: commitment from management and doctors and training of IPC nurses. Bundle compliance and infections per 1000 central-line-days were incorporated as standard IPC measures and captured monthly. Phase 2, April 2011 to March 2012, breakthrough collaborative method: multiple regional learning sessions for nursing leaders, IPC nurses and unit managers. Phase 3, April 2012 to May 2016: sustained goal-setting, benchmarks, ongoing audits.
Findings
A total of 1,119,558 central-line-days were recorded. Bundle compliance improved significantly from a mean of 73.1% [standard deviation (SD): 11.2; range: 40.6–81.7%] in Phase 1 to a mean of 90.5% (SD: 4.7; range: 76.5–97.2%) in Phase 3 (P = 0.0004). The CLABSI rate declined significantly from a mean of 3.55 (SD: 0.82; range: 2.54–5.78) per 1000 central-line-days in Phase 1 to a mean of 0.13 (SD: 0.09; range: 0–0.33) (P < 0.0001).
Conclusion
This intervention, the first of its kind in South Africa, through considerable motivation and education, and through competition between hospitals resulted in significant decreases in CLABSI."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Carbapenem-resistant organism (CRO) colonization is a serious problem that increases the risk of infection and contributes to dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare-associated environments. The risk of acquisition and dissemination of CRO is high in chronic renal failure patients and the surveillance culture is recommended as a component of infection control programmes.
Aim
To assess colonization by CRO, comparing phenotypic and molecular-based methods of diagnostics, in rectal swabs in a large population of chronic renal failure patients.
Methods
A total of 1092 rectal swabs (ESwab™) were collected at two different times from 546 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients from a specialized tertiary care university centre. They were divided into three groups: conservative treatment (N = 129), dialysis (N = 217), and transplanted patients (N = 200). A chromogenic (CHROMagar™) KPC agar and the multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting carbapenemase-encoding genes were tested as phenotypic and molecular screening for carbapenemase production. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and conventional PCR were also performed on the isolates grown on chromogenic agar.
Findings
Among the 1092 samples, 150 (13.7%) were identified as CRO producers according to chromogenic agar. Only 26 (2.4%) were confirmed as KPC by conventional PCR. According to qPCR direct from swab, 31 (2.8%) were positive for KPC, 39 (3.6%) for GES, and three (0.3%) for SPM with kappa index of 0.256.
Conclusion
The qPCR technique provides faster results when compared to culture method and enables rapid implementation of control measures and interventions to reduce the spread of CRO in healthcare settings, especially among CKD patients."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Handwashing is viewed as the most important barrier to cross-infection. Incorrect use of clinical handwash basins may lead to cross-infection either from contaminated water or due to failure to decontaminate hands. Elbow-operated taps used correctly prevent recontamination of hands during operation. Many elbow-operated taps are installed incorrectly, with the handle flush with the back panel, making it difficult to open using the elbow.
Aim
To determine the effect of altering the angle of the handle of elbow-operated taps on handwashing technique.
Methods
An observational study was conducted using two rooms; in one the handles of the elbow-operated taps were flush with the inspection panel behind, and in the other they were set at 35°.
Findings
Thirty-five staff members washed their hands in both rooms. Hands were used to turn on the taps in 97% of instances. In 57% of washes hands were recontaminated when used to turn the tap off. Only six individuals consistently used their elbows to turn outlets off. Surprisingly, more individuals used their elbows to operate taps whose handles were flush with the inspection panel behind.
Conclusion
Greater emphasis needs to be placed on correct use of elbow-operated outlets. The decision to use elbow- or sensor-operated outlets is not clear-cut, as each has pros and cons. There is much room for improvement in design and standardization of handwash basins. Given the importance of handwashing it is surprising that these gaps exist."

Group A rotaviruses (RVA) are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in young (aged <5 years) children, causing ∼250,000 deaths worldwide, mostly in developing countries. Differences on nucleotide sequences of VP7 (G-type) and VP4 (P-type) genes are the basis for the binary RVA nomenclature. Although at least 32 G-types and 47 P-types of rotavirus are presently known, most RVA infections in humans worldwide are related to five major G/P combinations: G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], and G9P[8].
Aim
To provide the hospitals of the Italian surveillance network with update information on RVA AGE.
Methods
During RVA gastroenteritis surveillance in Italy in 2012–14, a total of 2341 RVA-positive faecal samples were collected from children hospitalized with AGE, and RVA strains were genotyped following standard EuroRotaNet protocols.
Findings
Most strains analysed belonged to the five major human genotypes and 118 out of 2341 (5.0%) were reported to be hospital-acquired. Comparison of the distributions of the RVA genotypes circulating in the community or associated with nosocomial infections showed a different distribution of genotypes circulating inside the hospital wards, with respect to those observed in the community. G1P[8] and G9P[8] RVA strains were detected frequently, whereas G12P[8] caused a single large nosocomial outbreak.
Conclusion
The information from this study will be useful to implement guidelines for preventing RVA AGE and optimizing the management of patients in hospital wards."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Previous work has shown that a ceiling-mounted, 405 nm high-intensity narrow-spectrum light environmental decontamination system (HINS-light EDS) reduces bacterial contamination of environmental surfaces in a burns unit by between 27% and 75%. Examination of the efficacy of the light over extended exposure times and its probable mode of action was performed.
Aim
To ascertain the correlation between bacterial kill achieved on sampled surface sites around the burns unit and both irradiance levels of the 405 nm light, and exposure time.
Methods
Seventy samples were taken using contact agar plates from surfaces within an occupied side-room in the burns unit before, during, and after a seven-day use of the HINS-light EDS. This was repeated in three separate studies. Statistical analysis determined whether there was significant decrease in environmental contamination during prolonged periods of HINS-light treatment, and whether there was an association between irradiance and bacterial kill.
Findings
A decrease of between 22% and 86% in the mean number of surface bacteria was shown during the use of the HINS-light EDS. When the light ceased to be used, increases of between 78% and 309% occurred. There was no correlation between bacterial kill and irradiance levels at each sampling site but strong correlation between bacterial kill and exposure time.
Conclusion
Prolonged exposure to the HINS-light EDS causes a cumulative decontamination of the surfaces within a burns unit. The importance of exposure time and possible airborne effect over irradiance levels is emphasized."

Background
During functionality testing and packaging of reusable surgical instruments (RSI) for sterilization, instruments are frequently touched. There is a lack of standards relating to hand hygiene frequency and use of gloves in the sterilizing service unit packing area.
Aim
To determine the effect of hand hygiene and glove use on maintenance of RSI cleanliness.
Methods
Following manual and automated cleaning, Halsted-mosquito forceps were assessed for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), protein and microbial contamination after handling with gloved and ungloved but washed hands using an ATP surface swab test, bicinchoninic acid assay, and standard culture plate/broth, respectively. Gram's stain was used to classify the isolates. RSI contamination was assessed immediately following and 1, 2, and 4 h after washing hands.
Findings
Packing instruments with hands that had been unwashed for 2 or 4 h resulted in a significant increase in contaminating ATP when compared with all other treatment groups (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the time since washing hands, the amount of ATP (r = 0.93; P ≤ 0.001), and the microbial load (r = 0.83; P ≤ 0.001) contaminating the forceps, where the longer the time the hands remained unwashed the higher the contamination. Significantly more contaminating protein was found on forceps handled with ungloved hands that had not been washed for 2 or 4 h (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
Critical RSI inspection, assembling, lubricating and packing should be performed using either gloves or within 1 h of washing hands."

Background and aim
Prompted by an article describing a dog trained to detect Clostridium difficile in patients, our institution evaluated a dog's ability to detect C. difficile scent from equipment and surfaces to assist in strategic deployment of adjunctive cleaning measures.
Methods
An expert in drug and explosives scent dog handling trained a canine to identify odours from pure cultures and/or faecal specimens positive for C. difficile. Methods used to assess explosive and drug detection dogs were adapted and included evaluation of (i) odour recognition, using containers positive and negative for the scent of C. difficile, and of (ii) search capability, on a simulation ward with hidden scents. After demonstration that the canine could accurately and reliably detect the scent of C. difficile, formal assessments of all clinical areas began.
Findings
Odour recognition (N = 75 containers) had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97%. Search capability was 80% sensitive and 92.9% specific after removal of results from one room where dog and trainer fatigue influenced performance. Both odour recognition and search capability had an overall sensitivity of 92.3% and specificity of 95.4%. The clinical unit sweeps over a period of five months revealed a sensitivity of 100% in alerting on positive quality control hides. These clinical unit sweeps also resulted in 83 alerts during 49 sweep days.
Conclusion
A dog can be trained to accurately and reliably detect C. difficile odour from environmental sources to guide the best deployment of adjunctive cleaning measures and can be successfully integrated into a quality infection control programme."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization in young children. In addition to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), other viruses have been increasingly implicated. Guidance on testing has also changed.
Aims
To compare clinicopathological outcomes in young children admitted with bronchiolitis due to RSV in comparison with rhinovirus (RV), and identify associated risk/epidemiological factors.
Methods
Children aged less than two years admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis with positive results for either RSV or RV were included in this study. Polymerase-chain-reaction-negative cases using an extended respiratory virus panel served as a control group. Retrospective data were collected on sex, risk factors, respiratory support, intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Outcomes such as length of stay (LOS) and need for transfer to the high-dependency unit/paediatric intensive care unit were included.
Findings
Two hundred and twenty-seven out of 437 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were positive for either RSV (N = 162) or RV (N = 65). The median age of cases was three months and 75% had at least one risk factor. Risk factors were higher in the RV group (P = 0.004). RV accounted for the majority of cases outside the RSV season (P < 0.01). RV-associated bronchiolitis had a longer LOS (more than seven days) (P < 0.05) and increased need for chest X-rays and/or antibiotics (P < 0.05). Use of intravenous fluids and respiratory support were higher in the RV group, but the difference was not significant.
Conclusions
RV is the second most common pathogen associated with bronchiolitis and is isolated all year round. This may be important in those with risk factors resulting in prolonged LOS. Further research is necessary to establish the exact role of RV in this common condition, particularly outside the traditional RSV season."

Background
Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) may be placed on contact isolation for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization to prevent transmission. Prior studies suggest that isolated patients may receive substandard care compared with non-isolated patients. An optimal level of sedation is required to facilitate mechanical ventilation (MV) and to minimize adverse outcomes.
Aim
To determine if patients on MV and isolated for MRSA colonization are at increased risk of oversedation compared with non-isolated patients.
Methods
Retrospective chart review of adult patients on MV who received an MRSA nasal polymerase chain reaction assay and sedation within 24 and 48 h of ICU admission, respectively. Endpoints included rate of inappropriate sedation, length of ICU stay, length of time on MV, and incidence of ventilator-associated complications.
Findings
In total, 226 patients were included (114 MRSA positive, 112 MRSA negative). Baseline demographics were similar between the groups, with the exception of ICU admission diagnosis. Fifty-six (55%) isolated patients experienced inappropriate sedation compared with 49 (50%) non-isolated patients (P=0.482). Isolated patients spent longer in the ICU (10.4 vs 6.8 days, P=0.0006), longer on MV (8.98 vs 4.81 days, P<0.001), and required tracheostomies more frequently [37 (32%) vs 14 (13%), P=0.0003] than non-isolated patients.
Conclusions
Isolated patients were not at increased risk of oversedation compared with non-isolated patients. There was an association between the use of contact isolation for MRSA nares colonization and prolonged ICU stay and prolonged MV."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Silver-based products have been marketed as an alternative to antibiotics, and their consumption has increased. Bacteria may, however, develop resistance to silver.
Aim
To study the presence of genes encoding silver resistance (silE, silP, silS) over time in three clinically important Enterobacteriaceae genera.
Methods
Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 752 bloodstream isolates from the years 1990–2010 were investigated. Age, gender, and ward of patients were registered, and the susceptibility to antibiotics and silver nitrate was tested. Clonality and single nucleotide polymorphism were assessed with repetitive element sequence-based PCR, multi-locus sequence typing, and whole-genome sequencing.
Findings
Genes encoding silver resistance were detected most frequently in Enterobacter spp. (48%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (41%) and Escherichia coli 4%. Phenotypical resistance to silver nitrate was found in Enterobacter (13%) and Klebsiella (3%) isolates. The lowest carriage rate of sil genes was observed in blood isolates from the neonatology ward (24%), and the highest in blood isolates from the oncology/haematology wards (66%). Presence of sil genes was observed in international high-risk clones. Sequences of the sil and pco clusters indicated that a single mutational event in the silS gene could have caused the phenotypic resistance.
Conclusion
Despite a restricted consumption of silver-based products in Swedish health care, silver resistance genes are widely represented in clinical isolates of Enterobacter and Klebsiella species. To avoid further selection and spread of silver-resistant bacteria with a high potential for healthcare-associated infections, the use of silver-based products needs to be controlled and the silver resistance monitored."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The impact of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) on mortality is controversial.
Aim
To assess excess mortality due to CDI in France.
Method
Two cohorts of patients with CDI and a cohort of matched controls were extracted from a 1% representative sample of subjects covered by the general health insurance system in France (Echantillon Généraliste de Bénéficiaires database, 660,000 patients). The CDI patients were hospitalized with CDI as a principal diagnosis or an associated diagnosis between 2007 and 2014, but not in 2006. Controls were patients hospitalized between 2007 and 2014 but not hospitalized with CDI between 2006 and 2014. The one-year incidence of deaths between 2007 and 2014 was estimated and compared with that of a propensity score (PS)-matched control group with no CDI (two controls per case). The PS was calculated with the following variables: age; sex; Charlson Comorbidity Index score; duration of stay; year of index stay; and main comorbidities. Cox and Poisson models were used to estimate the increased risk of death while adjusting for PS. Sensitivity analyses (timeframe, diarrhoea, recurrent hospitalization for CDI) were used to explore the robustness of the results.
Findings
In total, 482 patients who had been infected with C. difficile were matched with 964 controls. A significantly higher risk of death was observed among the subjects with CDI, with a non-adjusted hazard ratio of 1.65 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33–2.04] and an adjusted ratio of 1.58 (95% CI 1.27–1.97). The adjusted relative risk of death was 1.78 (95% CI 1.18–2.70]) at 28 days, 1.52 (95% CI 1.17–1.98) at three months, 1.52 (95% CI 1.20–1.93) at six months and 1.64 (95% CI 1.32–2.03) at 12 months. Sensitivity analyses produced similar results; the hazard ratio ranged from 1.53 to 1.86, and was always statistically significant.
Conclusion
CDI is responsible for excess mortality after taking age, sex, comorbidities and length of hospital stay into account."

Background
Healthcare-associated infections by drug-resistant bacteria affect a patient's prognosis. Infection control activities at medical institutions in Japan are increasingly focused on the threat from these bacteria.
Aim
To undertake a full cost analysis that included the costs of consumables and labour required for infection control activities.
Methods
The cost of infection control activities undertaken by the infection control team (ICT) at Nishimino Kosei Hospital in Japan was surveyed from January 2013 to December 2015. The evaluation index of infection control activities used the meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus detection rate. The cost:effectiveness ratio (CER) of each intervention was calculated.
Findings
Consumables and labour costs increased over time, as did the ratio of labour cost to total cost over time. However, the CER of interventions was found to have decreased, from ¥164,177 in 2014 to ¥57,989 in 2015. There were increases not only in the amount of consumables, but also in ICT time, suggesting the possibility of improvements in the economic efficiency of infection control.
Conclusion
Increasing the amount of consumables and the time input of the ICT could help improve the economic efficiency of infection control. Our research suggests the possibility for improvements in the economic efficiency of infection control."

Background
Healthcare workers (HCWs) face specific challenges in infectious disease outbreaks, which provide unusual, new events with exposure risk. The fear of infection or new, unknown tasks in an unfamiliar setting, for example, may complicate outbreak management.
Aim
To gain insight into how healthcare organizations can prepare to meet the needs of their HCWs by capturing the experiences of HCWs with patients with suspected Ebola virus disease.
Methods
We conducted 23 in-depth interviews with HCWs, of whom 20 worked in a Dutch university hospital and three worked in a regional ambulance service. We invited HCWs who cared for patients with suspected Ebola or who were on the team preparing for admission of such patients in the period 2014–2015.
Findings
The HCWs were stressed and anxious, but most rated their overall experience as positive. We categorized the reported experiences in three main themes, namely, experiences related to: (i) the novelty of the threat, (ii) the risk of infection and fear of transmission, and (iii) the excessive attention. Our results underline the importance of a supportive working environment suitable for crises.
Conclusion
The experiences of HCWs dealing with patients with suspected Ebola can direct improvements in generic preparedness for highly transmissible diseases."

Background
New technologies for automated disinfection have been developed, including the use of hydrogen peroxide atomized by specific equipment, with associated silver compounds.
Aims
To compare the effectiveness of an automated disinfection system with hydrogen peroxide <8% and silver ion versus a manual method with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution when evaluating the reduction of microbial mesophilic contamination and Clostridium difficile presence; and to evaluate the time required for both of these processes.
Methods
This was a randomized multicentre trial performed in different hospital wards that had been occupied previously by patients with Clostridium difficile infection. When patients were discharged their rooms were randomized to one of two decontamination arms. The surfaces where sampled using swabs, before and after disinfection. Swab samples were cultured for quantitative detection of microbial mesophilic contamination and qualitative detection of C. difficile.
Findings
Before disinfection, 13% of surfaces decontaminated with hydrogen peroxide and silver ions and 20% of surfaces decontaminated with sodium hypochlorite showed presence of C. difficile spores. After disinfection, the samples containing C. difficile were 0% (P < 0.001) in the group decontaminated with hydrogen peroxide and silver ions, and were 3% (P < 0.001) in the group decontaminated with sodium hypochlorite. This difference was not statistically significant; nor was the difference in the reduction of the microbial mesophilic contamination.
Conclusion
The differences between the groups were not statistically significant; however, the disinfection with hydrogen peroxide and silver ions is preferable due to less dependence on operators."

Background
A national voluntary surveillance programme has shown year-on-year increases in the number of bacteraemias caused by Escherichia coli. Mandatory surveillance of E. coli bacteraemia was introduced in 2011 with the aim of improving the quantity and quality of data collected. In contrast to the other national mandatory surveillance programmes, cases are not currently categorized based upon time of onset in relation to hospital admission.
Aim
To assess the case for applying time-of-onset categorization to cases of E. coli bacteraemia in England.
Methods
Data for all cases of E. coli bacteraemia reported to Public Health England between April 2012 and March 2016 were extracted from the national mandatory surveillance database. Cases were categorized as hospital-onset if positive blood cultures were obtained two or more days after admission.
Results
Approximately 21% of cases were categorized as hospital-onset. However, the proportion of hospital-onset cases decreased by 1% in each successive 12-month period, from 23% in 2012/13 to 20% in 2015/16 (P<0.001).
Conclusions
Approximately one-fifth of E. coli bacteraemia cases reported via mandatory surveillance were identified as hospital-onset. Given that prevention and control strategies will vary by setting, the routine feedback of this information will prove important in informing infection prevention and control efforts. The categorization of this subset of cases represents an important step towards better understanding of the epidemiology of E. coli bacteraemia."

Sensitivity values for UTIs, BSIs and PNEU were 85.3%, 74.0% and 66.7%, and specificity values were 98.7%, 99.1% and 98.7%, respectively. Positive predictive values were 85.3%, 94.7% and 78.3%, and negative predictive values were 98.7%, 94.6% and 97.7%, respectively. Sensitivity for PNEU was lower than that for UTIs and BSIs. The hospitals participating in KONIS infrequently reported conditions that were not HAIs. Sensitivity for BSIs was lower in this study than in KONIS validation studies conducted in 2008 and 2010.
Conclusions
KONIS data are generally reliable; however, sensitivity for BSIs exhibited a decrease. This study shows the need for ongoing validation and continuous training of surveillance personnel to maintain the accuracy of surveillance data."

Background
Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) challenge public health in developing countries such as Brazil, which harbour social inequalities and variations in the complexity of healthcare and regional development.
Aim
To describe the prevalence of HCAIs in hospitals in a sample of hospitals in Brazil.
Methods
A prevalence survey conducted in 2011–13 enrolled 152 hospitals from the five macro-regions in Brazil. Hospitals were classified as large (≥200 beds), medium (50–199 beds) or small sized (<50 beds). Settings were randomly selected from a governmental database, except for 11 reference university hospitals. All patients with >48 h of admission to the study hospitals at the time of the survey were included. Trained epidemiologist nurses visited each hospital and collected data on HCAIs, subjects' demographics, and invasive procedures. Univariate and multivariate techniques were used for data analysis.
Findings
The overall HCAI prevalence was 10.8%. Most frequent infection sites were pneumonia (3.6%) and bloodstream infections (2.8%). Surgical site infections were found in 1.5% of the whole sample, but in 9.8% of subjects who underwent surgical procedures. The overall prevalence was greater for reference (12.6%) and large hospitals (13.5%), whereas medium- and small-sized hospitals presented rates of 7.7% and 5.5%, respectively. Only minor differences were noticed among hospitals from different macro-regions. Patients in intensive care units, using invasive devices or at extremes of age were at greater risk for HCAIs.
Conclusion
Prevalence rates were high in all geographic regions and hospital sizes. HCAIs must be a priority in the public health agenda of developing countries."

The combination of personal protective equipment (PPE) together with donning and doffing protocols was designed to protect British and Canadian military medical personnel in the Kerry Town Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) in Sierra Leone. The PPE solution was selected to protect medical staff from infectious risks, notably Ebola virus, and chemical (hypochlorite) exposure. PPE maximized dexterity, enabled personnel to work in hot temperatures for periods of up to 2h, protected mucosal membranes when doffing outer layers, and minimized potential contamination of the doffing area with infectious material by reducing the requirement to spray PPE with hypochlorite. The ETU was equipped to allow medical personnel to provide a higher level of care than witnessed in many existing ETUs. This assured personnel working as part of the international response that they would receive as close to Western treatment standards as possible if they were to contract Ebola virus disease (EVD). PPE also enabled clinical interventions that are not seen routinely in West African EVD treatment regimens, whilst providing a robust protective barrier. Competency in using PPE was developed during a nine-day pre-deployment training programme. This allowed over 60 clinical personnel per deployment to practice skills in PPE in a simulated ETU and in classrooms. Overall, the training provided: (i) an evidence base underpinning the PPE solution chosen; (ii) skills in donning and doffing of PPE; (iii) personnel confidence in the selected PPE; and (iv) quantifiable testing of each individual's capability to don PPE, perform tasks and doff PPE safely."

Background
A new process for packaging endoscopes (SureStore®, Medical Innovations Group) immediately after they exit from washing and disinfection in an automated endoscope reprocessor (AER) allows for endoscopes to be stored for up to 15 days.
Aim
To describe the microbiological quality of samples from gastrointestinal endoscopes following this process.
Methods
Three-month prospective study using microbiological sampling from a stock of 38 gastrointestinal endoscopes carried out in a French University Hospital. The compliance rate (proportion of samples ≤25 cfu with no pathogenic micro-organisms) and the rate of sterile samples (proportion of germ-free samples) were calculated. We then used multivariate analysis to determine the factors associated with the maintenance of sterility.
Findings
One hundred samples were taken from stored endoscopes: 31 stored for ≤3 days, 34 stored between 3 and 7 days, and 35 after storage between 7 and 15 days. The compliance rate was 98% and the sterile sample rate was 60%. Only the time between leaving the AER and packaging was significantly associated with the sterility of samples (P = 0.02). The probability of having a sterile sample decreased 17-fold when the endoscope was packaged >2 h after leaving the AER (P = 0.04) compared to an endoscope packaged within 1 h after leaving the AER.
Conclusion
The SureStore process seems capable of satisfactorily maintaining compliance (98%) of samples taken from endoscopes stored for up to 15 days. The delay in packaging should not exceed 1 h, as the rate of sterile samples decreases thereafter."

Background
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has emerged as an important opportunistic pathogen, especially in patients who are immunocompromised, suffering from malignancy or have been hospitalized for a prolonged period. Information of this bacterium in Thailand has not been elucidated.
Aims
To investigate the phenotype and genotype of environmental and clinical isolates of S. maltophilia in Songklanagarind Hospital, southern Thailand.
Methods
Isolates of S. maltophilia were collected from various environmental sources on three hospital wards and clinical samples from seven wards. Antibiotic susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing were performed using disk diffusion and E-test, respectively. Isolates were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
Findings
The majority of S. maltophilia environmental isolates were from sink drains (67.5%), followed by drinking water (18.7%) and tap water (7.5%). Clinical isolates of the bacterium mainly originated from sputum samples (56.2% of all isolates). Antibiotic resistance was more common in clinical isolates than in environmental isolates; resistance to co-trimoxazole was associated with the presence of the sul1 gene. The MIC values for ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole correlated closely with the results obtained from disk diffusion assay. DNA profile analysis revealed seven clusters with high diversity among the isolates.
Conclusion
No genotypic relationship was detected between isolates from environmental and clinical samples. As such, acquisition of this bacterium may occur outside the hospital."

Background
Israel experienced a national outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) starting in 2006.
Aim
To assess the association between infection control (IC) interventions implemented in a referral hospital in Israel and CRE incidence.
Methods
Retrospective quasi-experimental study of prospectively collected data. CRE incidence, defined as the number of patients newly acquiring CRE in surveillance or clinical samples per 100,000 hospital-days, was plotted quarterly between 2005 and 2016. IC interventions were applied at different time-points throughout this period. Data were collected on IC staffing, number of rectal surveillance cultures, and carbapenem consumption. Autocorrelated segmented linear regression analysis was used to assess the time-points at which a significant change in the CRE incidence trend occurred, and the association between the timing of IC intervention implementation and observed CRE trends was assessed. Trends between time-points were expressed as quarterly percent change (QPC) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Findings
Between 2005 and 2008, CRE incidence increased significantly (QPC: 19.7%; CI: 11.5–28.4), reaching a peak of 186.6 new acquisitions per 100,000 hospital-days. From mid-2011 until the end of follow-up, there was a significantly decreasing incidence trend (QPC: −4.5; CI: –6.4 to –2.5). Cohorting of patients, screening of contacts and high-risk patients on admission were insufficient to control the epidemic. Improved hand hygiene compliance, cohorting with dedicated nursing staff, addition of regular screening in high-risk departments, and carbapenem restriction were required. Decreasing CRE incidence was observed with an infectious diseases/IC staffing of 1.2–1.5 per 100 beds and 20,000–36,000 yearly CRE surveillance samples.
Conclusion
A multi-faceted hospital-wide intervention programme is required to control CRE in hospital settings."

abstract = "Summary
Most hand hygiene guidelines recommend that gloves should be changed during patient care when an indication for hand disinfection occurs. Observational studies indicate that the majority of healthcare workers (HCWs) do not disinfect their hands at all during continued glove wear. The aim of this narrative review is to assess the potential benefits and risks for disinfecting gloved hands during patient care for multiple activities with indicated glove use on the same patient. Continued glove wear for multiple activities on the same patient often results in performing procedures, including aseptic procedures with contaminated gloves, especially in a setting where there are many indications in a short time, e.g. anaesthetics or accident and emergency departments. Of further note is that hand hygiene compliance is often lower when gloves are worn. To date, three independent studies have shown that decontamination is at least as effective on gloved hands as on bare hands and that puncture rates are usually not higher after up to 10 disinfections. One study on a neonatal intensive care unit showed that promotion of disinfecting gloved hands during care on the same patient resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of late-onset infections and of necrotizing enterocolitis. We conclude that disinfection of gloved hands by HCWs may substantially reduce the risk of transmission when gloves are indicated for the entire episode of patient care and when performed during multiple activities on the same patient."

Background
Hand hygiene is considered to be the foremost infection prevention measure. How healthcare workers accept and make sense of the hand hygiene message is likely to contribute to the success and sustainability of initiatives to improve performance, which is often poor.
Methods
A survey of nurses in critical care units in three National Health Service trusts in England was undertaken to explore opinions about hand hygiene, use of alcohol hand rubs, audit with performance feedback, and other key hand-hygiene-related issues. Data were analysed descriptively and subjected to cluster analysis.
Results
Three main clusters of opinion were visualized, each forming a significant group: positive attitudes, pragmatism and scepticism. A smaller cluster suggested possible guilt about ability to perform hand hygiene.
Conclusion
Cluster analysis identified previously unsuspected constellations of beliefs about hand hygiene that offer a plausible explanation for behaviour. Healthcare workers might respond to education and audit differently according to these beliefs. Those holding predominantly positive opinions might comply with hand hygiene policy and perform well as infection prevention link nurses and champions. Those holding pragmatic attitudes are likely to respond favourably to the need for professional behaviour and need to protect themselves from infection. Greater persuasion may be needed to encourage those who are sceptical about the importance of hand hygiene to comply with guidelines. Interventions to increase compliance should be sufficiently broad in scope to tackle different beliefs. Alternatively, cluster analysis of hand hygiene beliefs could be used to identify the most effective educational and monitoring strategies for a particular clinical setting."

National enhanced surveillance of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) commenced on 1st October 2014 to gain a more in-depth understanding of the epidemiology of SAB in Scotland. Children under 16 years of age were analysed separately from adults because previous studies had demonstrated epidemiological differences.
Aim
To identify risk factors and patient populations at greatest risk to enable the development of focused improvement plans.
Methods
All National Health Service (NHS) boards within NHS Scotland take part in the mandatory enhanced surveillance, with data collected by trained data collectors using nationally agreed definitions.
Findings
Analysis of the first 18 months of data showed that hospital-acquired SAB was mostly associated with neonates with device risk factors, whereas community-associated SAB was found in older children who had few, if any, risk factors and most presented with a bone or joint infection.
Conclusion
The enhanced SAB data highlighted the difference in risk factors and entry points for the acquisition of SAB within the paediatric population."

Background
Severity or mortality prediction of nosocomial pneumonia could aid in the effective triage of patients and assisting physicians.
Aim
To compare various severity assessment scoring systems for predicting intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in nosocomial pneumonia patients.
Methods
A prospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care university-affiliated hospital in Manipal, India. One hundred patients with nosocomial pneumonia, admitted in the ICUs who developed pneumonia after >48h of admission, were included. The Nosocomial Pneumonia Mortality Prediction (NPMP) model, developed in our hospital, was compared with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Mortality Probability Model II (MPM72 II), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia Predisposition, Insult, Response, Organ dysfunction (VAP-PIRO). Data and clinical variables were collected on the day of pneumonia diagnosis. The outcome for the study was ICU mortality. The sensitivity and specificity of the various scoring systems was analysed by plotting receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and computing the area under the curve for each of the mortality predicting tools.
Findings
NPMP, APACHE II, SAPS II, MPM72 II, SOFA, and VAP-PIRO were found to have similar and acceptable discrimination power as assessed by the area under the ROC curve. The AUC values for the above scores ranged from 0.735 to 0.762. CPIS and MODS showed least discrimination.
Conclusion
NPMP is a specific tool to predict mortality in nosocomial pneumonia and is comparable to other standard scores."

Background
Bed closures due to acute gastroenteritis put hospitals under pressure each winter. In England, the National Health Service (NHS) has monitored the winter situation for all acute trusts since 2010/11.
Aim
To estimate the burden, duration and costs of hospital bed closures due to acute gastroenteritis in winter.
Methods
A retrospective analysis of routinely collected time-series data of bed closures due to diarrhoea and vomiting was conducted for the winters 2010/11 to 2015/16. Two key issues were addressed by imputing non-randomly missing values at provider level, and filtering observations to a range of dates recorded in all six winters. The lowest and highest values imputed were taken to represent the best- and worst-case scenarios. Bed-days were costed using NHS reference costs, and potential staff absence costs were based on previous studies.
Findings
In the best-to-worst case, a median of 88,000–113,000 beds were closed due to gastroenteritis each winter. Of these, 19.6–20.4% were unoccupied. On average, 80% of providers were affected, and had closed beds for a median of 15–21 days each winter. Hospital costs of closed beds were £5.7–£7.5 million, which increased to £6.9–£10.0 million when including staff absence costs due to illness.
Conclusions
The median number of hospital beds closed due to acute gastroenteritis per winter was equivalent to all general and acute hospital beds in England being unavailable for a median of 0.88–1.12 days. Costs for hospitals are high but vary with closures each winter."

Inadequate drying of endoscope channels is a possible cause of replication and survival of remaining pathogens during storage. The presence during storage of potentially contaminated water in endoscope channels may promote bacterial proliferation and biofilm formation. An incomplete drying procedure or lack of drying and not storing in a vertical position are the most usual problems identified during drying and endoscope storage. Inadequate drying and storage procedures, together with inadequate cleaning and disinfection, are the most important sources of endoscope contamination and post-endoscopic infection. Flexible endoscopes may be dried in automated endoscope reprocessors (AERs), manually, or in drying/storage cabinets. Flushing of the endoscope channels with 70–90% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol followed by forced air drying is recommended by several guidelines. Current guidelines recommend that flexible endoscopes are stored in a vertical position in a closed, ventilated cupboard. Drying and storage cabinets have a drying system that circulates and forces the dry filtered air through the endoscope channels. Endoscope reprocessing guidelines are inconsistent with one another or give no exact recommendations about drying and storage of flexible endoscopes. There is no conclusive evidence on the length of time endoscopes can be safely stored before requiring re-disinfection and before they pose a contamination risk. To minimize the risk of disease transmission and nosocomial infection, modification and revision of guidelines are recommended as required to be consistent with one another."

Background
Carbapenem-resistant (CR), Gram-negative (GN), late-onset sepsis (LOS) is a serious threat in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
Aim
To assess the prevalence of CR-GN-LOS in NICU patients and to identify the risk factors and outcomes associated with its acquisition.
Methods
Neonates with carbapenem-susceptible (CS)-GN-LOS were compared with those with CR-GN-LOS in a two-year observational study.
Findings
A total of 158 patients had GN-LOS; 100 infants had CS-GN-LOS and 58 infants had CR-GN-LOS. The incidence rate of CR-GN-LOS was 6.5 cases per 1000 patient-days. The most frequent bacterial strain in both groups was Klebsiella pneumoniae. The duration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (P=0.006) and prior carbapenem use (P=0.01) were independent risk factors for CR-GN-LOS acquisition. CR-GN-LOS was associated with higher mortality than CS-GN-LOS (P=0.04). Birth weight, small for gestational age, time to start enteral feeding, exclusive formula feeding, previous surgery, previous antifungal use, central venous device before onset, duration of central venous device, and infectious complications were identified as dependent risk factors for overall mortality. However, only male gender (P=0.04) and infectious complications (P < 0.001) were independent risk factors associated with mortality. Infectious complication rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay were significantly higher in infants with CR compared to CS-GN-LOS.
Conclusion
The duration of TPN and carbapenem use were the independent predictors for CR-GN-LOS acquisition. CR-GN-LOS is associated with higher mortality, infectious complication rates, longer mechanical ventilation, and longer hospital stay. Male gender and infectious complications were the independent risk factors for mortality in neonates with GN-LOS."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Contact precautions are a widely accepted strategy to reduce in-hospital transmission of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). However, these practices may have unintended deleterious effects on patients.
Aim
To evaluate the effect of a modification in hospital-wide contact precaution practices on emergency department (ED) admission times.
Methods
During the study period, the hospital changed its contact precaution policy from requiring contact precautions for all patients with a history of MRSA or VRE to only those who presented with clinical conditions likely to contaminate the environment with pathogens. An interrupted time series analysis of ED admission times for adults for one year preceding and one year following this change was performed at a two-campus hospital. The main outcome was admission time, defined as time from decision to admit to arrival in an inpatient bed, for patients with MRSA or VRE compared with all other patients. The in-hospital MRSA and VRE acquisition rates were evaluated over the same period and have been published previously.
Findings
At one campus, admission time decreased immediately by 161min for MRSA patients (P=0.008) and 135min for VRE patients (P=0.003), and both continued to decrease over the duration of the study. There was no significant change in admission time at the second campus.
Conclusions
Modifying contact precaution requirements for MRSA and VRE may be associated with improved ED admission time without significantly altering in-hospital MRSA and VRE acquisition."

Background
Very-low-birthweight (VLBW) neonates (<1500g) comprise approximately 1% of liveborn infants in Poland. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common complication of prematurity. This study aimed to determine how many VLBW neonates treated in the participating units needed surgical correction of PDA, and to evaluate the incidence of various types of postoperative infections and their microbiology.
Methods
Observational study in five neonatology departments by the Polish Neonatology Surveillance Network, involving 2039 VLBW newborns of whom 103 (5.1%) required surgical PDA ligation. Continuous infection surveillance was conducted between 2009 and 2013; infections were defined based on Gastmeier's criteria.
Results
PDA surgery was required significantly more frequently in infants from multiple pregnancies, and where labour was complicated by amnionitis. Surgical PDA correction was performed, on average, at 19 days of life. The incidence of infection was 48.5% (N = 50), and the most common infections were bloodstream infection (26.2%) and pneumonia (22.3%). A correlation was observed between the day on which the procedure was performed and the time of infection: the earlier the neonate underwent PDA surgery, the earlier the infection manifested (P = 0.032). A high CRIB score and chorioamnionitis contributed significantly to the presence of infection.
Conclusion
The later the PDA surgery was performed, the later the infection occurred. The incidence of infection after correction of PDA among VLBW neonates was comparable with the incidence of infection among all hospitalized VLBW neonates."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections have been linked to contaminated hospital taps, highlighting the potential for tap outlet fittings (OF) to harbour biofilm. P. aeruginosa may be transferred to OFs via contaminated cleaning cloths. Suggested interventions include flushing regimens and alternative OF designs.
Aim
To investigate the transfer of P. aeruginosa from a contaminated cleaning cloth to conventional and ‘antimicrobial/antibiofilm’ OFs and to determine whether this contamination persists and/or leads to contamination of tap water.
Methods
Microfibre cloths contaminated with P. aeruginosa (108 cfu/mL) were used to wipe four different types of OF [one of conventional design (OF-A) and three marketed as ‘antimicrobial’ and/or ‘antibiofilm’ (OF- B, -C and -D)]. OFs were inserted into an experimental water distribution system for up to 24 h. Survival was assessed by culture. Single and multiple water samples were collected and cultured for P. aeruginosa.
Findings
The median number of P. aeruginosa transferred from cloth to OF was 5.7 × 105 cfu (OF-A), 1.9 × 106 cfu (OF-B), 1.4 × 105 cfu (OF-C) and 2.9 × 106 cfu (OF-D). Numbers declined on all OFs during the 24 h period with log reductions ranging from 3.5 (OF-C) to 5.2 (OF-B; P > 0.05). All water samples delivered immediately after OF contamination contained P. aeruginosa at ≥10 cfu per 100 mL. Contamination of water delivered from OF-A persisted despite continued flushing. Water delivered from OF-B did not contain P. aeruginosa beyond the first flush.
Conclusion
Contaminated cleaning cloths may transfer P. aeruginosa to OFs, leading to contamination of tap water. Although not removing the potential for contamination, ‘antimicrobial/antibiofilm’ OFs may prevent P. aeruginosa from continually contaminating water delivered from the outlet."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Norovirus outbreak management comprises isolation and cohorting of patients. In this context, exposed patients are preferably cohorted separately from symptomatic and unexposed asymptomatic patients, since they potentially develop symptoms of norovirus gastroenteritis. Whether routinely examined clinical or laboratory parameters can help to predict occurrence of gastroenteritis symptoms in those patients has not yet been examined.
Aim
To evaluate routinely examined clinical and laboratory parameters as predictive values for the development of norovirus symptoms in exposed patients during outbreaks.
Methods
Exposed patients during norovirus outbreaks were observed throughout a two-year period in the university hospital of Muenster. The development of laboratory-confirmed norovirus gastroenteritis symptoms was examined in exposed patients, and clinical as well as laboratory parameters prior to onset of the outbreak were compared in exposed symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Findings
We detected 42 exposed patients within 10 outbreaks. Of these, 33 remained asymptomatic, whereas nine patients developed norovirus gastroenteritis. Exposed symptomatic patients were significantly older (50±10.51 vs 28±4.68 years), had significantly higher blood sodium concentration (142.5±1.48 vs 138.8±0.47mmol/L) and higher systolic blood pressure (119.3±3.84 vs 108.5±2.41mmHg). Development of symptoms among exposed patients was significantly associated with blood type O (75% vs 20%).
Conclusion
In order to minimize patient-to-patient transmission within norovirus outbreaks in hospital, risk stratification of exposed patients is helpful. To achieve this, routinely detected clinical and laboratory parameters can be useful to predict development of symptoms in these patients."

Background
Whereas Klebsiella species are the most frequently occurring agents in nosocomial outbreaks due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms, very few outbreaks have been reported from rehabilitation wards.
Aim
To describe a long-lasting outbreak due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing (ESBL) Klebsiella pneumoniae in a rehabilitation ward.
Methods
ESBL K. pneumoniae from all in- and outpatients whose specimens were tested at a tertiary care university hospital between 2007 and 2012 were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and selected isolates were submitted to multi-locus sequence typing and ESBL genotyping. Outbreak characteristics and infection control interventions were summarized. The literature was searched for K. pneumoniae-related outbreaks in rehabilitation wards.
Findings
ESBL K. pneumoniae was detected in 69 out of 2478 K. pneumoniae-positive patients (2.8%) during the study period. Eight related outbreak clones from 35 patients, 25 of whom were in the rehabilitation ward, produced CTX-M-15 and belonged to ST336. The outbreak lasted for more than three years and was controlled by sequentially increasing measures culminating in review of all patient-related care, compulsory educational meetings for personnel, profession-specific guidelines and educational flyers for patients.
Conclusion
Half of ESBL K. pneumoniae-positive patients identified over six years at a tertiary care university hospital harboured related clones, and more than a third were hospitalized in a rehabilitation ward. Rehabilitation wards pose particular challenges for infection control because of patient dependency and an environment that encourages socializing. They are, however, rarely involved in K. pneumoniae-related outbreaks."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Patients with chronic renal failure who require haemodialysis are at high risk for infections.
Aim
To determine the burden of bloodstream and local access-related infections and the prescribing patterns for intravenous antibiotics in Australian haemodialysis outpatients.
Methods
A surveillance network was established following stakeholder consultation, with voluntary participation by haemodialysis centres and data collation by the Victorian Healthcare Associated Infection Surveillance System Coordinating Centre. Definitions for infection and intravenous antimicrobial starts were based upon methods employed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Longitudinal mixed-effects Poisson regression was used to model time-trends for the period 2008–2015.
Findings
Forty-eight of 78 Victorian dialysis centres participated in the network, with 3449 events reported over 78,826 patient-months. Rates of bloodstream infection, local infection and intravenous antimicrobial starts were much higher for patients with tunnelled central lines (2.60, 1.41, and 3.37 per 100 patient-months, respectively), compared to those with arteriovenous fistulae (0.27, 0.23, and 0.73 per 100 patient-months, respectively) and arteriovenous grafts (0.76, 1.08, 1.50 per 100 patient-months, respectively). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent pathogen, with meticillin-resistant isolates (MRSA) responsible for 14.0%. Access-related infections diminished significantly across all vascular-access modalities over time. Vancomycin contributed nearly half of all antimicrobial starts consistently throughout the study period.
Conclusion
Risk for bloodstream and local access-related infections is highest in Australian haemodialysis patients with tunnelled central lines. S. aureus is the most frequent cause of infection, with a low incidence of MRSA. Future programmes should evaluate infection prevention practices and appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in this population."

Background
A number of antimicrobial-impregnated discs to prevent central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) are marketed but it is unclear which disc is most effective.
Aim
To investigate the feasibility and safety of comparing two antimicrobial-impregnated discs to prevent CLABSI.
Methods
A single-centre, parallel group, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a 929-bed tertiary referral hospital. Hospital inpatients requiring a peripherally inserted central catheter were randomized to chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) or polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) disc dressing group. Dressings were replaced every seven days, or earlier, if clinically required. Participants were followed until device removal or hospital discharge. Feasibility outcomes included: proportion of potentially eligible participants who were enrolled; proportion of protocol violations; and proportion of patients lost to follow-up. Clinical outcomes were: CLABSI incidence, diagnosed by a blinded infection control practitioner; all-cause bloodstream infection (BSI); and product-related adverse events.
Findings
Of 143 patients screened, 101 (71%) were eligible. Five (3.5%) declined participation. There was one post-randomization exclusion. Two (2%) protocol violations occurred in the CHG group. No patients were lost to follow-up. Three (3%) BSIs occurred; two (2%) were confirmed CLABSIs (one in each group) and one a mucosal barrier injury-related BSI. A total of 1217 device-days were studied, resulting in 1.64 CLABSIs per 1000 catheter-days. One (1%) disc-related adverse event occurred in the CHG group.
Conclusion
Disc dressings containing PHMB are safe to use for infection prevention at catheter insertion sites. An adequately powered trial to compare PHMB and CHG discs is feasible."

Background
Surfaces in the patient environment may play a role in microbial transmission if they become colonized by bacteria. Patient privacy curtains are one such surface that may pose a high risk for transmission because they are high-contact surfaces, are infrequently cleaned, and healthcare workers are less likely to wash their hands after contacting inanimate objects such as curtains.
Aim
To determine the amount and type of bacterial colonization of patient privacy curtains at a regional burns/plastic surgery unit.
Methods
Privacy curtain contamination on the burns/plastic surgery ward was determined for two separate occasions six months apart: 23 curtains on August 2015 and 26 curtains on January 2016. Dey–Engley neutralizing agar (DENA) replicate organism detection and counting (RODAC) contact plates were used daily to sample curtains near the edge hem where they are most frequently touched. Microbial contamination was reported as cfu/cm2 and the presence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was determined. Swabs were also taken of any open wounds and from tracheostomy sites on the ward.
Findings
Curtain contamination in August 2015 was 0.7–4.7 cfu/cm2 with 22% testing positive for MRSA, whereas contamination on January 2016 was 0.6–13.3 cfu/cm2 with 31% of curtains testing positive for MRSA.
Conclusion
Curtains on the burns/plastic surgery ward become colonized with significant quantities of bacteria. Future studies will need to address the rate of colonization and the clinical impact of this colonization to better inform cleaning protocols."

Background
Much of the existing literature on the epidemiology of multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms (MDROs) and infection control measures still concentrates on hospital care settings.
Aim
To pilot a cross-sectional survey in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), rehabilitation clinics, and homecare services to assess the prevalence of MDROs, structural data on infection control, and referral links between care settings in the state of Mecklenburg–West Pomerania, Germany, in 2015.
Methods
A voluntary, anonymous, point prevalence survey, using routine microbiological and structural data (MDRO screening strategies) and the compliance of referring facilities with MRDO patient transfer sheets that are mandatory in Germany. Data from 39 facilities including 24 LTCFs, nine rehabilitation clinics, and six homecare services were analysed.
Findings
The most reported pathogen was meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with a prevalence of 2.09% in homecare services, 1.43% in LTCFs, and 0.53% in rehabilitation clinics. Missing information on the MRDO status in the referral documents was a relevant problem in all facility types.
Conclusion
Our results imply strong epidemiological links between acute care hospitals and non-clinical care settings. This underlines that successful efforts to curb antimicrobial resistance must not be limited to single facilities but include different settings that are linked by referral networks. Compared to surveys in clinical settings that used the same approach, the prevalence of MRSA is comparable to that of hospitals. By contrast, care facilities lack the infection control resources of hospitals."

Background
Hand hygiene is the cornerstone of infection prevention and control practices, and reduces healthcare-associated infections significantly. However, international evidence suggests that medical doctors demonstrate poor compliance.
Aim
To explore and compare practices and attitudes towards hand hygiene, particularly hand rubbing using alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR), among hospital-based physicians in Ireland between 2007 and 2015.
Methods
In 2007, a random sample of doctors in a large teaching hospital was invited to complete a postal survey using a validated questionnaire. In 2015, the study was replicated among all doctors employed in a university hospital group, including the setting of the original study, using an online survey. Data were analysed using SPSS and Survey Monkey.
Findings
Predominately positive and improving attitudes and practices were found, with 86% of doctors compliant with hand hygiene before patient contact in 2015, compared with 58% in 2007. Ninety-one percent of doctors were compliant after patient contact in 2015, compared with 76% in 2007. In 2015, only 39% of respondents reported that they ‘almost always’ used ABHR for hand hygiene. However, this represents 13.5% more than in 2007. Stated barriers to use of ABHR included dermatological issues, poor acceptance, tolerance and poor availability of ABHR products.
Conclusion
Greater awareness of hand hygiene guidelines and greater governance appear to have had a positive impact on practice. However, despite this, practice remains suboptimal and there is scope for substantial improvement. Continued and sustained efforts are required in order to build on progress achieved since the World Health Organization hand hygiene guidelines were published in 2009."

Background
Sepsis is a condition widely observed outside critical care areas.
Aim
To examine the application of sepsis screening tools for early recognition of sepsis in general hospitalized patients to: (i) identify the accuracy of these tools; (ii) determine the outcomes associated with their implementation; and (iii) describe the implementation process.
Methods
A systematic review method was used. PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases were systematically searched for primary articles, published from January 1990 to June 2016, that investigated screening tools or alert mechanisms for early identification of sepsis in adult general hospitalized patients. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016042261).
Findings
More than 8000 citations were screened for eligibility after duplicates had been removed. Six articles met the inclusion criteria testing two types of sepsis screening tools. Electronic tools can capture, recognize abnormal variables, and activate an alert in real time. However, accuracy of these tools was inconsistent across studies with only one demonstrating high specificity and sensitivity. Paper-based, nurse-led screening tools appear to be more sensitive in the identification of septic patients but were only studied in small samples and particular populations. The process of care measures appears to be enhanced; however, demonstrating improved outcomes is more challenging. Implementation details are rarely reported. Heterogeneity of studies prevented meta-analysis.
Conclusion
Clinicians, researchers and health decision-makers should consider these findings and limitations when implementing screening tools, research or policy on sepsis recognition in general hospitalized patients."

Aim
To describe an outbreak of colonization by linezolid- and glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium harbouring the cfr gene in a UK nephrology unit.
Methods
Isolates of linezolid-resistant E. faecium were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing for the transmissible cfr gene that confers resistance to linezolid. Enhanced environmental cleaning, initial and weekly screening of all patients, and monitoring of adherence to standard infection control precautions were implemented.
Findings
Five patients with pre-existing renal disease were found to have rectal colonization with linezolid-resistant E. faecium over a two-week period. The index case was a 57-year-old male from India who had travelled to the UK. One patient also had a linezolid-resistant E. faecium of a different PFGE profile isolated from a heel wound.

To gain an understanding of the epidemiology of SAB cases and associated risk factors for healthcare and true community onset. Identification of these factors and the patient populations at greatest risk enables the development of focused improvement plans.
Methods
All NHS boards within NHS Scotland take part in the mandatory enhanced surveillance, with data collected by trained data collectors using nationally agreed definitions.
Findings
Between 1st October 2014 and 31st March 2016, 2256 episodes of SAB in adults were identified. The blood cultures were taken in 58 hospitals and across all 15 Scottish health boards. The data demonstrated that approximately one-third of all SAB cases are true community cases. Vascular access devices continue to be the most reported entry point (25.7%) in individuals who receive health care, whereas skin and soft tissue risk factors are present in all origins. A significant risk factor unique to community cases is illicit drug injection.
Conclusion
Improvement plans for reduction of SAB should be targeted more widely than hospital care settings alone."

Background
The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has been reported to be lower in Japan than in many other countries. However, extensive surveillance for CRE carriage has not been performed in Japan.
Aim
To investigate the prevalence of CRE carriage in Japan among convalescent patients considered to be at high risk of being CRE carriers using an improved selective culture medium.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 22 acute care hospitals (ACHs) and 21 long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) in northern Osaka from December 2015 to January 2016. Patients who used incontinence aids, an enteral feeding tube or a urinary catheter were enrolled. Faecal specimens were examined using the newly developed M-ECC for imipenemase (IMP)-producing CRE, which is the most prevalent form of CRE in Japan. The positive isolates were analysed by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Risk factors associated with carriage were analysed by logistic regression.
Findings
Among 1507 patients, 184 (12.2%) carried CRE. The percentage of positive patients was significantly higher in LTCHs (14.9%) than in ACHs (3.6%) (P<0.001). Risk factors for CRE carriage were longer hospital stay [odds ratio (OR) 2.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.87–3.60], enteral feeding (OR 3.03, 95% CI 2.08–4.42) and antibiotic exposure (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.40–2.87). Among the 233 CRE isolates identified, 223 were IMP producers; the remaining isolates did not produce carbapenemase.
Conclusions
This is the first Japanese report to demonstrate the significant spread of CRE in both ACHs and LTCHs using an improved selective medium. A coordinated regional approach may help to prevent further spread."

Background
Umbilical venous catheters (UVCs) or peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), widely used in high-risk neonates, may have a threshold dwell time for subsequent increased risk of central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
Aim
To evaluate the CLABSI risks in neonates having either UVC, PICC, or those having both sequentially.
Methods
The study included 3985 infants who had UVC or PICC inserted between 2007 and 2009 cared for in 10 regional neonatal intensive care units: 1392 having UVC only (group 1), 1317 PICC only (group 2), and 1276 both UVC and PICC (group 3).
Findings
There were 403 CLABSIs among 6000 venous catheters inserted, totalling 43,302 catheter-days. CLABSI rates were higher in group 3 infants who were of lowest gestation (16.9 per 1000 UVC-days and 12.5 per 1000 PICC-days; median: 28 weeks) when compared with group 1 (3.3 per 1000 UVC-days; 37 weeks) and group 2 (4.8 per 1000 PICC-days; 30 weeks). Life table and Kaplan–Meier hazard analysis showed that UVC CLABSI rate increased stepwise to 42 per 1000 UVC-days by day 10, with the highest rate in group 3 (85 per 1000 UVC-days). PICC CLABSI rates remained relatively stable at 12–20 per 1000 PICC-days. Compared to PICC, UVC had a higher adjusted CLABSI risk controlled for dwell time. Among group 3, replacing UVC electively before day 4 may have a trend of lower CLABSI risk than late replacement.
Conclusion
There was no cut-off duration beyond which PICC should be removed electively. Early UVC removal and replacement by PICC before day 4 might be considered."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) account for approximately 25% of nosocomial infections globally, and often result in increased morbidity and healthcare costs. An additional concern is the presence of microbial biofilms which are major reservoirs of bacteria, especially antibiotic-resistant bacteria, in catheters. Since introduction of the use of closed drainage systems, innovations to combat CAUTI have not led to significant improvements in clinical outcomes. The lack of a robust laboratory platform to test new CAUTI preventive strategies may impede development of novel technologies.
Aim
To establish an in-vitro catheterization model (IVCM) for testing of technological innovations to prevent CAUTI.
Methods
The IVCM consists of a continuous supply of urine medium flowing into a receptacle (bladder) where the urine is drained through a urinary catheter connected to an effluent collection vessel (drainage bag). Test organism(s) can be introduced conveniently into the bladder via a rubber septa port. Development of bacteriuria and microbial biofilm on the catheter can be determined subsequently.
Findings
With an initial inoculum of Escherichia coli [∼5×105 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL] into the bladder, a 100% silicone catheter and a commercially available silver-hydrogel catheter showed heavy biofilm colonization (∼108 cfu/cm and ∼107 cfu/cm, respectively) with similar bacterial populations in the urine (bacteriuria) (∼108 cfu/mL and ∼107 cfu/mL, respectively) within three days. Interestingly, an antimicrobial peptide (CP11-6A)-coated catheter showed negligible biofilm colonization and no detectable bacteriuria.
Conclusion
The IVCM is a useful preclinical approach to evaluate new strategies for the prevention of CAUTI."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MR-AB) can cause outbreaks in a burns unit.
Aim
To study the incidence, risk factors and outcome of MR-AB colonization during an outbreak.
Methods
A prospective study was conducted from April to November 2014 in a burns unit in Paris. Weekly surveillance cultures of patients and their environment were performed. MR-AB acquisition, discharge, or death without MR-AB colonization were considered as competing events. To identify risk factors for colonization, baseline characteristics and time-dependent variables were investigated in univariate and multivariate analyses using Cox models. MR-AB strains were genotypically compared using multi-locus sequence typing.
Findings
Eighty-six patients were admitted in the burns unit during the study period. Among 77 patients without MR-AB colonization at admission, 25 (32%) acquired MR-AB with a cumulative incidence of 30% at 28 days (95% CI: 20–40). Median time to MR-AB acquisition was 13 days (range: 5–34). In multivariate analysis, risk factors for MR-AB acquisition were ≥2 skin graft procedures performed [hazard ratio (HR): 2.97; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10–8.00; P = 0.032] and antibiotic therapy during hospitalization (HR: 4.42; 95% CI: 1.19–16.4; P = 0.026). A major sequence type of MR-AB (ST2) was found in 94% and 92% of patients and environmental strains, respectively, with all strains harbouring the blaOXA-23 gene. MR-AB colonization increased length of hospitalization (HR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.17–0.58; P = 0.0002) by a median of 12 days.
Conclusion
A high incidence of MR-AB acquisition was seen during this outbreak with most strains from patients and their environment belonging to single sequence type. MR-AB colonization was associated with more skin graft procedures, antibiotic use, and prolonged hospitalization."

Background
Among patients admitted to European hospitals or intensive care units (ICUs), 5.7% and 19.5% will encounter healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), respectively, and antimicrobial resistance is emerging. As hospital surfaces are contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria, environmental cleanliness is an essential aspect to reduce HAIs.
Aim
To address the efficacy of a titanium dioxide coating in reducing the microbial colonization of environmental surfaces in an ICU.
Methods
A prospective, controlled, single-centre pilot study was conducted to examine the effect of a titanium dioxide coating on the microbial colonization of surfaces in an ICU. During the pre- and post-intervention periods, surfaces were cultured with agar contact plates (BBL RODAC plates). Factors that were potentially influencing the bacterial colonization of surfaces were recorded. A repeated measurements analysis within a hierarchic multi-level framework was used to analyse the effect of the intervention, controlling for the explanatory variables.
Findings
The mean ratio for the total number of colony-forming units (cfus) in a room between the pre- and post-intervention periods was 0.86 (standard deviation 0.57). The optimal model included the following explanatory variables: intervention (P=0.065), week (P=0.002), culture surfaces (P<0.001), ICU room (P=0.039), and interaction between intervention and week (P=0.002) and between week and culture surfaces (P=0.031). The effect of the intervention on the number of cfus from all culture plates in Week 4 between the pre- and post-intervention periods was -0.47 (95% confidence interval -0.24 to - 0.70).
Conclusion
This study found that a titanium dioxide coating had no effect on the microbial colonization of surfaces in an ICU."

Background
In 2011, 15 deep-seated Propionibacterium acnes infections were identified in patients following craniotomies in a hospital in the UK.
Aim
To describe the outbreak and report findings from the investigation undertaken in order to identify the source and risk factors and inform control measures.
Methods
Data were obtained from hospital clinical records and included patient and surgical variables. Cases were defined as patients with microbiologically confirmed deep or organ space surgical site infection (SSI) caused by P. acnes following craniotomy undertaken in 2011. Four controls per case were randomly selected from patients who had a craniotomy in 2011 but who did not develop any SSI. The relationship between infection and putative exposures was examined using multivariate regression techniques. Infection prevention procedures and the theatre environment were reviewed to assess compliance with existing standards.
Findings
Fifteen cases and 65 controls were recruited. Odds of infection were higher for those who had a dural implant inserted during their operation [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 14.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95–∞] and for those who had alcohol/Betadine®/chlorhexidine mix as a disinfectant (aOR: 7.9; 95% CI: 0.8–∞). Environmental investigations suggested that theatre ventilation systems delivered air exchange rates below the recommended standard.
Conclusion
There was a positive association between using dural implants and P. acnes infection. Infection may have been facilitated by inefficient use of skin disinfectant and environmental factors. Recommendations included ongoing surveillance, the use of chlorhexidine skin disinfectant, ensuring adequate air exchanges and appropriate use of doors in theatre to minimize air turbulence."

Background
Clinical diagnostic sensitivity alone is inadequate in the diagnosis of influenza. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is sensitive but the inherent delays in result availability potentially prolong time to isolation and treatment. Until recently no near-patient test (NPT) has demonstrated adequate sensitivity for routine clinical use.
Aim
To evaluate diagnostic accuracy, time to result availability, clinical impact, and cost consequences of Alere™ i Influenza A&B NPT (Alere Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) using off-label throat swabs.
Methods
Prospective, multi-centre [four UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals], diagnostic accuracy cohort study with cost modelling. Throat swab samples from suspected influenza patients were tested for influenza using the reference standard of PCR; a second throat swab was tested using NPT.
Findings
A total of 827 participants were recruited; 589 were suitable for analysis: sensitivity was 75.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 67.0–84.6]; specificity was 96.8% (95% CI: 95.2–98.3). Sensitivity varied between Sheffield (Northern General Hospital: 82.1%; Royal Hallamshire Hospital: 83.3%) and other sites (Doncaster Royal Infirmary: 71.4%; Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary: 50.0%) whereas specificity was high (92–100%). Positive predictive value (PPV) was 81.2% (95% CI: 72.9–89.5) with negative predictive value 95.6% (95% CI: 93.9–97.4) with observed prevalence of 15.4%. Median time to result for PCR was 1.1 days (on-site laboratories) and 5.2 days (remote laboratories). Isolation findings: 75% influenza positive not isolated; 69% of isolated participants did not have influenza. For a cohort of 1000 participants, annual estimated non-diagnostic cost savings with NPT are £215,040.
Conclusion
This first prospective study of the Alere i NPT using throat swabs demonstrates high specificity, high PPV during seasonal epidemics, and rapid result availability which could lead to substantial cost savings."

Background
The survival of pathogenic micro-organisms in the healthcare environment has a major role in nosocomial infections. Among the responsible mechanisms enabling nosocomial pathogens to persist with these stress conditions is their ability to resist desiccation and to form biofilms.
Aim
To investigate the survival behaviour of Acinetobacter pittii isolates on inert surfaces and saline microcosms.
Methods
Five A. pittii clinical strains were spotted over white laboratory coat fragments, glass, and plastic surfaces, or inoculated into sterile saline and monitored at room temperature for a period of 43 days.
Findings
Although the permanence on solid surfaces negatively affected the culturability of the strains used, a fraction of stressed cells survived for at least the period of study. On average, A. pittii culturability was reduced by 77.3%, 80.9%, and 68.1% in white coat, plastic, and glass surfaces, respectively. However, ∼85.6% of the populations retain their culturability in saline solution. Culturability correlated with the presence of cells with an intact membrane, as demonstrated after live/dead staining. Supplementation of the culture medium with sodium pyruvate favoured the culturability of strains from all conditions; but, in general, A. pittii populations did not enter a viable but non-culturable state.
Conclusion
After long-term desiccation, all A. pittii strains retained, or even increased, their ability to form biofilms after they had been fed with nutrient media. This suggests that A. pittii may recover easily from desiccation and may express adherence factors to infect new hosts after rehydration."

abstract = "Summary
Background
As antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, revisiting old antimicrobial agents, modified to enhance efficacy and safety, becomes important. Iodine has been widely used for more than 150 years as a wound and skin disinfectant; it is an effective broad range bactericide and does not promote the development of resistant strains. The most important iodine-based agent is povidone-iodine (PVP-I) which provides excellent antibacterial activity. However, its safety profile has been questioned.
Aim
To evaluate the in-vitro antibacterial efficacy and kinetic properties of a novel iodine-based compound, iodine lithium alpha-dextrin (ILαD), against Staphylococcus aureus, and compare the in-vitro cytotoxicity profiles of ILαD and PVP-I.
Methods
A minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) microbroth dilution method was performed against 12 meticillin-resistant (MRSA) and eight meticillin-susceptible (MSSA) S. aureus clinical isolates using ILαD and PVP-I. Time-kill and post-antibiotic effect studies of ILαD provided rate-of-kill information. MTT cytotoxicity assays were performed using three cell lines, treated with MIC doses of ILαD and PVP-I.
Findings
The MIC values of ILαD and PVP-I against the MRSA strains were 125 mg/L and 31.25 mg/L, respectively. Time-kill and post-antibiotic effect studies of ILαD revealed a log10 reduction factor of 3 within 8 h of exposure at a 2 × MIC dose; the post-antibiotic effect was calculated at 5±0.3h. Cell viability was affected slightly at the MIC dose of ILαD, while the MIC dose of PVP-I exerted a strong cell growth inhibitory effect of 90–95%.
Conclusions
ILαD could be a promising solution against staphylococcal infections as it is effective, does not promote the development of resistant strains, and in-vitro testing indicates that it may be safer than PVP-I. Further studies are justified to determine whether ILαD overcomes the clinical limitations of PVP-I."

Adult patients admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong from January 1st, 2009 to June 30th, 2016 (7.5 years) with KP bacteraemia were included. Demographics, clinical features, microbiological characteristics, and outcomes were analysed.
Findings
Among 853 patients, 178 (20.9%) required critical care and 176 (20.6%) died within 30 days of hospital admission. Thirty-day survivors were younger (P<0.001), had milder disease (defined by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score) (P<0.001), presented with hepatobiliary sepsis (P<0.001) or urosepsis (P<0.001), less septic shock (P=0.013), fewer invasive organ supports (P<0.001), and had appropriate empirical antibiotics (P<0.001). Cox regression analysis showed that respiratory tract infection (hazard ratio: 2.99; 95% confidence interval: 2.061–4.337; P≤0.001), gastrointestinal tract infection (excluding hepatobiliary system) (2.763; 1.761–4.337; P≤0.001), mechanical ventilation (2.202; 1.506–3.221; P≤0.001), medical case (1.830; 1.253–2.672; P=0.002), inappropriate empirical antibiotics (1.716; 1.267–2.324; P≤0.001), female (1.699; 1.251–2.307; P<0.001), age >65 years (1.692; 1.160–2.467; P=0.006), and presence of solid tumour (1.457; 1.056–2.009; P=0.022) were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. Unexpectedly, diabetes mellitus was associated with better 30-day survival (P=0.002). A total of 102 patients (12.0%) had infections with ESBL-producing strains, which were not associated with higher 30-day mortality.
Conclusion
KP bacteraemia is associated with high 30-day mortality. Site of infection, patients' comorbidities and appropriate use of empirical antibiotic are important predictors of patients' outcomes."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Transmission of microbes in the hospital environment occurs frequently through human interactions with high-touch surfaces such as patient beds and over-bed tables. Although stringent cleaning routines are implemented as a preventive measure to minimize transmission of microbes, it is desirable to have high-touch surfaces made of antimicrobial materials. Physical texturing of solid surfaces offers a non-bactericidal approach to control the colonization of such surfaces by microbes.
Aim
To investigate the efficacy of micro-textured polycarbonate films in reducing bacterial load on over-bed tables in a hospital ward.
Methods
Two different micro-patterns were fabricated on polycarbonate film via a thermal imprinting method. Micro-textured films were then mounted on patient over-bed tables in a general hospital ward and the bacterial load monitored over 24 h. Total colony counts, which represented on-specific bacterial loading, and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus counts were monitored at each time-point.
Findings
Over a period of 24 h, both micro-textured surfaces showed consistently lower bacterial load as compared to the unpatterned polycarbonate and the bare over-bed table laminate. This study supports the findings of earlier laboratory-scale studies that microscale physical texturing can reduce bacterial colonization on a solid surface.
Conclusion
Results of the current study suggest that micro-textured surfaces could provide a viable method for reducing microbial contamination of high-touch surfaces in hospitals."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The 20-site Benefits of Universal Glove and Gown (BUGG) study found that wearing gloves and gowns for all patient contacts in the intensive care unit (ICU) reduced acquisition rates of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The relative importance of gloves and gowns as a barrier, improved hand hygiene, and reduced healthcare worker (HCW)–patient contact rates is unknown.
Aim
To determine what proportion of the reduction in acquisition rates observed in the BUGG study was due to improved hand hygiene, reduced contact rates, and universal glove and gown use using agent-based simulation modelling.
Methods
An existing agent-based model to simulate MRSA transmission dynamics in an ICU was modified, and the model was calibrated using site-specific data. Model validation was completed using data collected in the BUGG study. A full 2k factorial design was conducted to quantify the relative benefits of improving each of the aforementioned factors with respect to MRSA acquisition rates.
Findings
Across 40 simulated replications for each factorial design point and intervention site, approximately 44% of the decrease in MRSA acquisition rates was due to universal glove and gown use, 38.1% of the decrease was due to improvement in hand hygiene compliance on exiting patient rooms, and 14.5% of the decrease was due to the reduction in HCW–patient contact rates.
Conclusion
Using mathematical modelling, the decrease in MRSA acquisition in the BUGG study was found to be due primarily to the barrier effects of gowns and gloves, followed by improved hand hygiene and lower HCW–patient contact rates."

Background
Optimal hand hygiene may be compromised by contact with contaminated environmental surfaces.
Aim
To investigate the in-vitro efficacy of a novel alcohol-release doorplate to reduce surface contamination during hand contact.
Methods
Prototype, horizontally held, Surfaceskins, alcohol gel-impregnated and control (aluminium) doorplates were challenged (N = 72 per micro-organism) with Staphylococcus aureus-, Eschericia coli-, Enterococcus faecalis-, or Clostridium difficile-contaminated fingers. S. aureus and E. faecalis were used for challenges (90 per micro-organism) of vertical (modified design) doorplates, on days 0, 3, 4, 6, and 7. Surface contamination was measured pre and immediately post challenges using agar contact plates.
Findings
Horizontal test, but not control, doorplates demonstrated bacterial killing of S. aureus, E. faecalis and E. coli, but not of C. difficile; hence, only testing of S. aureus and E. faecalis was continued. Vertical Surfaceskins, but not control, doorplates demonstrated rapid killing of S. aureus over seven days. There were significant reductions (>90% up to day 6; P ≤ 0.01) of surface bacterial colony counts compared with controls immediately post challenge. There were also significant reductions in Surfaceskins doorplate enterococcal colony counts compared with controls on every day of testing (P ≤ 0.004). There was no evidence that bacterial recovery was greater from the tops of Surfaceskins doorplates (i.e. due to pooling of contents).
Conclusion
Surfaceskins doorplates were efficient at reducing surface contamination by S. aureus, E. faecalis, and E. coli. Reducing microbial contamination of frequently touched door surfaces, and so bacterial transfer via hands, could feasibly reduce the risk of healthcare-associated and other infections."

Hepatitis B is one of the most common infectious diseases globally. It has been estimated that there are 350 million chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers worldwide. The liver is connected to the small intestine by the bile duct, which carries bile formed in the liver to the intestine. Nearly all of the blood that leaves the stomach and intestines must pass through the liver. Human intestines contain a wide diversity of microbes, collectively termed the ‘gut microbiota’. Gut microbiota play a significant role in host metabolic processes and host immune modulation, and influence host development and physiology (organ development). Altered gut microbiota is a common complication in liver disease. Changes in intestinal microbiota seem to play an important role in induction and promotion of HBV-induced chronic liver disease progression, and specific species among the intestinal commensal bacteria may play either a pathogenic or a protective role in the development of HBV-induced chronic liver disease. Thus, the gut microbiome may represent fertile targets for prevention or management of HBV-induced chronic liver disease. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may be a useful therapy for HBV-related disease in the future. However, the data available in this field remain limited, and relevant scientific work has only just commenced. New technologies have enabled systematic studies of gut microbiota, and provided more realistic information about its composition and pathological variance. This review summarizes the cutting edge of research into the relationship between gut microbiota and HBV-induced chronic liver disease, and the future prospects of FMT therapy."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Germany has established a nationwide surveillance system of alcohol-based hand-rub consumption (AHC) per patient-day in hospital settings as a surrogate parameter for hand hygiene (HH) compliance. Analysis of AHC data in intensive care units (ICUs) shows not only a wide range of consumption between units of different specialties, but also within units of one specialty. This seems to reflect variation in the number of HH opportunities per patient-day between ICUs due to variation in complexity of care.
Aim
To investigate whether ventilator utilization ratio (VUR) might be a good surrogate for describing complexity and intensity of care on ICUs and whether stratification by VUR works as a new method of setting benchmarks for AHC data.
Methods
Data from 365 ICUs participating in the German national nosocomial infection surveillance system (KISS) were used. VUR was calculated by dividing the number of ventilator-days per unit by the number of patient-days per unit. AHC was stratified according to VUR in quartiles.
Findings
The median AHC was 107mL/patient-day [interquartile range (IQR): 86–134] and the median VUR was 33% (IQR: 22–45%). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0.28 (P<0.0001). After stratifying AHC according to VUR, the AHC in quartile I was significantly lower compared to quartile IV. There was also significant difference between quartile I and quartiles II and III.
Conclusion
Stratification of AHC data according to VUR is suggested to improve the quality of benchmark parameters based on AHC data as surrogate parameter for HH compliance in ICUs."

Background
Not all nosocomial outbreaks (NOs) are reported to health authorities (HAs).
Aim
To identify barriers to investigating and reporting NOs to HAs.
Methods
A mixed methods approach was performed with a convergent parallel design. The quantitative and qualitative branches of the study were a statewide (electronic) survey and focus groups (FGs), respectively. Infection control practitioners (ICPs) working in the State of São Paulo, Brazil were recruited.
Findings
Eighty-five ICPs were enrolled in the survey and 22 ICPs were enrolled in the FGs. Barriers to investigating and reporting NOs included: (i) difficulty in translating outbreak investigation knowledge into practice; (ii) weak planning in outbreak investigation process; (iii) organizational culture and context; (iv) lack of awareness about reporting; and (v) lack of autonomy of ICPs to report outbreaks to HAs.
Conclusion
HAs could overcome these barriers by revising their strategies to work with healthcare services, as well as delivering translational educational programmes to support improvement in knowledge and skills for NO investigation."

Background
There is increasing interest in the effects of hospital and ward design on multi-faceted infection control. Definitive evidence is rare and the state of knowledge about current ward design is lacking.
Objective
To collect data on the current status of ward design for intensive care units (ICUs) and to analyse associations between particular design factors and nosocomial infection rates.
Methods
In 2015, operational infrastructure data were collected via an online questionnaire from ICUs participating voluntarily in the German nosocomial infection surveillance system (KISS). A multi-variate analysis was subsequently undertaken with nosocomial infection rates from the KISS database from 2014 to 2015.
Findings
In total, 534 ICUs submitted data about their operational infrastructure. Of these, 27.1% of beds were hosted in single-bed rooms with a median size of 18m2 (interquartile range 15–21m2), and 73.5% of all ICU beds had a hand rub dispenser nearby. The authors were able to match 266 ICUs in the multi-variate analysis. ICUs with openable windows in patient rooms were associated with lower device-associated lower respiratory tract infections [odds ratio (OR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58–0.90]. ICUs with >40% two-bed rooms were associated with lower primary bloodstream infection rates (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51–0.86).

Aim
To estimate the attributable mortality of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) in Ireland.
Methods
A retrospective case–cohort study was conducted, based on notifications from Irish microbiology laboratories and administrative patient records from six Irish hospitals from January 2007 to December 2013. Probabilistic linkage was used to link 1252 cases of bloodstream infection from a cohort of 343,189 hospitalized patients. Independent predictors of mortality were determined using a multi-variable logistic regression model, and included: patient age, emergency or re-admission to hospital, length of stay in an intensive care unit, number of procedures, number of diagnoses, major diagnostic category and presence of HA-BSI.
Results
Attributable mortality was calculated from the crude mortality of case subjects after adjusting for other predictors of mortality, and was found to be 15.3% (95% confidence interval 14.8–15.8%). The study was further stratified according to the causative organism, including: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and, where available, their antimicrobial resistance patterns. The highest attributable mortality among these organisms was reported for E. faecium at 18.1% and the lowest attributable mortality was reported for E. coli at 13.6%. A significantly higher attributable mortality was found for antimicrobial resistance patterns of some organisms, most notably for meticillin-resistant S. aureus at 19.5%, vs meticillin-susceptible S. aureus at 13.3%.
Conclusions
HA-BSI is an important cause of mortality, and attributable mortality differs significantly among causative organisms and antimicrobial resistance patterns."

Background
Surgical site infections remain a significant burden on healthcare systems and may benefit from new countermeasures.
Aim
To assess the merits of open surgical wound CO2 insufflation via a gas diffuser to reduce airborne contamination, and to determine the distribution of CO2 in and over a wound.
Methods
An experimental approach with engineers and clinical researchers was employed to measure the gas flow pattern and motion of airborne particles in a model of an open surgical wound in a simulated theatre setting. Laser-illuminated flow visualizations were performed and the degree of protection was quantified by collecting and characterizing particles deposited in and outside the wound cavity.
Findings
The average number of particles entering the wound with a diameter of <5μm was reduced 1000-fold with 10L/min CO2 insufflation. Larger and heavier particles had a greater penetration potential and were reduced by a factor of 20. The degree of protection was found to be unaffected by exaggerated movements of hands in and out of the wound cavity. The steady-state CO2 concentration within the majority of the wound cavity was >95% and diminished rapidly above the wound to an atmospheric level (∼0%) at a height of 25mm.
Conclusion
Airborne particles were deflected from entering the wound by the CO2 in the cavity akin to a protective barrier. Insufflation of CO2 may be an effective means of reducing intraoperative infection rates in open surgeries."

Background
Published data regarding temporal trends in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) prevalence within specific regions or healthcare systems are scarce.
Aim
To characterize temporal trends and risk factors for healthcare-associated infections caused by VRE.
Methods
The study included all adult discharges occurring from 2006 to 2014 with an enterococcal infection from three hospitals in a large academic healthcare system. Bivariate analyses were used to identify statistically significant factors associated with vancomycin-susceptible or -resistant infection. Statistically significant variables were included in a final logistic regression model. Trends assessed whether the proportion of enterococcal infections resistant to vancomycin changed over time.
Findings
The sample included 10,186 adults with first-time healthcare-associated enterococcal infection. Significant risk factors (P≤0.05) for VRE in the final logistic regression model included: tertiary 1 hospital, intensive care unit length of stay, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, previous immunosuppressive or chemotherapeutic medications, previous hospitalization, renal failure, malignancy, longer length of stay prior to infection, taking an antibiotic prior to infection, being female, and having an infection in winter or spring. Between 2006 and 2014, the rate of resistance varied from 37.1 to 42.9% but there were no significant differences in the proportion resistant to vancomycin over time (P=0.36).

Enterococcus spp. are a normal part of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. They are also important pathogens, being responsible for 14% of US nosocomial infections from 2007 to 2010.
Aim
To examine a laundry facility that processes clinical linens for the presence and seasonality of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp.
Methods
Surface samples were collected four times in 2015 from the dirty and clean areas of the laundry facility. Isolates were confirmed using biochemical assays, and antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed. Further investigations included molecular characterization by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), detection of acquired vanA and vanB and/or intrinsic vanC1 genes by polymerase chain reaction, and eBURST analysis.
Findings
Seventy-four vanA-positive multi-drug-resistant Enterococcus spp. were identified: 64/120 (53%) in the dirty area and 10/120 (8%) in the clean area. There were 14 ST types among the E. faecium isolates identified (ST16, 17, 18, 117, 186, 280, 324, 412, 584, 664, 665, 736, 750 and 1038). Both E. faecalis isolates were ST109.
Conclusion
Isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolates was significantly higher (53% vs 8%) in the dirty area of the facility compared with the clean area.

abstract = "Summary
Introduction
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) develops in up to 25% of patients following cardiac surgery. Colonization of the endotracheal tube (ETT) contributes to VAP. The PneuX ETT has been shown to halve VAP in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery. This article reports on the secondary analysis of bacterial colonization in relation to VAP between the PneuX and standard ETTs.
Methods
In this randomized controlled trial, patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to Group A (PneuX ET, N=120) or Group B (standard ETT, N=120). Patients aged >70 years with or without impaired left ventricular function (<50%) undergoing elective and urgent cardiac surgery were included in this study. Incidence of postoperative VAP and analysis of bacterial colonization within the ETT (N=234) were measured for patients requiring <24 h, 24–48 h and >48 h of intubation.
Results
Baseline patient demographics were comparable. VAP was lower in Group A compared with Group B (10.8% vs 21%; P=0.03). The incidence of VAP was lower at each time point for Group A. There was a lower incidence of ETT colonization in Group A for patients needing >48 h of intubation. There was no difference in the type of bacterial colonization (P=0.5) or the mean number of colony-forming units [4.35x107 (1.18x108) and 2.16x108 (1.24x109) in Groups A and B, respectively (P=0.8)].
Conclusion
Colonization of the ETT does not seem to play an important role in early-onset VAP. There is a tendency for reduced colonization in the PneuX ETT with longer intubation times. This may have an impact on reducing the incidence of late-onset VAP."

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major health burden worldwide. A patient with no history of HCV infection while on a renal unit was found to seroconvert to HCV.
Aim
To report the use of sequencing to postulate how transmission of HCV occurred in a healthcare setting, and how this guided our outbreak investigation.
Findings
Based on infection control inspections the transmission event was surmised to be due to ward environmental contamination with blood and subsequent inoculation from intravenous interventions on the patient acquiring HCV. We discuss the interventions put in place in response to the outbreak investigation findings.
Conclusion
Sequencing of healthcare-acquired HCV infections should be undertaken as routine practice in outbreak investigations."

Background
Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) cause surgical site infections (SSIs) in intensive care units (ICUs). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of intervention and control measures to reduce CRE colonization and infection rates among patients in the ICU of a cardiac surgery hospital following a CRE outbreak.
Methods
An observational study of the pre- and postintervention status of a cohort of colonized or infected patients in the postoperative adult cardiac surgery ICU was performed between April 2013 and December 2014. As well as the usual measures of screening and cohort nursing, the control measures were enhanced during the intervention period by providing alcohol gel at the bedside, daily bathing with no-rinse 2% chlorhexidine-impregnated wash cloths, and disinfection of surfaces around the patient three times per day.
Results
The rates of CRE colonization (P<0.001), primary central-line-associated bloodstream infections (P<0.002) and SSIs (P< 0.003) decreased significantly during the postintervention period.
Conclusion
The implemented measures were effective in controlling colonization and infection with CRE in the cardiac surgery ICU."

Background
Influenza vaccination of healthcare workers (HCWs) is essential for patient safety, their own safety, and hospital operation. However, despite its strong recommendation, studies indicates a low rate of vaccine uptake.
Aim
To assess rates of, and factors affecting, influenza vaccine uptake among HCWs.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was carried out during October 1st to 16th, 2015, among HCWs in King Abdullah Medical City in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. A self-administered, anonymous questionnaire was distributed to HCWs; this included questions on demographic characteristics, vaccine uptake, and knowledge, beliefs, attitude, and concern about influenza vaccine.
Findings
Out of 500 HCWs approached, 447 returned valid self-reported questionnaires with response rate 89.4%. Overall, 88.3% of the participants reported receiving vaccination during the 2014/15 season, higher than during the 2013/14 (61.2%) and 2012/13 (54.5%) seasons. Self-protection (81.5%) was the main reason for vaccination, whereas 73.4% of HCWs reported vaccination to protect patients. The main reasons for vaccination avoidance were misconception that the vaccine causes influenza (38.5%) and concern about vaccine efficacy (32.7%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the following were independently associated with vaccine receipt among HCWs: awareness of vaccine guidelines; intention to receive the vaccine next season; nurses and other HCWs compared to physicians; longer practice; and age >40 years.
Conclusion
A good uptake of influenza vaccine was achieved during the 2014/15 season following adoption of mandatory vaccination policy. Awareness programmes are needed to correct HCWs’ misconceptions about the vaccine. Efforts need to focus especially on physicians, younger staff and new recruits."

Background
Antibiotic optimization in hospitals is an increasingly critical priority in the context of proliferating resistance. Despite the emphasis on doctors, optimizing antibiotic use within hospitals requires an understanding of how different stakeholders, including non-prescribers, influence practice and practice change.
Aim
This study was designed to understand Australian hospital managers' perspectives on antimicrobial resistance, managing antibiotic governance, and negotiating clinical vis-à-vis managerial priorities.
Methods
Twenty-three managers in three hospitals participated in qualitative semi-structured interviews in Australia in 2014 and 2015. Data were systematically coded and thematically analysed.
Findings
The findings demonstrate, from a managerial perspective: (1) competing demands that can hinder the prioritization of antibiotic governance; (2) ineffectiveness of audit and monitoring methods that limit rationalization for change; (3) limited clinical education and feedback to doctors; and (4) management-directed change processes are constrained by the perceived absence of a ‘culture of accountability’ for antimicrobial use amongst doctors.
Conclusion
Hospital managers report considerable structural and interprofessional challenges to actualizing antibiotic optimization and governance. These challenges place optimization as a lower priority vis-à-vis other issues that management are confronted with in hospital settings, and emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes that engage management in understanding and addressing the barriers to change."

The World Health Organization recommends the use of hand rubs with ‘sustained activity’ for surgical hand preparation. This review aims to verify whether any of the alcohol-based hand rubs containing non-volatile ‘active ingredients’ such as chlorhexidine digluconate (CHG), mecetronium ethylsulphate (MES), or ortho-phenylphenol (OPP) provides such sustained efficacy for surgical hand disinfection. Literature was searched to find studies according to EN 12791. Published data sets were analysed to verify whether any of the formulations has a superior efficacy (P<0.01) after 3h in comparison to the reference procedure. Formulations with 0.5 and 1% CHG in 70% iso-propanol or 61% ethanol were not superior after 3h. Formulations with 0.2% MES in 45% iso-propanol and 30% n-propanol were also not superior when applied for 1min (one data set), 1.5min as currently recommended for use (14 data sets), and 2min (one data set). When applied for 3min the formulations were superior in three out of seven data sets. The hand rub with 0.1% OPP in 78.2% ethanol was also not superior to the reference treatment when applied as recommended for 1.5min. It appears reasonable and responsible to limit the dermal exposure and environmental input to biocidal agents with a clear benefit such as the alcohols. In analogy to avoiding dyes and fragrances in hand rubs, formulations containing ‘active’ substances without a clear benefit but with potential risks should be avoided when alternative formulations with the same level of antimicrobial activity, dermal tolerance, and user acceptability are available."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) infections are associated with morbidity and mortality. Peri-operative systemic intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the rate of CIED infections. AIGISRx, a polymer envelope implanted with the CIED, releases minocycline and rifampin, and has been introduced to reduce infections.
Methods
Retrospective review of 184 patients who underwent CIED implantation was conducted. Ninety-two patients were implanted with an AIGISRx envelope (AIGISRx group) and 92 patients were not implanted with an AIGISRx envelope (control group). Data were collected on demographics and risk factors for CIED infections (i.e. congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, chronic kidney disease, oral anticoagulant use, chronic steroid use, need for lead replacement or revision, temporary pacing, early re-intervention, and having more than two leads in place). Rates of implantation success, major infections and mortality were compared between the AIGISRx group and the control group.
Results
The AIGISRx group had longer hospitalizations (6.8±10.7 days vs 3.1±5.2 days; P=0.001), higher chronic corticosteroid use, higher rates of replacement or revision (51.1% vs 8.7%; P=0.001), and a greater proportion of devices with more than two intracardiac leads (42.4% vs 29.3%; P=0.03) than the control group. Successful implantation occurred in 97% of patients in both groups. Major infection was seen in 5.4% of cases in the AIGISRx group and 1.1% of cases in the control group (P=0.048). Device removal was conducted in 3.3% of cases in the AIGISRx group compared with 1.1% of cases in the control group (P=0.16). There were two deaths in the AIGISRx group. Organisms cultured were meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, meticillin-susceptible S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
Conclusion
The AIGISRx group had higher rates of major infection but also higher risk factors compared with the control group. The rate of device extraction and CIED-related mortality was higher in the AIGISRx group than in the control group."

Background
Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are among the most common healthcare-associated infections. Antiseptic cleaning of the meatal area before and during catheter use may reduce the risk of CAUTIs.
Aim
To undertake a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of studies investigating the effectiveness of antiseptic cleaning before urinary catheter insertion and during catheter use for prevention of CAUTIs.
Methods
Electronic databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and compared across intervention and control groups using DerSimonian–Laird random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed. Heterogeneity was estimated using the I2 statistic.
Findings
In total, 2665 potential papers were identified; of these, 14 studies were eligible for inclusion. There was no difference in the incidence of CAUTIs when comparing antiseptic and non-antiseptic agents (pooled OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.73–1.10; P=0.31), or when comparing different agents: povidone-iodine vs routine care; povidone-iodine vs soap and water; chlorhexidine vs water; povidone-iodine vs saline; povidone-iodine vs water; and green soap and water vs routine care (P>0.05 for all). Comparison of an antibacterial agent with routine care indicated near significance (P=0.06). There was no evidence of heterogeneity (I2=0%; P>0.05). Subgroup analyses showed no difference in the incidence of CAUTIs in terms of country, setting, risk of bias, sex and frequency of administration.
Conclusions
There were no differences in CAUTI rates, although methodological issues hamper generalizability of this finding. Antibacterial agents may prove to be significant in a well-conducted study. The present results provide good evidence to inform infection control guidelines in catheter management."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hand hygiene is a major means for preventing healthcare-associated infections. One critical point in understanding poor compliance is the lack of relevant markers used to monitor practices systematically.
Methods
This study analysed hand hygiene compliance and associated factors with a radio-frequency-identification-based real-time continuous automated monitoring system in an infectious disease ward with 17 single bedrooms. Healthcare workers (HCWs) were tracked while performing routine care over 171 days. A multi-level multi-variate logistics model was used for data analysis. The main outcome measures were hand disinfection before entering the bedroom (outside use) and before entering the patient care zone, defined as the zone surrounding the patient’s bed (inside/bedside use). Variables analysed included HCWs’ characteristics and behaviour, patients, room layouts, path chains and duration of HCWs’ paths.
Findings
In total, 4629 paths with initial hand hygiene opportunities when entering the patient care zone were selected, of which 763 (16.5%), 285 (6.1%) and 3581 (77.4%) were associated with outside use, inside/bedside use and no use, respectively. Hand hygiene is caregiver-dependent. The shorter the duration of the HCW’s path, the worse the bedside hand hygiene. Bedside hand hygiene is improved when one or two extra HCWs are present in the room.
Interpretation
Hand hygiene compliance at the bedside, as analysed using the continuous monitoring system, depended upon the HCW’s occupation and personal behaviour, number of HCWs, time spent in the room and (potentially) dispenser location. Meal tray distribution was a possible factor in the case of failure to disinfect hands."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
To evaluate the effect of pre-operative octenidine (OCT) decolonization on surgical site infection (SSI) rates.
Design
Before-and-after cohort study.
Patients
Patients undergoing an elective isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure: control group (1st January to 31st December 2013), N=475; intervention group (1st January to 31st December 2014), N=428.
Interventions
The intervention consisted of nasal application of OCT ointment three times daily, beginning on the day before surgery, and showering the night before and on the day of surgery with OCT soap.
Results
A median sternotomy was performed in 805 (89.1%) patients and a minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass procedure was performed in 98 (10.9%) patients. Overall, there was no difference in SSI rates between the control and intervention groups (15.4% vs 13.3%, P=0.39). The rate of harvest site SSIs was significantly lower in patients in the intervention group (2.5% vs 0.5%, P=0.01). Patients who had undergone a median sternotomy in the intervention group had a significantly lower rate of organ/space sternal SSIs (1.9% vs 0.3%, P=0.04). However, there was a trend towards an increased rate of deep incisional sternal SSIs (1.2% vs 2.9%, P=0.08). Multi-variate analysis did not identify a significant protective effect of the intervention (odds ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.53–1.15, P=0.27).
Conclusions
Pre-operative decolonization with OCT did not reduce overall SSI rates in patients undergoing an elective isolated CABG procedure, but significantly decreased harvest site and organ/space sternal SSIs. Randomized controlled trials, including controlled patient adherence to the intervention, are required to confirm these observations and to determine the clinical utility of OCT in pre-operative decolonization."

Background
Carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is a risk for infections. Targeted decolonization reduces postoperative infections but depends on accurate screening.
Aim
To compare detection of S. aureus carriage in healthy individuals between anatomical sites and nurse- versus self-swabbing; also to determine whether a single nasal swab predicted carriage over four weeks.
Methods
Healthy individuals were recruited via general practices. After consent, nurses performed multi-site swabbing (nose, throat, and axilla). Participants performed nasal swabbing twice-weekly for four weeks. Swabs were returned by mail and cultured for S. aureus. All S. aureus isolates underwent spa typing. Persistent carriage in individuals returning more than three self-swabs was defined as culture of S. aureus from all or all but one self-swabs.
Findings
In all, 102 individuals underwent multi-site swabbing; S. aureus carriage was detected from at least one site from 40 individuals (39%). There was no difference between nose (29/102, 28%) and throat (28/102, 27%) isolation rates: the combination increased total detection rate by 10%. Ninety-nine patients returned any self-swab, and 96 returned more than three. Nasal carriage detection was not significantly different on nurse or self-swab [28/99 (74%) vs 26/99 (72%); χ2: P=0.75]. Twenty-two out of 25 participants with first self-swab positive were persistent carriers and 69/71 with first self-swab negative were not, giving high positive predictive value (88%), and very high negative predictive value (97%).
Conclusion
Nasal swabs detected the majority of carriage; throat swabs increased detection by 10%. Self-taken nasal swabs were equivalent to nurse-taken swabs and predicted persistent nasal carriage over four weeks."

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) represent an important healthcare burden.
Aim
To assess the effectiveness of an evidence-based multi-modal, multi-disciplinary intervention intended to improve outcomes by reducing the use of urinary catheters (UCs) and minimizing the incidence of CAUTIs in the internal medicine department of a university hospital.
Methods
A multi-modal intervention was developed, including training sessions, urinary catheterization reminders, surveillance systems, and mechanisms for staff feedback of results. The frequency of UC use and incidence of CAUTIs were recorded in three-month periods before (P1) and during the intervention (P2).
Findings
The catheterization rate decreased significantly during P2 [27.8% vs 16.9%; relative risk (RR): 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.57–0.65]. We also observed a reduction in CAUTI risk (18.3 vs 9.8%; RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.30–0.93), a reduction in the CAUTI rate per 1000 patient-days [5.5 vs 2.8; incidence ratio (IR): 0.52; 95% CI: 0.28–0.94], and a non-significant decrease in the CAUTI rate per 1000 catheter-days (19.3 vs 16.9; IR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.46–1.55).

Background
Multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDRGNB) have become an important cause of nosocomial infection in intensive care units (ICUs).
Aims
To investigate the molecular epidemiology of MDRGNB isolated from medical personnel (MP) and non-medical personnel (NMP) at 69 ICUs in Tianjin, China.
Methods
From April 2007 to October 2015, 2636 nasal and hand swab samples from 1185 MP and 133 NMP were cultured for GNB (including MDRGNB), meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The susceptibilities of GNB to 14 antimicrobial agents were determined, and 80 MDRGNB were characterized using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and dendrogram analysis.
Findings
In total, 301 GNB were identified in 269 MP, including 109 MDRGNB isolates in 104 MP. Forty-two GNB were isolated from 39 NMP, which included 20 NMP with MDRGNB. Overall, 8.8% of MP were colonized with MDRGNB, which greatly exceeded colonization rates with MRSA (0.9%) and VRE (0.1%). Three pairs of Klebsiella pneumoniae and one pair of Enterobacter aerogenes were indistinguishable from each other, but the majority of isolate tests had distinct PFGE profiles.
Conclusions
The prevalence of MDRGNB was high among ICU MP in Tianjin, and greatly exceeded that of VRE and MRSA. There was no difference in the rates of nasal carriage of MDRGNB between MP and NMP, but NMP were significantly more likely to have hand colonization with MDRGNB. PFGE profiles showed that there was only limited sharing of strains of MDR E. aerogenes and K. pneumoniae between personnel."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Reports of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) in Australia were previously uncommon, with cases imported sporadically by travellers from higher prevalence countries.
Aim
The study institution reported the first outbreak of KPC-Kp in Australia. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for KPC-Kp colonization and infection using a matched case–control study.
Methods
The study included all hospitalized patients with KPC-Kp colonization or infection from January 2012 to September 2015.
Findings
Thirty-four cases of KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae (including 31 KPC-Kp cases) were matched with 136 controls. Variables associated with KPC-Kp acquisition included: length of hospital stay >28 days in the past 12 months, prior vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) colonization, central venous catheter (CVC), gastrointestinal disease and invasive procedures. Exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics was also found to be a significant risk factor. In the multi-variate analysis, three factors independently associated with KPC-Kp acquisition were length of hospital stay >28 days in the past 12 months [odds ratio (OR) 23.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.9–113.3], presence of a CVC (OR 15.4, 95% CI 2.7–86.9), and prior VRE colonization (OR 6.0, 95% CI 1.6–23.2). Very few patients had a history of overseas travel.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that patients with prolonged hospital exposure are more likely to acquire KPC-Kp in the setting of a local outbreak, and suggests that risk factors for KPC-Kp acquisition may be shared with those for VRE colonization. Local screening strategies targeting overseas travellers would likely miss many cases. The results of this study will help to inform screening policies for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae."

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most common healthcare-associated infections, and contribute significantly to patient morbidity and healthcare costs. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common microbial cause. The epidemiology of S. aureus is changing with the dissemination of newer clones and the emergence of mupirocin resistance. The prevention and control of SSIs is multi-modal, and this article reviews the evidence on the value of screening for nasal carriage of S. aureus and subsequent decolonization of positive patients pre-operatively. Pre-operative screening, using culture- or molecular-based methods, and subsequent decolonization of patients who are positive for meticillin-susceptible S. aureus and meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) reduces SSIs and hospital stay. This applies especially to major clean surgery, such as cardiothoracic and orthopaedic, involving the insertion of implanted devices. However, it requires a multi-disciplinary approach coupled with patient education. Universal decolonization pre-operatively without screening for S. aureus may compromise the capacity to monitor for the emergence of new clones of S. aureus, contribute to mupirocin resistance, and prevent the adjustment of surgical prophylaxis for MRSA (i.e. replacement of a beta-lactam agent with a glycopeptide or alternative)."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Occupational exposure to blood or other body fluids in healthcare settings puts healthcare workers (HCWs) at risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It is estimated that between 200 and 5000 HIV infections are transmitted annually to HCWs worldwide. Use of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) has been documented to reduce the rate of HIV infection from workplace exposures by 81%.
Aim
To investigate the extent of occupational exposure to HIV infection during the period of 12 months before the survey and to identify factors associated with uptake of PEP services among HCWs.
Methods
We interviewed 221 HCWs from selected healthcare facilities in Kongwa, Tanzania. Data included occupational exposures to body fluids, knowledge and use of PEP.
Findings
Sixty (27.1%) of the HCWs had experienced exposures to blood and body fluids, of whom 71.7% (43/60) had needlestick injuries. Medical attendants were more frequently exposed, followed by nurses (31.7% and 28.6% respectively). Of the exposed HCWs, seven (11.7%) reported use of HIV PEP. Reporting of exposure [odds ratio (OR): 8.44; P = 0.016], knowledge of the HIV status of the source patient (OR: 42.19; P = 0.007) and awareness of PEP (OR: 12.72; P = 0.010) were significant predictors of PEP use.
Conclusion
Uptake of PEP services among HCWs remains low despite high rate of occupational exposures. Wider dissemination of HIV PEP guidelines and training of HCWs is required in Tanzania to ensure that HCWs have knowledge of, and prompt access to, PEP services."

This article describes two outbreaks of P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in renal transplant patients in the West of Scotland. In total, 25 patients in two geographically contiguous locations were affected. Allele B was identified as the dominant type, along with allele A3. It was not possible to determine the exact reason for clustering of cases, although the outpatient clinic setting featured in one of the outbreaks. The outbreaks ceased with the use of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole prophylaxis; the target populations that received prophylaxis were different in the two outbreaks. Infection control teams should be alert to the possibility of outbreaks of PCP."

keywords = "Meticillin-resistant , Screening, Point of care, Rapid screening",
abstract = "Summary
Background
Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is frequently endemic in healthcare settings and may be transmitted by person-to-person spread. Asymptomatic MRSA carriers are potential, unsuspected sources for transmission and some of them may be identified by admission screening.
Aim
To assess whether rapid point-of-care screening (POCS) for MRSA at hospital admission may be associated with a reduction in MRSA acquisition rates when compared with slower laboratory-based methods.
Methods
A cluster-randomized cross-over trial was conducted in four admission wards of an acute London tertiary care hospital. Polymerase chain reaction-based POCS screening was compared with conventional culture screening. Patients were screened on ward admission and discharge, and the MRSA acquisition rate on the admission wards was calculated as the primary outcome measure.
Results
In all, 10,017 patients were included; 4978 in the control arm, 5039 in the POCS arm. The MRSA carriage rate on admission was 1.7%. POCS reduced the median reporting time from 40.4 to 3.7 h (P < 0.001). MRSA was acquired on the admission wards by 23 (0.46%) patients in the control arm and by 24 (0.48%) in the intervention arm, acquisition rates of 5.39 and 4.60 per 1000 days respectively. After taking account of predefined confounding factors, the adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) for change in trend for MRSA acquisition was 0.961 (95% confidence interval: 0.766–1.206). The adjusted IRR for step change for MRSA acquisition was 0.98 (0.304–3.162).
Conclusion
POCS produces a significantly faster result but has no effect on MRSA acquisition on admission wards compared with culture screening. Where compliance with infection prevention and control is high and MRSA carriage is low, POCS has no additional impact on MRSA acquisition rates over the first one to four days of admission compared with conventional culture screening."

Background
Surgical site infection (SSI) is a serious potential complication of spinal surgery. SSI may impact significantly on inpatient hospitalization and the costs associated with extra care.
Aim
To investigate the management of patients experiencing SSI following surgery for spinal metastatic tumours, and to estimate the costs associated with SSI in this context.
Methods
Patients experiencing SSI following spinal tumour surgery at a large spinal surgery centre between January 2009 and December 2012 were identified. Existing case notes were reviewed and patient and procedural data, details of the infection, and treatment interventions were recorded. A bottom-up approach to calculating costs associated with infection was used for patients experiencing SSI and compared with a quasi-random sample of similar patients without SSI.
Findings
The mean cost of treating patients with SSI was significantly greater than costs associated with those without SSI (P=0.019). Mean cost of inpatient hospital stay was 60% higher in patients with SSI compared to those without SSI (P=0.004). Inpatient hospital stay alone accounted for 59% of total costs. Return to theatre was the second most costly intervention overall, accounting for 38% of costs, and was the most expensive single intervention involved in the treatment of SSI.
Conclusion
SSI significantly increases healthcare costs for patients undergoing surgery for spinal metastasis, with prolonged inpatient hospitalization and return to theatre for wound management being major contributors. The actual total cost to society derived from SSI in this patient group is likely to be far beyond just the direct costs to healthcare providers."

Background
Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) may cause healthcare-associated infections with high mortality rates. New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is among the most recently discovered carbapenemases.
Aim
To report the first outbreak of NDM-1 CPE in Ireland, including microbiological and epidemiological characteristics, and assessing the impact of infection prevention and control measures.
Methods
This was a retrospective microbiological and epidemiological review. Cases were defined as patients with a CPE-positive culture. Contacts were designated as roommates or ward mates.
Findings
This outbreak involved 10 patients with a median age of 71 years (range: 45–90), located in three separate but affiliated healthcare facilities. One patient was infected (the index case); the nine others were colonized. Nine NDM-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, an NDM-1-producing Escherichia coli and a K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacter cloacae were detected between week 24, 2014 and week 37, 2014. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated similarity. NDM-1-positive isolates were meropenem resistant with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 12 to 32 μg/mL. All were tigecycline susceptible (MICs ≤1 μg/mL). One isolate was colistin resistant (MIC 4.0 μg/mL; mcr-1 gene not detected). In 2015, four further NDM-1 isolates were detected.
Conclusion
The successful management of this outbreak was achieved via the prompt implementation of enhanced infection prevention and control practices to prevent transmission. These patients did not have a history of travel outside of Ireland, but several had frequent hospitalizations in Ireland, raising concerns regarding the possibility of increasing but unrecognized prevalence of NDM-1 and potential decline in value of travel history as a marker of colonization risk."

Results
For the period 2004–2013, 2932 water samples were studied; 17% were positive for P. aeruginosa. A higher incidence of P. aeruginosa cases was associated with a higher proportion of positive water samples (P=0.056 in complete case analysis and P=0.031 with the imputed dataset). The association was no longer observed when haematology and intensive care units were excluded, but was significant in analyses of data concerning intensive care units alone (P<0.001).

Background
The economic impact of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) on the healthcare system is significant. From May 2013 to May 2014, an outbreak of C. difficile ribotype 027 occurred in a Dutch tertiary care hospital, involving 72 patients. The primary aim of this study was to provide insight into the financial burden that this CDI outbreak brought upon this hospital.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was performed to estimate the costs of a one-year-long C. difficile ribotype 027 outbreak. Medical charts were reviewed for patient data. In addition, all costs associated with the outbreak control measures were collected.
Findings
The attributable costs of the whole outbreak were estimated to be €1,222,376. The main contributing factor was missed revenue due to increased length of stay of CDI patients and closure of beds to enable contact isolation of CDI patients (36%). A second important cost component was extra surveillance and activities of the Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control (25%).
Conclusion
To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to provide insight into the attributable costs of CDI in an outbreak setting, and to delineate the major cost items. It is clear that the economic consequences of CDI are significant. The high costs associated with a CDI outbreak should help to justify the use of additional resources for CDI prevention and control."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Previous studies comparing Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) due to different ribotypes have been conflicting, and many have only compared small numbers of cases or few ribotypes.
Aim
To compare patient and episode characteristics for CDI due to different ribotypes.
Methods
The ribotyping results from 3333 toxin-producing isolates collected from 110 Belgian hospitals between October 2010 and December 2015 were matched to clinical data from the national CDI surveillance database. Data for ribotypes with at least 100 occurrences were compared. In addition, the national reference laboratory quantitatively measured the level of toxin production in five randomly chosen cultured isolates for each of the most common ribotypes.
Findings
Ribotypes with more than 100 occurrences were R014, R020, R002, R078, R027, R005 and R106 (Brazier classification). The median age for all patients was 79 years [patients with R027, 83 years (P<0.001); patients with R106, 73 years (P<0.001)]. In total, 10% of episodes were recurrences; values were higher for R027 (22%) and R106 (18%). CDI due to R078 was not significantly more likely to be community associated than healthcare associated (28% vs 24%; P=0.1). Complications occurred in 7% of all episodes, and 12% for those with R027 and R078. However, after adjusting for age, onset outside the hospital and recurrence, R027 was no longer associated with complications [odds ratio (OR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7–2.4], unlike R078 (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0–2.6; P=0.04). A positive stool toxin test and greater levels of toxin production in the cultured isolates were more likely for R078 and R027.
Conclusion
Out of the seven most common ribotypes in hospital patients, R078 and R027 were associated with higher rates of complications. Infections with R027 and R106 were more likely to be recurrent. The presence of toxin in stools was most likely with R078, R027 and R106, with highest levels of toxin production in vitro for R078 and R027. R060 produced the lowest levels of toxin in vitro."

Background
In most African countries the prevalence and effects of paediatric healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are unknown.
Aim
To investigate the burden, spectrum, risk factors, and impact of paediatric HCAI by prospective clinical surveillance at a South African referral hospital.
Methods
Continuous prospective clinical and laboratory HCAI surveillance using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definitions was conducted at Tygerberg Children's Hospital, South Africa, from May 1st to October 31st in 2014 and 2015. Risk factors for HCAI and associated mortality were analysed with multivariate logistic regression; excess length of stay was estimated using a confounder and time-matching approach.
Findings
HCAI incidence density was 31.1 per 1000 patient-days (95% CI: 28.2–34.2); hospital-acquired pneumonia (185/417; 44%), urinary tract infection (UTI) (45/417; 11%), bloodstream infection (BSI) (41/417; 10%), and surgical site infection (21/417; 5%) predominated. Device-associated HCAI incidence in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was high: 15.9, 12.9 and 16 per 1000 device-days for ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated BSI and catheter-associated UTI, respectively. HCAI was significantly associated with PICU stay (odds ratio: 2.0), malnutrition (1.6), HIV infection (1.7), HIV exposure (1.6), McCabe score ‘fatal’ (2.0), comorbidities (1.6), indwelling devices (1.9), blood transfusion (2.5), and transfer in (1.4). Two-thirds of paediatric deaths were HCAI-associated, occurring at a median of four days from HCAI onset with significantly higher crude mortality for HCAI-affected vs HCAI-unaffected hospitalizations [24/325 (7.4%) vs 12/1022 (1.2%); P<0.001]. HCAI resulted in US$371,887 direct costs with an additional 2275 hospitalization days, 2365 antimicrobial days, and 3575 laboratory investigations.
Conclusion
HCAI was frequent with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Establishment of HCAI surveillance and prevention programmes for African children is a public health priority."

Background
Rapid identification of patients infected with influenza virus, precise case definition and strict hygiene measures are important for the prevention of nosocomial transmission.
Aim
To prove the usefulness of a case definition for rapid identification of patients with influenza and to investigate the effect of two-step hygiene management, including the continuous use of surgical masks by hospital staff, on the rate of nosocomial infections.
Methods
All patients hospitalized between January and March 2015 with suspected influenza were enrolled. Real-time polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza was performed. Infected patients were managed according to the national hygiene guidelines, including the use of surgical masks by hospital staff during close contact with infected patients. When influenza activity increased, the continuous use of surgical masks by hospital staff was implemented as an add-on measure.
Findings
Most patients enrolled in this study were elderly (N=212, mean age 75 years). Frequency of cough was the only clinical parameter of respiratory infection that differed between influenza-negative and influenza-positive patients. Compared with the targeted use of surgical masks during close contact with infected patients, the continuous use of surgical masks for the entire working shift resulted in a reduction of nosocomial infections from 31% to 16%, respectively (P<0.01).
Conclusion
Discrimination between influenza A and other respiratory infections in elderly hospitalized patients was not possible based on clinical characteristics. With regard to hygiene management, the continuous use of surgical masks by hospital staff seems to be effective for the prevention of nosocomial infections."

Background
Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are a major health threat. There are few data about HCAI and antibiotic use in the People's Republic of China in the English literature.
Aim
To describe and discuss the prevalence of HCAI and antibiotic use from the 2015 point prevalence survey (PPS) in Dong Guan City.
Methods
In 2015, the Dong Guan (City) Nosocomial Infection Control and Quality Improvement Centre organized its yearly PPS in the secondary and tertiary care hospitals of Dong Guan City. The survey was performed on one single calendar day.
Findings
Thirty-seven secondary and 14 tertiary care hospitals assessed 9679 and 11,641 patients, respectively. A total of 616 patients had 681 HCAIs. The pooled HCAI prevalence (95% confidence interval) in secondary care, tertiary care, and all hospitals together was 2.3% (2.0–2.6), 3.4% (3.0–3.7), and 2.9% (2.6–3.1), respectively. Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), urinary tract infection (UTI), surgical site infection (SSI), and bloodstream infection together accounted for 73.1% of HCAIs. LRTI was the most frequently diagnosed HCAI (35.5%), followed by UTI (17.0%), and SSI (15.1%). Gram-negative bacteria were most frequently isolated (68.1%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (19.3%), and fungi (10.9%). Escherichia coli was the most frequent pathogen (14.8%), and Acinetobacter baumannii accounted for 10.9%. A total of 34.8% of the patients received one or more antimicrobials.
Conclusion
The pooled prevalence is in the range of other recent Chinese studies, but lower compared to previous reports in Europe, and the USA. The use of antimicrobials for therapeutic purposes is similar to that in Europe, but lower than previous Chinese reports, and lower than in the USA."

Background
Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus raffinosus has rarely been associated with nosocomial infection and outbreaks.
Aim
To report the successful control of a nosocomial outbreak of vanA-type vancomycin-resistant E. raffinosus in a surgical intensive care unit.
Methods
The investigation of the outbreak is reported with control measures taken. Molecular typing of vancomycin-resistant E. raffinosus isolates was performed by repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Findings
Between September and October 2014, vancomycin-resistant E. raffinosus isolates were isolated from four patients. The index patient had been hospitalized previously in Portugal, and was not found to be colonized by vancomycin-resistant enterococci on screening cultures obtained at admission. However, vancomycin-resistant E. raffinosus was isolated from a bile sample 19 days after hospital admission. All four isolates were resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin due to the presence of the vanA gene, while remaining susceptible to daptomycin and linezolid. Repetitive sequence-based PCR confirmed the spread of a single vanA-positive E. raffinosus clone. Infection control measures including direct PCR screening on rectal specimens, contact precautions, and cohorting of patients and personnel led to successful control of the outbreak.
Conclusion
This is the first reported outbreak of vanA-type vancomycin-resistant E. raffinosus in France in both clinical and screening specimens among hospitalized patients. The inability of routine selective screening media to detect the vancomycin-resistant E. raffinosus in the index case likely contributed to the outbreak."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a frequent cause of respiratory viral infections, increasing the morbidity and mortality in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. Little is known about the best management strategy in this immunocompromised group and there are very few data on oral ribavirin treatment.
Aim
To evaluate the effectiveness of oral ribavirin in allogeneic HSCT patients with RSV infection.
Methods
Twenty-three RSV cases treated with oral ribavirin were analysed retrospectively. RSV diagnosis was established by polymerase chain reaction assay. Oral ribavirin was initiated at 15 mg/kg/day in three divided doses for 10 days, with no subsequent dose escalation, as per centre policy.
Findings
At diagnosis, seven patients presented with lower respiratory tract infection (RTI), whereas 16 had upper RTI. Oral ribavirin was well tolerated with minor adverse effects. The median treatment duration was 10 days (range: 5–47). After a median follow-up of 17 months (range: 4–48), 17 patients are alive. We recorded one RSV-related and five non-related deaths.
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the largest single centre study yet performed on adult allogeneic HSCT recipients with RSV infection treated with oral ribavirin. Prompt initiation of treatment is essential and may avoid hospital admission. Our experience supports the use of oral ribavirin, but large prospective studies are needed to determine the optimal therapy in this patient group."

Background
Waterborne pathogens such as Pseudomonas spp. and Legionella spp. may persist in hospital water networks despite chemical disinfection. Point-of-use filtration represents a physical control measure that can be applied in high-risk areas to contain the exposure to such pathogens. New technologies have enabled an extension of filters' lifetimes and have made available faucet hollow-fibre filters for water ultrafiltration.
Aim
To compare point-of-use filters applied to cold water within their period of validity.
Methods
Faucet hollow-fibre filters (filter A), shower hollow-fibre filters (filter B) and faucet membrane filters (filter C) were contaminated in two different sets of tests with standard bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 939 and Brevundimonas diminuta ATCC 19146) and installed at points-of-use. Every day, from each faucet, 100 L of water was flushed. Before and after flushing, 250 mL of water was collected and analysed for microbiology.
Findings
There was a high capacity of microbial retention from filter C; filter B released only low Brevundimonas spp. counts; filter A showed poor retention of both micro-organisms.
Conclusion
Hollow-fibre filters did not show good micro-organism retention. All point-of-use filters require an appropriate maintenance of structural parameters to ensure their efficiency."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. Local epidemiological studies need to be conducted to set the priorities for surveillance and prevention programmes.
Aim
To investigate the epidemiology of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) among patients admitted to Polish adult ICUs over a three-year period.
Methods
Data were collected according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) European Union Point Prevalence Survey of Healthcare-associated Infections and Antimicrobial Use in European Acute Care Hospitals (EU-PPS HAI & AU) protocol for 39,318 patients within 160 acute care hospitals. From this initial database, data for adult ICU patients (N=945) were filtered for further analyses.
Findings
HAIs were present in 370 patients (39%) and 430 HAI episodes were recorded. The most common HAIs were respiratory tract infections (45%), usually caused by Enterobacteriaceae and Gram-negative non-fermenters. The majority (87%) of these infections were likely to be device associated. Out of 61 cases of bloodstream infection, 51% were catheter associated. These bloodstream infections were mainly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. Among 57 cases of surgical site infection, 42% were classified as organ/space, 33% were classified as deep incisional, and 25% were classified as superficial. The predominant micro-organisms were Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus. Out of 50 cases of urinary tract infection, 96% were device associated.
Conclusions
The prevalence of HAI among Polish adult ICU patients is higher than described in similar studies, but may be partially affected by methodological differences. The proportion of device-associated infections was very high, so there is an urgent need to introduce countrywide, targeted surveillance and prevention programmes."

Background
Enhanced environmental cleaning practices are among the most accepted measures for controlling the spread of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CR-Ab).
Aim
To evaluate the impact of heightened cleaning on an ongoing CR-Ab outbreak in a burn intensive care unit (BICU) of an Italian teaching hospital, where chlorhexidine–60% isopropyl alcohol was applied as a complementary disinfectant on high-touch surfaces.
Methods
Compliance with the microbial limit proposed for the BICU by AFNOR-NF-S90-351 (20 colony-forming units/100cm2) was assessed by plate count, and compared with the results obtained with intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) detection. Genotyping was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
Findings
During the standard cleaning regimen, three out of 23 samples (13%) gave results over the AFNOR limit and five (21.7%) showed unacceptable ATP levels with 100 relative light units/100cm2 as the benchmark limit (sensibility 86.4%, specificity 92.2%). Following improvement of the cleaning procedure, only two samples out of 50 (4%) did not satisfy the microbiological criteria and seven (14%) exceeded the ATP limit. In a successive phase, eight of 30 samples collected showed unacceptable results (27%).
Conclusions
Adding chlorhexidine–60% isopropyl alcohol as complementary disinfectant proved to be effective for reducing environmental microbial contamination, ATP levels and CR-Ab infection/colonization in patients admitted to the BICU. Real-time monitoring by ATP assay was useful for managing the cleaning schedule and reducing hospital infections, although the calculated values must be interpreted as cleanliness indicators rather than risk indicators."

Background
Escherichia coli causes more than one-third of the bacteraemia cases in England each year, and the incidence of these infections is increasing.
Aim
To determine the underlying risk factors associated with E. coli bacteraemia.
Methods
A three-month enhanced sentinel surveillance study involving 35 National Health Service hospitals was undertaken in the winter of 2012/13 to collect risk factor information and further details on the underlying source of infection to augment data already collected by the English national surveillance programme. Antimicrobial susceptibility results for E. coli isolated from blood and urine were also collected.
Findings
A total of 1731 cases of E. coli bacteraemia were included. The urogenital tract was the most frequently reported source of infection (51.2% of cases) with previous treatment for a urinary tract infection being the largest independent effect associated with this infection source. Half of all patients had previous healthcare exposure in the month prior to the bacteraemia with antimicrobial therapy and urinary catheterization being reported in one-third and one-fifth of these patients, respectively. Previous healthcare exposure was associated with a higher proportion of antibiotic non-susceptibility in the blood culture isolates (P=0.001).
Conclusion
Analysis of risk factors suggests the potential benefit of community- and hospital-related interventions, especially the better use of urinary catheters and improved antibiotic management of urinary tract infections. As part of the latter strategy, antibiotic resistance profiles need to be closely monitored to ensure that treatment guidelines are up to date to limit inappropriate empiric therapy."

Background
Washbasin U-bends are reservoirs of microbial contamination in healthcare environments. U-Bends are constantly full of water and harbour microbial biofilm.
Aim
To develop an effective automated cleaning and disinfection system for U-bends using two solutions generated by electrochemical activation of brine including the disinfectant anolyte (predominantly hypochlorous acid) and catholyte (predominantly sodium hydroxide) with detergent properties.
Methods
Initially three washbasin U-bends were manually filled with catholyte followed by anolyte for 5min each once weekly for five weeks. A programmable system was then developed with one washbasin that automated this process. This U-bend had three cycles of 5min catholyte followed by 5min anolyte treatment per week for three months. Quantitative bacterial counts from treated and control U-bends were determined on blood agar (CBA), R2A, PAS, and PA agars following automated treatment and on CBA and R2A following manual treatment.
Findings
The average bacterial density from untreated U-bends throughout the study was >1×105 cfu/swab on all media with Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounting for ∼50% of counts. Manual U-bend electrochemically activated (ECA) solution treatment reduced counts significantly (<100cfu/swab) (P<0.01 for CBA; P<0.005 for R2A). Similarly, counts from the automated ECA-treatment U-bend were significantly reduced with average counts for 35 cycles on CBA, R2A, PAS, and PA of 2.1±4.5 (P<0.0001), 13.1±30.1 (P<0.05), 0.7±2.8 (P<0.001), and 0 (P<0.05) cfu/swab, respectively. P. aeruginosa was eliminated from all treated U-bends.
Conclusion
Automated ECA treatment of washbasin U-bends consistently minimizes microbial contamination."

Background
Healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) represents a major problem for patient safety worldwide.
Aim
To demonstrate the prevalence, causative agents, and risk factors for HCAI in Chinese hospitals.
Methods
A one-day point-prevalence survey was conducted in 52 Chinese hospitals between October 2014 and March 2015. A web-based software system was developed for data entry and management.
Findings
Among 53,939 patients surveyed, the prevalence of patients with at least one HCAI was 3.7%. Of 2182 HCAI episodes, the most frequently occurring types were lower respiratory tract infections (47.2%), followed by urinary tract infection (12.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (11.0%), and surgical site infection (6.2%). The prevalence of patients with at least one HCAI in critical care units was highest (17.1%). Device-associated infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-associated urinary tract infection, and central catheter-associated bloodstream infection, accounted for only 7.9% of all HCAIs. The most frequently isolated micro-organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa [206 infections (9.4%)], Acinetobacter baumannii [172 infections (7.9%)], Klebsiella pneumoniae [160 infections (7.3%)], and Escherichia coli [145 infections (6.6%)]. Of the survey patients (18,206/53,939), 33.8% were receiving at least one antimicrobial agent at the time of the survey. Risk factors for HCAI included older age (≥80 years), male gender, days of hospital admission, admission into a critical care unit, and device utilization.
Conclusion
Our study suggests that the overall prevalence of HCAI in surveyed Chinese hospitals was lower than that reported from most European countries and the USA. More attention should be given to the surveillance and prevention of non-device-associated HCAI in China."

Background
Accumulated data indicate that meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are associated with a worse prognosis than methicillin-susceptible S. aureus infections.
Aim
To assess the epidemiological profile of S. aureus infections and the genetic diversity of clinical strains of MRSA in 12 hospitals in southern Poland.
Methods
Samples from bloodstream infections, pneumonia, and skin and soft tissue infections from adult patients were examined. S. aureus isolates were tested for MRSA and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) phenotypes. Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing and S. aureus protein A (spa) typing were performed. Analysis of the genetic similarity was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
Results
This study included 555 patients. An MRSA phenotype was detected in 15.1% of strains. The prevalence of MRSA infection was higher in patients aged >80 years. An MLSB phenotype was detected in 18.2% of strains. Analysis of SmaI profiles did not reveal a dominant clone. Spa typing showed 25 different spa types, and spa type t003 was the most common (49% of strains). Among MRSA strains, SCCmecII (49%) and SCCmecIV (27.4%) were predominant.
Conclusion
The characteristics of MRSA showed considerable heterogeneity. The results demonstrate the need for caution when drawing conclusions on direct epidemiological relationships between isolates based on a single typing method. As the cases of infection in this study were not associated with the hospital environment and horizontal transfer, a focus on screening at hospital admission, and appropriate infection control, may help to reduce the risk of MRSA infections."

Background
Clostridium difficile is a bacterial healthcare-associated infection that may be transferred by houseflies (Musca domestica) due to their close ecological association with humans and cosmopolitan nature.
Aim
To determine the ability of M. domestica to transfer C. difficile both mechanically and following ingestion.
Methods
M. domestica were exposed to independent suspensions of vegetative cells and spores of C. difficile, then sampled on to selective agar plates immediately postexposure and at 1-h intervals to assess the mechanical transfer of C. difficile. Fly excreta was cultured and alimentary canals were dissected to determine internalization of cells and spores.
Findings
M. domestica exposed to vegetative cell suspensions and spore suspensions of C. difficile were able to transfer the bacteria mechanically for up to 4h upon subsequent contact with surfaces. The greatest numbers of colony-forming units (CFUs) per fly were transferred immediately following exposure (mean CFUs 123.8 +/− 66.9 for vegetative cell suspension and 288.2 +/− 83.2 for spore suspension). After 1h, this had reduced (21.2 +/− 11.4 for vegetative cell suspension and 19.9 +/− 9 for spores). Mean C. difficile CFUs isolated from the M. domestica alimentary canal was 35 +/− 6.5, and mean C. difficile CFUs per faecal spot was 1.04 +/− 0.58. C. difficile could be recovered from fly excreta for up to 96h.
Conclusion
This study describes the potential for M. domestica to contribute to environmental persistence and spread of C. difficile in hospitals, highlighting flies as realistic vectors of this micro-organism in clinical areas."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Patients with metastatic spinal tumours have a limited prognosis. Surgical complications that may result in prolonged hospitalization or readmission are highly undesirable. Surgical site infection (SSI) is one such complication, which can, in extreme cases, lead to death.
Aim
To assess the impact of SSI on patient survival after surgery for spinal metastases.
Methods
Demographic, operative, and survival data were collected on 152 patients undergoing surgery for spinal metastasis at a large UK tertiary referral centre. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade and the Revised Tokuhashi Score (RTS) were determined as measures of health status and prognosis, respectively, at baseline. A semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards survival analysis was used to assess the relationships between covariates and survival.
Findings
Seventeen patients (11.2%) experienced SSI. Overall, median survival time from operation was 262 days (95% confidence interval: 190–334 days) and 12-month survival was 42.1%. RTS (hazard ratio: 0.82; 95% confidence interval: 0.76–0.89; P < 0.001) and ASA grade (1.37; 1.03–1.82; P=0.028) were significantly associated with survival, with better survival found in patients with higher RTS and lower ASA scores. Infection status was of substantive importance, with better survival in those without SSI (P=0.075).
Conclusion
Twelve-month survival in patients undergoing surgery for spinal metastasis is ∼42%. RTS and ASA scores may be used as indicators of patient survival either in combination or individually. Whereas SSI has some negative impact on survival, a larger study sample would be needed to confirm whether this is statistically significant."

Background
Sepsis is a major cause of mortality with an estimated 37,000 deaths in the UK each year. This study aimed to determine host factors that can predict severe sepsis in a bacteraemic cohort.
Methods
From December 2012 to November 2013, demographic, clinical and microbiological data were collected on consecutive patients with bacteraemia at a London teaching hospital. These data were used to categorize patients as having severe or non-severe sepsis. Multi-variate logistic regression was used to determine the association between host factors and severe sepsis.
Findings
Five hundred and ninety-four bacteraemic episodes occurred in 500 patients. The majority of cases were in patients aged >50 years (382/594, 64.3%) and in males (346/594, 58.2%). The most common isolates were Escherichia coli (207/594, 34.8%) and meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (57/594, 9.6%). In logistic regression multi-variable analysis, site of infection was significantly associated with severe sepsis. For catheter-associated urinary tract infections, the association was significant after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index and where infection was acquired (odds ratio 3.94, 95% confidence interval 1.70–9.11).
Conclusions
Urinary catheters increase the risk of severe sepsis. They should only be used if clinically indicated. If inserted, a care bundle approach should be used and the anticipated removal date should be recorded unless a long-term catheter is required. In the context of sepsis, the presence of a urinary catheter should prompt immediate implementation of ‘Sepsis Six’ and consideration of transfer to a critical care unit."

Background
Few studies have explored the microbial contamination of glove boxes in clinical settings. The objective of this observational study was to investigate whether a new glove packaging system in which single gloves are dispensed vertically, cuff end first, has lower levels of contamination on the gloves and on the surface around the box aperture compared with conventional glove boxes.
Methods
Seven participating sites were provided with vertical glove dispensing systems (modified boxes) and conventional boxes. Before opening glove boxes, the surface around the aperture was sampled microbiologically to establish baseline levels of superficial contamination. Once the glove boxes were opened, the first pair of gloves in each box was sampled for viable bacteria. Thereafter, testing sites were visited on a weekly basis over a period of six weeks and the same microbiological assessments were made.
Results
The surface near the aperture of the modified boxes became significantly less contaminated over time compared with the conventional boxes (P<0.001), with an average of 46.7% less contamination around the aperture. Overall, gloves from modified boxes showed significantly less colony-forming unit contamination than gloves from conventional boxes (P<0.001). Comparing all sites over the entire six-week period, gloves from modified boxes had 88.9% less bacterial contamination.
Conclusion
This simple improvement to glove box design reduces contamination of unused gloves. Such modifications could decrease the risk of microbial cross-transmission in settings that use gloves. However, such advantages do not substitute for strict hand hygiene compliance and appropriate use of non-sterile, single-use gloves."

Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection acquired in the hospital and in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) has been poorly characterized.
Aim
To assess the clinical impact of hospital-acquired infection with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus in critically ill patients.
Methods
Analysis of a prospective database of the Spanish registry (2009–2015) of patients with severe influenza A admitted to the ICU. Infection was defined as hospital-acquired when diagnosis and starting of treatment occurred from the seventh day of hospital stay with no suspicion on hospital admission, and community-acquired when diagnosis was established within the first 48 h of admission.
Findings
Of 2421 patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection, 224 (9.3%) were classified as hospital-acquired and 1103 (45.6%) as community-acquired (remaining cases unclassified). Intra-ICU mortality was higher in the hospital-acquired group (32.9% vs 18.8%, P < 0.001). Independent factors associated with mortality were hospital-acquired influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection (odds ratio: 1.63; 95% confidence interval: 1.37–1.99), APACHE II score on ICU admission (1.09; 1.06–1.11), underlying haematological disease (3.19; 1.78–5.73), and need of extrarenal depuration techniques (4.20; 2.61–6.77) and mechanical ventilation (4.34; 2.62–7.21).

To describe mortality rates up to one year post infection and the significant factors associated with death.
Methods
Positive blood cultures for P. aeruginosa were identified retrospectively from January 2008 to January 2011 at seven tertiary care hospitals. Extensive epidemiological, clinical and outcome data were obtained.
Findings
Three hundred and eighty-eight BSI episodes were included in the analysis. The majority of infections were hospital acquired. The most common patient comorbidities were haematological or oncological. Seventy-eight percent of the cohort had a medical device in situ in the preceding seven days. Sixty-one percent of the cohort received adequate empirical therapy. All-cause mortality was 4% at 48 h, 19% at one month and 38% at one year. Forty-eight-hour mortality was associated with non-hospital-acquired infection, pulmonary comorbidity, recent corticosteroid therapy, and a Pitt bacteraemia score >2. Comorbidities became significantly associated with mortality from seven days post infection. Long-term mortality (defined as mortality at one year) was associated with female sex, haematological or oncological comorbidity, a Charlson comorbidity index >2 and recent corticosteroid therapy.

Background
Since the first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in South Korea was reported on 20th May 2015, there have been 186 confirmed cases, 38 deaths and 16,752 suspected cases. Previously published research on South Korea's MERS outbreak was limited to the early stages, when few data were available. Now that the outbreak has ended, albeit unofficially, a more comprehensive review is appropriate.
Methods
Data were obtained through the MERS portal by the Ministry for Health and Welfare (MOHW) and Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, press releases by MOHW, and reports by the MERS Policy Committee of the Korean Medical Association. Cases were analysed for general characteristics, exposure source, timeline and infection generation. Sex, age and underlying diseases were analysed for the 38 deaths.
Findings
Beginning with the index case that infected 28 others, an in-depth analysis was conducted. The average age was 55 years, which was a little higher than the global average of 50 years. As in most other countries, more men than women were affected. The case fatality rate was 19.9%, which was lower than the global rate of 38.7% and the rate in Saudi Arabia (36.5%). In total, 184 patients were infected nosocomially and there were no community-acquired infections. The main underlying diseases were respiratory diseases, cancer and hypertension. The main contributors to the outbreak were late diagnosis, quarantine failure of ‘super spreaders’, familial care-giving and visiting, non-disclosure by patients, poor communication by the South Korean Government, inadequate hospital infection management, and ‘doctor shopping’. The outbreak was entirely nosocomial, and was largely attributable to infection management and policy failures, rather than biomedical factors."

Background
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most frequent cause of nosocomial diarrhoea in adults. Cancer patients, in particular, are at a higher risk for CDI. Limited clinical data exist regarding the use of tigecycline for the treatment of CDI, especially in patients with oncologic and haematologic malignancies.
Aim
To characterize the use of tigecycline for treatment of CDI in oncology patients at an academic cancer centre.
Methods
This was a retrospective, single-centre, single-arm, chart review evaluating the use of tigecycline for the management of CDI in oncology patients at an academic cancer centre.
Findings
The median age of CDI diagnosis in this patient group (N=66) was 65 years (range: 16–84) and the majority of patients had solid tumour malignancies. Fifty-six percent of patients had severe CDI, 70.3% of which were classified as having severe complicated disease. The median time to initiation of tigecycline therapy was 2 days (mean: 3.83) and the median number of tigecycline doses was 13 (range: 1–50). Twelve non-CDI breakthrough infections were observed, and four patients developed CDI while receiving tigecycline for non-CDI indications. The rate of death was 18% and the recurrence rate was 15.2%.
Conclusion
Tigecycline did not lead to overt benefits in outcomes of oncology patients with CDI when compared to historical data. In addition, several breakthrough CDIs were observed in patients who received the drug for a non-CDI indication. Further prospective research is needed to validate the use of tigecycline for management of CDI."

Transfer of Clostridium difficile by Musca domestica has been demonstrated, revealing their potential for disseminating infection in the hospital environment.

To determine the ability of M. domestica larvae to acquire and retain C. difficile throughout their metamorphosis into adult flies.
Methods
Larvae were exposed to spores of C. difficile in a faecal emulsion, and examined externally and internally to determine carriage and internalization of spores through their development to adults.
Findings
Larvae harboured C. difficile externally, with means of 21.56+/−5.76 colony-forming units (cfu) at Day 0, 22.44+/−9.90 cfu at Day 2, decreasing to 0.56+/−0.34 cfu at Day 4, with no C. difficile isolated thereafter. The same larvae harboured C. difficile internally, with means of 587.33+/−238.29 cfu at Day 0, decreasing to 297.44+/−155.21 cfu at Day 2, decreasing further to 73.67+/−46.74 cfu at Day 4, with no C. difficile isolated thereafter. The zero recovery of C. difficile coincided with the development of M. domestica larvae into pupae. From Day 6 onwards, all larvae had developed into the pupal stage and no C. difficile was recoverable from any pupae. No C. difficile was recovered from adult flies (emerged on Day 12) or empty puparia.
Conclusion
Although C. difficile spores are readily acquired and internalized by larvae during feeding, they are not retained through development to adults. Adult flies therefore acquire C. difficile contamination as adults. The potential antimicrobial action of M. domestica larvae and their extracts against C. difficile spores warrants further investigation."

abstract = "Summary
Objective
Healthcare-associated Clostridium difficile infection (HCA-CDI) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. However, few data exist on the burden of HCA-CDI in multi-site non-metropolitan settings. This study examined the introduction of an antimicrobial stewardship programme (ASP) in relation to HCA-CDI rates, and the effect of HCA-CDI on length of stay (LOS) and hospital costs.
Methods
A comparative before-and-after intervention study of patients aged ≥16 years with HCA-CDI from December 2010 to April 2016 across the nine hospitals of a non-metropolitan health district in New South Wales, Australia was undertaken. The intervention comprised a multi-site ASP supported by a clinical decision support system, with subsequent introduction of email feedback of HCA-CDI cases to admitting medical officers.
Main outcome measures
HCA-CDI rates, comparative LOS and hospital costs, prior use of antimicrobials and proton pump inhibitors, and appropriateness of CDI treatment.
Results
HCA-CDI rates rose from 3.07 to 4.60 cases per 10,000 occupied bed-days pre-intervention, and remained stable at 4 cases per 10,000 occupied bed-days post-intervention (P=0.24). Median LOS (17 vs six days; P<0.01) and hospital costs (AU$19,222 vs $7861; P<0.01) were significantly greater for HCA-CDI cases (N=91) than for matched controls (N=172). Half of the patients with severe HCA-CDI (4/8) did not receive initial appropriate treatment (oral vancomycin).
Conclusions
HCA-CDI placed a significant burden on the regional and rural health service through increased LOS and hospital costs. Interventions targeting HCA-CDI could be employed to consolidate the effects of ASPs."

abstract = "Summary
Chlorhexidine digluconate (CHG) is an antimicrobial agent used for different types of applications in hand hygiene, skin antisepsis, oral care, and patient washing. Increasing use raises concern regarding development of acquired bacterial resistance. Published data from clinical isolates with CHG minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were reviewed and compared to epidemiological cut-off values to determine resistance. CHG resistance is rarely found in Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci. In Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., Proteus spp., Providencia spp. and Enterococcus spp., however, isolates are more often CHG resistant. CHG resistance may be detected in multi-resistant isolates such as extremely drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Isolates with a higher MIC are often less susceptible to CHG for disinfection. Although cross-resistance to antibiotics remains controversial, some studies indicate that the overall exposure to CHG increases the risk for resistance to some antibiotic agents. Resistance to CHG has resulted in numerous outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections. On an average intensive care unit, most of the CHG exposure would be explained by hand hygiene agents when liquid soaps or alcohol-based hand rubs contain CHG. Exposure to sub-lethal CHG concentration may enhance resistance in Acinetobacter spp., K. pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas spp., all species well known for emerging antibiotic resistance. In order to reduce additional selection pressure in nosocomial pathogens it seems to make sense to restrict the valuable agent CHG to those indications with a clear patient benefit and to eliminate it from applications without any benefit or with a doubtful benefit."

Background
Previous studies of the association between antibiotic exposure and risk of hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile-associated infection (CDI) have not fully accounted for patient severity of illness, and competing risks.
Aim
To determine the potential effects of interventions on hospital-acquired CDI risk.
Methods
All adults admitted to a teaching hospital between 2004 and 2014 for more than two days were included. Exposures to all antibiotics and cases of CDI were determined. Patients were followed until discharge from hospital, death, or acquisition of hospital-acquired CDI (defined as positive toxin assay in unformed stool >2 days following admission). Multivariable proportional hazards competing-risks modelling with time-dependent covariates was used, accounting for patient severity of illness using the Escobar model.
Findings
In all, 208,104 patients were studied. Hospital-acquired CDI risk was 0.46 events per 1000 patient-days, decreasing significantly during the study period. Compared to the 5th percentile hospital death risk (0.02%), patients with a 50% risk of death in hospital had an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of hospital-acquired CDI of 5.5. Exposure to some antibiotics significantly increased hospital-acquired CDI risk, being highest for carbapenems (aHR: 1.47 after one week of continuous exposure) and intravenous vancomycin (aHR: 1.53). On the ward, sharing a room with other patients newly diagnosed with CDI significantly increased the risk of subsequent disease (aHR: 1.16 on CDI diagnosis day).
Conclusion
The primary determinant of hospital-acquired CDI was patient severity of illness. Exposure to both antibiotics and other patients with CDI significantly increased the subsequent risk of hospital-acquired CDI but this risk was small relative to patient severity of illness."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Over the past decade, the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) has increased. Whilst basic infection prevention and control practices reduce the risk of transmission, cases of unrecognized carriage pose a potential risk of transmission.
Aim
To estimate the prevalence of CPE and explore risk factors associated with colonization within a large teaching hospital with an established CPE outbreak.
Methods
All inpatients that had not previously tested positive for CPE were offered testing. Demographic and hospital episode data were also collected, together with antibiotic and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use in the preceding 24h.
Findings
This study identified 70 CPE-positive cases (26 newly identified and 44 previously known) and 592 CPE-negative cases, giving a combined prevalence of 11% [95% confidence interval (CI) 8–13]. Medication (antibiotic and PPI use), previous admission, ethnicity and length of stay were assessed as risk factors for colonization, and none were found to be independently associated with CPE colonization. Using logistic regression, age [odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.07] and antibiotic use (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.08-6.03) were the only risk factors significantly associated with CPE colonization.
Conclusion
This study has added to the evidence base by estimating the prevalence of CPE among inpatients in an acute hospital with an established CPE outbreak. A case-finding exercise was feasible and identified a number of new cases. Despite a small sample size, increasing age and prescription of an antibiotic on the day of testing were significantly associated with CPE colonization."

abstract = "Summary
Background
All health workers should take responsibility for infection prevention and control (IPC). Recent reduction in key reported healthcare-associated infections in the UK is impressive, but the determinants of success are unknown. It is imperative to understand how IPC strategies operate as new challenges arise and threats of antimicrobial resistance increase.
Methods
The authors undertook a retrospective, independent evaluation of an action plan to enhance IPC and ‘ownership’ (individual accountability) for IPC introduced throughout a healthcare organization. Twenty purposively selected informants were interviewed. Data were analysed inductively. Normalization Process Theory (NPT) was applied to interpret the findings and explain how the action plan was operating.
Findings
Six themes emerged through inductive analysis. Theme 1: ‘Ability to make sense of ownership’ provided evidence of the first element of NPT (coherence). Regardless of occupational group or seniority, informants understood the importance of IPC ownership and described what it entailed. They identified three prerequisites: ‘Always being vigilant’ (Theme 2), ‘Importance of access to information’ (Theme 3) and ‘Being able to learn together in a no-blame culture’ (Theme 4). Data relating to each theme provided evidence of the other elements of NPT that are required to embed change: planning implementation (cognitive participation), undertaking the work necessary to achieve change (collective action), and reflection on what else is needed to promote change as part of continuous quality improvement (reflexive monitoring). Informants identified barriers (e.g. workload) and facilitators (clear lines of communication and expectations for IPC).
Conclusion
Eighteen months after implementing the action plan incorporating IPC ownership, there was evidence of continuous service improvement and significant reduction in infection rates. Applying a theory that identifies factors that promote/inhibit routine incorporation (‘normalization’) of IPC into everyday health care can help explain the success of IPC initiatives and inform implementation."

Background
Needlestick injuries (NSIs) are the most common cause of sharps injuries and pose a serious risk to healthcare workers (HCWs). In 2014, ‘Technical rule for biological agents in healthcare and welfare facilities' (TRBA 250) was modified in Germany in order to promote the prevention of sharps injuries.
Aims
To examine the epidemiology of NSIs among HCWs in hospitals, doctor's offices and in- and outpatient care; to collect information on the causes of the accidents when safety-engineered devices (SEDs) are used; and to compare the results with the main principles of TRBA 250.
Methods
The survey was based on HCWs' compensation claims for NSIs, as notified within a four-week period in November 2014. Detailed information on the NSI was collected by telephone interview.
Findings
In total, 533 HCWs participated. Subcutaneous needles were most often involved in NSIs, regardless of the healthcare setting (39% of all NSIs). Insulin pens were involved in 48% of NSIs in in- and outpatient care. Disposal of sharps devices accounted for 38% of the injuries. SEDs were used in 20% of NSIs. Lack of activation was the most important cause of failure when SEDs were used.
Conclusion
Despite the binding recommendations of TRBA 250, more efforts are needed to increase the experience of HCWs in terms of working with SEDs. All professional groups must be encouraged to be more aware of the risks associated with sharps disposal. Safe handling practices for disposal of insulin pens are needed in in- and outpatient care settings."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Healthcare facility hand hygiene impacts patient care, healthcare worker safety, and infection control, but low-income countries have few data to guide interventions.
Aim
To conduct a nationally representative survey of hand hygiene infrastructure and behaviour in Bangladeshi healthcare facilities to establish baseline data to aid policy.
Methods
The 2013 Bangladesh National Hygiene Baseline Survey examined water, sanitation, and hand hygiene across households, schools, restaurants and food vendors, traditional birth attendants, and healthcare facilities. We used probability proportional to size sampling to select 100 rural and urban population clusters, and then surveyed hand hygiene infrastructure in 875 inpatient healthcare facilities, observing behaviour in 100 facilities.
Findings
More than 96% of facilities had ‘improved’ water sources, but environmental contamination occurred frequently around water sources. Soap was available at 78–92% of handwashing locations for doctors and nurses, but just 4–30% for patients and family. Only 2% of 4676 hand hygiene opportunities resulted in recommended actions: using alcohol sanitizer or washing both hands with soap, then drying by air or clean cloth. Healthcare workers performed recommended hand hygiene in 9% of 919 opportunities: more after patient contact (26%) than before (11%). Family caregivers frequently washed hands with only water (48% of 2751 opportunities), but with little soap (3%).
Conclusion
Healthcare workers had more access to hand hygiene materials and performed better hand hygiene than family, but still had low adherence. Increasing hand hygiene materials and behaviour could improve infection control in Bangladeshi healthcare facilities."

abstract = "Summary
The purpose of hand hygiene is to break the chain of healthcare-associated infection. In many countries hand hygiene is regularly audited as part of quality assurance based on recommendations from the World Health Organization. Direct observation is the recommended audit method but is associated with disadvantages, including potential for being observed to alter usual behaviour. The Hawthorne effect in relation to hand hygiene is analogous with productivity improvement by increasing the frequency with which hand hygiene is undertaken. Unobtrusive and/or frequent observation to accustom staff to the presence of observers is considered an acceptable way of reducing the Hawthorne effect, but few publications have discussed how to implement these techniques or examine their effectiveness. There is evidence that awareness of being watched can disrupt the usual behaviour of individuals in complex and unpredictable ways other than simple productivity effect. In the presence of auditors, health workers might defer or avoid activities that require hand hygiene, but these issues are not addressed in guidelines for practice or research studies. This oversight has implications for the validity of hand hygiene audit findings. Measuring hand hygiene product use overcomes avoidance tactics. It is cheaper and generates data continuously to assess the compliance of all clinicians without disrupting patient care. Disadvantages are the risk of overestimating uptake through spillage, wastage, or use by visitors and non-clinical staff entering patient care areas. Electronic devices may overcome the Hawthorne and avoidance effects but are costly and are not widely used outside research studies."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The Bengal Bay clone, ST772-MRSA-V, associated with multi-drug resistance, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and skin and soft tissue infections, is emerging worldwide. In Norway, a country with low prevalence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), increased occurrence of ST772-MRSA-V has also caused hospital outbreaks. The conserved nature of this clone challenged the outbreak investigations.
Aim
To evaluate the usefulness of S. aureus protein A (spa) typing, multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat fingerprinting/analysis (MLVF/MLVA) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) when investigating outbreaks with a conserved MRSA clone.
Methods
A panel of 25 MRSA isolates collected in 2004–2014, consisting of six hospital outbreak isolates and 19 sporadic isolates, were analysed using spa typing, polymerase chain reaction detection of genes encoding PVL, MLVF/MLVA and PFGE.
Findings
All isolates were ST772-MRSA-V-t657 and resistant to erythromycin, gentamicin and norfloxacin, and 88% were PVL positive. PFGE could not discriminate between the isolates (≥85% similarity). MLVF resolved five types [Simpson's index of diversity (SID)=0.56], MLVA resolved six types (SID=0.66), and both methods separated the hospital isolates into two defined outbreaks.
Conclusion
MLVF/MLVA could not discriminate all epidemiologically unlinked cases and identical genotypes originated from a timespan of 10 years. MLVA was regarded as most suitable due to its higher discriminatory power and ability to provide unambiguous profiles. However, the Bengal Bay clone may require higher resolution methods for exact demarcation of outbreaks due to low diversity among isolates."

Sixteen pertussis cases in haemodialysis patients and healthcare workers were detected in a 25-bed outpatient haemodialysis facility in Japan between October 2013 and April 2014.
Aim
To describe an outbreak of pertussis among patients and healthcare workers, and to identify risk factors for pertussis infection.
Methods
Sputum cultures, loop-mediated isothermal amplification assays performed on nasopharyngeal swabs to detect respiratory pathogens including Bordetella pertussis, and serum anti-pertussis toxin immunoglobulin G measurements were performed for all haemodialysis patients and healthcare workers. A retrospective case–control study was performed to identify the risk factors for pertussis infection in the clinic.
Findings
Only six of the 16 pertussis patients (37.5%) had respiratory symptoms. Recent exposure to an unmasked individual with a cough was associated with pertussis infection (odds ratio 6.25, P<0.05). The outbreak was terminated successfully after enforcing the use of surgical masks among both patients and healthcare workers.

Background
Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), especially those that produce Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and are associated with colistin resistance, pose a severe health threat due to the limited treatment options.
Aim
To describe two outbreaks of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae in an adult intensive care unit (AICU) in Brazil. In May 2015, 14 patients had colistin-susceptible KPC-producing strains (ColS-KPC), and in July 2015, nine patients had colistin-resistant KPC-producing strains (ColR-KPC).
Methods
Between September 2014 and August 2015, we performed surveillance at a university hospital and all CRE were tested for blaKPC genes. Clonality was investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Resistance to colistin was confirmed by broth microdilution method. Consumption of carbapenems and colistin was expressed as defined daily doses.
Findings
In all, 111 patients with CRE were identified during the surveillance period; K. pneumoniae was the major isolate (77.13%). The two outbreaks were identified when infection rates (KPC per 1000 patient-days) exceeded the background level. Rates of carbapenem and colistin consumption were high. Control measures (bedside alcohol gel, contact precautions, regular rectal swabs) did not curtail the outbreaks. Mortality rates were 42.9% and 44.4% for ColS-KPC- and ColR-KPC-infected patients, respectively. After the death of four infected patients with ColR-KPC, the unit was closed to new admissions.
Conclusion
Our experience demonstrates the serious risks presented by KPC, and especially ColR-KPC, in Brazilian AICUs. Selective pressure from excessive antibiotic use and transmission on healthcare workers' hands were likely the major factors in transmission."

We analysed the efficacy of disinfecting gloves by comparing an individual effect of five different hand disinfectant solutions in combination with three different glove types.
Methods
The investigation was performed in accordance with DIN EN 1500:2013. For all combinations, ten analyses were performed, including (1) right/left-hand examination disinfection efficacy after the first and fifth contamination with E. coli K12 NCTC 10538, (2) recovery rates after contamination, (3) reduction efficacy, (4) fingertip immersion culture, and (5) check for tightness. Disinfection of the ungloved hands was taken as an additional benchmark.
Findings
The disinfection efficacy for all disinfectant/glove combinations was better with rather than without gloves. For eight combinations, the disinfection efficacy was always >5.0 log10. There were significant differences within the gloves (P=0.0021) and within the disinfectant product (P=0.0023), respectively.

Background
Many countries have implemented guidelines to prevent transmission of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Important contextual factors of stigma can be identified in the context of MRSA. Over the past decade, concerns have been raised over a possible stigmatizing effect of these actions.
Aim
To identify and quantify the occurrence of MRSA-associated stigma, and to explore its association with mental health in a country with an MRSA ‘search and destroy’ policy.
Methods
In 2014, a questionnaire study among 57 Dutch MRSA carriers (people that carry MRSA without signs of MRSA infection) was performed. Stigma was measured with an adjusted version of the Berger HIV Stigma Scale. Mental health was measured with the five-item RAND Mental Health Inquiry.
Findings
Thirty-two (56%) MRSA carriers reported stigma; of these, eight (14%) reported ‘clear stigma’ (Berger score >110) and 24 (42%) reported ‘suggestive for stigma’ (Berger score 76–110). Educational level, female sex and intensive MRSA eradication therapy were associated with higher stigma scores. Poor mental health (RAND score <60) was reported by 33% of MRSA carriers. Stigma and mental health scores were inversely correlated. Stigma was experienced most frequently in healthcare settings, and was seldom experienced in the religious community or at sport facilities.
Conclusion
A substantial proportion of MRSA carriers reported stigma due to MRSA, and stigma was associated with poor mental health. Anticipation of MRSA-associated stigma is warranted, both in the way that care is delivered by hospital staff and in the way that care is organized within the hospital."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infection in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Decolonization may eliminate bacterial reservoirs that drive MRSA transmission.
Aim
To measure the association between colonization pressure from decolonized and non-decolonized neonates and MRSA acquisition to inform use of this strategy for control of endemic MRSA.
Methods
An eight-year retrospective cohort study was conducted in a level-4 NICU that used active surveillance cultures and decolonization for MRSA control. Weekly colonization pressure exposures were defined as the number of patient-days of concurrent admission with treated (decolonized) and untreated (non-decolonized) MRSA carriers in the preceding seven days. Poisson regression was used to estimate risk of incident MRSA colonization associated with colonization pressure exposures. The population-attributable fraction was calculated to assess the proportion of overall unit MRSA incidence attributable to treated or untreated patients in this setting.
Findings
Every person-day increase in exposure to an untreated MRSA carrier was associated with a 6% increase in MRSA acquisition risk [relative risk (RR): 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–1.11]. Risk of acquisition was not influenced by exposure to treated, isolated MRSA carriers (RR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.98–1.04). In the context of this MRSA control programme, 22% (95% CI: 4.0–37) of MRSA acquisition could be attributed to exposures to untreated MRSA carriers.
Conclusion
Untreated MRSA carriers were an important reservoir for transmission. Decolonized patients on contact isolation posed no detectable transmission threat, supporting the hypothesis that decolonization may reduce patient-to-patient transmission. Non-patient reservoirs may contribute to unit MRSA acquisition and require further investigation."

Background
Controlling antibiotic use in healthcare establishments limits their consumption and the emergence of bacterial resistance.
Aim
To evaluate the efficiency of an innovative antibiotic stewardship strategy implemented over three years in a university hospital.
Methods
An antimicrobial multi-disciplinary team (AMT) [pharmacist, microbiologist and infectious disease specialist (IDS)] conducted a postprescription review. Specific coding of targeted antibiotics (including broad-spectrum β-lactams, glycopeptides, lipopeptides, fluoroquinolones and carbapenems) in the computerized physician order entry allowed recording of all new prescriptions. The data [patient, antibiotic(s), prescription start date, etc.] were registered on an AMT spreadsheet with shared access, where the microbiologist's opinion on the drug choice, based on available microbiology results, was entered. When the microbiologist and pharmacist did not approve the antibiotic prescribed, a same-day alert was generated and sent to the IDS. That alert led the IDS to re-evaluate the treatment.
Findings
From 2012 to 2014, 2106 targeted antibiotic prescriptions were reviewed. Among them, 389 (18.5%) generated an alert and 293 (13.9%) were re-evaluated by the IDS. Recommendations (mostly de-escalation or discontinuation) were necessary for 136 (46.4%) and the prescribers' acceptance rate was 97%. The estimated intervention time was <30 min/day for each AMT member. This system allowed correct use of targeted antibiotics for 91.8% of prescriptions, but had no significant impact on targeted antibiotic consumption.
Conclusion
This computerized, shared access, antibiotic stewardship strategy seems to be time saving, and effectively limited misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an opportunistic multi-drug-resistant bacterium responsible for healthcare-associated infections. Strategies for in-hospital infection control and management of carriers and environmental reservoirs remain controversial.
Aim
To determine the population structure of S. maltophilia strains in hospitalized infected patients and to identify putative highly pathogenic subpopulations that require upgraded infection control measures.
Methods
Eighty-three diverse human strains of various clinical origins from 18 geographically distant hospitals were characterized phenotypically and genotypically using a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) approach.
Findings
Neither a predominant nor emerging sequence type (ST) was identified. Among the 80 typeable strains, only 29% corresponded to described STs, especially ST5 (N=6) and ST4/26/31 (N=2). The ST distribution and the phylogenic tree based on the concatenated MLST genes did not account for geographical, clinical origin or antimicrobial susceptibility clustering. A phylogenic tree that included 173 ST profiles from the MLST database and the 80 typeable strains confirmed the high genetic diversity of S. maltophilia, the previously reported genogroup organization and the predominance of genogroup 6, as it represented 41% (33/80) of the strains. Unexpectedly, genogroup 2 was the second most prevalent genogroup and included 16% (13/80) of the strains. These genogroups represented 57% (20/35) of the strains in respiratory patients and 75% (9/12) of the strains in patients with cystic fibrosis.
Conclusion
Beyond MLST, the over-representation of some genogroups among strains responsible for healthcare-associated infections was confirmed. Genogrouping affiliation is recommended to implement infection control measures selectively for the most pathogenic strains isolated from patient or environmental reservoirs."

Background
Acinetobacter baumannii is a major hospital-acquired pathogen in Thailand that has a negative effect on patient survival. The nature of its transmission is poorly understood.
Aim
To investigate the genotypic and spatiotemporal pattern of A. baumannii infection at a hospital in Thailand.
Methods
The medical records of patients infected with A. baumannii at an 800-bed tertiary care hospital in southern Thailand between January 2010 and December 2011 were reviewed retrospectively. A. baumannii was identified at the genomospecies level. Carbapenemase genes were identified among carbapenem-resistant isolates associated with A. baumannii infection. A spatiotemporal analysis was performed by admission ward, time of infection and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) groups of A. baumannii.
Results
Nine PFGE groups were identified among the 197 A. baumannii infections. All A. baumannii isolates were assigned to International Clonal Lineage II. blaOXA-23 was the most prevalent carbapenemase gene. Outbreaks were observed mainly in respiratory and intensive care units. The association between PFGE group and hospital unit was significant. Spatiotemporal analysis identified 20 clusters of single PFGE group infections. Approximately half of the clusters involved multiple hospital units simultaneously.
Conclusions
A. baumannii transmitted both within and between hospital wards. Better understanding and control of the transmission of A. baumannii are needed."

Background
Close contact transmission (either direct or large droplet/droplet nuclei) is considered the main driver of influenza outbreaks but there is limited information regarding the role of fomites in transmission.
Aim
To investigate the surface stability of influenza strains and thereby the role of fomites in transmission.
Methods
The viability and quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (qt-RT–PCR) signal of five influenza strains (A/PR/8/34/H1N1, A/Cal/7/09/H1N1, A/Cal/4/09/H1N1, A/Sol/54/06/H1N1, and A/Bris/59/07/H1N1) seeded on to three surfaces (cotton, microfibre, and stainless steel) were assessed over time. Coupons of material were seeded with 10μL of a 106–108pfu/mL suspension of cell culture-derived virus stock supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin. Coupons were assayed by plaque assay and qt-RT–PCR at 1, 24h, and weekly for seven weeks using a vortex-mixing elution method.
Findings
Viable virus was detected from coupons for up to two weeks (stainless steel) and one week (cotton and microfibre), whereas detection of viruses by PCR was made for the entire seven-week study period. No strain differences were found. Ninety-nine percent reduction values (as a function of the seeding stock) were determined to be 17.7h for cotton (R2=0.86), 34.3h for microfibre (R2=0.80), and 174.9h for stainless steel (R2=0.98).
Conclusion
Viable influenza was recovered from surfaces for up to two weeks. By contrast, influenza could be detected by PCR for more than seven weeks. These results have important implications for determining infection control protocols, cleaning regimes and sampling methods in healthcare settings."

Background
Critical care patients are at increased risk of infection. Near-patient surfaces act as reservoirs of microbial soil, which may contain pathogens.
Aim
To correlate soil levels with hand-touch frequency of near-patient sites in an intensive care unit (ICU).
Methods
Five sites around each bed in a 10-bed ICU were screened for total microbial soil (cfu/cm2) and Staphylococcus aureus every month for 10 months. Selected sites were infusion pump and cardiac monitor, left and right bedrails, and bed table. Ten 1 h covert audits of hand-touch frequency of these sites were performed in order to provide an average hand-touch count, which was modelled against soil levels obtained from microbiological screening.
Findings
Seven of 10 staphylococci were found in conjunction with gross contamination of a specific site (P=0.005) and the same proportion from three most frequently touched sites (bedrails and bed table). There was a linear association between four sites demonstrating gross microbial contamination (>12 cfu/cm2) and mean number of hand-touch counts (P=0.08). The bed table was handled most but was not the most contaminated site. We suspected that customary placement of alcohol gel containers on bed tables may have reduced microbiological yield. Removing the gel container from one table confirmed its inhibitory effect on microbial contamination after rescreening (19% vs 50% >12 cfu/cm2: P=0.007).
Conclusion
Surface bioburden at near-patient sites in ICU is associated with hand-contact frequencies by staff and visitors. This supports the need for targeted hygienic cleaning in a high-risk healthcare environment."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In recent years, infections with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) have been increasing globally and present a major public health challenge.
Aim
To review the international literature: (i) to describe CPE outbreaks in acute hospital settings globally; and (ii) to identify the control measures used during these outbreaks and report on their effectiveness.
Methods
A systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, abstract lists for key conferences and reference lists of key reviews was undertaken, and information on unpublished outbreaks was sought for 2000–2015. Where relevant, risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale. A narrative synthesis of the evidence was conducted.
Findings
Ninety-eight outbreaks were eligible. These occurred worldwide, with 53 reports from Europe. The number of cases (CPE infection or colonization) involved in outbreaks varied widely, from two to 803. In the vast majority of outbreaks, multi-component infection control measures were used, commonly including: patient screening; contact precautions (e.g. gowns, gloves); handwashing interventions; staff education or monitoring; enhanced environmental cleaning/decontamination; cohorting of patients and/or staff; and patient isolation. Seven studies were identified as providing the best-available evidence on the effectiveness of control measures. These demonstrated that CPE outbreaks can be controlled successfully using a range of appropriate, commonly used, infection control measures. However, risk of bias was considered relatively high for these studies.
Conclusion
The findings indicate that CPE outbreaks can be controlled using combinations of existing measures. However, the quality of the evidence base is weak and further high-quality research is needed, particularly on the effectiveness of individual infection control measures."

keywords = "External ventricular drains, Meningitis, Neurosurgery, Definitions, Surveillance",
abstract = "Summary
Background
The insertion of external ventricular drains (EVDs) is necessary in some neurosurgical patients, but increases the risk of meningitis/ventriculitis. While there are well-recognized risk factors, the proportion of patients who develop meningitis/ventriculitis varies partly due to differences in definitions. A multi-disciplinary working group was established to agree definitions for EVD-associated meningitis/ventriculitis, and a surveillance system was piloted in four centres in the UK and Ireland.
Methods
Definitions were agreed based on those published previously and on clinical and microbiological criteria. An agreed dataset was developed to monitor patients after the insertion of an EVD and until the EVD was removed and the microbial aetiology was recorded.
Findings
Four neurosurgical centres participated, with 61–564 patients surveyed in each unit. The vast majority of drains were cranial. Intracranial haemorrhage was the most common indication for the EVD insertion. Between 6% and 35% of EVDs were inserted by consultants rather than junior doctors. The proportion of patients who developed meningitis/ventriculitis varied from 3% to 18% and from 4.8 to 12.7/1000 EVD-days. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common microbial causes.
Conclusions
Routine and ongoing monitoring of patients with an EVD in situ to detect meningitis/ventriculitis presents logistical difficulties, and few units do so. This pilot study suggests that a national system of surveillance with agreed definitions and a methodology to enable unit-to-unit comparisons of EVD meningitis/ventriculitis is both necessary and feasible. This will, in turn, inform quality improvement processes leading to the minimization of infection."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Manufacturers’ recommended dosages for alcohol-based hand rubs are typically determined by measuring product efficacy using a model protocol such as EN 1500; however, anecdotal reports and informal observation suggests that in many cases users self-titrate to much lower doses in real-world application.
Aim
To examine the interdependence of alcohol-based hand-rub volume on in-vivo efficacy using the EN 1500 standard test method, on drying time on users’ hands, and on their perceptions of acceptability.
Methods
Three formulations were studied using EN 1500 and a modification of this method. The modification used volumes ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 mL and 30 s application. Drying times were recorded and user acceptability was established using a three-point scale (too long, OK, or too short). Dying times were analysed in relation to hand surface area.
Findings
The drying time for all three products increased as a function of volume. The drying time displayed a positive association with volume and a negative association with hand surface area. The optimum volume for user acceptability was between 1.5 and 2 mL, yielding a drying time of between 20 and 30 s.
Conclusion
Whereas EN 1500 is appropriate for establishing the efficacy of a hygienic hand-rub formulation compared to a benchmark, it does not reflect actual in-use conditions or the likely clinical effectiveness of the product. In particular, it fails to address the need to optimize the volume of application and user acceptability of the product."

Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections. The ability of S. aureus to attach and subsequently accumulate on the surfaces of implanted medical devices and in host tissues makes infections caused by this pathogen difficult to treat. Current treatments have been shown to have limited effect on surface-associated S. aureus, and may be enhanced by the addition of a dispersal agent. This study assessed the enzymatic agents dispersin B, lysostaphin, alpha amylase, V8 protease and serrapeptase, alone and in combination with vancomycin and rifampicin, against biofilms formed by meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of S. aureus. The efficacy of both antibiotics was enhanced when combined with any of the dispersal agents. Lysostaphin and serrapeptase were the most effective dispersal agents against all strains tested. These data indicate that combinations of biofilm dispersal agents and antibiotics may extend the therapeutic options for the treatment of S. aureus biofilm-associated infections."

Background
As lipid in parenteral nutrition (PN) purportedly enhances microbial growth, recommendations limit infusion of lipid PN (or lipid emulsion) from a single container to 24h (48h for lipid-free PN). However, the associated evidence base is ambiguous.
Aim
To examine factors affecting microbial growth in PN.
Methods
A systematic review with meta-analyses examined effects of nutrients on microbial growth in PN infusates over a 48-h period using the growth ratio {GR=log10[colony-forming units (cfu)/mL at 48h/cfu/mL at time zero]}.
Findings
Factors influencing GR in PN included glucose, microbial species, temperature, osmolarity, presence of vitamins, trace elements and lipid, and amino acid profile. Using unmatched datasets (N=306), a general linear model found that lipid inclusion in PN represented 3.3% of the variability, which was less than that due to glucose concentration (5.8%), microbial species (35.3%) and microbe–infusate interaction (4.4%). Using matched datasets (N=38 pairs), lipid inclusion in PN represented 5.4% of the variability (P=0.076), which was less than that due to glucose concentration (8.5%; P=0.025), microbial species (75.5%; P<0.001) and microbe–infusate interaction (13.3%; P=0.382). Using meta-analyses of matched datasets, the presence of lipid in PN at fixed glucose concentrations did not significantly increase GR of Candida albicans, Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus epidermidis (P=0.352, P=0.025 and P=0.494, respectively; overall P=0.175).
Conclusion
Lipid inclusion in PN is only one of several factors that may influence microbial growth in PN. Any recommendations about the duration of PN infusion from a single container should account for all these factors, and should be weighted according to microbial species likely to contaminate PN."

Background
Healthcare-associated infections are a frequent threat to patient safety and cause significant disease burden. The most important single preventive measure is hand hygiene (HH). Barriers to adherence with HH recommendations include structural aspects, knowledge gaps, and organizational issues, especially a lack of time in daily routine.
Aim
To determine the number of hand hygiene opportunities (HHOs), compliance rates, and time spent on hand hygiene in intensive care units (ICUs).
Methods
We conducted an observational study in two ICUs to determine the average number of HHOs per patient. Documentation was based on the World Health Organization concept of ‘five moments for hand hygiene’. HHOs were collected in 12 patient rooms for 12h each.
Findings
On average, 134 (internal ICU) and 182 (surgical ICU) HHOs per patient were observed during the 12h observation period. Overall HH compliance was 42.6%. Considering additional HHOs during the night shift, we estimated 218 (internal ICU) and 271 (surgical ICU) HHOs per patient-day. The average duration of hand disinfection was 7.6s. The time spent on HH was 8.3 (internal ICU) and 11.1 (surgical ICU) min during the day shift for each patient for all healthcare workers (nurses: 6.9min in the internal ICU and 8.3min in the surgical ICU). If nurses fully complied with guidelines, 58.2 (internal ICU) and 69.8 (surgical ICU) min would be spent on HH for each patient during the day shift.
Conclusion
Complying with guidelines is time-consuming. Sufficient time for HH should be considered in staff planning."

Seasonal influenza vaccine uptake rate of healthcare workers (HCWs) varies widely from <5% to >90% worldwide. Perception of vaccine efficacy and side-effects are conventional factors affecting the uptake rates. These factors may operate on a personal and social level, impacting the attitudes and behaviours of HCWs. Vaccination rates were also under the influence of the occurrence of other non-seasonal influenza pandemics such as avian influenza. Different strategies have been implemented to improve vaccine uptake, with important ones including the enforcement of the local authority’s recommendations, promulgation of practice guidelines, and mandatory vaccination polices. Practised in some regions in North America, mandatory policies have led to higher vaccination rate, but are not problem-free. The effects of conventional educational programmes and campaigns are in general of modest impact only. Availability of convenient vaccination facilities, such as mobile vaccination cart, and role models of senior HCWs receiving vaccination are among some strategies which have been observed to improve vaccination uptake rate. A multi-faceted approach is thus necessary to persuade HCWs to participate in a vaccination programme, especially in areas with low uptake rate."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The increasing prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the healthcare setting and in the community despite established infection control guidelines indicates that these microorganisms may possess survival strategies that allow them to persist in the environment.
Aims
To determine the extent and variation in endemic ESBL-carrying species in different ward environments, and to investigate the potential for cephalosporin resistance to be transferred from environmental isolates to human pathogens.
Methods
Conventional microbiological methods were used to sample 1436 environmental surfaces for ESBL-producing bacteria. Transconjugation assays (broth mating experiments) were performed using environmental ESBL-producing isolates as donors and streptomycin-resistant Escherichia coli (NCTC 50237) as the recipient.
Findings
The prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria on surfaces in a non-outbreak setting was low (45/1436; 3.1%). The sites most likely to be contaminated were the drains of handwash basins (28/105; 26.7%) and floors (14/160; 8.8%). Fifty-nine ESBL-carrying organisms were isolated. Of these, Klebsiella spp. (33.9%), Enterobacter spp. (20.3%), Pantoea spp. (15.3%) and Citrobacter spp. (13.6%) were the most common isolates. ESBL determinants were transferred successfully from three representative environmental isolates (Pantoea calida, Klebsiella oxytoca, Raoultella ornithinolytica) to the human pathogen E. coli.
Conclusion
ESBL-producing Gram-negative isolates were recovered from the hospital environment in the absence of any ESBL infection on the wards. The drains of handwash basins should be considered potential long-term reservoirs of multi-drug-resistant bacteria and drug resistance genes. These genes can reside in various genera of hardy environmental organisms and be a potential source of ESBL for more common human pathogens."

Background
Nosocomial infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii international clone II (IC II) can cause severe clinical outcomes.
Aim
Differential evaluation of bactericidal efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and benzethonium chloride (BZT) disinfectants against IC II and non-IC II isolates.
Methods
Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CHX and BZT were determined for 137 A. baumannii IC II, 99 non-IC II and 69 non-baumannii isolates, further classified according to MIC values into disinfectant-reduced susceptible (DRS) and disinfectant-susceptible (DS) groups. Time-kill curves and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were evaluated for representative isolates in each group.
Results
CHX and BZT MIC90s for IC II isolates were 100 and 175mg/L, respectively, but those for non-IC II and non-baumannii isolates were <100mg/L. Nevertheless, time-kill curves indicated that CHX and BZT reduced live bacterial cell number by 5 log10 for IC II and non-IC II isolates within 30s when used at 1000mg/L, comparable to practical use concentrations. CHX MBC at 30s was 1000mg/L for IC II and non-IC II isolates, and was not influenced by addition of 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA); BZT MBC at 30s was 100mg/L without BSA and increased up to 500mg/L upon addition of BSA. No significant differences in BSA were found between DRS and DS isolates.
Conclusion
CHX and BZT were effective against Acinetobacter spp. including IC II at a concentration of 1000mg/L and exposure for at least 30s, but their concentrations should be considered carefully to ensure sufficient effects in both clinical and healthcare settings."

Background
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating gastrointestinal disease with high morbidity and mortality that predominantly affects preterm neonates during outbreaks. In a previous study, the present authors identified 15 Clostridium butyricum isolates from stool samples during a series of NEC cases involving four neonatal intensive care units. A clonal lineage of these strains was observed by in-silico multi-locus sequence typing.
Aim
To confirm the previous findings by sequencing a larger number of C. butyricum genomes and using other genotyping approaches.
Methods
The previously isolated 15 C. butyricum strains were characterized and compared with 17 other commensal and environmental C. butyricum strains using whole-genome sequencing (WGS). In addition, the clustering was analysed using multi-spacer sequence typing (MST).
Findings
The core genome of C. butyricum was composed of 1251 genes, and its pan-genome consisted of 12,628 genes with high variability between strains. It was possible to distinguish the clonal lineage of strains from a series of NEC cases, forming three clades with geographical clustering. The results obtained using WGS and MST approaches were congruent.
Conclusion
MST is a fast, cheap and effective genotyping method for investigating NEC outbreaks associated with C. butyricum."

Background
The incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) have increased in recent years. Predictive models may help to identify at-risk patients before the onset of infection. Early identification of high-risk patients could help antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes and other initiatives to better prevent C. difficile in these patients.
Aim
To develop a predictive model that identifies patients at high risk for CDI at the time of hospitalization. This approach to early identification was evaluated to determine if it could improve upon a pre-existing AMS programme.
Methods
Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to develop an analytic model to predict risk for CDI at the time of hospitalization in a retrospective cohort of inpatients. The model was validated in a prospective cohort. Concurrence between the model's risk predictions and a pre-existing AMS programme was assessed.
Findings
The model identified 55% of patients who later tested positive as being at high risk for CDI at the time of admission. One in every 32 high-risk patients with potentially modifiable antimicrobial risk factors tested positive for CDI. Half (53%) tested positive before meeting the risk criteria for the hospital's AMS programme.
Conclusion
Analytic models can identify most patients prospectively at the time of admission who later test positive for C. difficile. This approach to early identification may help AMS programmes to pursue susceptibility testing and modifications to antimicrobial therapies at an earlier stage in order to better prevent CDI."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Economic analysis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) should consider the incentives facing institutional decision-makers. To avoid overstating the financial benefits of infection prevention, fixed and variable costs should be distinguished.
Aim
To quantify CDI fixed and variable costs in a tertiary referral hospital during August 2015.
Methods
A micro-costing analysis estimated CDI costs per patient, including the additional costs of a CDI outbreak. Resource use was quantified after review of patient charts, pharmacy data, administrative resource input, and records of salary and cleaning/decontamination expenditure.
Findings
The incremental cost of CDI was €75,680 (mean: €5,820 per patient) with key cost drivers being cleaning, pharmaceuticals, and length of stay (LOS). Additional LOS ranged from 1.75 to 22.55 days. For seven patients involved in a CDI outbreak, excluding the value of the 58 lost bed-days (€34,585); costs were 30% higher (€7,589 per patient). Therefore, total spending on CDI was €88,062 (mean: €6,773 across all patients). Potential savings from variable costs were €1,026 (17%) or €1,768 (26%) if outbreak costs were included. Investment in an antimicrobial pharmacist would require 47 CDI cases to be prevented annually. Prevention of 5%, 10% and 20% CDI would reduce attributable costs by €4,403, €8,806 and €17,612. Increasing the incremental LOS attributable to CDI to seven days per patient would have increased costs to €7,478 or €8,431 (if outbreak costs were included).
Conclusion
As much CDI costs are fixed, potential savings from infection prevention are limited. Future analysis must consider more effectively this distinction and its impact on institutional decision-making."

Objectives
To examine whether carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) carriage is associated with incidence of clinical infection as a means of assessing whether the morbidity and mortality associated with these bacteria are mediated by underlying conditions or intrinsic properties of CRE.
Methods
This retrospective matched cohort study compared the incidence of invasive infections in CRE-colonized patients and matched non-carriers in the intensive care unit (ICU). The primary outcome was infection caused by CRE of the same species as the colonizing strain among CRE carriers, and infections caused by carbapenem-sensitive strains of the same organism in non-carriers. Hospital discharge and death were considered as competing events. Competing-risks hazard analysis was performed for the entire cohort and for a nested cohort matched by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, stratified by matching.
Results
In total, 146 CRE carriers were compared with 292 non-carriers. Patients were well matched for most risk factors for Enterobacteriaceae infection, including age, renal failure, previous invasive infection, previous hospitalization, APACHE II score, length of mechanical ventilation, length of hospitalization and CRE carriage. On regression analysis, colonization with CRE was independently associated with Enterobacteriaceae infection {cause-specific hazard ratio (CSHR) 2.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03–4.09]}. On regression analysis of the APACHE-II-matched cohort (N=284), colonization with CRE remained significantly associated with Enterobacteriaceae infection [CSHR 3.32 (95% CI 1.31–8.43)].
Conclusions
Colonization with CRE was associated with at least a two-fold increased risk of infection by the colonizing strain amongst ICU patients."

Background
Operating theatres and surgical clothing are designed to protect the patient from surgical site infections. However, there is still a risk of infection of the surgical team with blood-borne pathogens via ocular or mucocutaneous exposure. Whereas conventional surgical clothing provides some protection against contamination, surgical helmet systems (SHS) are intended to provide a high level of protection by forming a barrier for particles, aerosols and fluids between surgeon and surgical field of work.
Aim
The aim of this study was to quantify the contamination of the surgeon by droplets during orthopaedic procedures by an in-vitro simulation of hip and knee arthroplasty while wearing SHS versus conventional surgical clothing.
Methods
Hip and knee arthroplasty procedures were performed on artificial foam bone, which was continuously kept wet with a marker fluid. Each of the procedures was carried out by ten subjects wearing conventional surgical clothing or wearing SHS with integrated toga. After the simulated operation, pictures of the subjects were taken under ultraviolet illumination. Images wearing the full gown, and after removal of the gown, were evaluated for stained areas.
Findings
The contamination risk was 30% while wearing conventional clothing. In none of the 20 subjects using the SHS stains could staining be detected after removal of the protective clothing.
Conclusion
This study has demonstrated that the protective properties of the SHS are superior to conventional surgical clothing. Using SHS in high-risk procedures could reduce occupational exposure to blood-borne infections in surgeons."

Background
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections in the intensive care unit (ICU).
Aim
To investigate an unexplained increase in the incidence of P. aeruginosa recovered from clinical samples in the ICU over a two-year period.
Methods
After unsuccessful epidemiological investigation by conventional tools, P. aeruginosa clinical isolates of all patients hospitalized between January 2010 and July 2012 were typed by a novel double-locus sequence typing (DLST) method and compared to environmental isolates recovered during the investigation period.
Findings
In total, 509 clinical isolates from 218 patients and 91 environmental isolates were typed. Thirty-five different genotypic clusters were found in 154 out of 218 patients (71%). The largest cluster, DLST 1-18, included 23 patients who were mostly hospitalized during overlapping periods in the burn unit. Genotype DLST 1-18 was also recovered from floor traps, shower trolleys and the shower mattress in the hydrotherapy rooms, suggesting environmental contamination of the burn unit as the source of the outbreak. After implementation of appropriate infection control measures, this genotype was recovered only once in a clinical sample from a burned patient and twice in the environment, but never thereafter during a 12-month follow-up period.
Conclusion
The use of a novel DLST method allowed the genotyping of a large number of clinical and environmental isolates, leading to the identification of the environmental source of a large unrecognized outbreak in the burn unit. Eradication of the outbreak was confirmed after implementation of a continuous epidemiological surveillance of P. aeruginosa clones in the ICU."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is widespread and may result in antibiotic side-effects, excess costs to the healthcare system, and may potentially trigger antimicrobial resistance. According to international management guidelines, ASB is not an indication for antibiotic treatment (with few exceptions).
Aim
To determine reasons for using antibiotics to treat ASB in the absence of a treatment indication.
Methods
A qualitative study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland during 2011. We interviewed 21 internal medicine residents and attending physicians selected by purposive sampling, using a semi-structured questionnaire. Responses were analysed in an inductive thematic content approach using dedicated software (MAXQDA®).
Findings
In the 21 interviews, the following thematic rationales for antibiotic overtreatment of ASB were reported (in order of reporting frequency): (i) treating laboratory findings without taking the clinical picture into account (N = 17); (ii) psychological factors such as anxiety, overcautiousness, or anticipated positive impact on patient outcomes (N = 13); (iii) external pressors such as institutional culture, peer pressure, patient expectation, and excessive workload that interferes with proper decision-making (N = 9); (iv) difficulty with interpreting clinical signs and symptoms (N = 8).
Conclusion
In this qualitative study we identified both physician-centred factors (e.g. overcautiousness) and external pressors (e.g. excessive workload) as motivators for prescribing unnecessary antibiotics. Also, we interpreted the frequently cited practice of treating asymptomatic patients based on laboratory findings alone as lack of awareness of evidence-based best practices."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Pseudomonas aeruginosa may colonize water systems via biofilm formation. In hospital environments, contaminated sinks have been associated with nosocomial transmission. Here we describe a prolonged outbreak of a metallo-β-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa (Pae-MBL) associated with sink drains, and propose a previously unreported decontamination method with acetic acid.
Aim
To describe a nosocomial outbreak of Pae-MBL associated with hospital sink drains and to evaluate acetic acid as a decontamination method.
Methods
The outbreak was investigated by searching the microbiology database, microbiological sampling and strain typing. Antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of acetic acid were evaluated in vitro. Pae-MBL-positive sinks were treated with 24% acetic acid once weekly and monitored with repeated cultures.
Findings
Fourteen patients with positive cultures for Pae-MBL were identified from 2008 to 2014. The patients had been admitted to three wards, where screening discovered Pae-MBL in 12 sink drains located in the patient bathrooms. Typing of clinical and sink drain isolates revealed identical or closely related strains. Pae-MBL biofilm was highly sensitive to acetic acid with a minimum biofilm eradication concentration of 0.75% (range: 0.19–1.5). Weekly treatment of colonized sink drains with acetic acid resulted in negative cultures and terminated transmission.
Conclusion
Acetic acid is highly effective against Pae-MBL biofilms, and may be used as a simple method to decontaminate sink drains and to prevent nosocomial transmission."

Objective
To identify patient-related risk factors for surgical site infection (SSI) following eight types of gastrointestinal surgery that could be collected as part of infection surveillance efforts.
Design
Record linkage from existing datasets comprising the Japan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (JANIS) and Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) programmes.
Methods
Patient data from 35 hospitals were retrieved using JANIS and DPC from 2007 to 2011. Patient-related factors and the incidence of SSI were recorded and analysed. Risk factors associated with SSI were examined using multi-level mixed-effects logistic regression models.
Results
In total, 2074 appendectomies; 2084 bile duct, liver or pancreatic procedures; 3460 cholecystectomies; 7273 colonic procedures; 482 oesophageal procedures; 4748 gastric procedures; 2762 rectal procedures and 1202 small bowel procedures were analysed. Using multi-variate analyses, intra-operative blood transfusion was found to be a risk factor for SSI following all types of gastrointestinal surgery, except appendectomy and small bowel surgery. In addition, diabetes was found to be a risk factor for SSI following colon surgery [odds ratio (OR) 1.23, P=0.028] and gastric surgery (OR 1.70, P<0.001). Use of steroids was significantly associated with a higher incidence of SSI following cholecystectomy (OR 2.83, P=0.003) and colon surgery (OR 1.27, P=0.040).
Conclusions
Intra-operative blood transfusion, diabetes and use of steroids are risk factors for SSI following gastrointestinal surgery, and should be included as part of SSI surveillance for these procedures."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Healthcare-associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (HA-SAB) results in morbidity, mortality, and increased healthcare costs, and these infections are frequently regarded as preventable.
Aim
To implement a multi-modal prevention programme for improved processes regarding peripheral intravenous cannula (PIVC) insertion and maintenance, in order to reduce PIVC-associated HA-SAB events in a large Australian health service.
Methods
Baseline clinical practice was evaluated for a 12-month pre-intervention period. Measures to reduce HA-SAB risk were introduced between January and September 2013: staff education, improved documentation (including phlebitis scoring), and availability of standardized equipment. Post-intervention auditing was performed during the 27 months following intervention. Baseline and post-intervention HA-SAB and PIVC-associated infection rates were compared. Interrupted time-series and Bayesian change-point analyses were applied to determine the impact of interventions and timing of change.
Findings
Significantly improved documentation regarding PIVC insertion and management was observed in the post-intervention period, with fewer PIVCs left in situ for ≥4 days (2.6 vs 6.9%, P<0.05). During the baseline period a total of 68 HA-SAB events occurred [1.01/10,000 occupied bed-days (OBDs)] and 24 were PIVC-associated (35% of total, rate 0.39 per 10,000 OBDs). In the post-intervention period, a total of 83 HA-SAB events occurred (0.99 per 10,000 OBDs) and 12 were PIVC-associated (14.4% of total, rate 0.14 per 10,000 OBDs). PIVC-associated SAB rates were 63% lower in the post-intervention period compared to baseline (P=0.018) with a change point observed following full bundle implementation in October 2013.
Conclusion
A successful multi-modal hospital-wide campaign was introduced to reduce PIVC-associated SAB rates. Evaluation of cost-effectiveness and sustainability is required."

abstract = "Summary
Recognized issues with poor hand hygiene compliance among healthcare workers and reports of recontamination of previously chemically disinfected surfaces through hand contact emphasize the need for novel hygiene methods in addition to those currently available. One such approach involves antimicrobial (nano) coatings (AMCs), whereby integrated active ingredients are responsible for elimination of micro-organisms that come into contact with treated surfaces. While widely studied under laboratory conditions with promising results, studies under real-life healthcare conditions are scarce. The views of 75 contributors from 30 European countries were collated regarding specialized cleaning associated with AMCs for reduction of healthcare-associated infection. There was unanimous agreement that generation of scientific guidelines for cleaning of AMCs, using traditional or new processes, is needed. Specific topics included: understanding mechanisms of action of cleaning materials and their physical interactions with conventional coatings and AMCs; that assessments mimic the life cycle of coatings to determine the impact of repetitive cleaning and other aspects of ageing (e.g. exposure to sunlight); determining concentrations of AMC-derived biocides in effluents; and development of effective de-activation and sterilization treatments for cleaning effluents. Further, the consensus opinion was that, prior to widespread implementation of AMCs, there is a need for clarification of the varying responsibilities of involved clinical, healthcare management, cleaning services and environmental safety stakeholders."

abstract = "Summary
Nosocomial pathogens may be acquired by patients via their own unclean hands, but there has been relatively little emphasis on patient hand hygiene as a tool for preventing healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs). The aim of this systematic review was to determine the efficacy of patient hand hygiene interventions in reducing HCAIs and improving patient hand hygiene rates compared to usual care. Electronic databases and grey literature were searched to August 2014. Experimental and quasi-experimental studies were included if they evaluated a patient hand hygiene intervention conducted in an acute or chronic healthcare facility and included HCAI incidence and/or patient hand hygiene rates as an outcome. All steps were performed independently by two investigators. Ten studies were included, most of which were uncontrolled before–after studies (N=8). The majority of interventions (N=7) were multi-modal, with components similar to healthcare worker hand hygiene programmes, including education, reminders, audit and feedback, and provision of hand hygiene products. Six studies reported HCAI outcomes and four studies assessed patient hand hygiene rates; all demonstrated improvements but were at moderate to high risk of bias. In conclusion, interventions to improve patient hand hygiene may reduce the incidence of HCAIs and improve hand hygiene rates, but the quality of evidence is low. Future studies should use stronger designs and be more selective in their choice of outcomes."

keywords = "Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Hospital screening, Isolation demand, Isolation capacity, Detection rates",
abstract = "Summary
Objective
To estimate the isolation demands arising from high-risk specialty-based screening for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), and the potential fraction of CPE burden detected.
Methods
Clinical specialty groups from three London hospitals were ranked by incidence of carbapenem resistance among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. Contact precaution bed-days were estimated for three screening strategies: Strategy 1, ‘circulation science and renal medicine’; Strategy 2, Strategy 1 plus ‘specialist services’; and Strategy 3, Strategy 2 plus ‘private patients’. Isolation bed occupancy rates and potential CPE detection rates were estimated.
Results
Of 99,105 admissions to the three hospitals in Financial Year 2014/15, Strategies 1, 2 and 3 would have screened 4371 (4.4%), 7482 (7.6%), and 13,542 (13.7%) patients, respectively. The specialties' isolation bed occupancy rates varied between 3% and 696% depending on strategy, number of consecutive tests, and whether or not pre-emptive isolation had been applied. Expected detection rates of the potential CPE burden in the hospital network would have varied between 17.1% and 47.5%.
Conclusions
High-risk specialty-based screening has the potential to detect nearly half of the potential CPE burden, and would be more pragmatic than patient-level risk-factor-based screening. Pre-emptive isolation increases isolation requirements substantially. CPE screening strategies need to balance risk and resources."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In 2010, an infection prevention and control team in an acute hospital trust integrated an audit and monitoring tool (AMT) into the management regime for patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).
Aim
To examine the mechanisms through which the implementation of an AMT influenced the care and management of patients with CDI.
Methods
A constructivist grounded theory approach was used, employing semi-structured interviews with ward staff (N=8), infection prevention and control practitioners (IPCPs) (N=7) and matrons (N=8), and subsequently a theoretical sample of senior managers (N=4). All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a constant comparison approach until explanatory categories emerged.
Findings
The AMT evolved into a daily review process (DRP) that became an essential aspect of the management of all patients with CDI. Participants recognized that the DRP had positively influenced the care received by patients with CDI. Two main explanatory themes emerged to offer a framework for understanding the influence of the DRP on care management: education and learning, and the development and maintenance of relationships.
Conclusion
The use of auditing and monitoring tools as part of a daily review process may enable ward staff, matrons, and IPCPs to improve patient outcomes and achieve the required levels of environmental hygiene if they act as a focal point for interaction, education, and collaboration. The findings offer insights into the behavioural changes and improved patient outcomes that ensue from the implementation of a DRP."

Although misinformation has always existed, the scope and speed at which fake news can reach even the most remote corners of the globe is a modern phenomenon. In the field of infection prevention and control (IPC), we like to believe that our dedication to the field and the process of conducting science protects us from the ravages of ‘bad buzz’ and fake news. This misconception leads medical professionals to underestimate the negative effects of misinformation on public health. This paper focuses on the nexus of what is happening between the field of IPC and the public. Its aim is to examine how information gets distorted and amplified between the medical community and the public, and outline some of the issues that deserve further attention. It looks at a number of case studies which show that even one badly conducted study can have a severe negative impact on public health, and that a well-conducted study can be distorted to make people believe something fallacious. In the current system of publishing and the proliferation of online journals that publish without peer review, ‘bad buzz’ and fake news can quickly do a good deal of damage."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Outbreaks of infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) pose a major threat, especially to extremely preterm infants. This study describes a 35-day outbreak of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) in a tertiary-level NICU in Germany.
Aim
To underline the importance of surveillance policies in the particularly vulnerable cohort of preterm infants and to describe the efficacy of outbreak control strategies.
Methods
Data were collected retrospectively from medical reports. Infants and environment were tested for E. coli.
Findings
The outbreak affected a total of 13 infants between 25+1 and 35+0 weeks of gestation with seven infants showing signs of infection. The outbreak strain was identified as E. coli sequence type 131. Environmental screening provided no evidence for an environmental source. Through colonization surveillance and immediate and adequate treatment of potentially infected preterm infants, no fatalities occurred. Outbreak control was achieved by strict contact precautions, enhanced screening and temporary relocation of the NICU. Relocation and reconstruction improved the NICU's structural layout, focusing on isolation capacities. Follow-up indicated carriage for several months in some infants.
Conclusion
Routine surveillance allowed early detection of the outbreak. The identification of carriers of the outbreak strain was successfully used to direct antibiotic treatment in case of infection. Enhanced hygienic measures and ward relocation were instrumental in controlling the outbreak."

Background
There is growing interest in the use of no-touch automated room decontamination devices within healthcare settings. Xenex PX-UV is an automated room disinfection device using pulsed ultraviolet (UV) C radiation with a short cycle time.
Aim
To investigate the microbiological efficacy of this device when deployed for terminal decontamination of isolation rooms within a clinical haematology unit.
Methods
The device was deployed in isolation rooms in a clinical haematology unit. Contact plates were applied to common touch points to determine aerobic total colony counts (TCCs) and samples collected using Polywipe™ sponges for detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).
Findings
The device was easy to transport, easy to use, and it disinfected rooms rapidly. There was a 76% reduction in the TCCs following manual cleaning, with an additional 14% reduction following UV disinfection, resulting in an overall reduction of 90% in TCCs. There was a 38% reduction in the number of sites where VRE was detected, from 26 of 80 sites following manual cleaning to 16 of 80 sites with additional UV disinfection.
Conclusions
The Xenex PX-UV device can offer a simple and rapid additional decontamination step for terminal disinfection of patient rooms. However, the microbiological efficacy against VRE was somewhat limited."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Surgical site infection surveillance (SSI) is important for the improvement of care and patient safety. Most SSI surveillance systems focus on hospital settings, whereas numerous infectious events occur after discharge.
Aim
To evaluate the patient care trajectory after discharge, we linked the hospital discharge database and the National Health Insurance Cross-Schemes Information System (NHI-CIS) to trace hip or knee arthroplasty infection (HKAI).
Methods
A retrospective analysis was performed using the permanent 1/97th sample of the whole NHI-CIS database. A total of 1739 patients underwent hip or knee arthroplasty between January 1st, 2011 and December 31st, 2011. Patients rehospitalized for HKAI were detected using a specific published algorithm. Non-rehospitalized HKAI patients were identified using a novel tracking algorithm based on ambulatory care consumption: nurse intervention, antibiotics and bandage purchase.
Findings
Of the 1739 studied patients, 20 patients (1.1%) were rehospitalized for HKAI. Fourteen (70%) of the HKAI events occurred within the first two months after surgery, two occurring during the patients' surgical hospital stay. Using ambulatory care data, 10 additional cases were suspected of developing HKAI in the year following their surgery. HKAI incidence rate was then estimated to be 1.76% (95% confidence interval: 1.14–2.38%).
Conclusion
Although the study sample was limited, we demonstrated that each HKAI occurring after discharge could not be traced by the in-hospital information system alone. This result emphasizes the need for having a passive routine tool for post-discharge surveillance such as the NHI-CIS database."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are an economic burden, and infection control (IC) measures are cost- and labour-intensive. A two-tier IC management strategy was developed, including active screening, in order to achieve effective use of limited resources. Briefly, high-risk patients were differentiated from other patients, distinguished according to type of MDRO, and IC measures were implemented accordingly.
Aim
To evaluate costs and benefits of this IC management strategy.
Methods
The study period comprised 2.5 years. All high-risk patients underwent microbiological screening. Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR). Expenses consisted of costs for staff, materials, laboratory, increased workload and occupational costs.
Findings
In total, 39,551 patients were screened, accounting for 24.5% of all admissions. Of all screened patients, 7.8% (N=3,104) were MDRO positive; these patients were mainly colonized with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (37.3%), followed by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (30.3%) and MDR-GNB (28.3%). The median length of stay (LOS) for all patients was 10 days (interquartile range 3–20); LOS was twice as long in colonized patients (P<0.001). Screening costs totalled 255,093.82€, IC measures cost 97,701.36€, and opportunity costs were 599,225.52€. The savings of this IC management strategy totalled 500,941.84€. Possible transmissions by undetected carriers would have caused additional costs of 613,648.90–4,974,939.26€ (i.e. approximately 600,000–5 million €).
Conclusion
Although the costs of a two-tier IC management strategy including active microbiological screening are not trivial, these data indicate that the approach is cost-effective when prevented transmissions are included in the cost estimate."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is the infusion of donor faeces into the gut with the aim of improving microbial diversity. The procedure has gained significant interest recently in the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The literature is currently dominated by small case series and isolated case reports. There is no standardization of methods and recording of outcomes.
Aim
To present the adverse events that have been associated with the use of FMT, as reported in the English literature to date.
Methods
A database search of Medline and Embase identified publications where FMT has been administered. Review articles were excluded. In total, 109 publications were identified that described the use of FMT in 1555 individuals.
Findings
Other than three small randomized controlled studies, the data consisted of small series and case reports. CDI was the most common indication for FMT (N = 1190), with the majority of the remaining cases receiving FMT for inflammatory bowel disease. FMT had also been applied for irritable bowel syndrome, metabolic syndrome and constipation in small numbers. Adverse events appear to be uncommon, often mild and self-limiting; however, serious adverse events including bacteraemia, perforations and death have been reported.
Conclusion
The vast majority of adverse events of FMT appear to be mild, self-limiting and gastrointestinal in nature. In some cases, a credible association was not established due to the lack of controlled data. There is a need for standardized, randomized controlled trials to qualify and quantify the risks associated with FMT."

Background
Quantitative information on the effectiveness of safety-engineered devices (SEDs) is needed to support decisions regarding their implementation.
Aim
To elucidate the effects of SED use in winged steel needles, intravenous (IV) catheter stylets and suture needles on needlestick injury (NSI) incidence rates in Japan.
Methods
Japan EPINet survey data and device utilization data for conventional devices and SEDs were collected from 26 participating hospitals between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2014. The NSI incidence rate for every 100,000 devices was calculated according to hospital, year and SED use for winged steel needles, IV catheter stylets and suture needles. Weighted means and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to calculate overall NSI incidence rates.
Findings
In total, there were 236 NSIs for winged steel needles, 152 NSIs for IV catheter stylets and 180 NSIs for suture needles. The weighted NSI incidence rates per 100,000 devices for SEDs and non-SEDs were as follows: winged steel needles, 2.10 (95% CI 1.66–2.54) and 14.95 (95% CI 2.46–27.43), respectively; IV catheter stylets, 0.95 (95% CI 0.60–1.29) and 6.39 (95% CI 3.56–9.23), respectively; and suture needles, 1.47 (95% CI −1.14–4.09) and 16.50 (95% CI 4.15–28.86), respectively. All devices showed a significant reduction in the NSI incidence rate with SED use (P < 0.001 for winged steel needles, P = 0.035 for IV catheter stylets and P = 0.044 for suture needles).
Conclusion
SED use substantially reduces the incidence of NSIs, and is therefore recommended as a means to prevent occupational infections in healthcare workers and improve healthcare safety."

Hand hygiene is a key measure to prevent healthcare-associated infection. To promote hand hygiene nationally the German campaign ‘Aktion Saubere Hände’ was launched in January 2008, based on the World Health Organization's ‘Clean Care is Safer Care’ initiative. We report the first results from a full year of data collection on hand hygiene compliance recorded with the help of a renewed observation tool. Data were based on submissions from 109 participating hospitals collected from 576 wards between January 1st and December 31st, 2014. The overall median compliance was 73%, ranging from 55% (10th percentile) to 89% (90th percentile). The results demonstrated only small differences between adult and non-adult intensive care units (ICUs) with neonatal ICUs and paediatric non-ICUs maintaining higher compliance than adult care units. Performance among nurses was better than physicians, and overall rates of hand hygiene performance were significantly higher after patient contact than before."

abstract = "Summary
Viruses with pandemic potential including H1N1, H5N1, and H5N7 influenza viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)/Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoV) have emerged in recent years. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza virus can survive on surfaces for extended periods, sometimes up to months. Factors influencing the survival of these viruses on surfaces include: strain variation, titre, surface type, suspending medium, mode of deposition, temperature and relative humidity, and the method used to determine the viability of the virus. Environmental sampling has identified contamination in field-settings with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, although the frequent use of molecular detection methods may not necessarily represent the presence of viable virus. The importance of indirect contact transmission (involving contamination of inanimate surfaces) is uncertain compared with other transmission routes, principally direct contact transmission (independent of surface contamination), droplet, and airborne routes. However, influenza virus and SARS-CoV may be shed into the environment and be transferred from environmental surfaces to hands of patients and healthcare providers. Emerging data suggest that MERS-CoV also shares these properties. Once contaminated from the environment, hands can then initiate self-inoculation of mucous membranes of the nose, eyes or mouth. Mathematical and animal models, and intervention studies suggest that contact transmission is the most important route in some scenarios. Infection prevention and control implications include the need for hand hygiene and personal protective equipment to minimize self-contamination and to protect against inoculation of mucosal surfaces and the respiratory tract, and enhanced surface cleaning and disinfection in healthcare settings."

Background
Healthcare-associated infections are costly and are increasingly viewed as an indicator of the quality of care. Although strategies to reduce infections have become widespread, few studies have formally investigated the role of undernutrition on the development of infection-related complications in children after surgery.
Aim
To perform a systematic review of the literature to determine if undernutrition is prognostic of postoperative infection complications in children.
Methods
Electronic bibliographic and research databases were searched from 1950 to 2014. Inclusion criteria were studies in children (age <18 years) evaluating pre-operative nutritional status and reporting postoperative infection complications. Quality assessment was performed independently by two reviewers, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. The quality of the evidence was judged to be low in the majority of studies.
Findings
Ten cohort and two case–control studies met the inclusion criteria. Five studies reported an outcome combining infection-related complications, with the remainder reporting individual infection complications. Six studies reported surgical site infection (SSI) alone or in combination with other infection complications. Direct comparison between studies was difficult due to clinical and diagnostic heterogeneity. Unadjusted analyses (for patient or clinical variables) were suggestive of a relationship between undernutrition and infection complications. In studies controlling for other variables, the analyses did not remain significant for SSI.
Conclusion
There was low-quality evidence that undernutrition may be predictive of postoperative infection complications in children, with the exception of SSI. However, inconsistencies in nutritional and outcome assessments made it difficult to draw conclusions. Larger, high-quality studies are warranted to further investigate a potential prognostic relationship."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Two meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones, sequence type (ST) 22 and ST239, have successfully spread globally. Across Australia, ST22 has supplanted ST239 as the main healthcare-associated MRSA. To understand the reasons underlying this shift, the epidemiology and clinical features of infections due to ST22 and ST239 MRSA isolates from a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Australia were compared.
Methods
Over six months, consecutive MRSA isolates with clinical data were collected from specimens referred to Alfred Health Pathology (AHP). Isolates were genotyped by a multi-locus-sequence-typing-based high-resolution melting method.
Findings
Three hundred and twenty-eight of 1079 (30%) S. aureus isolated by AHP were MRSA. Of these, 313 were genotyped; 78 (25%) were clonal complex (CC) 22 (representing ST22) and 142 (45%) were CC239 (representing ST239). Common clinical syndromes included skin or soft tissue, respiratory tract and osteo-articular infections. On multi-variate logistic regression, compared with CC239, CC22 was associated with older patients [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.04 for each year increase, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02–1.07)], and patients from subacute hospitals (aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2–5.8) or long-term care facilities (LTCFs; aOR 5.5, 95% CI 2.0–14.5). Median time from patient admission to MRSA isolation was nine days for CC239 and one day for CC22 (P < 0.01). MRSA strain epidemiology varied according to hospital unit.
Conclusions
CC22 and CC239 MRSA have differing ecological niches. CC22 is associated with elderly patients in LTCFs, and CC239 is associated with nosocomial acquisition. Infection control strategies involving LTCFs and their residents will likely be required to achieve continued MRSA control."

Investigations into the suspected airborne transmission of pathogens in healthcare environments have posed a challenge to researchers for more than a century. With each pathogen demonstrating a unique response to environmental conditions and the mechanical stresses it experiences, the choice of sampling device is not obvious. Our aim was to review bioaerosol sampling, sampling equipment, and methodology. A comprehensive literature search was performed, using electronic databases to retrieve English language papers on bioaerosol sampling. The review describes the mechanisms of popular bioaerosol sampling devices such as impingers, cyclones, impactors, and filters, explaining both their strengths and weaknesses, and the consequences for microbial bioefficiency. Numerous successful studies are described that point to best practice in bioaerosol sampling, from the use of small personal samplers to monitor workers' pathogen exposure through to large static samplers collecting airborne microbes in various healthcare settings. Of primary importance is the requirement that studies should commence by determining the bioefficiency of the chosen sampler and the pathogen under investigation within laboratory conditions. From such foundations, sampling for bioaerosol material in the complexity of the field holds greater certainty of successful capture of low-concentration airborne pathogens. From the laboratory to use in the field, this review enables the investigator to make informed decisions about the choice of bioaerosol sampler and its application."

abstract = "Summary
Background
A vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) (vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration: 4mg/L) outbreak occurred in an advanced emergency medical service centre [hereafter referred to as the intensive care unit (ICU)] between 2013 and 2014.
Aim
Our objective was to evaluate the infection control measures that were successful.
Methods
Seventeen VISA strains were isolated from the sputum of 15 inpatients and the skin of two inpatients. Fourteen VISA strains were recognized as colonization. However, three VISA strains were isolated from the sputum of three inpatients with pneumonia. Environmental cultures were performed and VISA strains were detected in five of 65 sites. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was performed on 21 VISA strains.
Findings
Molecular typing including PFGE and MLST showed that the patterns of 19 VISA strains were identical and those of the other two VISA strains were possibly related. This meant that a horizontal transmission of VISA strains had occurred in the ICU. In August 2013, the infection control team began interventions. However, new inpatients with VISA strains continued to appear. Therefore, in October 2013, the ICU was partially closed in order to try to prevent further horizontal transmission, and existing inpatients with the VISA strain were isolated. Although new cases quickly dissipated after the partial closure, it took approximately five months to eradicate the VISA outbreak.
Conclusion
Our data suggest that despite the employment of various other infection control measures, partial closure of the ICU was essential in terminating this VISA outbreak."

Viruses cause a major proportion of human infections, especially gastroenteritis and respiratory infections in children and adults. Indirect transmission between humans via environmental surfaces may play a role in infections, but methods to investigate this have been sparse.
Aim
To validate and test efficient and reliable procedures to detect multiple human pathogenic viruses on surfaces.
Methods
The study was divided into two parts. In Part A, six combinations of three different swabs (consisting of cotton, foamed cotton, or polyester head) and two different elution methods (direct lysis or immersion in alkaline glycine buffer before lysis) were tested for efficient recovery of human norovirus GII.7 and mengovirus from artificially contaminated surfaces. In Part B we determined the detection limit for norovirus GI.1 and GII.3 using the best procedure found in Part A linked with a commercial multiplex real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction detection assay.
Findings
Combining the polyester swab with direct lysis allowed recovery down to 100 and 10 genome copies/cm2 of norovirus GI.1 and GII.3, respectively. This procedure resulted in the significant highest recovery of both norovirus and mengovirus, whereas no differences in amplification efficiencies were observed between the different procedures.
Conclusion
The results indicate that it is possible to detect low concentrations of virus on environmental surfaces. We therefore suggest that a polyester swab, followed by direct lysis, combined with a multiplex qPCR detection assay is an efficient screening tool that merits study of different respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses on environment surfaces."

Considerable emphasis is currently placed on reducing healthcare-associated infection through improving hand hygiene compliance among healthcare professionals. There is also increasing discussion in the lay media of perceived poor hand hygiene compliance among healthcare staff. Our aim was to report the outcomes of a systematic search for peer-reviewed, published studies – especially clinical trials – that focused on hand hygiene compliance among healthcare professionals. Literature published between December 2009, after publication of the World Health Organization (WHO) hand hygiene guidelines, and February 2014, which was indexed in PubMed and CINAHL on the topic of hand hygiene compliance, was searched. Following examination of relevance and methodology of the 57 publications initially retrieved, 16 clinical trials were finally included in the review. The majority of studies were conducted in the USA and Europe. The intensive care unit emerged as the predominant focus of studies followed by facilities for care of the elderly. The category of healthcare worker most often the focus of the research was the nurse, followed by the healthcare assistant and the doctor. The unit of analysis reported for hand hygiene compliance was ‘hand hygiene opportunity’; four studies adopted the ‘my five moments for hand hygiene’ framework, as set out in the WHO guidelines, whereas other papers focused on unique multimodal strategies of varying design. We concluded that adopting a multimodal approach to hand hygiene improvement intervention strategies, whether guided by the WHO framework or by another tested multimodal framework, results in moderate improvements in hand hygiene compliance."

Background
Centrally led performance management regimes using standard setting, monitoring, and incentives have become a prominent feature of infection prevention and control (IPC) in health systems.
Aim
To characterize views and experiences of regulation and performance management relating to IPC in English hospitals.
Methods
Two qualitative datasets containing 139 interviews with healthcare workers and managers were analysed. Data directly relevant to performance management and IPC were extracted. Data analysis was based on the constant comparative method.
Findings
Participants reported that performance management regimes had mobilized action around specific infections. The benefits of establishing organizational structures of accountability were seen in empirical evidence of decreasing infection rates. Performance management was not, however, experienced as wholly benign, and setting targets in one area was seen to involve risks of ‘tunnel vision’ and the marginalization of other potentially important issues. Financial sanctions were viewed especially negatively; performance management was associated with risks of creating a culture of fearfulness, suppressing learning and disrupting inter-professional relationships.
Conclusion
Centrally led performance management may have some important roles in IPC, but identifying where it is appropriate and determining its limits is critical. Persisting with harsh regimes may affect relationships and increase resistance to continued improvement efforts, but leaving all improvement to local teams may also be a flawed strategy."

Background
The emergence and spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) have become a major public health problem. Control and prevention of CPE infections hinge on isolation precautions for carriers and active screening and follow-up of contacts.
Aim
To implement an open registry of cases and contacts for acute outbreak management, long-term data collection and epidemiological investigation.
Methods
All cases, defined as patients (infected or colonized) with a CPE-positive culture during their hospitalization, and contacts (e.g. patients cared for by the same healthcare team as a case) were registered in an ongoing database. Hospital stays were cross-referenced for every new entry and epidemiological links (e.g. shared contacts) investigated. All cases and contacts not cleared by complete screening were registered on an active list.
Findings
Between October 2012 and November 2014, we registered 30 cases and 1268 contacts, among which 24 were linked to two or three separate cases. Only 6.5% of contacts fulfilled complete screening with three rectal swabs, and 1145 contacts are still registered on the active surveillance list. Two outbreaks (12 and nine cases) occurred nine months apart. Cross-referencing of hospital stays using the registry revealed epidemiological links between seemingly unrelated cases of CPE-positive patients and suggested an environmental source of transmission, which was demonstrated thereafter.
Conclusion
We implemented a simple and multi-purpose tool to manage CPE episodes and investigate epidemiological links. Efforts are necessary to improve screening of contact patients who may be occult sources of transmission. A regional registry could be helpful."

Hospitals are hotspots for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) and play a major role in both their emergence and spread. Large numbers of these ARB will be ejected from hospitals via wastewater systems. In this review, we present quantitative and qualitative data of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in hospital wastewaters compared to community wastewaters. We also discuss the fate of these ARB in wastewater treatment plants and in the downstream environment. Published studies have shown that hospital effluents contain ARB, the burden of these bacteria being dependent on their local prevalence. The large amounts of antimicrobials rejected in wastewater exert a continuous selective pressure. Only a few countries recommend the primary treatment of hospital effluents before their discharge into the main wastewater flow for treatment in municipal wastewater treatment plants. Despite the lack of conclusive data, some studies suggest that treatment could favour the ARB, notably ESBL-producing E. coli. Moreover, treatment plants are described as hotspots for the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes between bacterial species. Consequently, large amounts of ARB are released in the environment, but it is unclear whether this release contributes to the global epidemiology of these pathogens. It is reasonable, nevertheless, to postulate that it plays a role in the worldwide progression of antibiotic resistance. Antimicrobial resistance should now be seen as an ‘environmental pollutant’, and new wastewater treatment processes must be assessed for their capability in eliminating ARB, especially from hospital effluents."

Background
Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is defined as radiologically confirmed pneumonia occurring ≥48h after hospitalization, in non-intubated patients. Empirical treatment regimens use broad-spectrum antimicrobials.
Aim
To evaluate the accuracy of the diagnosis of HAP and to describe the demographic and microbiological features of patients with HAP.
Methods
Medical and surgical inpatients receiving intravenous antimicrobials for a clinical diagnosis of HAP at a UK tertiary care hospital between April 2013 and 2014 were identified. Demographic and clinical details were recorded.
Findings
A total of 166 adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of HAP were identified. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials were prescribed, primarily piperacillin–tazobactam (57.2%) and co-amoxiclav (12.5%). Sputum from 24.7% of patients was obtained for culture. Sixty-five percent of patients had radiological evidence of new/progressive infiltrate at the time of HAP treatment, therefore meeting HAP diagnostic criteria (2005 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines). Radiologically confirmed HAP was associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers and sputum culture positivity. Previous surgery and/or endotracheal intubation were associated with radiologically confirmed HAP. A bacterial pathogen was identified from 17/35 sputum samples from radiologically confirmed HAP patients. These were Gram-negative bacilli (N = 11) or Staphylococcus aureus (N = 6). Gram-negative bacteria tended to be resistant to co-amoxiclav, but susceptible to ciprofloxacin, piperacillin–tazobactam and meropenem. Five of the six S. aureus isolates were meticillin susceptible and all were susceptible to doxycycline.
Conclusion
In ward-level hospital practice ‘HAP’ is an over-used diagnosis that may be inaccurate in 35% of cases when objective radiological criteria are applied. Radiologically confirmed HAP represents a distinct clinical and microbiological phenotype. Potential risk factors were identified that could represent targets for preventive interventions."

Our institution is a 1000-bed medical centre with two main buildings (B1 and B2). B1 has three intensive care units (ICUs) and transplant wards and polyethylene water pipes. B2 (control) has no ICUs and galvanized water pipes. A ClO2 generating unit was installed in the water system of B1 in April 2012 and water samples were collected in B1 and B2 before and eight times after installation. All samples were cultured for NFGNB and NTM.
Findings
The ClO2 concentration was significantly lower in the hot water than in the cold water (P<0.001). After 40 weeks of ClO2 use, the overall NFGNB colonies decreased significantly (hot water: 160±143 vs 2±4cfu/mL, P<0.001; cold water: 108±138 vs 3±7cfu/mL, P<0.001). Highly prevalent nosocomial NFGNB, such as Pseudomonas spp. and Stenotrophomonas spp., were undetected three months after ClO2 disinfection; Sphingomonas spp. persisted but had lower colony counts. NTM was present in 25% (three out of 12) of sampling locations initially, but was not detected at two weeks after ClO2 disinfection. The ICUs had no overall change in the number of NFGNB nosocomial infections after the intervention.
Conclusion
Addition of a ClO2 disinfection unit to our hospital water system reduced the numbers of NTM and NFGNB in the hot and cold water systems."

Background
With epidemic strains of Clostridium difficile posing a substantial healthcare burden internationally, there is a need for longitudinal evaluation of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) events in Australia.
Aim
To evaluate time trends and severity of illness for CDI events in Australian healthcare facilities.
Methods
All CDI events in patients admitted to Victorian public hospitals between 1st October 2010 and 31st December 2014 were reported to the Victorian Healthcare Associated Infection Surveillance System. CDI was defined as the isolation of a toxin-producing C. difficile organism in a diarrhoeal specimen, and classified as community-associated (CA-CDI) or healthcare-associated (HA-CDI). Severe disease was defined as admission to an intensive care unit, requirement for surgery and/or death due to infection. Time trends were examined using a mixed-effects Poisson regression model, and the Walter and Edward test of seasonality was applied to evaluate potential cyclical patterns.
Findings
In total, 6736 CDI events were reported across 89 healthcare facilities. Of these, 4826 (71.6%) were HA-CDI, corresponding to a rate of 2.49/10,000 occupied bed days (OBDs). The incidence of HA-CDI was highest in the fifth quarter of surveillance (3.6/10,000 OBDs), followed by a reduction. Severe disease was reported in 1.66% of events, with the proportion being significantly higher for CA-CDI compared with HA-CDI (2.21 vs 1.45%, P = 0.03). The highest and lowest incidence of HA-CDI occurred in March and October, respectively.
Conclusions
A low incidence of HA-CDI was reported in Victoria compared with US/European surveillance reports. Seasonality was evident, together with diminishing HA-CDI rates in 2012–2014. Severe infections were more common in CA-CDI, supporting future enhanced surveillance in community settings."

Background
A case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) was imported into Scotland in 2012.
Aim
To discuss the public health response to the case, and the control measures taken to prevent secondary transmission.
Methods
Following confirmation of the case, an incident management team (IMT) was convened to ensure that: (i) all individuals exposed to the case and/or their blood/body fluids were identified, assessed and followed-up appropriately; and (ii) the appropriate disinfection or disposal of equipment was used to manage the patient, laboratory specimens obtained from the case, and their environment.
Findings
Contact tracing identified 19 individuals who required follow-up and monitoring. No secondary cases occurred. Identification of laboratory specimens obtained prior to diagnosis proved challenging. The majority were traced, temporarily stored in sharps boxes and subsequently incinerated. A small number could not be recovered and consequently would have been disposed of through the routine hospital waste system. Biochemical and haematology analysers were decontaminated according to the manufacturers' instructions and liquid waste was discharged to drains. The patient's mattress, sphygmomanometer and pulse oximeter probe were incinerated. Decontamination of the clinical environment was undertaken following guidance from national experts.
Conclusions
While national guidance for the management of cases of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) available at the time in the UK informed the approach taken to manage the risk of secondary transmission, a number of practical issues relating to infection control aspects of managing a patient with VHF in a non-high-level isolation unit environment were encountered. Close liaison between national experts and the IMT was key to the expedient response to the emerging issues."

Background
To date, few studies have investigated the occurrence of phlebitis related to insertion of a peripheral venous cannula (PVC) in an emergency department (ED).
Aim
To describe the natural history of ED-inserted PVC site use; the occurrence and severity of PVC-related phlebitis; and associations with patient, PVC and nursing care factors.
Methods
A prospective study was undertaken of 1262 patients treated as urgent cases in EDs who remained in a medical unit for at least 24h. The first PVC inserted was observed daily until its removal; phlebitis was measured using the Visual Infusion Phlebitis Scale. Data on patient, PVC, nursing care and organizational variables were collected, and a time-to-event analysis was performed.
Findings
The prevalence of PVC-related phlebitis was 31%. The cumulative incidence (78/391) was almost 20% three days after insertion, and reached >50% (231/391) five days after insertion. Being in a specialized hospital [hazard ratio (HR) 0.583, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.366–0.928] and receiving more nursing care (HR 0.988, 95% CI 0.983–0.993) were protective against PVC-related phlebitis at all time points. Missed nursing care increased the incidence of PVC-related phlebitis by approximately 4% (HR 1.038, 95% CI 1.001–1.077).
Conclusions
Missed nursing care and expertise of the nurses caring for the patient after PVC insertion affected the incidence of phlebitis; receiving more nursing care and being in a specialized hospital were associated with lower risk of PVC-related phlebitis. These are modifiable risk factors of phlebitis, suggesting areas for intervention at both hospital and unit level."

Background
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogen causing chronic respiratory infections and posing a risk for cross-infection between patients with CF.
Aim
To propose an algorithm for long-term surveillance of P. aeruginosa and assess its suitability for monitoring the epidemiological situation at a CF centre with approximately 300 patients.
Methods
Over a nine-year period, over 300 P. aeruginosa isolates from 131 infected patients were tested by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and/or random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay.
Findings
MLST analysis led to the identification of 97 different sequence types which were distributed among 17 RAPD-generated (pseudo)clusters. This indicates that the easy-to-perform RAPD assay is only suitable for intra-individual, not interindividual, strain analyses. No epidemic strains were observed. Longitudinal analysis revealed that 110 of the 131 patients were infected with the same strain over the observation period, whereas 21 patients had a strain replacement or a new infection. Chronic infection was found in 99 of the 131 patients, and the remaining 32 patients met the criteria for intermittent infection (as defined by the Leeds criteria). Eighteen of the 32 patients (56%) with intermittent infection were infected with the same strain for up to nine years.
Conclusion
The strain type only changed in 16% of 131 patients with chronic or intermittent infection. As many as 56% of patients considered to have intermittent infection were actually chronically infected with the same strain for many years."

Background
Surveillance of healthcare-associated infection has been associated with a reduction in surgical site infection (SSI).
Aim
To evaluate the Korean Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System (KONIS) in order to assess its effects on SSI since it was introduced.
Methods
SSI data after gastrectomy, total hip arthroplasty (THA), and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between 2008 and 2012 were analysed. The pooled incidence of SSI was calculated for each year; the same analyses were also conducted from hospitals that had participated in KONIS for at least three consecutive years. Standardized SSI rates for each year were calculated by adjusting for SSI risk factors. SSI trends were analysed using the Cochran–Armitage test.
Findings
The SSI rate following gastrectomy was 3.12% (522/16,918). There was a significant trend of decreased crude SSI rates over five years. This trend was also evident in analysis of hospitals that had participated for more than three years. The SSI rate for THA was 2.05% (157/7656), which decreased significantly from 2008 to 2012. The risk factors for SSI after THA included the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance risk index, trauma, reoperation, and age (60–69 years). The SSI rate for TKA was 1.90% (152/7648), which also decreased significantly during a period of five years. However, the risk-adjusted analysis of SSI did not show a significant decrease for all surgical procedures.
Conclusion
The SSI incidence of gastrectomy and prosthetic joint replacement declined over five years as a result of active surveillance by KONIS."

Background
Audit and feedback programmes (AFPs) using fluorescent marking lead to improvements in room cleaning but have not been linked to reduced Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) incidence.
Aim
To evaluate the impact of an AFP on hospital-acquired CDI incidence.
Methods
In 2012, a hospital-wide AFP was implemented. Fluorescent marking of high-touch surfaces was used to assess discharge cleaning thoroughness. Weekly audit results were presented to cleaning staff. Interrupted time-series analysis was used to test for changes in the trend and level of hospital-acquired CDI incidence between the pre-intervention (January 2008 to December 2011) and post-intervention (April 2012 to June 2015) periods.
Findings
In all, 1002 audits were performed and room cleaning thoroughness improved from 49% to 90%. Hospital-acquired CDI incidence fell from 54 to 42 cases per 100,000 patient-days following the intervention whereas non-hospital-acquired CDI incidence rose from 43 to 52 cases per 100,000 patient-days, although both exhibited a downward trend post intervention. Time-series analysis showed that hospital-acquired CDI incidence was declining at a rate of 0.59 cases per 100,000 patient-days per quarter before the intervention. Following programme implementation, the rate of decline accelerated by an additional 1.35 cases per 100,000 patient-days per quarter (P < 0.05). Hand hygiene compliance increased minimally post intervention.
Conclusion
Implementation of an AFP using fluorescent marking resulted in improved thoroughness of room cleaning and appeared to result in an enhanced downward trend in CDI incidence, although part of this decline could be due to changes in local CDI epidemiology or improved hand hygiene."

Background
This study describes an outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) in a nursing home for men with mental disorders where residency is lengthy or permanent. This type of setting can provide a model of transmission as contact with the rest of society is extremely limited.
Aim
To determine if cases of TB, diagnosed around the same time and in the same place, are linked based on results using molecular and conventional methods.
Methods
The strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were analysed by drug resistance testing and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTRV). Microbiological results were related to clinical history and time of diagnosis.
Findings
Nine patients were diagnosed with TB, and strains were recovered from seven of these patients. Unexpectedly, the strains with the same genotype showed different patterns of resistance, and only two strains demonstrated identical patterns. MIRU-VNTR analysis demonstrated that one patient was infected with two different strains.
Conclusion
Variation between the strains indicates that the outbreak may have arisen from several sources of infection. The variation in resistance indicates that rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance is possible. As such, several questions are raised concerning source of infection, development of disease, resistance and mixed infections."

Background
Surgical site infection (SSI) causes significant mortality and morbidity. Administration of a high inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) to patients undergoing surgery may represent a potential preventive strategy.
Aim
To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in which high FiO2 was compared with normal FiO2 in patients undergoing surgery to estimate the effect on the development of SSI.
Methods
A comprehensive search was undertaken for randomized controlled trials (until December 2015) that compared high FiO2 with normal FiO2 in adults undergoing surgery with general anaesthesia and reported on SSI.
Findings
This study included 17 randomized controlled trials with 8093 patients. Infection rates were 13.11% in the control group and 11.53% in the hyperoxic group, while the overall risk ratio was 0.893 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.794–1.003; P = 0.057]. Subgroup analyses stratified by country, definition of SSI, and type of surgery were also performed, and showed similar results. However, high FiO2 was found to be of significant benefit in patients undergoing colorectal surgery, with a risk ratio of 0.735 (95% CI 0.573–0.944; P=0.016).
Conclusions
There is moderate evidence to suggest that administration of high FiO2 to patients undergoing surgery, especially colorectal surgery, reduces the risk of SSI. Further studies with better adherence to the intervention may affect the results of this meta-analysis."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Considering the incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), risk reduction strategies are crucial. Prior studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use can increase the risk of CDI over antibiotics alone; however, data and guidelines have been conflicting.
Aim
The aim was to compare CDI incidence in patients receiving high-risk antibiotics, comparing rates in those prescribed a PPI versus those without overlapping PPI exposure.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study assessed the incidence of CDI in veterans receiving high-risk antibiotics over an approximately three-year period. High-risk antibiotics were defined as: ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, clindamycin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, or cefixime.
Findings
We identified subjects who were prescribed any high-risk antibiotic, finding 3513 on a concomitant PPI and 6149 not taking a PPI. Of these subjects, 111 were diagnosed with CDI and met inclusion criteria. Baseline characteristics, CDI severity, length of hospitalization and antibiotic therapy prior to infection were similar in both groups. The incidence of CDI was significantly higher in patients prescribed a PPI (odds ratio: 2.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.52–3.23; P=0.0001). A strong association was found between concurrent PPI use with fluoroquinolones (P=0.005) and clindamycin (P=0.045).
Conclusion
The use of PPIs together with high-risk antibiotics was associated with a significantly higher incidence of CDI. Our study provides further support for the CDI prevention strategy of judicious PPI use, especially in patients receiving high-risk antibiotics. Prudent avoidance of PPIs may reduce the incidence of CDI, a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide."

Background
Selective chromogenic media allowing one-step meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolation and identification are widely used. However, the changing epidemiology of MRSA means that the suitability of these chromogenic media requires investigation.
Aim
To evaluate the following chromogenic media – Colorex MRSA, MRSA Select II, ChromID MRSA, and MRSA Brilliance 2 – for the detection of divergent strain types.
Methods
We used a diverse collection of S. aureus, including strains harbouring the mecC gene, strains expressing varying levels of meticillin resistance, and isolates recovered from patient samples.
Findings
MRSA Select II, Colorex MRSA, and ChromID each grew at a density of 1.5 × 101cfu/mL for each SCCmec type investigated. Brilliance 2 demonstrated growth at 1.5 × 101cfu/mL for mecC MRSA but at a higher density (1.5 × 104cfu/mL) for the three mecA MRSA strains. All four media demonstrated excellent sensitivity for MRSA detection (≥99%), but reduced levels of specificity (85–73%) when challenged with a range of meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates. High levels of false positives (∼50%) were also obtained with all chromogenic media when tested with mec-negative borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA) isolates.
Conclusion
Although false positives may be obtained with some strains of MSSA and BORSA, the high sensitivity of these media and their ability to recover almost all MRSA tested (including oxacillin-susceptible and mecC-positive strains) confirm the value of chromogenic agar in MRSA detection."

Background
Health policy initiatives continue to recognize the valuable role of patients and the public in improving safety, advocating the availability of information as well as involvement at the point of care. In infection control, there is a limited understanding of how users interpret the plethora of publicly available information about hospital performance, and little evidence to support strategies that include reminding healthcare staff to adhere to hand hygiene practices.
Aim
To understand how users define their own role in patient safety, specifically in infection control.
Methods
Through group interviews, self-completed questionnaires and scenario evaluation, user views of 41 participants (15 carers and 26 patients with recent experience of inpatient hospital care in London, UK) were collected and analysed. In addition, the project's patient representative performed direct observation of the research event to offer inter-rater reliability of the qualitative analysis.
Findings
Users considered evidence of systemic safety-related failings when presented with hospital choices, and did not discount hospitals with high (‘red’ flagged) rates of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Further, users considered staff satisfaction within the workplace over and above user satisfaction. Those most dissatisfied with the care they received were unlikely to ask staff, ‘Have you washed your hands?’
Conclusion
This in-depth qualitative analysis of views from a relatively informed user sample shows ‘what matters’, and provides new avenues for improvement initiatives. It is encouraging that users appear to take a holistic view of indicators. There is a need for strategies to improve dimensions of staff satisfaction, along with understanding the implications of patient satisfaction."

Aim
To determine which simulated-use test soils met the worst-case organic levels and viscosity of clinical secretions, and had the best adhesive characteristics.
Methods
Levels of protein, carbohydrate and haemoglobin, and vibrational viscosity of clinical endoscope secretions were compared with test soils including ATS, ATS2015, Edinburgh, Edinburgh-M (modified), Miles, 10% serum and coagulated whole blood. ASTM D3359 was used for adhesion testing. Cleaning of a single-channel flexible intubation endoscope was tested after simulated use.
Results
The worst-case levels of protein, carbohydrate and haemoglobin, and viscosity of clinical material were 219,828μg/mL, 9296μg/mL, 9562μg/mL and 6cP, respectively. Whole blood, ATS2015 and Edinburgh-M were pipettable with viscosities of 3.4cP, 9.0cP and 11.9cP, respectively. ATS2015 and Edinburgh-M best matched the worst-case clinical parameters, but ATS had the best adhesion with 7% removal (36.7% for Edinburgh-M). Edinburgh-M and ATS2015 showed similar soiling and removal characteristics from the surface and lumen of a flexible intubation endoscope.
Conclusions
Of the test soils evaluated, ATS2015 and Edinburgh-M were found to be good choices for the simulated use of endoscopes, as their composition and viscosity most closely matched worst-case clinical material."

Background
Norovirus outbreaks are a major burden for healthcare facilities globally.
Aim
Lessons learned to inform an action plan to improve facilities as well as responses to norovirus within the medicine of the elderly (MoE) hospital as well as other NHS (National Health Service) Lothian facilities.
Methods
This study investigated the impact of a prolonged outbreak at an MoE hospital in one of the 14 Scottish health boards between February and March 2013.
Findings
In all, 143 patients (14.80 cases per 1000 inpatient bed-days) and 30 healthcare staff (3.10 cases per 1000 inpatient bed-days) were affected clinically and 63 patients were confirmed virologically. Restricting new admissions to affected units resulted in 1192 lost bed-days. The cost due to lost bed-days in addition to staff absence and management of the outbreak was estimated at £341,534 for this incident alone. At certain points during the outbreak, the whole facility was closed with resulting major impact on the health board's acute care hospitals.
Conclusion
Due to the outbreak, new measures were implemented for the first time within NHS Lothian that included floor-by-floor (instead of individual) ward closures, enhanced cleaning with chlorine-based products throughout the hospital, reduction in bed capacity with enhanced bed-spacing and interruption to direct admissions from the Board's general practice surgeries, and temporary suspension of visitors to affected areas. Together with regular communication to staff, patients, relatives, and the public throughout the outbreak and good engagement of staff groups in management of the incident, the outbreak was gradually brought under control."

Contamination of the healthcare environment with pathogenic organisms contributes to the burden of healthcare-associated infection (HCAI). Antimicrobial surfaces are designed to reduce microbial contamination of healthcare surfaces. We aimed to determine whether antimicrobial surfaces prevent HCAI, transmission of antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs), or microbial contamination, we conducted a systematic review of the use of antimicrobial surfaces in patient rooms. Outcomes included HCAI, ARO, and quantitative microbial contamination. Relevant databases were searched. Abstract review, full text review, and data abstraction were performed in duplicate. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization Care (EPOC) Group risk of bias assessment tool and the strength of evidence determined using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Eleven studies assessed the effect of copper (N = 7), silver (N = 1), metal-alloy (N = 1), or organosilane-treated surfaces (N = 2) on microbial contamination. Copper surfaces demonstrated a median (range) reduction of microbial contamination of <1 log10 (<1 to 2 log10). Two studies addressed HCAI/ARO incidence. An RCT of copper surfaces in an ICU demonstrated 58% reduction in HCAI (P = 0.013) and 64% reduction in ARO transmission (P = 0.063) but was considered low-quality evidence due to improper randomization and incomplete blinding. An uncontrolled before–after study evaluating copper-impregnated textiles in a long-term care ward demonstrated 24% reduction in HCAI but was considered very-low-quality evidence based on the study design. Copper surfaces used in clinical settings result in modest reductions in microbial contamination. One study of copper surfaces and one of copper textiles demonstrated reduction in HCAI, but both were at high risk of bias."

abstract = "Summary
Background
We describe an outbreak with an extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an intensive care unit in a secondary care hospital in Norway. The outbreak source was a fibreoptic intubation endoscope in which the outbreak strain survived despite chemothermal disinfection in a decontaminator designated for such use. The genetic marker clpK, which increases microbial heat resistance, has previously been described in K. pneumoniae outbreak strains.
Aim
To investigate the role of clpK in biofilm formation and heat-shock stability in the outbreak strain.
Methods
The outbreak investigation was done by review of clinical records, screening of patients and culture from intubation endoscopes and bronchoscopes. Amplified fragment length polymorphism was used to identify the outbreak strain. clpK detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction, followed by mutant construction and heat-shock assays.
Findings
Five patients and one intubation endoscope contained K. pneumoniae with the same amplified fragment length polymorphism pattern. The outbreak strain contained the clpK genetic marker, which rendered the strain its increased heat resistance. The survival rate of the strain grown as biofilm following heat treatment was also strongly dependent on clpK.
Conclusion
Although clpK has been associated with clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae in earlier outbreaks, this is the first time that a ClpK-producing strain has been isolated from an environmental outbreak source. Heat resistance of certain K. pneumoniae strains may facilitate survival in biofilms on medical equipment and hence increase the potential of those strains to persist and disperse in the hospital environment."

Background
Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli are responsible for more than 50% of healthcare-associated infections. Colonization dynamics, characteristics, and risk factor data for CR-GNB are scarce in children.
Aim
To examine the molecular characteristics of, and risk factors for nosocomial colonization with, carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (CR-GNB) in hospitalized paediatric patients in a tertiary university hospital's paediatric units in Turkey.
Methods
A prospective case–control study was performed at a university hospital in Istanbul, Turkey.
Findings
A total of 1840 rectal swab specimens were collected from all 762 hospitalized children between March 2013 and October 2013. Among them, 176 (23%) patients were colonized with CR-GNB. Of these, 72 (9%) patients were colonized with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, 138 (18%) with CR-non-fermenter Gram-negative bacilli (CR-NF) and 34 (4%) with both. The median CR-GNB colonization time was 10 days (range: 1–116). The median duration of rectal colonization with CR-GNB was 8 days (range: 1–160). NDM (31%) was the second most frequent carbapenemase identified in Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, and has not previously been detected in Turkey. All of the 17 patients colonized with NDM-producing A. baumannii were newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit. Independent risk factors for CR-GNB colonization were: age <1 year, nasogastric tube placement, presence of underlying chronic diseases, ampicillin usage, surgical intervention, and carbapenem use.
Conclusion
This is the first description of NDM in A. baumannii in newborn units in Turkey. Carbapenem usage is a common independent risk factor for both CRE and CR-NF colonization, which underscores the importance of antibiotic stewardship programmes."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) has important implications for infection control and empiric antibiotic prescribing. This study aims to develop a risk scoring system for predicting ESBL-EC infection based on local epidemiology.
Methods
The study retrospectively collected eligible patients with a positive culture for E. coli during 2011 to 2014. The risk scoring system was developed using variables independently associated with ESBL-EC infection through logistic regression-based prediction. Area under the receiver–operator characteristic curve (AuROC) was determined to confirm the prediction power of the model.
Findings
Predictors for ESBL-EC infection were male gender [odds ratio (OR): 1.53], age ≥55 years (OR: 1.50), healthcare-associated infection (OR: 3.21), hospital-acquired infection (OR: 2.28), sepsis (OR: 1.79), prolonged hospitalization (OR: 1.88), history of ESBL infection within one year (OR: 7.88), prior use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins within three months (OR: 12.92), and prior use of other antibiotics within three months (OR: 2.14). Points scored ranged from 0 to 47, and were divided into three groups based on diagnostic performance parameters: low risk (score: 0–8; 44.57%), moderate risk (score: 9–11; 21.85%) and high risk (score: ≥12; 33.58%). The model displayed moderate power of prediction (AuROC: 0.773; 95% confidence interval: 0.742–0.805) and good calibration (Hosmer–Lemeshow χ2 = 13.29; P = 0.065).
Conclusion
This tool may optimize the prescribing of empirical antibiotic therapy, minimize time to identify patients, and prevent spreading of ESBL-EC. Prior to adoption into routine clinical practice, further validation study of the tool is needed."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Noroviruses are a leading cause of outbreaks globally and the most common cause of service disruption due to ward closures. Temporary suspension of visiting (TSV) is increasingly a recommended public health measure to reduce exposure, transmission and impact during norovirus outbreaks; however, preventing patient–visitor contact may contravene the ethos of person-centred care, and public acceptability of this measure is not known.
Aim
To investigate the acceptability of TSV during norovirus outbreaks from the perspectives of patients, visitors and the wider public.
Methods
Cross-sectional survey of patients (N = 153), visitors (N = 175) and the public (N = 224) in three diverse areas in Scotland. Health Belief Model constructs were applied to understand ratings of acceptability of TSV during norovirus outbreaks, and to determine associations between these levels and various predictor variables.
Findings
The majority (84.6%) of respondents indicated that the possible benefits of TSV are greater than the possible disadvantages. Conversely, the majority (70%) of respondents disagreed that TSV ‘is wrong as it ignores people's rights to have contact with family and friends’. The majority (81.6%) of respondents agreed that TSV would be more acceptable if exceptions were made for seriously ill or dying patients. Correlational analysis demonstrated that overall acceptability was positively related to perceived severity (r = 0.65), identified benefits (r = 0.54) and implementing additional communication strategies (r = 0.60); acceptability was negatively related to potential barriers (r = −0.49).
Conclusions
There is greater service user and public support for the use of TSV than concerns around impinging upon patients' rights to have visitors. TSV should be considered as an acceptable infection control measure that could be implemented consistently during norovirus outbreaks."

Background
When a child is hospitalized, parents have to share their role to protect the child with the hospital, and establish a partnership with healthcare workers to deliver safe care to the child, including undertaking good hand hygiene practices.
Aim
To review the scientific evidence about the participation of parents in the promotion of hand hygiene in paediatric settings.
Methods
A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and SciELO databases was undertaken using the following terms: (‘hand hygiene’[MeSH] OR ‘hand hygiene’ OR ‘hand disinfection’[MeSH] OR hand disinf* OR hand wash* OR handwash* OR hand antisep*) AND (parent OR caregiver OR mother OR father OR family OR families OR relatives). The Integrated Quality Criteria for Review of Multiple Study Designs tool was used for quality assessment.
Findings
The literature search yielded 1645 articles, and 11 studies met the inclusion criteria for the final analysis. Most studies were observational, and were based on questionnaires or interviews. Most parents had little knowledge about the indications to perform hand hygiene, but recognized hand hygiene as a relevant tool for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections. Their willingness to remind healthcare workers about a failed opportunity to perform hand hygiene was variable and, overall, rather low. Parents felt more comfortable about reminding healthcare workers about hand hygiene if they had previously been invited to do so.
Conclusions
Literature on the subject is scarce. The promotion of hand hygiene by parents should be further explored by research as a potential intervention for enhancing patient safety in paediatric settings."

Background
Several cases of Mycobacterium chimaera infection have recently been reported in cardiosurgical patients. So-called heater–cooler units (HCUs) used in cardiosurgical procedures are suspected to be the reservoir for pathogen growth and dissemination.
Aim
To assess the contamination status of HCUs at our facility.
Methods
Air sampling for mycobacteria was conducted at different distances from the machines and in the area around the operating table. Air sampling was also conducted for non-fermenters as a surrogate parameter for water-associated pathogens.
Findings
Mycobacterium chimaera was detected in the water tanks of the HCUs. When the devices were operating, M. chimaera was also found in their exhaust air, as well as in the area around the operating table. Non-fermenters were identified at different distances from the running HCU and the area around the operating table. Cultures remained negative when the devices were switched off.
Conclusions
Exhaust air from HCUs may be a pathway of pathogen transmission to patients undergoing open chest heart surgery. Although, for technical reasons, relocation of HCUs is difficult to achieve, only strict separation of the HCU from the operating room appears to enhance patient safety. Using non-fermenters as a surrogate parameter may be considered a viable option for a timely risk assessment. The design of HCUs should be modified to keep susceptibility to contamination at a minimum."

Background
Extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDR-Ab) is an increasingly important cause of healthcare-associated infection. Uncertainties remain concerning optimal control measures for healthcare-associated outbreaks.
Aim
To describe the epidemiology and control of an XDR-Ab outbreak that involved multiple units of a large hospital from March 2012 to January 2014.
Methods
Case-finding included screening of rectum, groin, throat, nose, wounds, iatrogenic portals of entry, and catheterized sites. Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated by disc diffusion and E-test. Resistance genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Clonality was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Charts of cases were reviewed to identify risk factors for invasive infection. Control measures included isolation and cohorting of cases, hand hygiene reinforcement, environmental decontamination, and source control with daily baths using wipes pre-impregnated with chlorhexidine gluconate.
Findings
A single clonal strain of XDR-Ab colonized or infected 29 patients. Five patients died of XDR-Ab bacteraemia. Transmission occurred primarily on two wards. Colonization was detected at all anatomical screening sites; only 57% (16/28) of cases were rectal carriers. Advanced malignancy was a risk factor for bacteraemia (relative risk: 5.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.2–27.0). Transmission ended following implementation of the multimodal control strategy. No additional nosocomial cases occurred during the following 20 months.
Conclusion
Our study highlights the need to screen multiple anatomic sites to diagnose carriage and identifies risk factors for XDR-Ab bacteraemia. A multimodal intervention that included daily chlorhexidine baths for cases was rapidly followed by the termination of the outbreak. Hospitals should consider similar interventions when managing future XDR-Ab outbreaks."

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infection is the primary complication associated with placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD). The use of silver-impregnated EVD catheters has become commonplace in many neurosurgical centres.
Aim
To assess the effect of silver-impregnated EVD catheter usage on catheter-related CSF infections.
Methods
A meta-analysis was performed by systematically searching Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs comparing silver-impregnated and plain EVD catheters were identified and analysed.
Findings
Six non-RCTs were included. The crude infection rate was 10.8% for plain catheters and 8.9% for silver-impregnated catheters [pooled odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46–1.08; P = 0.11]. In a microbiological spectrum analysis, silver-impregnated catheters demonstrated a significantly lower rate of CSF infections caused by Gram-positive organisms (2.0% vs 6.7% in the silver-impregnated and plain catheter groups, respectively; pooled OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11–0.63; P = 0.002).

Background
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Several nosocomial outbreaks of PCP have been reported in human-immunodeficiency-virus-negative, immunocompromised patients. The primary route of P. jirovecii transmission has yet to be proven; however, these outbreaks of infection suggest either interhuman transmission or a common environmental source.
Aim
To identify and evaluate all published clusters and outbreaks of PCP. The main objective was to compare the epidemiology of the outbreaks, with a particular focus on the evidence for different modes of transmission.
Methods
PubMed and EMBASE were searched to identify all English-language articles describing PCP outbreaks or clusters between 1980 and March 2015. Data were extracted on the outbreak setting, features of the outbreak, application of molecular typing, results of epidemiological assessment and environmental sampling.
Findings
Thirty outbreaks described in 29 articles were identified. Twenty-five (83%) of these outbreaks were described in patients who had undergone solid organ transplantation, primarily renal transplantation. All studies described a defined cohort of patients who shared some nosocomial facilities, including both inpatient and outpatient areas. Genotyping was undertaken in 16 (47%) studies. Cases with an identical genotype were demonstrated in all these studies.
Conclusions
The findings of this review raise a number of concerns regarding the public health and infection control implications of infection with PCP. The evidence presented for nosocomial acquisition and possible person-to-person transmission of infection suggests the need for formal infection control policies."

abstract = "Summary
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infection is a serious and potentially devastating complication of CSF shunt placement. Younger age, previous CSF shunt infection or revision, and the type of the shunt are important risk factors for shunt infection. More than half of the cases are caused by Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. The biofilm plays a central role in its pathogenesis. CSF cultures remain the gold standard for diagnosis of CSF shunt infection. The most effective way to prevent CSF shunt infection is optimization of sterile protocols and use of proper and timely antibiotic prophylaxis. Management of CSF shunt infection frequently requires removal of all shunt components, placement of a temporary external device, and administration of intravenous antibiotics, followed by reshunting at a later time. This review summarizes and analyses the results of previous reports of CSF shunt infection and assesses the prevention and management of this important entity."

abstract = "Summary
Background
During an environmental investigation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in intensive care units, the liquid hand soap was found to be highly contaminated (up to 8 × 105cfu/g) with this pathogen. It had been used over the previous five months and was probably contaminated during manufacturing.
Aim
To evaluate the burden of this contamination on patients by conducting an epidemiological investigation using molecular typing combined with whole genome sequencing (WGS).
Methods
P. aeruginosa isolates from clinical specimens were analysed by double locus sequence typing (DLST) and compared with isolates recovered from the soap. Medical charts of patients infected with a genotype identical to those found in the soap were reviewed. WGS was performed on soap and patient isolates sharing the same genotype.
Findings
P. aeruginosa isolates (N = 776) were available in 358/382 patients (93.7%). Only three patients (0.8%) were infected with a genotype found in the soap. Epidemiological investigations showed that the first patient was not exposed to the soap, the second could have been exposed, and the third was indeed exposed. WGS showed a high number of core single nucleotide polymorphism differences between patients and soap isolates. No close genetic association was observed between soap and patient isolates, ruling out the hypothesis of transmission.
Conclusion
Despite a highly contaminated soap, the combined investigation with DLST and WGS ruled out any impact on patients. Hand hygiene performed with alcohol-based solution for >15 years was probably the main reason. However, such contamination represents a putative reservoir of pathogens that should be avoided in the hospital setting."

Background
Hospital-associated infections (HAIs) are more frequently encountered in low- than in high-resource settings. There is a need to identify and implement feasible and sustainable approaches to strengthen HAI prevention in low-resource settings.
Aim
To evaluate the biological contamination of routinely cleaned mattresses in both high- and low-resource settings.
Methods
In this two-stage observational study, routine manual bed cleaning was evaluated at two university hospitals using adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Standardized training of cleaning personnel was achieved in both high- and low-resource settings. Qualitative analysis of the cleaning process was performed to identify predictors of cleaning outcome in low-resource settings.
Findings
Mattresses in low-resource settings were highly contaminated prior to cleaning. Cleaning significantly reduced biological contamination of mattresses in low-resource settings (P < 0.0001). After training, the contamination observed after cleaning in both the high- and low-resource settings seemed comparable. Cleaning with appropriate type of cleaning materials reduced the contamination of mattresses adequately. Predictors for mattresses that remained contaminated in a low-resource setting included: type of product used, type of ward, training, and the level of contamination prior to cleaning.
Conclusion
In low-resource settings mattresses were highly contaminated as noted by ATP levels. Routine manual cleaning by trained staff can be as effective in a low-resource setting as in a high-resource setting. We recommend a multi-modal cleaning strategy that consists of training of domestic services staff, availability of adequate time to clean beds between patients, and application of the correct type of cleaning products."

Background
Point-prevalence studies can identify priorities for infection control.
Aim
In May 2014, the Beijing Nosocomial Infection Control and Quality Improvement Centre organized a point-prevalence survey in 124 acute care hospitals in Beijing province. By analysing the survey results and factors affecting the point prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) in secondary and tertiary acute care hospitals in a certain area of China, this study provides evidence and reference to monitor HCAIs in a wide variety of hospitals.
Methods
An epidemiological cross-sectional survey conducted by infection control practitioners was used to assess the point-prevalence rate of HCAIs by reviewing cases and performing bedside surveys.
Findings
In total, 124 hospitals and 61,990 patients were surveyed, and 1389 (2.2%) HCAIs were diagnosed in 1294 (2.1%) patients. Respiratory tract infections were the most common HCAIs (54.4%, 51.7–56.9%), followed by urinary tract infections (15.0%, 13.2–16.9%), gastrointestinal tract infections (7.7%, 6.3–9.1%), surgical site infections (6.3%, 5.1–7.6%) and bloodstream infections (5.5%, 4.3–6.8%). In this survey, the top three pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli. Rates of central vein catheter insertion, urethral catheterization and mechanical ventilation were 9.9%, 12.4% and 3.8%, respectively. Overall, 23.7% of the patients underwent surgery on or before the date of the survey. HCAIs were present in 14.5% of intensive care unit patients, 2.3% of medical patients and 2% of surgical patients. Diarrhoea was found in 0.8% of the assessed cases; however, tests for Clostridium difficile are not routinely available in China.
Conclusion
In areas with limited personnel and resources, regular investigation of the point prevalence of HCAIs can be performed in lieu of comprehensive monitoring to elucidate risk factors and disease burdens of HCAIs."

Background
The Danish Hospital-Acquired Infections Database (HAIBA) is an automated surveillance system using hospital administrative, microbiological, and antibiotic medication data.
Aim
To define and evaluate the case definition for hospital-acquired urinary tract infection (HA-UTI) and to describe surveillance data from 2010 to 2014.
Methods
The HA-UTI algorithm defined a laboratory-diagnosed UTI as a urine culture positive for no more than two micro-organisms with at least one at ≥104cfu/mL, and a probable UTI as a negative urine culture and a relevant diagnosis code or antibiotic treatment. UTI was considered hospital-acquired if a urine sample was collected ≥48h after admission and <48h post discharge. Incidence of HA-UTI was calculated per 10,000 risk-days. For validation, prevalence was calculated for each day and compared to point prevalence survey (PPS) data.
Findings
HAIBA detected a national incidence rate of 42.2 laboratory-diagnosed HA-UTI per 10,000 risk-days with an increasing trend. Compared to PPS the laboratory-diagnosed HA-UTI algorithm had a sensitivity of 50.0% (26/52) and a specificity of 94.2% (1842/1955). There were several reasons for discrepancies between HAIBA and PPS, including laboratory results being unavailable at the time of the survey, the results considered clinically irrelevant by the surveyor due to an indwelling urinary catheter or lack of clinical signs of infection, and UTIs being considered HA-UTI in PPS even though the first sample was taken within 48h of admission.
Conclusion
The HAIBA algorithm was found to give valid and valuable information and has, among others, the advantages of covering the whole population and allowing continuous standardized monitoring of HA-UTI."

abstract = "Summary
Background
The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is of particular concern with respect to urinary tract infections, since the majority of causative agents are Gram-negative bacteria. Healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (HAUTIs) are frequently associated with instrumentation of the urinary tract, specifically with indwelling catheters.
Aim
To evaluate the current incidence, mortality, and length of hospital stay associated with HAUTIs.
Methods
A non-concurrent cohort study design was used, conducted between January 1st, 2010 and June 30th, 2014. All patients admitted to one of the eight participating Australian hospitals and who were hospitalized for more than two days were included. The primary outcome measures were the incidence, mortality, and excess length of stay associated with HAUTIs.
Findings
From 162,503 patient admissions, 1.73% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.67–1.80] of admitted patients acquired a HAUTI. Using a multi-state model, the expected extra length of stay due to HAUTI was four days (95% CI: 3.1–5.0 days). Using a Cox regression model, infection significantly reduced the rate of discharge (hazard ratio: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.73–0.83). Women were less likely to die (0.71; 0.66–0.75), whereas older patients were more likely to die (1.40; 1.38–1.43). Death was rarer in a tertiary referral hospital compared to other hospitals, after adjusting for age and sex (0.74; 0.69–0.78).
Conclusion
This study is the first to explore the burden of HAUTIs in hospitals using appropriate statistical methods in a developed country. Our study indicates that the incidence of HAUTI, in addition to its associated extra length of stay in hospital, presents a burden to the hospital system. With increasing incidence of UTI due to antimicrobial-resistant organisms, surveillance and interventions to reduce the incidence of HAUTI are required."

Standard precaution (SP) adherence is universally suboptimal, despite being a core component of healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) prevention and healthcare worker (HCW) safety. Emerging evidence suggests that patient safety climate (PSC) factors may improve HCW behaviours. Our aim was to examine the relationship between PSC and SP adherence by HCWs in acute care hospitals. A systematic review was conducted as guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. Three electronic databases were comprehensively searched for literature published or available in English between 2000 and 2014. Seven of 888 articles identified were eligible for final inclusion in the review. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality using a validated quality tool. The seven articles were assigned quality scores ranging from 7 to 10 of 10 possible points. Five measured all aspects of SP and two solely measured needlestick and sharps handling. Three included a secondary outcome of HCW exposure; none included HCAIs. All reported a statistically significant relationship between better PSC and greater SP adherence and used data from self-report surveys including validated PSC measures or measures of management support and leadership. Although limited in number, studies were of high quality and confirmed that PSC and SP adherence were correlated, suggesting that efforts to improve PSC may enhance adherence to a core component of HCAI prevention and HCW safety. More clearly evident is the need for additional high-quality research."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen causing worldwide hospital outbreaks. It has become a prototype of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) organisms.
Aim
To identify risk factors for acquisition of XDR-AB and to develop a colonization risk score in intensive care unit (ICU) patients in a Lebanese tertiary care centre where XDR-AB causes intermittent outbreaks.
Methods
This retrospective study included 257 patients with baseline negative screening cultures for XDR-AB admitted to a seven-bed ICU from July 2012 to July 2013. Patients' demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected from the hospital's electronic medical records. Univariate analysis of potential risk factors was performed followed by multivariate analysis to determine parameters to be included in the colonization risk score.
Findings
The rate of XDR-AB acquisition was 15.6%. Multivariate analysis identified urinary catheter placement >6 days (odds ratio: 16.98; 95% confidence interval: 3.96–49.56; P<0.0001), ICU contact pressure for >4 days (2.38; 1.48–3.57; P=0.001), presence of gastrostomy tube (5.44; 1.43–20.68; P=0.013), and previous use of carbapenems or piperacillin–tazobactam (4.20; 1.65–11.81; P=0.002) as parameters to be included in the colonization score. The risk of XDR-AB acquisition was 0, 5.6%, 17.2%, 56.8%, and 80% in the presence of a score of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. A score of 4 indicates high probability of XDR-AB acquisition, suggesting that patient isolation is required; zero indicates a low probability of XDR-AB acquisition.
Conclusion
Risk factors could be used to develop a score to decide which patients need isolation to limit the spread of XDR-AB."

Background
Ireland has been shown to have the highest rate of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in cases of bacteraemia in Europe, according to a report in 2014 from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System Network.
Aim
To investigate the prevalence of VRE gut colonization in a cohort of patients in 2014 at Cork University Hospital (CUH) by performing a cross-sectional study using faecal samples submitted to the microbiology laboratory for routine investigation from both hospital inpatients and community-based patients.
Methods
Faeces were examined for VRE colonization using selective cultivation, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and speciation using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. All VRE isolates were evaluated by molecular means for resistance determinants, type, and Insertion Sequence 16 as an indicator of Clonal Complex 17 (CC17).
Findings
From the 350 specimens investigated, 67 (19.1%) specimens were positive for VRE [95% confidence interval (CI): 15.0–23.2]. The prevalence of VRE colonization among CUH patients tested in this study (N = 194) was 31.4% (95% CI: 24.7–38.1). By contrast, the general practitioner patient samples (N=29) showed a prevalence of 0%, whereas 22.2% of samples from other hospitals (N=27) were positive for VRE. All isolates were Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) and were indicated to contain CC17, though with considerable heterogeneity among the isolates.
Conclusion
This high prevalence goes some way towards providing an explanation for the current high rates of VRE bacteraemia in Ireland, as well as highlighting the benefits of screening and enhanced infection control practices by all hospitals to control the high rates of VRE observed."

Background
For all countries, information on pathogens causing healthcare-associated infections is important in order to develop proper strategies for preventing and treating nosocomial infections.
Aim
To assess the change in frequencies and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens causing device-associated infections (DAIs) in intensive care units (ICUs) in South Korea between July 2006 and June 2014.
Methods
Data from the Korean Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System (KONIS) were analysed, including three major DAI types in ICUs.
Findings
The frequency of Gram-negative bacteria gradually increased for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (from 24.6% to 32.6% and from 52.8% to 73.5%, respectively). By contrast, the frequency of Gram-positive bacteria decreased from 58.6% to 49.2% for CLABSI, and from 44.3% to 23.8% for VAP (P < 0.001). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent causative pathogen in CLABSI throughout the surveillance period, but for VAP was replaced as the most frequent pathogen by Acinetobacter baumannii as of 2010. Candida albicans was the most frequent pathogen for catheter-associated urinary tract infection. The meticillin resistance rate in S. aureus decreased from 95% to 90.2% (P < 0.001); amikacin resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli decreased from 43.8% to 14.7% and from 15.0% to 1.8%, respectively (P < 0.001); imipenem resistance in A. baumannii increased from 52.9% to 89.8% (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
The proportion of Gram-negative bacteria as nosocomial pathogens for CLABSI and VAP has increased. The prevalence of A. baumannii causing DAIs in Korean ICUs has increased rapidly, as has the rate of carbapenem resistance in these bacteria."

To demonstrate the value of enhanced SAB surveillance to identify targets for infection prevention.
Methods
Prospective cohort study of all patients identified with SAB over a five-year period in a single health board in Scotland. All patients were reviewed at the bedside by a clinical microbiologist.
Findings
In all, 556 SAB episodes were identified: 261 (46.6%) were hospital-acquired; 209 (37.9%) were healthcare-associated; 80 (14.4%) were community-acquired; and in six (1.1%) the origin of infection was not hospital-acquired, but could not be separated into healthcare-associated or community-acquired.

In addition, there was a significantly higher 30-day mortality associated with hospital-acquired (31.4%) and healthcare-associated (16.3%) infections compared to community-acquired SAB (8.7%). Vascular access devices were associated with hospital-acquired SAB and peripheral venous cannulas were the source for most of these (43.9%). Community-acquired infections were associated with intravenous drug misuse, respiratory tract infections and skeletal and joint infections. Skin and soft tissue infections were more widely seen in healthcare-associated infections.
Conclusion
The data indicate that enhanced surveillance of SAB by origin of infection and source of bacteraemia has implications for infection prevention, empirical antibiotic therapy, and health improvement interventions."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Norovirus outbreaks cause significant patient distress and adversely affect healthcare service delivery. Measures to manage outbreaks include controlling patient/staff movement and advising visitors of the risks of infection; temporary suspension of visiting (TSV) is advocated by some. Factors influencing the use of TSV have not previously been reported.
Aim
To describe current practice in Scotland regarding TSV during norovirus outbreaks.
Methods
Cross-sectional survey of Scottish Health Boards [National Health Service (NHS)] Infection Prevention Leads (N = 22) and independent care home (ICH) managers (N = 107).
Findings
TSV practice is inconsistent across care settings. NHS findings: although 86.4% reported a recent norovirus outbreak, only 36.4% reported having criteria in place to guide TSV decisions and only 57.9% of those who had an outbreak implemented TSV. Conversely, 77.6% ICH respondents do have TSV criteria in place; 70.1% who had previously experienced an outbreak all reported that they would normally close to visitors. The majority of both NHS (81.8%) and ICH (84.2%) respondents reported making exceptions to TSV for individual cases. Despite variation in practice, 75% NHS and 81.8% ICH respondents agreed that TSV was helpful in controlling outbreaks. Factors influencing TSV implementation decisions included use of judgement in individual cases, perceived lack of evidence for the role of visitors in transmission, and belief in patients’ rights to have visitors.
Conclusion
Implementation of TSV in Scotland is inconsistent, with variation in the use of criteria, personal beliefs, and professional judgements. Further research on the role of visitors in transmission and service-user acceptability of TSV is required for policy development."

Background
Bedside hygiene is important to reduce healthcare-associated infection rates. The CareCentre® is an end-of-hospital-bed table, housing: alcohol-based hand rub, gloves, aprons, waste bin, and an ergonomic writing surface.
Aim
To determine the effectiveness of the CareCentre at improving bedside hygiene.
Methods
In the randomized cross-over simulation evaluation, 20 participants used the CareCentre and standard conditions to perform common bedside tasks. In the randomized cross-over clinical evaluation, nine pairs of acute adult hospital ward bays received CareCentres and standard conditions for one week each. Researchers measured adherence to the World Health Organization's ‘my five moments for hand hygiene’ and donning and disposing of gloves and aprons at the bedside.
Findings
Adherence to hand hygiene guidelines improved from 48% to 67% (P = 0.04) in the simulation and from 14% to 40% (P < 0.001) in the clinical evaluation. Donning and disposing of gloves at the bedside improved from 19% to 79% (P < 0.001) in the simulation and from 30% to 65% (P = 0.014) in the clinical evaluation.

Background
Antimicrobial use and resultant resistance is still increasing worldwide. Close monitoring and strict implementation of policies are important to tackle this issue.
Aim
To assess the use of antimicrobials in acute care hospitals in the Slovak Republic.
Methods
Antimicrobial use was monitored as part of a point prevalence survey (PPS) of healthcare-associated infections. Surveillance was performed in 40 hospitals in the Slovak Republic according to the standardized methodology developed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Data were collected according to a standard protocol.
Findings
In total, 8397 patients in 40 Slovak hospitals were surveyed. Of these, 30.7% were receiving antibiotics at the time of the survey. In 630 cases, patients were receiving more than one antimicrobial agent. The prevalence of antimicrobial use was highest in intensive care units (54.3%). Antimicrobials were prescribed most frequently for treatment of community-acquired infections (48.1%) and healthcare-associated infections (11.4%). Surgical prophylaxis was the indication for 22.2% of all prescribed antimicrobials, and exceeded 24h in 81.5% of cases. The antimicrobials used most often were fluoroquinolones (20.9%), especially for non-surgical prophylaxis (26.8%) and treatment (21.9%). The antimicrobials prescribed most frequently for surgical prophylaxis were first-generation cephalosporins (23.0%), fluoroquinolones (14.7%) and second-generation cephalosporins (11.4%). The use of antimicrobials was higher in patients with invasive medical devices.
Conclusion
This study found excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged surgical prophylaxis, frequent use of parenteral antibiotics and inadequate documentation of the indication for prescription. These findings present opportunities for improving the management of antimicrobials in Slovak hospitals."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) disinfection systems are being used to reduce patients' exposure to hospital pathogens in the environment. HPV whole-room aerial disinfection systems may vary in terms of operating concentration and mode of delivery.
Aim
To assess the efficacy of two HPV systems (HPS1 and HPS2) for whole-room aerial disinfection of single isolation rooms (SIRs).
Methods
Ten SIRs were selected for manual terminal disinfection after patient discharge. Test coupons seeded with biological indicator (BI) organisms [∼106 colony-forming units (cfu) of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Klebsiella pneumoniae, or ∼105cfu Clostridium difficile 027 spores] prepared in a soil challenge were placed at five locations per room. For each cycle, 22 high-frequency-touch surfaces in SIRs were sampled with contact plates (∼25cm2) before and after HPV decontamination, and BIs were assayed for the persistence of pathogens.
Findings
Approximately 95% of 214 sites were contaminated with bacteria after manual terminal disinfection, with high numbers present on the SIR floor (238.0–352.5cfu), bed control panel (24.0–33.5cfu), and nurse call button (21.5–7.0cfu). Enhanced disinfection using HPV reduced surface contamination to low levels: HPS1 [0.25cfu, interquartile range (IQR) 0–1.13] and HPS2 (0.5cfu, IQR 0–2.0). Both systems demonstrated similar turnaround times (∼2–2.5h), and no differences were observed in the efficacy of the two systems against BIs (C. difficile ∼5.1log10 reduction; MRSA/K. pneumoniae ∼6.3log10 reduction). Despite different operating concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, MRSA persisted on 27% of coupons after HPV decontamination.
Conclusion
Enhanced disinfection with HPV reduces surface contamination left by manual terminal cleaning, minimizing the risks of cross-contamination. The starting concentration and mode of delivery of hydrogen peroxide may not improve the efficacy of decontamination in practice, and therefore the choice of HPV system may be based upon other considerations such as cost, convenience and logistics."

Background
Dry hospital environments are contaminated with pathogenic bacteria in biofilms, which suggests that current cleaning practices and disinfectants are failing.
Aim
To test the efficacy of sodium hypochlorite solution against Staphylococcus aureus dry-surface biofilms.
Methods
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Biofilm Reactor was adapted to create a dry-surface biofilm, containing 1.36 × 107 S. aureus/coupon, by alternating cycles of growth and dehydration over 12 days. Biofilm was detected qualitatively using live/dead stain confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and quantitatively with sonicated viable plate counts and crystal violet assay. Sodium hypochlorite (1000–20,000parts per million) was applied to the dry-surface biofilm for 10min, coupons were rinsed three times, and residual biofilm viability was determined by CLSM, plate counts and prolonged culture up to 16 days. Isolates before and after exposure underwent minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum eradication concentration (MEC) testing, and one pair underwent whole-genome sequencing.
Findings
Hypochlorite exposure reduced plate counts by a factor of 7 log10, and reduced biofilm biomass by a factor of 100; however, staining of residual biofilm showed that live S. aureus cells remained. On prolonged incubation, S. aureus regrew and formed biofilms. Post-exposure S. aureus isolates had MICs and MECs that were not significantly different from the parent strains. Whole-genome sequencing of one pre- and post-exposure pair found that they were virtually identical.
Conclusions
Hypochlorite exposure led to a 7-log kill but the organisms regrew. No resistance mutations occurred, implying that hypochlorite resistance is an intrinsic property of S. aureus biofilms. The clinical significance of this warrants further study."

Background
Diagnosis of intravascular catheter infection may be affected by the definition and procedures applied in the absence of blood culture data.
Aim
To examine the extent to which different definitions of catheter infection and procedures for handling absent blood culture data can affect reported catheter infection rates.
Methods
Catheter infection rates were established in a cohort of hospitalized patients administered parenteral nutrition according to three clinical and four published definitions. Paired and unpaired comparisons were made using available case analyses, sensitivity analyses and intention-to-categorize analyses.
Findings
Complete data were available for each clinical definition (N = 193), and there were missing data (4.1–26.9%) for the published definitions. In an available case analysis, the catheter infection rate was 13.0–36.8% for the clinical definitions and 2.1–12.4% for the published definitions. For the published definitions, the rate was 1.6–32.1% in a sensitivity analysis and 11.4–16.9% in an intention-to-categorize analysis, with suggestion of bias towards a higher catheter infection rate in those with missing data, in keeping with the analyses of the clinical definitions. For paired comparisons, the strength of agreement between definitions varied from ‘poor’ (Cohen's kappa <0.21) to ‘very good’ (Cohen's kappa ≥0.81).
Conclusion
The use of different definitions of catheter infection and procedures applied in the absence of blood culture data produced widely different catheter infection rates, which could compromise measurements or comparisons of service quality or study outcome. As such, there is a need to establish and use a valid, consistent and practical definition."

Background
Completion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) occupational postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is important for successful prophylaxis.
Aim
To determine factors associated with failure to complete the four-week HIV PEP.
Methods
A retrospective study was conducted among healthcare workers (HCWs) accidentally exposed to blood or body fluids of patients at the Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand, between March 1996 and June 2014. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with failure to complete the four-week HIV PEP.
Findings
In total, 225 exposure episodes were reported. The mean age of HCWs was 33.1 (standard deviation 9.9) years, and 189 (84%) were female. Nurses (43%) were exposed most frequently. The HIV status of the source was defined in 149 (66%) episodes, and 101 (68%) of these were positive. Of 225 exposures, PEP was prescribed in 155 (69%) cases, with intentional discontinuation in 26 cases. Ninety-one of 129 (71%) HCWs completed the four-week regimen. Multi-variate analysis showed that a regimen of two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) + efavirenz (EFV) was the only significant factor associated with non-completion of the four-week course (odds ratio 37.8, 95% confidence interval 4.2–342.3; P < 0.01). Other factors including age, sex, staff position, status of the source and other PEP regimens were not associated with non-completion of the four-week course (P > 0.05). None of the HCWs were documented to have HIV seroconversion.
Conclusion
A regimen of two NRTIs + EFV was significantly associated with premature discontinuation of occupational PEP. This regimen should not be used for HIV prophylaxis following occupational exposure."

Aim
To compare inguinal and rectal swabs for the detection of multidrug-resistant bacteria colonizing the intestinal tract.

Compared to rectal swabs, the sensitivity and specificity of inguinal swabs was 91.8% and 88.7%, respectively. Even when there were low colony counts from rectal samples, there were more than 100 colonies from inguinal samples.
Conclusion
The inguinal region can be considered an acceptable alternative for collecting surveillance cultures for multidrug-resistant bacteria colonizing the intestinal tract. The inguinal swab technique is sensitive and specific for assessing multidrug-resistant micro-organisms, less embarrassing for patients, and simple to implement in hospital practice."

Background
Few studies have investigated the additional healthcare costs of recurrent C. difficile infection (CDI).
Aim
To quantify inpatient treatment costs for CDI and length of stay among hospitalized patients with primary CDI only, compared with CDI patients who experienced recurrent CDI.
Methods
This was a prospective, observational cohort study of hospitalized adult patients with primary CDI followed for three months to assess for recurrent CDI episodes. Total and CDI-attributable hospital length of stay (LOS) and hospitalization costs were compared among patients who did or did not experience at least one recurrent CDI episode.
Findings
In all, 540 hospitalized patients aged 62±17 years (42% males) with primary CDI were enrolled, of whom 95 patients (18%) experienced 101 recurrent CDI episodes. CDI-attributable median (interquartile range) LOS and costs (in US$) increased from 7 (4–13) days and $13,168 (7,525–24,456) for patients with primary CDI only versus 15 (8–25) days and $28,218 (15,050–47,030) for patients with recurrent CDI (P<0.0001, each). Total hospital median LOS and costs increased from 11 (6–22) days and $20,693 (11,287–41,386) for patients with primary CDI only versus 24 (11–48) days and $45,148 (20,693–82,772) for patients with recurrent CDI (P<0.0001, each). The median cost of pharmacological treatment while hospitalized was $60 (23–200) for patients with primary CDI only (N=445) and $140 (30–260) for patients with recurrent CDI (P=0.0013).

Background
Chronic infections, for example, diabetic foot ulcers, have a large impact in terms of patient morbidity and mortality. These wounds are characterized by complex polymicrobial communities of bacteria, which may include a number of difficult-to-eradicate multidrug-resistant pathogens.
Aim
To establish a multi-species biofilm model to test the efficacy of chlorhexidine and chlorhexidine-containing formulas in eradication of polymicrobial biofilms.
Methods
A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bioreactor was used to establish a multi-species biofilm incorporating Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis with equal numbers of each pathogen. This model was used to test the effectiveness of chlorhexidine at controlling the pre-formed biofilm.
Findings
Chlorhexidine digluconate (CHD) was added to the bioreactor at a range of concentrations. K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa survived within multi-species biofilms, up to and including 4% CHD, whereas S. aureus was reduced to below the level of detection at 1%. Wiping the biofilm-containing coupons from the bioreactor with chlorhexidine-containing medical wipes resulted in >3 to <4log10 reduction after 24h, for all species. When the coupons were embedded in a simulated wound bed, formed in an agar plate, CHD-containing medical dressings completely eliminated S. aureus (>8log10 reduction), but had minimal effect (<3log10) against the other species tested.
Conclusion
The study demonstrates that the effectiveness of chlorhexidine may be limited in settings where it is required to act on multi-species biofilms. This may compromise the ability of chlorhexidine to control the infection and spread of these pathogens."

The surfaces were contaminated with MRSA isolated from hospitalized patients using a mist sprayer to simulate the mode of environmental contamination caused by a carrier. MRSA cell density was assessed before contamination until 180min after contamination using Rodac plates. The differences between test and control surfaces in terms of MRSA density and log MRSA density reduction were assessed using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. Five strains were tested, and each strain was tested five times.
Findings
The highest median MRSA densities [46.3 and 43.1 colony-forming units (cfu)/cm2 for control and test surfaces, respectively] were detected 45min after contamination. Median MRSA densities 180min after contamination were 10.1 and 0.7cfu/cm2 for control and test surfaces, respectively (P<0.01). Log MRSA density reduction attributable to PCD was 1.16logcfu/cm2, corresponding to 93% reduction of the baseline MRSA contamination.
Conclusions
The disinfectant activity remained stable throughout the 25 testing occasions, despite between-test cleaning and disinfection. The anti-MRSA activity of PCD was compatible with the benchmark for surface hygiene in hospitals (<1cfu/cm2), but required 3h of exposure to photocatalysis. Thus, PCD could be considered for non-clinical surfaces. However, for clinical surfaces, PCD should be regarded as supplemental to conventional decontamination procedures, rather than an alternative."

Background
Control of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) organisms relies increasingly on the use of biocides, including chlorhexidine, to limit the risk of infection. The concentration and formulation of chlorhexidine can vary hugely between products.
Aim
To establish the activity of chlorhexidine and in-use chlorhexidine formulations against 14 clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated before and since the use of chlorhexidine became routine, and strains that have adapted following sublethal chlorhexidine exposure.
Methods
Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of five chlorhexidine-containing formulations were measured at 5min, 15min, 30min and 24h for the panel of K. pneumoniae strains.
Findings
After 5min, MBCs of five formulations varied from 0.006 to >50% working concentration (WC) or from 78 to 2500μg/mL chlorhexidine. For one formulation, MBCs were >50% WC for five of the 14 strains, and for another formulation, four of the 14 strains could resist 25% WC. NCTC 13368 was consistently most tolerant to chlorhexidine, whereas the strains isolated before the use of chlorhexidine became routine were more sensitive. One pre-chlorhexidine era and five modern strains increased MICs up to 16-fold following exposure to sublethal concentrations of chlorhexidine. A hand disinfectant with MBCs of 0.39% WC for all six of the wild-type strains, had MBCs of 50% WC for the chlorhexidine-adapted strains.
Conclusion
Not all chlorhexidine formulations kill MDR K. pneumoniae after the recommended exposure time. Activity, especially against chlorhexidine-adapted strains, depends on additional ingredients. Careful formulation of chlorhexidine products is therefore important to maintain and enhance the activity of chlorhexidine products, and avoid potential breakdown in infection control."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Postoperative infections, particularly surgical site infections (SSIs), cause significant morbidity and mortality. Probiotics or synbiotics are a potential prevention strategy.
Aim
To evaluate the efficacy of probiotics/synbiotics for reducing postoperative infection risk following abdominal surgery.
Methods
We searched AMED, Central, CINAHL, Embase, Medline, and grey literature for randomized controlled trials of elective abdominal surgery patients administered probiotics or synbiotics compared to placebo or standard care. Primary outcome was SSIs. Secondary outcomes were adverse events, respiratory tract infections (RTIs), urinary tract infections (UTIs), combined infections, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Using random-effects meta-analyses, we estimated the relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Tests were performed for heterogeneity, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted, and the overall evidence quality was graded.
Findings
We identified 20 trials (N = 1374 participants) reporting postoperative infections. Probiotics/synbiotics reduced SSIs (RR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.41–0.98; N = 15 studies), UTIs (RR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.15–0.57; N = 11), and combined infections (RR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.35–0.70; N = 18). There was no difference between groups for adverse events (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.61–1.30; N = 6), RTIs (RR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.36–1.00; N = 14), length of stay (MD: −1.19; 95% CI: −2.94 to 0.56; N = 12), or mortality (RR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.58–2.48; N = 15).
Conclusion
Our review suggests that probiotics/synbiotics reduce SSIs and UTIs from abdominal surgeries compared to placebo or standard of care, without evidence of safety risk. Overall study quality was low, owing mostly to imprecision (few patients and events, or wide CIs); thus larger multi-centered trials are needed to further assess the certainty in this estimate."

Background
There has been an increase in the availability of commercial sporicidal formulations. Any comparison of sporicidal data from the literature is hampered by the number of different standard tests available and the use of diverse test conditions including bacterial strains and endospore preparation.
Aim
To evaluate the effect of sporicidal standard tests on the apparent activity of eight biocides against Clostridium difficile and Bacillus subtilis.
Methods
The activity of eight biocidal formulations including two oxidizing agents, two aldehydes, three didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) and amine formulations, and sodium hypochlorite were evaluated using four standard sporicidal tests (BS EN 14347, BS EN13704, ASTM E2197-11, and AOAC MB-15-03) against B. subtilis (ACTC 19659) and C. difficile (NCTC 11209) spores.
Findings
C. difficile spores were more susceptible to the sporicides than were B. subtilis spores, regardless of the method used. There were differences in sporicidal activity between methods at 5 min but not at 60 min exposure. DDAC and amine-based products were not sporicidal when neutralized appropriately. Neutralization validation was confirmed for these biocides using the reporting format described in the BS EN standard tests, although the raw data appear to indicate that neutralization failed.
Conclusion
The different methods, whether based on suspension or carrier tests, produced similar sporicidal inactivation data. This study suggests that detailed neutralization validation data should be reported to ensure that neutralization of active spores is effective. Failure to do so may lead to erroneous sporicidal claims."

Background
Non-tuberculosis mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium chimaera are found widely in hospital water systems. Invasive M. chimaera infections have recently been attributed to heater–cooler units (HCUs) of cardiopulmonary bypass equipment.
Aim
To assess the extent of microbiological contamination within the HCUs and to inform decontamination strategies for reducing the microbial load.
Methods
Water samples taken from HCUs used at University Hospitals Birmingham for cardiopulmonary bypass surgery were sampled to determine the number of micro-organisms by membrane filtration. Various decontamination processes were used throughout the study, all based on the manufacturer's guidance.
Findings
Total viable counts >300cfu per 100mL containing a wide variety of micro-organisms were obtained from water inside the HCUs. Working with the manufacturers, we significantly reduced the microbial load of the water within the HCUs by removing the internal tubing soiled with biofilm followed by a weekly decontamination regimen with peracetic acid.
Conclusion
A decontamination cycle including an initial replacement of internal tubing with weekly microbiological water samples is required to maintain the water quality within HCUs at an acceptable level."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are an emerging infection control problem in hospitals worldwide. Identifying carriers may help reduce potential spread and infections.
Aim
To assess whether testing hospital wastewater for CPE can supplement patient-based screening for infection prevention purposes in a hospital without a recognized endemic CPE problem.
Methods
Wastewater collected from hospital pipework on 16 occasions during February to March 2014 was screened for CPE using chromID® CARBA agar and chromID® CPS agar with a 10μg ertapenem disc and combination disc testing. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy methodology and carbapenemase genes detected by polymerase chain reaction or whole-genome sequencing. Selected isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
Findings
Suspected CPE were recovered from all 16 wastewater samples. Of 17 isolates sent to the Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections Reference Unit, six (four Citrobacter freundii and two Enterobacter cloacae complex) were New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) producers and the remaining 11 (six Klebsiella oxytoca and five Enterobacter cloacae complex) were Guiana-Extended-Spectrum-5 (GES-5) producers, the first to be described among Enterobacteriaceae in the UK. The four NDM-producing C. freundii, two NDM-producing E. cloacae complex, and four out of five GES-5-producing E. cloacae complex were each indistinguishable isolates of the same three strains, whereas the six GES-5-producing K. oxytoca overall shared 79% similarity.
Conclusion
CPE are readily isolated from hospital wastewater using simple culture methods. There are either undetected carriers of CPE excreting into the wastewater, or these CPE represent colonization of the pipework from other sources. Surveillance of hospital wastewater for CPE does not appear helpful for infection control purposes within acute hospitals."

Background
National guidelines exist regarding preoperative antibiotic treatment for the prevention of surgical site infection (SSI); however, there are no published studies showing rates of compliance with them.
Aim
To establish compliance with national guidelines within our institution, and the impact of adherence, on SSI rate.
Methods
This was a retrospective observational study of 1019 patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty. Procedures were conducted at three metropolitan hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, throughout a 2.5-year period. Antibiotic prophylaxis recommendations were taken from the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines.
Findings
Of the procedures included, 61.3% adhered to prophylaxis guidelines, 38.7% did not. The total SSI rate was 2.7%; with an infection rate of 1.7% in those adherent to antibiotic guidelines, compared with a rate of 5.0% if non-adherent (P < 0.01). Overall, 98.4% of patients received a dedicated prophylactic antibiotic dose as per guidelines. Of the procedures, 1.7% lasted >4h with re-dosing being poorly adhered to (23.5% of procedures). In patients weighing >80kg (49.5% of surgeries), guideline-concordant dosing occurred in only 58.7% of cases. For patients >80kg without guideline-concordant dosing, the SSI rate was 6.6% and the odds ratio of SSI was 3.89 (confidence interval: 1.17–7.84; P = 0.01).
Conclusion
Non-adherence to guidelines increased the risk of SSI in patients undergoing total knee and hip arthroplasty. Dosing adjustment recommendations of prophylaxis for patients weighing >80kg was poorly adhered to, and these patients were subsequently at higher risk of infection."

Background
In June 2014, a cluster of identical S. maltophilia isolates was reported in an adult intensive care unit (ICU) at a district general hospital. An outbreak control team was convened to investigate the cluster and inform control measures.
Aim
To identify potential risk factors for isolation of S. maltophilia in this setting.
Methods
We conducted a cohort study of ICU patients for whom a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen was submitted between October 2013 and October 2014. Cases were patients with S. maltophilia-positive BAL. We calculated the association between isolation of S. maltophilia and patient characteristics using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and univariate logistic regression. Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests were used. BAL specimens were microbiologically typed using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
Findings
Eighteen patients met the case definition. Two patients had clinical presentations that warranted antibiotic treatment for S. maltophilia. All cases were exposed to bronchoscopy. PFGE typing revealed clusters of two strain types. We found statistically significant elevated risks of isolating BRISPOSM-4 in patients exposed to bronchoscope A (RR: 13.56; 95% CI: 1.82–100; P < 0.001) and BRISPOSM-3 in patients exposed to bronchoscope B (RR: 16.89; 95% CI: 2.14–133; P < 0.001). S. maltophilia type BRISPOSM-4 was isolated in water used to flush bronchoscope A after decontamination.
Conclusion
Two pseudo-outbreaks occurred in which BAL specimens had been contaminated by reusable bronchoscopes. We cannot exclude the potential for colonization of the lower respiratory tract of exposed patients. Introduction of single-use bronchoscopes was an effective control measure."

To determine whether patients infected with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella species (ESBL-EcKs) exhibit differences in clinical outcome, microbiological outcome, mortality, and/or hospital resource use compared to patients infected with non-ESBL-producing strains.
Methods
A retrospective case–control study of 75 case patients with ESBL-EcKs matched to controls infected with non-ESBL-EcKs who were hospitalized from June 2010 to April 2013 was conducted. Patient-level cost data were provided by the institution's business office. Clinical data were collected using the electronic databases and paper charts.
Findings
Median infection-related hospitalization costs per patient were greater for cases than controls (C$10,507 vs C$7,882; median difference: C$3,416; P = 0.04). The primary driver of increased costs was prolonged infection-related hospital length of stay (8 vs 6 days; P = 0.02) with patient location (ward, ICU) and indirect care costs (including costs associated with infection prevention and control) as the leading cost categories. Cases were more likely to experience clinical failure (25% vs 11%; P = 0.03), with a higher all-cause mortality (17% vs 5%; P = 0.04).

Background
The role of infectious diseases (ID) and clinical microbiology (CM) in hospital settings has expanded in response to increasing antimicrobial resistance, leading to widespread development of hospital antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes, the majority of which include antibiotic approval systems. However, inappropriate antibiotic use in hospitals continues, suggesting potential disjunctions between technical advice and the logics of antibiotic use within hospitals.
Aim
To examine the experiences of doctors in a UK hospital with respect to AMS guidance of antibiotic prescribing, and experiences of a verbal postprescription antibiotic approval process.
Methods
Twenty doctors in a teaching hospital in the UK participated in semi-structured interviews about their experiences of antibiotic use and governance. NVivo10 software was used to conduct a thematic content analysis systematically.
Findings
This study identified three key themes regarding doctors' relationships with ID/CM clinicians that shaped their antibiotic practices: (1) competing hierarchical influences limiting active consultation with ID/CM; (2) non-ID/CM consultants' sense of ownership over clinical decision-making and concerns about challenges to clinical autonomy; and (3) tensions between evidence-based practice and experiential-style learning.
Conclusions
This study illustrates the importance of examining relations between ID/CM and non-ID/CM clinicians in the hospital context, indicating that AMS models that focus exclusively on delivering advice rather than managing interprofessional relationships may be limited in their capacity to optimize antibiotic use. AMS and, specifically, antibiotic approval systems would likely be more effective if they incorporated time and resources for fostering and maintaining professional relationships."

Background
Little is known about multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) outbreaks in long-term care facilities (LTCFs).
Aim
To describe an MDRP outbreak in an LTCF and to clarify risk factors for MDRP acquisition.
Methods
Patients who were positive for MDRP at an LTCF from January 2013 to January 2014 were analysed. A descriptive analysis, a case–control study, and a microbiological analysis were performed.
Findings
A total of 23 MDRP cases were identified, 16 of which were confirmed in sputum samples. Healthcare workers were observed violating hand hygiene procedures when performing oral, wound, and genital care. Nasogastric tube and oxygen mask use was associated with MDRP acquisition in the respiratory tract, which might have been confounded by poor hand hygiene. Sharing unhygienic devices, such as portable oral suction devices for oral care, and washing bottles and ointments for wound and genital care with inadequate disinfection could explain the transmission of MDRP in some cases. Isolates from 11 patients were found to be indistinguishable or closely related by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and harbouring the blaGES-5 gene. Subsequent enhanced infection control measures were supported by nearby hospitals and a local public health centre. No additional cases were identified for a year after the last case occurred in January 2014.
Conclusion
An outbreak of MDRP with an antimicrobial resistance gene, blaGES-5, occurred in a Japanese LTCF. It was successfully controlled by enhanced infection control measures, which neighbouring hospitals and a local public health centre supported."

Background
Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) and use of antimicrobials are prevalent in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), but few data are available on the burden of these issues in intellectual disability (ID) LTCFs.
Aim
To assess the prevalence of HCAIs and use of antimicrobials in Irish ID-LTCFs to plan future HCAI prevention programmes.
Methods
A national point prevalence survey was conducted in Irish ID-LTCFs in May 2013 using a European protocol. All Irish ID-LTCFs with full-time residents were invited to participate in this voluntary survey. Data were collected locally and analysed at the national coordinating centre.
Results
Twenty-four Irish ID-LTCFs participated, with 1060 residents surveyed, representing 42% of ID-LTCF residents in Ireland. The crude HCAI prevalence rate was 4.3% (median 2.2, range 0–46.7), with respiratory tract infections (1.6%) and skin infections (1.6%) being the most prevalent types. Antimicrobials were prescribed for 10% of eligible residents (median 7.5, range 3.2–13.9), with 49% of all prescriptions indicated for prophylaxis. Prevention of urinary tract infections (38%), respiratory tract infections (36%) and skin infections (27%) were the most common reasons for prophylaxis. There was considerable variation in the prevalence of prescribing for prophylaxis across ID-LTCFs (range 2–29%), with only 17% of facilities having local antimicrobial guidelines in place.
Conclusion
There is a considerable burden of HCAIs and use of antimicrobials, particularly for skin and respiratory tract infections, in Irish ID-LTCFs. Further surveillance in this population is needed to help guide preventive strategies for ID-LTCF residents at risk of these infections."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Following the resolution of an episode of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), the factors associated with acquisition of different C. difficile strain types in patients with recurrent infection or persistent colonization have not been evaluated.
Aim
To explore factors with potential correlation with acquisition of different C. difficile strain types in patients clinically cured of CDI through long-term follow-up across the continuum of care.
Methods
Polymerase chain reaction ribotyping was performed on C. difficile isolates recovered at baseline and follow-up (days 19–38) from stool samples of patients successfully treated for CDI, and those who had recurrence and/or colonization following symptom resolution. Chart review was conducted to determine factors associated with acquisition of a different C. difficile ribotype.
Findings
Of 25 patients initially cured of CDI, five had a recurrence and eight were colonized at follow-up. Patients did not differ with regard to age, sex, and whether the initial infection was with the BI/NAP1/027 strain. Ribotyping revealed that two out of five patients had recurrence attributed to a different strain type. Three of the colonized patients demonstrated strain switching compared with five patients who carried the same baseline strain. All patients (both infected and colonized) with different C. difficile ribotypes were exposed to the healthcare system. Exposure to antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors were not related to strain switching.
Conclusion
Exposure to healthcare, but not to antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors, was consistently associated with recurrence or colonization with a different C. difficile ribotype."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Investigation of several outbreaks of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection has demonstrated that contamination of the inanimate hospital environment could be implicated in the spread of these multidrug-resistant strains.
Aim
To investigate the occurrence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii on inanimate surfaces and possible dissemination in the hospital environment in Algeria as a potential source of infection in humans.
Methods
A. baumannii strains were isolated from the hospital environment and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using disc diffusion and E-test methods. Carbapenemase activity was detected using microbiological tests, including modified Hodge test, modified Carba NP test, and EDTA test. Carbapenem resistance determinants were studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Clonal relatedness was determined using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST).
Results
A total of 67 A. baumannii isolates were obtained from 868 environmental samples and identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Among them, 61 isolates were resistant to imipenem with minimum inhibitory concentration >32μg/mL and positive by the modified Hodge test and modified Carba NP test. In addition, the activity of carbapenemase was inhibited by EDTA in 32 strains. PCR and sequencing showed the presence of blaOXA-23 gene in 29 strains, and the blaNDM-1 gene in 32 isolates. MLST demonstrated the presence of five types of ST (ST19, ST2, ST85, ST98, and ST115).
Conclusion
Our study demonstrated the dissemination of carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii strains recovered from inanimate surfaces in a hospital environment, surrounding patients, healthcare workers and visitors, in Algeria as a potential source for nosocomial infection."

keywords = "Meticillin-resistant , Epidemiology, Algorithm, Surveillance",
abstract = "Summary
Background
In The Netherlands, efforts to control meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in hospitals have been largely successful due to stringent screening of patients on admission and isolation of those that fall into defined risk categories. However, Dutch hospitals are not free of MRSA, and a considerable number of cases are found that do not belong to any of the risk categories. Some of these may be due to undetected nosocomial transmission, whereas others may be introduced from unknown reservoirs.
Aim
Identifying multi-institutional clusters of MRSA isolates to estimate the contribution of potential unobserved reservoirs in The Netherlands.
Methods
We applied a clustering algorithm that combines time, place, and genetics to routine data available for all MRSA isolates submitted to the Dutch Staphylococcal Reference Laboratory between 2008 and 2011 in order to map the geo-temporal distribution of MRSA clonal lineages in The Netherlands.
Findings
Of the 2966 isolates lacking obvious risk factors, 579 were part of geo-temporal clusters, whereas 2387 were classified as MRSA of unknown origin (MUOs). We also observed marked differences in the proportion of isolates that belonged to geo-temporal clusters between specific multi-locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) clonal complexes, indicating lineage-specific transmissibility. The majority of clustered isolates (74%) were present in multi-institutional clusters.
Conclusion
The frequency of MRSA of unknown origin among patients lacking obvious risk factors is an indication of a largely undefined extra-institutional but genetically highly diverse reservoir. Efforts to understand the emergence and spread of high-risk clones require the pooling of routine epidemiological information and typing data into central databases."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In Italy, infections with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) have increased markedly since 2009, creating unprecedented problems in healthcare settings and limiting treatment options for infected patients.
Aim
To assess the attributable mortality due to CRKP in ten Italian hospitals and to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with an invasive CRKP and carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae (CSKP) infection.
Methods
We conducted a matched cohort study, and calculated crude and attributable mortality for CRKP. The attributable mortality was calculated by subtracting the crude mortality rate of the patients with CSKP from the crude mortality rate of the patients with CRKP. We also described the clinical characteristics of CRKP and CSKP patients and analysed the determinants of mortality by using conditional Poisson regression.
Findings
The study included 98 patients, 49 with CRKP and 49 with CSKP. CRKP patients had undergone more invasive procedures and also tended to have more serious conditions, measured by higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score II. The attributable mortality of CRKP at 30 days was 41%. CRKP patients were three times more likely to die within 30 days [matched incidence rate ratio (mIRR): 3.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5–6.1]. Adjusting for potential confounders, the risk remained the same (adjusted mIRR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.3–7.1).
Conclusion
CRKP infection had a marked effect on patient mortality, even after adjusting for other patient characteristics. To control the spread of CRKP we recommend prioritization of control measures in hospitals where CRKP is found."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Routine surveillance in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) showed an increased detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli) in August 2012, following nearly a year without detection.
Aim
To describe the investigation and interventions by a hospital infection control team of an outbreak of ESBL-E. coli in a NICU.
Methods
Six neonates with positive cultures of ESBL-E. coli (five with respiratory colonization, one with a urinary tract infection), control infants who were negative for ESBL-E. coli during the study period, and mothers who donated their breast milk were included. A case–control study was performed to identify possible risk factors for positive ESBL-E. coli cultures and molecular typing of isolated strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
Findings
The odds ratio for ESBL-E. coli infection after receiving shared unpasteurized breast milk during the study period was 49.17 (95% confidence interval: 6.02–354.68; P < 0.05). The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern showed that all strains were identical, and the same pathogen was detected in freshly expressed milk of a particular donor. After ceasing the breast milk sharing, the outbreak was successfully terminated.
Conclusion
This outbreak indicates that contamination of milk packs can result in transmission of a drug-resistant pathogen to newborn infants. Providers of human breast milk need to be aware of the necessity for low-temperature pasteurization and bacterial cultures, which should be conducted before and after freezing, before prescribing to infants."
