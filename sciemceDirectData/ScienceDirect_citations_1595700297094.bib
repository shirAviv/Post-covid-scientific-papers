abstract = "Background
Diabetes is among the most prevalent diseases worldwide, of all the affected individuals a significant proportion of the population remains undiagnosed due to lack of specific symptoms early in this disorder and inadequate diagnostics. Diabetes and its associated sequela, i.e., comorbidity are associated with microvascular and macrovascular complications. As diabetes is characterized by an altered metabolism of key metabolites and regulatory pathways. Metabolic phenotyping can provide us with a better understanding of the unique set of regulatory perturbations that predispose to diabetes and its associated complication/comorbidities.
Methodology
The present study utilizes the analytical platform NMR spectroscopy coupled with Random Forest statistical analysis to identify the discriminatory metabolites in diabetes (DB = 38) vs. diabetes-related complication (DC = 35) along with the healthy control (HC = 50) subjects. A combined and pairwise analysis was performed to identify the discriminatory metabolites responsible for class separation. The perturbed metabolites were further rigorously validated using t-test, AUROC analysis to examine the statistical significance of the identified metabolites.
Results
The DB and DC patients were well discriminated from HC. However, 15 metabolites were found to be significantly perturbed in DC patients compared to DB, the identified panel of metabolites are TCA cycle (succinate, citrate), methylamine metabolism (trimethylamine, methylamine, betaine), -intermediates; energy metabolites (glucose, lactate, pyruvate); and amino acids (valine, arginine, glutamate, methionine, proline, and threonine).
Conclusion
The 1H NMR metabolomics may prove a promising technique to differentiate and predict diabetes and its complication on their onset or progression by determining the altered levels of the metabolites in serum."

Subclinical inflammation and presence of almost all indicators of systemic inflammation are found in type 2 diabetic patients. Such a systemic and subclinical inflammatory process can be characterized by elevated circulating levels of inflammatory markers.
Aim
To study the state of subclinical inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and establish a correlation between glycemic control and inflammatory markers.
Methods
This research included 90 subjects divided into 2 groups; Group A: 70 patients with type 2 diabetes and Group B: 20 Age and sex matched people as the control group. All patients were clinically examined, had laboratory investigations including; fasting and 2 h postprandial blood sugar, HbA1c, serum ferritin., high sensitivity C-reactive protein hs-CRP, kidney functions tests, liver function tests, complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and antinuclear antibody.
Results
The estimated levels of ESR, FBS, serum ferritin, hs-CRP and HbA1c in T2DM were 10.69 ± 3.05, 186.01 ± 92.21, 6005.2 ± 2639.83, 155.75 ± 73.95, 7.5 ± 3.23, respectively.

We aimed to compare C-peptide levels & measures of insulin resistance in non-lean & non-obese Asian Indian patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) vs. non-lean, non-diabetic controls and to correlate with anthropometric measures, volumes of abdominal adipose tissue depots, pancreas, & liver span.
Methods
Non-lean, non-obese (BMI >19 and < 25 kg/m2) Asian Indian patients with T2DM, (cases n, 87), diagnosed within one year, on metformin mono therapy, were compared to BMI-matched non-diabetic subjects (controls, n, 37). Measures of glycaemia, insulin and C-peptide levels (fasting and post-prandial), lipid profile, and hepatic transaminases were analysed. Abdominal adipose tissue volumes [subcutaneous & intra-abdominal], pancreatic volume and liver span were assessed using 1.5 Tesla MRI scan.
Results
In cases, the mean values of HbA1c, fasting and post prandial insulin and C-peptide levels, and 3 measures of insulin resistance were significantly higher than controls, but not for HOMA-B. Higher fasting C-peptide levels correlated significantly with HOMA-IR (r = 0.42, p < 0.001), Fasting Insulin Resistance Index (r = 0.42, p < 0.001), Bennett's Index (r = 0.38, p < 0.05), and volumes of SCAT and IAAT only in cases.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of elevated glycated LDL (low-density lipoprotein) in the progression of diabetic kidney disease among type 2 diabetes (T2D) subjects.
Materials and methods
This case-control observational study is a part of Saudi Diabetes Kidney Disease (SAUDI-DKD) study conducted during the period from April 2014 to June 2015. This study cohort is divided into two groups; the first group was T2D patients without diabetic nephropathy (DN) (n = 24) and the second group was T2D with DN (n = 45). Serum glycated LDL levels were determined by ELISA. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed, and the diagnostic accuracy was assessed using the area under the ROC curve.
Results
There was a threefold increase of serum glycated LDL level among diabetic subjects when compared with non-diabetic subjects and this level progressively increased with the progression of DN. The glycated LDL was found to have a significant diagnostic accuracy with AUC of 0.685 and 0.775 for cases with microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria respectively.

Several population-based studies found the associations between body mass index and thyroid function within the normal range. Furthermore, these thyroid functions are related with insulin resistance and plasma glucose levels. This study aimed to investigate the associations between thyroid functions and metabolic parameters in Thai euthyroid population.
Methods
Participants from the Thai National Thai Health Examination Survey were randomly measured for TSH, FT4, anti-thyroperoxidase, and anti-thyroglobulin. Euthyroidism was defined by TSH 0.27–4.20 mIU/L and FT4 0.93–1.71 ng/dL.
Results
A total of 2242 euthyroid participants were included. Fifty-one percent were female. Mean age, fasting plasma glucose, and body mass index were 55 ± 21 years, 93 ± 29 mg/dL, and 23.4 ± 4.6 kg/m2, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis after age and sex adjustment showed a negative association of serum FT4 with body mass index (β = −0.070, p = 0.001) and the relationship was still significant after subjects with positive anti-thyroperoxidase were excluded (β = −0.068, p = 0.003).

Data on prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among US adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are limited. The aim of this study was to provide such estimates for T2D, both overall and in those with CVD.
Materials and methods
Using the NHANES 2007–2014 data, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of an adult sample with diagnosed and undiagnosed T2D, aged ≥18 years. CVD was defined based on self-reported personal interview data on a broad range of health conditions—congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina, stroke, or heart attack. T2D was defined as diagnosed T2D (self-reported provider diagnosis) and undiagnosed T2D (FPG ≥126 mg/dL or HbA1c ≥ 6.5% without self-reported diagnosis). Participants who started insulin within a year of T2D diagnosis, or were pregnant at the time of health examination were excluded. Appropriate sample weights were used to provide a national estimate.
Results
The prevalence of moderate to severe renal impairment based on eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 among T2D was 18.0%. The prevalence of mild renal impairment was 36.9%: 28.3% with UACR<30 mg/g, 7.0% with UACR ≥30–300 mg/g and 1.6% with UACR >300 mg/g. For T2D and CVD subgroup, the prevalence was 33.6% for moderate to severe renal impairment and 42.8% for mild renal impairment.
Conclusions
This study confirms the high prevalence of CKD in patients with multiple comorbidities: T2D and CVD. It also provides estimates of the prevalence of CKD categories based on KDIGO 2012 classification for US adults with T2D."

Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) as the residual lipid plays a crucial role in cardiovascular complications and type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of OxLDL with the conventional risk markers and to find the association of OxLDL with the risk of development of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged (30–50 years) Asian Indians.
Materials and methods
A total of 78 type 2 diabetes patients and 78 age-matched controls were recruited. The serum OxLDL concentration was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Other anthropometric and biochemical measures were also carried out. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association of OxLDL and OxLDL to non-oxidized lipoproteins with the occurrence of type 2 diabetes.
Results
OxLDL was significantly higher in type 2 diabetes cases than controls (p < 0.001) even though there was no significant difference in LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) between type 2 diabetes patients and controls. OxLDL correlated significantly with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). OxLDL did not show any significant correlation with LDL-c. Multiple logistic regression showed a significant association of OxLDL, OxLDL/LDL-c and OxLDL/HDL-c with type 2 diabetes (p < 0.001). LDL-c showed no association with type 2 diabetes. ROC-AUC curve analyses showed OxLDL/HDL-c to have highest discriminatory power for type 2 diabetes (AUC: 0.710 with 95% CI: 0.629–0.791, p < 0.001).

Waist circumference (WC) is an indicator of adiposity; particularly visceral fat, cardiometabolic risk factors and related morbidity. The aim of this study was to determine the attribution of WC to increased carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and circulating levels of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in schoolchildren.
Methods
A total of 122 children (61 boys and 61 girls) aged 10–15 years were distributed into three groups: (i) the lower smoothed sex- and age-specific WC (LWC) group (ii) the middle smoothed sex- and age-specific WC (MWC) group, and (iii) the higher smoothed sex- and age-specific WC (HWC) group. Measurements of cIMT using high-resolution B-mode ultrasound, lipemic profile, blood pressure, serum proinflammatory cytokines and soluble adhesion molecules were performed.
Results
Mean measured values in the HWC and/or MWC groups showed significantly higher values (p ≤ 0.05) of cIMT (mm), total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), blood pressure, interlukien-6 (IL-6), and interlukien-1 beta (IL-1β), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) and E-selectin, and significantly lower values of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) as compared to the LWC group. Using multiple linear regression analysis of WC-SDS adjusted for BMI-SDS with the studied subclinical atherosclerosis risk, WC-SDS was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) associated with the variation in HDL (R2 = −0.12), LDL (R2 = 0.36), IL-6 (R2 = 0.26), and VCAM-1 (R2 = 0.26).
Conclusions
Higher WC is positively associated with atherosclerosis risk factors including increased cIMT, a state of dyslipidemia, higher blood pressure and circulating levels of inflammation and adhesion molecules among schoolchildren. Waist circumference seems to be useful for the prediction of subclinical atherosclerosis in schoolchildren."

Fasting during Ramadan for some individuals with diabetes may lead to complications. Pharmacists may assist in dose adjustment and compliance with medication during Ramadan. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of Sudanese community pharmacists in the management of diabetes during Ramadan.
Method
A cross-sectional study from April to June 2017, included 330 pharmacies in Khartoum state. The sampling technique was done by two methods using stratified and systematic methods for seven localities of Khartoum State. The community pharmacists were assessed in their knowledge about Medication regimen adjustment (MRA), diabetes risk stratification and the condition in which the fasting diabetic patient have to stop their fast.
Results
The total response rate was 311(94.2%), and the females were 203(65.3%). Pharmacists mean age was 27.6 (SD = 5.9), ranged between 21-62 years. Importantly, more than 75% of the Pharmacists have sufficient knowledge of both identifying high-risk individuals and whether they need to break their fasting. The practice questions answered correctly by more than 80% of pharmacists in relation to monitor blood glucose level, undergo meal planning to avoid hypoglycemia and dehydration during prolong fasting hours and to undergo meal choices to avoid postprandial hyperglycemia. Importantly, 56.9% community pharmacists advised individuals with diabetes about physical activity. The barriers that hindering the proper counseling was attributed to the Lack of knowledge (71.4%). MRA was reported as highly important by (56.6%) and extremely important by (39.2%). The confidence of knowledge about MRA was reported by 52.1%.
Conclusion
This study showed that pharmacists had sufficient knowledge, positive attitude and good practice about diabetes management during Ramadan."

The rate of diabetes mellitus is increasing globally as a result of increased levels of blood glucose. The elevated blood glucose level results due to impairment in the production and action of insulin. An increase in glycated hemoglobin is associated with higher blood glucose levels that further results in nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the study has investigated the correlation between HbA1c and creatinine levels among diabetic patients, suffering from foot ulcerations.
Methods
A prospective cohort hospital based-study has retrieved hospital records of patients during January 2009 and February 2015. A total of 192 patients, admitted in the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Diabetes and Endocrinology, of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India were recruited.
Results
It has been examined that there is a positive correlation between ulcer duration and BMI, amputation rate and BMI, gender and BMI, hospital stay and BMI, HbA1c and BMI, Hb and BMI and triglyceride and BMI at 5% level of significance.

Sirtuins regulate energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity through their ability to act as energy sensors and regulators in several metabolic tissues.
Aim
To evaluate the expression levels of sirtuin genes SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3 and SIRT6 and their target genes (PPAR-α, PGC1-α, NRF1, DGAT1, PPAR-γ and FOXO3a) in subcutaneous adipose tissue collected from individuals with normoweight, overweight and obesity.
Methods
Adipose tissue samples, obtained by lipoaspiration during liposuction surgery, were processed to obtain RNA, which was reverse-transcribed to cDNA. Then, we measured the expression levels of each gene by qPCR.
Results
We found differences in the mRNA expression of SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3 and SIRT6 and their target genes (PPAR-α, PGC1-α, NRF1, DGAT1, PPAR-γ and FOXO3a) in adipose tissue from overweight or obese subjects when compared to normoweight subjects. All genes analyzed, except SIRT2, showed correlation with BMI.
Conclusions
Our findings in human subcutaneous adipose tissue show that increased body mass index modifies the expression of genes encoding sirtuins and their target genes, which are metabolic regulators of adipose tissue. Therefore, these could be used as biomarkers to predict the ability of adipose tissue to gain mass of adipose tissue."

Small for gestational age (SGA) is associated with increased rates of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Adiponectin secreted from adipose tissue is implicated in the etiology of death and illness during infancy. SGA is also a likely risk factor for the development of metabolic and clinical complications in adulthood. The present study was performed to determine whether SGA neonates and healthy controls show differences in blood adiponectin concentration at birth.
Methods
Databases were searched to identify English-language studies providing the numbers of SGA neonates, the numbers of healthy controls, and the means and standard deviations (SDs) of blood adiponectin concentrations at birth in both groups. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS). A meta-analysis was performed to summarize the standardized mean differences (SMDs) in blood adiponectin concentration between SGA neonates and healthy controls.
Results
The results summarized from five good quality (i.e., NOS score ≥ 5) studies involving 253 neonates showed that blood adiponectin concentration was significantly lower in SGA neonates than in healthy controls (P = 0.016), and the effect was moderate (i.e., SMD = 0.4–0.7).

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a serious microvascular complication of a longstanding hyperglycemia. This study aims to evaluate whether urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and urinary Interleukin-18 possess a better diagnostic value than albumin creatinine ratio in assessing the severity of nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Material & methods
Ninety participants diagnosed with T2DM were recruited and they were divided into three study groups according to their albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR): (Normoalbuminuria group, Microalbuminuria group, and Macroalbuminuria group). A matching of Ninety healthy subjects were included as controls. Blood and urine samples were collected to measure various markers of glycemic control and kidney function.
Results
IL-18 levels were not changed significantly between all study groups (P > 0.05), despite a significant positive correlation between IL-18 and urinary albumin levels. NGAL levels were significantly increased in Microalbuminuria group and Macroalbuminuria group as compared to the control and Normoalbuminuria groups. NGAL was also positively correlated with urinary albumin and ACR, but negatively correlated with the age and body mass index. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves revealed that for early detection of DN, the best cutoff values to discriminate DN and diabetic without nephropathy groups were ˃ 21.4 ng/ml for NGAL (94.67 sensitivity, 26.67% specificity), ≤0.34 pg/mL for IL-18 (72% sensitivity, 53.33% specificity), and ˃29.8 mg/g for ACR (80% sensitivity, 100% specificity).
Conclusion
We conclude that the urinary ACR is a more accurate individual biomarker of DN when compared to both NGAL and IL-18."

MSP1A and MSP1B polymorphic sites located in the GH genomic area have been found associated with GH response to insulin stimulation, with familiar short stature and with age at onset of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). These observations prompted us to search for a possible relationship between stature and age at onset of the disease.
Methods
We have reexamined the data of 272 subjects with T2D mellitus.
Results
There is a highly significant negative correlation between stature and age at onset in non obese females (p < 0.001) but not in obese females and in males. In non obese females with stature within the first quartile the mean age at onset is 62 years while in those with a stature greater than the first quartlile the mean age at onset is 52 yesrs (p < 0.001). No difference is observed in obese females and males.
Conclusions
These observations suggest the existence of different mechanisms underlying susceptibility to T2D. In addition to the well known increased risk due to obesity, endocrine dysfunctions related to genetic variability within the GH genomic area could represent another mechanism operating in non obese females. A cluster of non obese women characterized by short stature and late onset of diabetes seems to be separated by this mechanism from other women."

Meta-analysis is useful for combining the results of different studies statistically to confirm genuine associations in genetics. Based on earlier reports, we aimed to investigate the association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) genetic variants identified in a previous meta-analysis in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in an Indian woman.
Material and methods
In this study, 137 pregnant women with GDM and 150 pregnant women were selected on the basis of their serum glucose levels. The six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of different genes studied had known involvement in pancreatic β-cell function, particular pathways linked to T2DM, and other biological functions. Genomic DNA was isolated from the 287 women for polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses.
Results
The rs7903146, rs13266634, rs2283228, rs5210 and rs179881 SNPs were found to be positively associated with GDM when calculated for genotype and allele frequencies (p < 0.05), but rs680 (ApaI) variant did not show statistically significant association (p = 0.31). The rs7903146, rs2283228, rs5210 and rs680 variants showed a strong association with oral glucose tolerance test values.
Conclusion
The SNPs studied in this GDM had the same role as those identified in a previous T2DM meta-analysis, and showed positive association in the Indian women. Meta-analyses should be implemented to assess the IGF2 gene in GDM subjects."

Specifically, normoalbuminuric chronic kidney disease (NA-CKD), which is characterized by a decline in the glomerular filtration rate in the absence of a preceding or accompanying elevation of albuminuria, has become a widely prevalent variant of renal impairment in diabetes. Diabetic women and nonsmoking individuals with better glycemic control have a better chance of preserving normoalbuminuria, even in the case of declining renal function. The wide use of renin-angiotensin system blockers, advances in antihyperglycemic, antihypertensive, and hypolipidemic therapy, and smoking cessation are suspected to be responsible for an increasing proportion of NA-CKD among diabetic subjects with renal impairment. Significant differences in the sets of risk factors, renal morphology, comorbidity, and outcomes were found between the albuminuric and normoalbuminuric CKD patterns. NA-CKD, even if a more favorable option in terms of the risk of end-stage renal disease, is clearly associated with cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. The presence of NA-CKD in patients with diabetes increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. The study of the molecular pathways, clinical course, and outcomes of NA-CKD in diabetic subjects and the search for more specific diagnostic and treatment options are challenges for future research."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide that requires a person with diabetes to make a multitude of daily self-management decisions. This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-management program based on PRECEDE-PROCEDE model on self-management behaviors in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods
This experimental study was conducted on 86 diabetic patients referred to the diabetes clinics in Ardabil, Iran, in 2017. From a total of 326 patients with diabetes medical records in those clinics, 86 (26.3%) patients agreed to participate in this study. They were then randomly divided into two groups; intervention (n = 43) and control (n = 43). The intervention group received eight sessions of PRECEDE model-based self-management education program while the control group did not receive any education program. Both groups were assessed at baseline and six months after the intervention.
Results
The mean age of the participants was 55.69 ± 12.04 years (range 32–86 years). 41 patients were men, and 45 were women. The mean time since the first diagnosis of diabetes was 8.6 years (SD = 5.2), and the mean BMI of the patients was 31.63 (SD = 4.20). At baseline, 35.01% of patients had poor self-management behaviors. All PRECEDE variables, including predisposing factors (knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy), enabling factors, and reinforcing factors, as well as self-management behaviors, were significantly improved in those of intervention group after the education program.

In type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroiditis, there seems to be common genetic loci. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether patients with type 1 diabetes had increased prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis, and which factors were influencing the co-existence of these two clinical entities.
Patients and methods
A cohort of 256 patients, 18–79 years of age, a median duration of diabetes of 20 years and a mean follow-up duration of 13 years were included in the study.
Results
Of the 256 patients with type 1 diabetes, 150 participants (58.6%) were women and 106 (41.4%) were men. One hundred and fifty-nine patients (64.6%) did not have autoimmune thyroiditis, whereas 97 (35.4%) had autoimmune thyroiditis, as was documented by the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies (anti-TPO and/or anti-TG). Of the 97 patients with both diabetes type 1 and autoimmune thyroiditis, 64 (66%) were women and 33 (34%) were men. Among the 97 patients who had both diabetes type 1 and autoimmune thyroiditis, 87 had abnormal levels of both anti-TPO and anti-TG, while 7 patients had subnormal levels of solely anti-TPO and only 3 patients had abnormal levels of only anti-TG.
Conclusions
There was a slightly higher prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis among our patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Also, female sex was predominant, when compared to male sex, among the adult participants of this study. Therefore, regular screening of thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies may be suggested for all patients with type 1 diabetes."

To evaluate the association between high triglyceride/HDL-cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio and insulin resistance (IR) or hyperinsulinemia after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in normal-weight healthy adults.
Methods
We carried out an analytical cross-sectional study in euthyroid non-diabetic adults, who attended the outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru from 2012 to 2016. Participants were divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of high TG/HDL-C ratio, IR or hyperinsulinemia after OGTT. TG/HDL-C ratio values ≥ 3 were considered as high. IR was defined as a Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) value ≥ 2.28 and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT as a serum insulin value ≥ 80μU/mL after 120 min of 75-g glucose intake. We elaborated crude and adjusted Poisson generalized linear models to evaluate the association between high TG/HDL-C ratio and IR or hyperinsulinemia after OGTT and reported the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
We analyzed the data of 118 individuals. Prevalence of high TG/HDL-C ratio was 17.8% (n = 21) while the prevalence of IR and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT was 24.6% (n = 29) and 17.0% (n = 20), respectively. TG/HDL-C-ratio values were positively correlated with HOMA-IR (r = 0.498; p < 0.01) and serum insulin after OGTT (r = 0.326; p < 0.001). In the adjusted model, high TG/HDL-C ratio was associated with both IR (aPR = 3.16; 95%CI: 1.80–5.77) and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT (aPR = 2.36; 95%CI: 1.20–4.63).
Conclusions
High TG/HDL-C ratio was associated with both IR markers used in our study, appearing to be a clinically useful tool to assess IR in euthyroid normal-weight adults without type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose level is above the normal but below the diagnostic value of diabetes mellitus. Besides progression to diabetes mellitus, prediabetic subjects are at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation and therefore this research was conducted with the aim to evaluate the risk of cardiovascular disease in prediabetic subjects by measuring the markers of oxidative stress and inflammation and their possible correlation with glucose intolerance.
Materials and methods
A total of 400 human subjects were recruited for the present cross-sectional study. Of them, 200 were prediabetic subjects and 200 were age and gender-matched control subjects. Blood samples were collected from all participants and analyzed for 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG), malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).
Results
The markers of oxidative stress i.e. 8-OHdG and MDA were found to be significantly increased in prediabetic subjects as compared to control subjects except GSH, which was significantly reduced in prediabetic subjects. Similarly, hs-CRP (a marker of inflammation) was significantly increased in prediabetic subjects compared to controls. On correlation analysis, 8-OHdG, MDA and hs-CRP were significantly and positively correlated with glucose intolerance in prediabetes whereas GSH showed significant negative correlation with glucose intolerance.
Conclusion
In conclusion, markers of oxidative stress and inflammation should be taken into consideration while evaluating the risk for CVD in prediabetes since these markers were well correlated with glucose intolerance in prediabetic subjects."

Insulin resistance (IR) and abnormal lipid profiles are the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in obesity. To clarify the relationship of the changes in insulin resistance, body weight and lipid profile, the present study was performed on Bangladeshi adults, total of 1500 individuals at the time of their general health examination in the hospital.
Methods
After exclusion of other endocrine diseases, the remaining 772 patients were classified as IR ≥ 2 and IR < 2 based on the homeostatic model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. The endocrine disease free subjects were further clustered based on age, gender and obesity. The anthropometric and biochemical profiles were statistically analyzed and correlated with IR ≥ 2 and IR<2 groups as well as other clusters of the subjects. Apart from some disparities, notable differences were observed in all anthropometric data.
Results
Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and serum insulin levels were significantly higher in IR ≥ 2 group in comparison with IR<2 group. Obesity and dyslipidemia were associated as prevalent components of IR. Generalized linear model revealed that TC: LDL and TG: HDL had significant effect on IR. Age group II (41–60 years old) subjects had significantly higher lipid profile compared to age group I (20–40 years old) and age group III (61–80 years old).
Conclusions
Results reported herein support the notion that lipoprotein ratios might be the reliable biomarkers to evaluate IR."

No studies have examined the contribution of major dietary patterns to MUH phenotypes in obese and overweight people based on Karelis criteria. This study was conducted to evaluate the association of major dietary patterns with MUHOW/O and MHOW/O phenotypes.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 290 overweight and obese women aged 18–50 (BMI≥25 kg/m2). Anthropometric measurements were assessed in all participants. The MH phenotype was defined according to the Karelis criteria. Major dietary patterns were determined using factor analysis of 21 foods groups using a valid and reliable FFQ containing 147 items. Participants' body composition was assessed by BIA. Serum HDL, LDL, TG, insulin, and hs-CRP levels were quantified by ELISA.
Results
By the use of factor analysis, 3 major dietary patterns were extracted: healthy dietary pattern (HDP), western dietary pattern (WDP) and unhealthy dietary pattern (UNHDP). Binary logistic analysis showed that participants in the in the upper category of WDP had greater odds of MUH phenotype (OR = 2.33, 95%CI = 1.11–4.91, P = 0.02), after confounder factor control. Individuals with high adherence to the UNHDP score had high odds of MUH phenotype (OR = 1.75, 95%CI = 0.98–3.10, P = 0.05), after adjustment for BMI, age, and total EI, compared to those with low adherence. A positive relation was observed between WDP and levels of hs-CRP, HOMA-IR (OR = 1.94, 95%CI = 0.91–4.10, P = 0.05 and OR = 2.53, 95%CI = 1.26–5.11, P = 0.009) as well as a positive association between UHDP and plasma level of LDL (OR = 1.90, 95%CI = 1.04–3.47, P = 0.03), but an inverse association between HDP and hs-CRP level (OR = 0.56, 95%CI = 0.29–0.92, P = 0.03).

Results
There was no difference in age, weight, and BMI between the two groups. The incidence of macrosomia, shoulder dystocia and stillbirth were similar in the two groups while that of pre-term labour, pre-eclampsia, Caesarean section (CS), large for gestational age (LGA), neonatal ICU (NICU) admission and neonatal hypoglycaemia were significantly higher in the T1DM than in the control group. From a multivariate regression analysis, excessive gestational weight gain was associated with increased risk of LGA (OR 4.53; 95% CI [1.42–14.25]). Last trimester HBA1c was associated with increased risk for macrosomia [OR 2.46, 95% CI [1.03–5.86)]; LGA [ OR 3.25, 95% CI [1.65–6.40)]; increased risk for C-section (OR 1.96, 95% CI [1.12–3.45]), and increased risk of NICU admission (OR 2.46, 95% CI [1.04–5.86]).

Contemporary studies examine the connection of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) with Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), alone or associated with other factors of the metabolic syndrome. However, little research has occurred concerning patients with diabetes of both genders and sexes without other diseases of the lower urinary tract. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between DM and LUTS.
Methods
The study enrolled 110 patients with DM and 134 healthy individuals. The IPSS questionnaire was used for the evaluation of symptoms from lower urinary tract. Data was analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression using SPSS v.24.
Results
Analysis with moderate/severe LUTS as dependent variable and plausible confounding factors (age group, BMI, hypertension, dyslipidemia, years with DM and reported HbA1c) as covariates revealed that only HbA1c levels correlated independently with the presence of moderate/severe LUTS (p = 0,024, OR:2,729, CI:1,144–6,509) in diabetic women, while there was no statistically significant difference between male groups. HbA1c levels' correlation with IPSS-voiding and IPSS- storage score was not statistically significant. Quality of life is also affected in women with diabetes mellitus (p: 0,02).

Prediabetes is a chronic low-grade inflammatory disease and considered as a risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a leukocyte-derived enzyme, linked to both oxidative stress and inflammation and has been proposed as a possible mediator of atherosclerosis, the major cause of cardiovascular disease. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the level of MPO in prediabetic subjects and correlate it with other cardiovascular disease risk factors.
Materials and methods
In this cross-sectional study, a total of 400 subjects were recruited. Of them, 200 were prediabetic subjects and 200 were age and gender-matched controls. For each subject, blood pressure, weight, height, waist circumference, hip circumference and lipid parameters were measured. In addition, MPO was determined.
Results
MPO was significantly increased in prediabetic subjects as compared to controls. In correlation analysis, MPO was found to be significantly and positively correlated with all the cardiovascular disease risk factors i.e. age, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), blood pressure [both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)], lipid parameters except high density lipoprotein (HDL) to which it was negatively correlated.
Conclusion
In conclusion, MPO is well correlated with cardiovascular disease risk factors in prediabetes. Hence, MPO could be used to detect cardiovascular risk among prediabetic subjects and also can be used as an early biomarker of oxidative stress and inflammation in prediabetes."

abstract = "Introduction
An inadequate glycemic control in cardiovascular postoperative is a predictor of mortality, postoperative infections and a prolonged hospital stay. This study evaluates the incidence of hypoglycemia in the first 72 h of postoperative and its association with different factors, such as tissue perfusion parameters, and the administration of medicines that induct hypoglycemia during surgery, in patients that undergo cardiovascular surgery in a 4th level hospital in Bogota, Colombia.
Methods and materials
A nested cases and controls study was developed, taking as cases the patients that presented hypoglycemia episodes (<70 mg/dl) and the controls were the patients without this outcome. A systematic record of the glycemic control in the first 72 h of postoperative was registered. An univariate and multivariate analysis was conducted to determine the factor associated with hypoglycemia.
Results
327 patients were evaluated (35% with coronary bypass and 27% with valvular replacement). 7.65% of the patients presented at least one episode of hypoglycemia <70 mg/dL (25 episodes). The multivariate analysis showed an association with chronic kidney failure in dialysis (OR6,21; IC:0,97–43.27,p:0.05), administration of preoperative steroids (OR4,41; IC:1,27-15,20,p:0.02), intraoperative insulin (OR2,61; IC:1.09–6,22, p:0.03), and postoperative hydrocortisone (OR 7,15; IC 1,46-34,9 p:0.01).
Conclusions
Hypoglycemia is frequent in patients that undergo a cardiovascular surgery. The associated factors were chronic kidney failure in dialysis, administration of preoperative steroids, intraoperative insulin and hydrocortisone during postoperative. Other factors such as tissue perfusion, administration of vasoactive or beta blockers substances, showed no association with hypoglycemia."

To evaluate the association between vitamin D deficiency and insulin resistance (IR) or hyperinsulinemia after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in euthyroid non-diabetic individuals.
Materials and methods
We carried out an analytical cross-sectional study in euthyroid non-diabetic adults of both sexes, who attended the outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru during the 2012–2016 period. Participants were categorized in two groups according to their serum vitamin D levels: normal vitamin D levels (serum vitamin D values ≥ 20 ng/dL) and vitamin D deficiency (serum vitamin D values < 20 ng/dL). IR was defined as a Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) value ≥ 3.8 and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT was defined as a serum insulin value ≥ 80μU/mL after 120 min of 75-g glucose intake. We elaborated crude and adjusted Poisson regression models to assess the association between serum vitamin D levels and IR or hyperinsulinemia after OGTT. The reported association measure was the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
We analyzed 204 participants, the average age was 38.5 ± 10.6 (SD) years, 40 (19.6%) were males and the vitamin D median was 25.0 (IQR: 19.0–33.3) ng/dL. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, IR and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT was 29.4% (n = 60), 29.9% (n = 61) and 25.0% (n = 51). In the adjusted Poisson regression models, the prevalence of hyperinsulinemia after OGTT was higher among the vitamin D deficient group (aPR=1.75; 95%CI: 1.06–2.90); however, we did not find statistically significant association between vitamin D deficiency and IR (aPR=0.99; 95%CI: 0.61–1.63).
Conclusions
We found an association between vitamin D deficiency and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT in euthyroid people with no T2DM.Our findings are consistent with previous reports; providing evidence that serum vitamin D deficiency could be an IR marker."

Egyptian Christians account for about 10%–15% of the population; the largest absolute number in the Middle East and North Africa. The Lent period is one of the three principal fasting periods which is less documented in the scientific literature.
Objectives
To evaluate the effect of Lenten fasting on anthropometric measures, biochemical and glycemic parameters in Christian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Methods
A prospective study, which was carried out in Assiut university hospital clinics of internal medicine during the period between February and May 2018 on 125 Christian patients with type 2 diabetes who fasted the Lent. The study was carried out in 3 phases.A semi-structured questionnaire was used to assess the risk category of fasting. Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation.
Results
Fasting blood glucose decreased significantly during, and after the fast.The number of patients with fasting blood glucose <8 mmol/L increased during fasting from 24.8% to 32.0%.Hypoglycemia during fasting occurred in 12.8% of patients. Hyperglycemia and dehydration were the main causes of breaking the fast.Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased during and after the fast. There was no significant change in high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Body weight of patients did not significantly change during fasting.
Conclusion
The Lenten fasting affected different biochemical parameters of fasting diabetic patients. The variations in the amount and type of diets of fasting patients caused variations in the results among patients of the study and between this study and the other studies."

Subjects and methods
In this case control study, Serum levels of CTRP3, HbA1c, Lipid profile, glucose and insulin levels were determined in 75 obese and 68 normal body weight individuals.
Results
In obese young adults CTRP3 concentrations were decreased compared to normal body weight young adults (NBW). The association between reduction of CTRP3 concentrations and the presence of diabetes is statistically significant. CTRP3 showed significant negative correlation with BMI, HOMA-IR and triglycerides as well as positive correlations with HDL – cholesterol while there is no association between CTRP3 and BMI within the NBW group. Higher HbA1C, HOMA-IR, and risk of diabetes development within obese subjects were related to lower CTRP3 concentration.
Conclusions
This study shows that reduction of CTRP3 concentrations is likely to bring a concomitant increase in risk of diabetes in obese and normal body weight young adults. Decrease in CTRP3 concentration may have an essential role in the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders concomitant to obesity."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global epidemic. However, T2DM is not a new, 21stcentury disease. Different populations have been struggling with this disease across a number of centuries. The question lies as to why humanity has never succeeded in keeping it in check over the course of its history.
Materials and methods
In this review, the history of T2DM and its evolution throughout the ages are revisited. The review then investigates the growing burden of T2DM across the past fourteen years within the European continent, while comparing this epidemic with the obesity burden.
Results
Various explanations for the emergence of this public health epidemic were explored ranging from lifestyle factors, high sugary food and drink, disrupted sleep pattern to obesity. Over a fourteen-year period, an evident steady incline in both T2DM and obesity prevalence rates across Europe was evident.
Conclusion
It is essential for public health officials and researchers alike to have a good grip of the past and the present diabetes epidemiology and its co-determinants. This will provide the basis for new and improved strategies to target and prevent this epidemic."

to investigate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its associated factors in adult population in Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (PE-Brazil).
Methods
A cross-sectional study was performed on a representative sample (N = 375) of adult residents of the region, aged 24–59 years, were harmonized according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria.
Results
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 45 (12%) and, the age was associated with MetS, which increases the chances to MetS development around 3% respectively (OR: 1.03; CI 95%: 1.002–1.070 P 0.0384). Waist circumference was elevated in female population 266 (70.74%), however, levels of fasting blood glucose (304 [80.85%]), blood pressure (375 [100%]), TG (302 [80.32]), and low HDLc (297 [78.99]) presented normal biochemical values. There is no significative difference for male and female gender and, the social and behavior factors did not present significative association.
Conclusion
The Fernando de Noronha presents lower prevalence of MetS thus, shows associations for elderly people. The waist circumference was elevated on female population. The results of this study provide further evidence and underscore the need for public health strategies that include education about MetS, promotion of cardiometabolic health, and prevention of undesirable outcomes such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease."

Insulin resistance (IR) is predominant in type 2 diabetic patients. This study aimed to investigate benefits from adding l-carnitine to ongoing glimepiride compared to glimepiride monotherapy on IR in diabetic patients who failed to achieve their glycemic goals on glimepiride monotherapy.
Methods
58 patients were recruited from Internal Medicine Department, Tanta University Hospital, Egypt then prospectively randomized to receive their glimepiride dose 2 mg twice daily (group 1) or glimepiride 2 mg twice daily + l-carnitine 1 g m twice daily (group 2) for 6 months. Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months after treatment for analysis of fasting and postprandial blood glucose [FBG &PPBG], glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c %], fasting insulin, extracellular part of insulin regulated aminopeptidase [IRAPe] as a novel marker, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α], visfatin and lipid panel. Body mass index [BMI] and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR] were calculated. Data were statistically analyzed by SPSS using unpaired Student's t-test and one way analysis of variance; p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The obtained data suggested that adding l-carnitine to glimepiride has a significantly beneficial effect on FBG, PPBG, HbA1c, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR index, IRAPe, TNF-α, visfatin and lipid panel parameters but doesn't have effect on BMI and blood pressure.
Conclusion
The co-administration of l-carnitine with glimepiride represents a new therapeutic strategy for better controlling diabetic patients as it resulted in more beneficial effects on direct and indirect biomarkers of insulin resistance than glimepiride alone."

The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the Diabetes Comprehensive Care Model (DCCM) intervention on diabetes care outcomes. We hypothesized that participants receiving diabetes care from the mobile diabetes clinic (intervention group) would demonstrate significant improvement in glycemic control compared to those receiving treatment as usual (control group).
Materials and methods
We conducted a longitudinal, quasi-experimental study in which two similar clinics were identified. From both, we recruited 100 patients diagnosed with Type II diabetes. At baseline, patients were similar in terms of both socio-demographic and diabetes health variables. The team visited patients at the Bethlehem clinic at the beginning and end of the study (control group). Mobile diabetes care teams implemented the DCCM in Hebron four times over one year (treatment group).
Results
Most participants were female (63.5%) with average diabetes duration of 7.9 years. Initial HbA1c was 9.49% on average (SD = 1.93) and 9.20% (SD = 1.92) for the control and intervention groups, respectively. Statistically significant change in HbA1c, cholesterol, creatinine and systolic BP were observed in the intervention group (differences in change between recruitment and follow-up). That is, significant improvement over time was observed for the treatment group whereas little or no change was observed for the control group.
Conclusion
The DCCM-based intervention leads to improved glycemic control parameters indicative of diabetes control. Clinically significant change was observed in treatment group only. Integrative diabetes care appears especially well suited for fragmented healthcare systems with limited resources."

Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients. Insulin resistance has been shown to be reduced by the secretion of irisin from muscle and adipose tissues. This study was aimed at determining the relationship between serum irisin levels and angiographically defined coronary artery disease (CAD) in type II diabetic patients.
Methods
In this case-control study, 30 diabetic subjects with angiographically defined CAD were compared with 30 age- and sex-matched diabetic subjects without CAD in terms of clinical and laboratory parameters including serum irisin levels.
Results
Serum levels of Irisin were significantly higher in the diabetic group without CAD compared with the group with CAD (P = 0.048). Serum irisin levels showed a significant positive correlation with BMI (r = 0.374, P = 0.004) and fasting insulin (r = 0.303, P = 0.021), and a significant negative correlation with diabetes duration (r = −0.384, P = 0.002). Based on the results of the binary logistic regression model, circulating levels of irisin were associated with the presence of CAD in diabetes (p = 0.038) after adjusting for potential confounders.
Conclusion
Serum irisin levels were lower in the diabetic patients with cardiovascular complication compared with the uncomplicated diabetic patients. Therefore, additional larger scale studies are needed to determine the role of irisin in monitoring CAD in diabetic patients."

abstract = "Type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus is a serious and lifelong condition commonly characterised by abnormally elevated blood glucose levels due to a failure in insulin production or a decrease in insulin sensitivity and function. Over the years, prevalence of diabetes has increased globally and it is classified as one of the leading cause of high mortality and morbidity rate. Furthermore, diabetes confers a huge economic burden due to its management costs as well as its complications are skyrocketing. The conventional medications in diabetes treatment focusing on insulin secretion and insulin sensitisation cause unwanted side effects to patients and lead to incompliance as well as treatment failure. Besides insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents, other treatments such as gene therapy and induced β-cells regeneration have not been widely introduced to manage diabetes. Therefore, this review aims to deliver an overview of the current conventional medications in diabetes, discovery of newer pharmacological drugs and gene therapy as a potential intervention of diabetes in the future."

We compared the ability of the selected anthropometric indicators to best predict the prevalence of hypertension among the Indian tribes.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was undertaken among 1431 adult participants (705 males and 726 females) between the ages of 20 and 60 years from six major tribes in India. Selected anthropometric indicators such as body mass index (BMI), waist-hip-ratio (WHR), waist-height-ratio (WHtR), percentage body fat (PBF), visceral fat (VF), minimum-waist-circumference (MWC) and sum-of-the-four skinfold thickness (SF4), along with the physiological parameters such as blood pressure were recorded. Discriminant analysis (DA) was performed to examine and compare the ability of the selected anthropometric indicators towards classifying hypertension among males, females and the total population.
Results
Significant independent association was observed for hypertension and similar conditions within gender and selected age-group categories. The overall hypertension prevalence among the studied tribes was observed at 12.6%. Standardized function coefficients (SFCs) in discriminant analysis revealed PBF(0.89, 0.36, and 0.76 for overall, males, and females respectively) as the most powerful discriminator of hypertension. In addition, visceral fat (0.74, 1.46, and 0.58 for overall, males and females respectively) was observed to be the other significant indicator of hypertensive blood pressure. These exploratory findings for the first time indicate fat deposition, rather than body density alone, as an emerging physiological and metabolic risk among Indian tribes.
Conclusion
In the context of the highly prevalent chronic undernutrition, internal fat deposition is a major classifying factor of physiological and metabolic intolerance. It also indicates the increasing trend in lifestyle changes and the associated adversities among the Indian tribes."

To assess the association between elevated triglycerides/glucose index (TGI) and insulin resistance (IR) or hyperinsulinemia after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in a sample of healthy adults.
Methods
We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study in euthyroid non-diabetic adults, who attended the outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru during the 2012–2016 period. Participants were categorized in two groups according to the presence or absence of elevated TGI, IR or hyperinsulinemia after OGTT. A TGI value ≥ 8.65 was considered as elevated. We defined IR as a Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) value ≥ 2.28 and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT as a serum insulin value ≥ 80μU/mL after 120 min of 75-g glucose intake. We elaborated crude and adjusted Poisson regression models to assess the association between elevated TGI and IR or hyperinsulinemia after OGTT. The reported association measure was the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
We analyzed 118 individuals, the average age was 37.5 ± 11.3 years, 21 (17.8%) were males and the median BMI was 22.7 ± 1.6 kg/m2. The prevalence of elevated TGI was 25.4% (n=30) while the prevalence of IR and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT was 24.6% (n=29) and 17.0% (n=20) respectively. In the adjusted model, elevated TGI was associated with both IR (aPR=6.36; 95%CI: 3.41–11.86) and hyperinsulinemia after OGTT (aPR=4.19; 95%CI: 1.81–9.70).
Conclusions
We found that elevated TGI was associated with both IR markers in a sample of euthyroid adults without T2DM and with a normal BMI. The simplicity of the TGI calculation makes it the first-choice alternative when the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp or HOMA-IR are not available."

Therefore, the study aims to determine the potential risk factors and infection outcomes among diabetic patients with multi drug resistance, who are suffering from foot ulcerations. A prospective cohort analysis was carried out among 192 diabetic patients admitted in the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Diabetes and Endocrinology of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital, Aligarh Muslim University, India. The patients having ulcer or ulcers in their foot during the period December 2008–June 2015 were included in the study. The results indicated the rate of resistance to CS and PC, which was 56.7% and 51.9%. The most common isolates included Escherichia coli (25.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (22.6%), and Klebsiella sp (5.4%). A total of 121 isolates from 278 were associated with the MDR. Furthermore, anaerobic isolates were also included in the study which included Peptostreptococcus spp, Propionibacterium spp, Clostridium perfringens, Eggerthella lenta, and Bacteroides ureolyticus. Ulcer was found among majority of patients with the duration of 1 month; whereas, the ulcer size was also the major risk factor for diabetic patients.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) ranks as the fifth most obese country with increasing cardio-metabolic risks. In this paper, relationships of salivary adipocytokines (markers of cardio-metabolic syndrome), diet quality and physical activity in 90 normal-weight, overweight and obese (30 subjects in each group) Emirati adult females were investigated.
Methods
A cross-sectional research design was adopted. Anthropometric measurements, diet quality and physical activity questionnaires were administered. Overnight fasting saliva was collected to determine levels of adiponectin, interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).
Results
Salivary adiponectin was significantly lower, while TNF-α was higher in obese than normal-weight subjects. IL-10 displayed a lower trend in obese subjects. Though diet quality and physical activity did not exhibit significant differences among the three groups, better diet quality and higher physical activity level were reported among normal-weight subjects. Salivary TNF-α correlated positively with body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.37; p < 0.001) and waist circumference (r = 0.31; p < 0.001), while adiponectin correlated negatively with BMI (r = −0.28; p < 0.05). IL-10 showed negative trend in correlation with obesity measures. Correlations were not observed between diet quality and physical activity with salivary adipocytokines. Interestingly, a significant negative correlation emerged between diet quality and neck circumference (r = −0.24; p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Our findings demonstrate that salivary adipocytokines correlate with obesity measures and can serve as convenient adjunct method in predicting cardio-metabolic risks in the population."

The World Health Organization recommends the implementation of interventions focused on the early detection of clinical risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) as effective strategies for the control of CVD in low resource settings. However, due to health system resource constraints, surveillance capacity for the identification of high-risk populations for non-communicable diseases, including CVD have been inadequate. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of CVD clinical risk factors among healthy adults residing in the Cape Coast metropolis of Ghana. The clinical risk factors assessed included glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, lipid control and blood pressure.
Methods
The study participants included 70 healthy adults without a previous diagnosis of CVD from Cape Coast metropolis. Blood samples, blood pressure and anthropometric measurement were obtained for each participant. Serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin, glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels were measured.
Results
Approximately four out of ten participants were either overweight or obese. Almost three-quarters of the sample were considered prehypertensive or hypertensive. About three in ten were clinically prediabetic. About a third of the participants had high non-HDL cholesterol levels. Triglyceride concentration levels were found to be high in almost 10 percent of the study sample. Approximately six percent were identified as having metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
A significant proportion of the study participants were identified to be at risk for CVD. There is the need for adaptive and less resource-intensive CVD risk-factor screening interventions to allow for the timely detection and management of CVD risk factors in low-resource settings."

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) becomes increasingly obvious from an early age. The current study aimed at exploring the relationship between insulin resistance and the main biomarkers of MetS in young adult algerian patients.
Methods
Glucose, HbA1C, total cholesterol (TC), hjgh bensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), insulinemia and C-peptide, adipokins (leptin, adiponectin), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-a), us-CRP and GLP-1 were measured by suitable methods. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to detect the degree of insulin resistance.
Results
The MetS patients displayed higher glucose, insulin, HbA1c values and impaired lipid profile as judged by increasing TC, TG, LDL-C levels and lower HDL-C. Furthermore, adipokines, HDL-C and CRP contents were significantly higher whilst TG and LDL-C were much lower in MetS female group as compared to male patients suggesting most pronounced metabolic perturbation in the latter group. The probability of a significant correlation between HOMA and studied variables was often higher in female than male subjects. Such was the case for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, adiponectin, interleukin-6, TNF-α and hs-CRP.
Conclusion
The high rate of metabolic syndrome among young obese adults is alarming, this requiring extensive investigations in prone subjects."

The economic burden due to unwanted intra-LH injections is accounted for by inappropriately high insulin requirements, increased emergency-related hospitalizations, and loss of work days. Greater attention has to be paid by diabetes care teams to education programs with periodic refreshers to achieve better metabolic control and reduce the economic burden of diabetes."

This study aimed to (1) assess the level of diabetes self-care knowledge among patients with diabetes mellitus and (2) examine the relationship between patients' diabetes self-care knowledge and their demographic and medical characteristics.
Methods
A cross-sectional design was used to implement the study. A convenience sample of 273 diabetic patients were recruited from five primary health-care centers in Amman- Jordan.
Results
The overall level of knowledge of diabetes self-care in the total sample was moderate (58.28% (SD = 18.24)). The highest level of knowledge was meal planning (70.2%) followed by monitoring, causes of diabetes, foot care, symptoms and complication, diabetic medication, and the lowest level was exercise (42.5%). Furthermore, knowledge of diabetes self-care was found to be associated with age, educational status, diabetic medications and years with diabetes.
Conclusion
and Practice implications: The study findings emphasized that diabetic patients had a moderate level of knowledge and there were many of the learning needs for each area of knowledge. The health-care professional has an important role in developing the appropriate diabetes educational programs based on patients' learning needs and patients' characteristics. These programs that enhances knowledge on diabetes could be reduced or prevented diabetes-related complications."

Cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness (CRF, MF) are independent predictor of metabolic syndrome (MS). The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between CRF, MF and MS in male adults.
Methods
Data collected from 10,774 males who visited the National Fitness Center between 2002 and 2009. The data included measurements of subjects' blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index, CRF (VO2max), MF (grip strength, push-up, sit-up, knee joint strength). CRF, MF level was classified into three tertiles.
Results
As for the prevalence rate according to CRF level, the differences between groups were 47.6% of the low CRF group, 33.1% of the middle CRF group, and 19.3% of the high CRF group were found to have MS. As for the MS prevalence rate according to MF level, the differences between groups were 47.1% of the low, 31.8% of the middle, 21.1% of the high MF group were found to MS. It was found that MS odds ratios (OR, 95% confidence interval) decreased as the CRF levels improved; as indicated by OR = 0.64 (0.57–0.72) in the middle CRF, OR = 0.36 (0.31–0.41) in the high CRF. As for MF, the middle MF, OR = 0.62 (0.55–0.70), the high MF, OR = 0.40 (0.35–0.45) were lower than that of the low MF.
Conclusion
The level of CRF, MF has association with MS in men. This study suggests that we need to manage our fitness to prevent MS."

We evaluate retrospectively long-term effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetic patients treated between 2008 and 2016.
Methods
131 patients treated by GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) were included. The objective was to evaluate the evolution of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) during a period up to 4 years. The secondary objectives consisted of analysing the long-term effects of treatment on body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and lipids; reporting the proportion of patients who reached HbA1c objectives; estimating the time before treatment failure and determining predictive factors of failure. We also compared twice-daily exenatide to once-daily liraglutide on the major parameters.
Results
HbA1c improved significantly, mostly during the first year of treatment (−1.2%), and this effect was maintained after 4 years (−1.4% vs. baseline). At 1 year, 26% and 47% of subjects achieved HbA1c levels <7.0% and 7.5%, respectively. Treatment failure was observed in 51% of patients after a mean duration of GLP-1RA treatment of 50 months. Half of patients had failed after 42 months. Baseline HbA1c greater than 9.0% and male gender were predictive factors of treatment failure. BMI also decreased: −0.9 kg/m2 the first year, −1.9 kg/m2 after 4 years. No significant difference was found between patients treated with exenatide and liragutide over time.
Conclusions
The beneficial effects of GLP-1RAs on HbA1c reached a plateau after the first year of treatment and are maintained at 4 years only in one third of patients. Failure occurred predominantly in men with a baseline HbA1c greater than 9%."

Up to 27% of the direct medical cost of diabetes may be attributed to DPN [3]. A 2013 article from the American Diabetes Association reported a $176 billion direct medical cost of diabetes in 2012 [4]. DPN patients often suffer from shooting and burning pain in their distal limbs and a severe loss of sensation. Diabetic foot ulcers, infections, and amputations may follow. Currently available treatments: tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants such as gabapentin and pregabalin, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, duloxetine, topical 5% lidocaine (applied to the most painful area) can manage painful symptoms but do not address the underlying pathologies of DPN and diabetic wound ulcers. A combination of pain-reducing medications can provide relief when individual medications fail, and opioids such as tramadol and oxycodone may be administered with these medications to reduce pain [5]. Due to the prevalence of diabetes, DPN, and diabetic foot ulcers, and because of the lack of available effective treatments to directly address the pathology contributing to these conditions, novel treatments are being sought. Our hypothesis is that a deficiency of nitric oxide synthase in diabetic patients leads to a lack of vascularization of the peripheral nerves, which causes DPN; and this could be treated with vasodilators such as nitric oxide. In this paper, the mechanisms of DPN are reviewed and analyzed to elucidate the potential of a transdermal nitric oxide application for the treatment of DPN and diabetic wound ulcers by increasing vasodilation."

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disorder that interferes with the function of the beta cells in the pancreas. Reports show that the incidence of T1DM is increasing throughout England and Wales, along with the Body Mass Index (BMI) of this patient group. The association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity is recognised, but literature describing the association between T1DM and high BMI is more limited. The aim of this paper is to identify factors affecting BMI and the impact that this increasing trend has on children and young people with T1DM.
Methods
Information was obtained from the medical records of patients with T1DM at the local paediatric centre. BMI standard deviation scores (SDS) were calculated and compared to other factors, which include insulin requirement, HbA1c, pubertal status and age at diagnosis.
Results
This study involved 102 patients (43 male and 59 female). The mean age at diagnosis was 7.79 years (range from 0.16 to 16.91 years). Our results showed a significant association between insulin requirement and BMI SDS (r = 0.23, p = 0.02) and a significant association between insulin requirement and mean HbA1c (r = 0.59, p=<0.01). A multivariable regression analysis of factors affecting BMI SDS showed that insulin requirement was an independent factor affecting BMI SDS.
Conclusion
There were significant associations between increased insulin requirement, high BMI SDS and poorer glycaemic control. Further research is required to fully understand the risk factors that may contribute to obesity in T1DM."

Hyperuricemia is one of the metabolic parameter which has been considered to play an important role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, there is still lack of studies about association between serum uric acid with liver disease progression in NAFLD. This study aimed to know the association between hyperuricemia with moderate to severe steatosis and significant fibrosis along with other metabolic factors in NAFLD patients evaluated using Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) – Transient Elastography (TE).
Methods
This is a prospective study in NAFLD patients who came to our tertiary referral center University hospital hepatobiliary outpatient's clinic. All patients underwent metabolic parameters measurement including serum uric acid level and CAP-TE examination. Cutoff value used for significant liver fibrosis ≥7 kPa and ≥285 dB/m for moderate-severe steatosis.
Results
Of 113 NAFLD patients, there were 45 patients with moderate-severe steatosis and 34 patients with significant fibrosis. Multivariate analysis showed only high level of fasting blood glucose (OR 2756; 95% CI 1.131–6.717) and low HDL level (OR 4.196, 95% CI 1.22–14.430) to be independent risk factors of moderate-severe steatosis.

the objective of this study was to know the prevalence and its risk factors in various psychiatric disorder and comparing them in older vs younger patients.
Methodology
A cross sectional indoor based study was conducted after taking ethical committee approval in 140 patients (substance use disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar and depressive disorders). All the metabolic parameters as per International diabetes federation criteria for metabolic syndrome were assessed involving waist circumference, weight, height, Systolic/diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, high density lipoprotein and triglycerides.
Statistics
Chi square and t-test were used.
Results
It was seen that prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS); 21.4% in psychiatric illness, up to 40% in major depressive disorders, followed by 33% in substance use disorder and 26.7% in psychotic disorders. Prevalence of MS was higher in older patients >30 years group (26% Vs. 16.4% in <30 years group). It was observed that substance use and depressive disorder and high BP in older male patients are all the significant risk factors for metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
More than 1/5th psychiatric patients are affected by metabolic syndrome. Thus, all male psychiatric patients with high BP must be evaluated for metabolic syndrome."

In the present study we included 79 patients with mean age 50.3 ± 10.6 years, divided into two age and BMI matched groups –control group with obesity without glycemic disturbances (NGT) (n = 40) and prediabetes (n = 39).
Results
We found significantly higher levels of TXNIP in patients with prediabetes compared to normoglycemic obese controls (54.2 ± 69.9 vs. 23.9 ± 47.1 pg/ml; p = 0.03). The levels of TXNIP gradually increased from normal glucose tolerance trough IFG/IGT only to IFG + IGT (27,1; 44.0; 49.9 and 95.7 pg/ml respectively; p = 0.025 between NGT and IFG + IGT). TXNIP levels correlated weakly only with fasting blood glucose (r = 0.235; p = 0.04) but not with glucose during OGTT or the markers of insulin resistance.
Conclusions
The levels of TXNIP are higher in patients with prediabetes compared to normoglycemic controls as they increase gradually from NGT trough IFG/IGT only to IFG + IGT."

In recent decades, metabolic syndrome is one of the most important public health risk factors. Having this in mind, the present study was conducted to evaluate the frequency of metabolic syndrome and its associated risk factors in healthcare workers.
Method
This study is a cross-sectional study conducted on 410 healthcare workers in a teaching hospital in Iran. Demographic, occupational, and psychosocial characteristics were assessed using questionnaire. Assessment of metabolic syndrome of hospital staff was performed at workplace during their medical examination.
Results
The frequency of metabolic syndrome was found to be 22.4%. This relationship was found among blood pressure and occupational stress, despite the fact that there was no significant relationship between metabolic syndrome and occupational stress. Higher age, having shift work, and inactivity were associated with metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
Considering the high frequency of metabolic syndrome among Iranian healthcare workers, it is advised that effective management should be employed to correct the occupational and psychosocial factors associated with this syndrome."

There are a number of immunological markers (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, etc), which play significant role during normal pregnancy and their irregular levels could likely cause some level of insulin resistance. There are studies which have compared the levels of different immunological mediators in GDM affected females and their healthy controls, but their findings are little controversial. Some of the studies have reported increased levels of IL-6, TNF-α, adiponectin, leptin, in females affected with GDM, while others do not confirm this. We have tried to summarize, in this short review, the findings of research studies being conducted globally, which have reported the association of insulin resistance, GDM and immunological markers. Our review suggests that there is a need for high quality data on the immunological parameters associated with GDM, especially from India."

abstract = "Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes for chronic liver disease in Asians. It occurs more commonly in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, data on prevalence and associations of NAFLD among Sri Lankans with diabetes are lacking. The main aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with NAFLD in a cohort of diabetic patients.
Methods
Total of 233 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, followed up at a diabetes center in Southern Sri Lanka, were recruited by convenience sampling method. Each of them underwent a detailed medical history, physical examination, laboratory investigations and abdominal ultrasonography(USS). The diagnosis of NAFLD was made according to the established criteria using USS.
Results
The overall prevalence of NAFLD based on USS was 62.6% with no significant gender difference. Compared to USS, elevation in AST and ALT levels, based on NHANES III criteria, occurred only in 42% (98/234). The patients with NAFLD (56.7 ± 8.9) were significantly younger and had higher BMI and waist circumference, and raised AST and ALT than those without NAFLD. Binary logistic regression showed that the use of pioglitazone, higher BMI, and waist circumference were independently and significantly associated with NAFLD.
Conclusions
NAFLD is common in Sri Lankan patients with T2DM and central and global obesity are significant associations. Use of pioglitazone seemed to be protective against the development of NAFLD. These findings underscore the need for weight management as a preventive measure of NAFLD in T2DM patients."

A sustained economic growth in Bangladesh leading to nutrition transition with negative impact on health followed to sedentary lifestyle, and obesity. Therefore, the study objective was to examine the prevalence of overweight, obesity and abdominal obesity among Bangladeshi university students.
Materials and methods
This cross-sectional study in Bangladeshi university students was conducted in December 2016 to April 2017. Randomly selected participants, aged 18–25 years were analyzed from three specific universities as per gender variation. The height and waist-circumference were measured using measuring tape and weight by personal weight scale.
Results
Total samples 500, 64.6% (n = 323) were males, 34.5% (n = 117) were females and mean age (standard deviation) was 21.76 (1.86) years. The prevalence of overweight and obesity (14.86% vs. 11.86%) were significantly 1.29-fold higher in males than females (OR: 1.29, 95%CI: 0.75–2.25, p < 0.001). Mean waist-circumference was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in males than females, but the waist-to height ratio (WHtR) was higher in females than in males (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
We conclude that the prevalence of overweight and obesity is significantly higher in male students than female university students of Bangladesh because of girls were so much concerned their physical appearance and wish a slim body than boys. However, future study and public health efforts are necessary to address complications of obesity problem and to promote active lifestyles."

In addition to measurements of blood pressure, lipid profile and HbA1c, weight and height measurement were also performed for calculation of body mass index.
Results
The study included individuals recruited from 62 tribes across Sudan. The effect of ethnicity on diabetic septic foot (DSF) was not statistically significant across different tribes (X-squared = 2.6098, df = 4, p-value = 0.6251). The effect of ethnicity on Albuminuria was also not statistically significant across different tribes recruited for this study (X-squared = 4.3787, df = 4, p-value = 0.3572). The Northern group carried a significantly higher unadjusted risk for development of retinopathy (OR = 1.8471, p-value = 0.04603). The Southern group was significantly different from the others regarding the effect of ethnicity on neuropathy, compared to the ‘West' group (OR = 0.1905, p-value = 0.0345). The unadjusted effect for the Southern group was also significant (OR = 0.2933, p-value = 0.0320).
Conclusion
There was no role of ethnicity in term of DSF and albuminuria complications. However, retinopathy likely to be seen in tribes originally from north of Sudan, while neuropathy is more likely to be found in tribes originally from the south of Sudan.

Background
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with disorders of lipoprotein metabolism mixed dyslipidemia. The purpose of this study is to verify whether non high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) can contribute to the development of T2DM in a population in the extreme western Algeria.
Methods
The study was conducted in Tlemcen region on a sample of 1852 subjects,1059 with T2DM and 793 controls, these were evaluated for biochemical parameters, measured using standard enzyme procedures (SFBC or IFCC recommendations) on the Beckman CX7® PLC (Beckman-Coulter®, NY, USA). All the information related to the disease were collected from the patients and recorded using predesigned questionnaire.
Results
The logistic model retained, the two levels of non-HDL-C: 130 mg/dl < non-HDL-C≤160 mg/dl (OR = 0,69; 95% CI = 0,49–0,97, P = 0,033) and non-HDL-C>190 mg/dl (OR = 2,22; 95% CI = 1,31–3,76, P = 0,003), inbreeding (OR = 1,71; 95% CI = 1,44–2,04, P = 0,000) and the two age groups 60–70 years (OR = 2,14; 95% CI = 1,47–3,1, P ≪ 0,001) and 70 years and over (OR = 2,26; 95% CI = 1,51–3,38, P ≪ 0,001).

abstract = "Aims
Although diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) commonly presents as a pure diabetic ketoacidosis (PDKA), up to 30% of cases may be associated with a mixed hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (HMA). It is unknown whether there is a difference in treatment outcomes between these two entities. We evaluated an insulin infusion protocol (IIP), previously validated for hyperglycemia management in ICU's, for the management of PDKA and HMA.
Materials and methods
A retrospective case series/cohort study of 41 DKA admissions was further characterized as having PDKA or HMA. HMA was defined in those having an elevated delta-delta gradient (ΔAG-ΔHCO3) ≥ 5 mmol/L and base excess chloride (BECl) > 2.7 mmol/L. The main outcome measures were times to recovery of glucose levels to ≤250 mg/dL and of anion gap to ≤12 mmol/L.
Results
The initial serum glucose was 553 ± 265 mg/dL, serum bicarbonate of 8.8 ± 5.1 mmol/L, and venous pH 7.13 ± 0.2). Recovery of glucose occurred in 5 h: 25 min (±3 h:39min), and for anion gap in 11 h:25 min (±6 h:56min). HMA compared with PDKA had a delayed recovery of serum glucose (7 h: 23min ± 3 h: 35min vs. 4 h: 31min ± 3:h:21min, p = 0.017), which was due to the higher initial level of glucose (p = 0.02) rather than level of BECl (p = 0.17). There was no difference in time to anion gap closure between the PDKA and HMA.
Conclusions
Correction of hyperglycemia and acidosis in PDKA as well as in HMA was managed through the IIP. The simultaneous fluid and electrolyte management corrected the hypochloremic alkalosis."

Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) means the amount of energy utilized by body in physical and psychological resting rate, after a night sleep, awake without any previous physical activity post meal (10 h after last meal) & neutral environment. In people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) there is an increase in BMR which is said to be associated with the level of glycaemic control. So, the objective of the study was to find out the correlation between BMR, Insulin resistance and Visceral fat in T2DM with peripheral neuropathy.
Materials & methods
A total of 50 participants with T2DM with peripheral neuropathy were included. Age group of 30–75 years were selected for the study. Participants with a known history of neurological disease, locomotor disability, and pregnancy were excluded from the study. Demographic details of the participants like duration of diabetes mellitus, age, Fasting Blood Glucose, Fasting Insulin, HOMA-IR, Glycated Haemoglobin (HBA1c), Neuropathy and Blood pressure values were noted. We measured Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) by using Mifflin-St Jeor predictive equation in T2DM with peripheral neuropathy.
Results
The mean age of the participants is 60.16 ± 10.62. The mean duration of T2DM 13.44 ± 11.92. In the present study we found a statistical significant correlation between BMR and HOMA IR (r = 0.913*; p = 0.000), BMR & Fasting blood sugar (FBS) (r = 0.281*; p = 0.048), BMR and Visceral fat (VF) (r = 0.332*; p = 0.018).
