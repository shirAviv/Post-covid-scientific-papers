To assess serum vitamin D status and its relations to other biochemical parameters in type 2 diabetic patients from Gaza Strip.
Materials and methods
This case-control study included 58 type 2 diabetic patients as well as 58 non-diabetic controls. Patients and controls were matched for age and gender. Data were obtained from questionnaire interview, and biochemical analysis of blood samples.
Results
Serum vitamin D was significantly lower in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic controls (25.9 ± 11.0 versus 34.6 ± 13.8 ng/dl, % difference = 28.8%, P < 0.001). The number of patients having vitamin D deficient, insufficient and sufficient were 6 (10.4%), 35 (60.3%) and 17 (29.3%) compared to controls of 3 (5.2%), 16 (27.6%) and 39 (67.2%), respectively (χ2 = 14.672, P < 0.001). Serum glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and triglycerides were significantly higher in patients than in controls whereas serum insulin, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and calcium were significantly lower in patients. Serum vitamin D showed significant negative correlations with HbA1c (r = − 0.186, P = 0.046), ALT (r = − 192, P = 0.040) and AST (r = − 0.188, P = 0.044) whereas significant positive correlations were found with HDL-C (r = 0.188, P = 0.044) and calcium (r = 0.239, P = 0.010).
Conclusion
The significant negative and positive correlations of vitamin D with HbA1c and calcium, respectively suggests that vitamin D supplementation would be of potential therapeutic value in clinical settings for controlling of type 2 diabetes and more importantly its complications. However, a well-designed clinical trials are needed to define the contribution of vitamin D status and therapy in the global diabetes problem."

All the subjects were followed up to the early third trimester (24–28 weeks of gestation) for second sampling until the onset of GDM. Lipid profile data shows that mean values of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipids and very low density lipids were significantly higher (p < 0.05) and mean HDL was significantly lower in early second trimester in those patients who subsequently developed GDM during late third trimester when compared with those who didn't develop GDM. Inflammatory biomarker such as High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were also found to be significantly higher by 69% increase in patients who developed GDM later in third trimester in comparison with those who didn't develop. About 32% patients who finally developed GDM belonged to positive clinical/family history group. The results of our study indicate that abnormal serum cholesterol; triglycerides, HDL, LDL, VLDL and hs-CRP play a vital in pathophysiology of gestational diabetes. Early diagnosis of GDM based on these biochemical markers will help decrease adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes."

Methods
Two hundred and thirty seven (237) subjects, comprising of one hundred and fifty seven (157) DM subjects and eighty (80) aged matched controls participated in this study. Blood samples were collected from the participants for the estimations of xanthine oxidase activity, uric acid, malon diadehyde (MDA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), high sensitive c – reactive protein (hs CRP), glucose, fructosamine and glycosylated hemoglobin by standard methods.
Results
The results of this study showed a significantly increased activity of xanthine oxidase in DM (0.044 ± 0.05μ/mg) compared with apparently healthy controls (0.028 ± 0.00 μ/mg). The mean plasma levels of MDA (42.40 ± 2.50μmol/l) and uric acid (7.22 ± 0.20 mg/dl) in DM were significantly higher (p ≤ 0.05) than healthy non DM group. The mean levels of hs CRP in DM (4.09 ± 0.91μg/ml) was significantly higher than controls (1.30 ± 0.50μg/ml, p = 0.009). While no association of xanthine oxidase was observed with glycemic control indices and hs CRP, a negative association of xanthine oxidase was observed with MDA (r = −0.514, p = 0.000).
Conclusion
Increased activity of xanthine oxidase in DM was associated with increased lipid peroxidation and could be a salient entity towards the onset on complications."

Recent epidemiological data have suggested that the prevalence of obesity is at an all-time high, growing to be one of the world's biggest problems. There are several mechanisms on how individuals develop obesity which includes genetic and environmental factors. Not only does obesity contribute to other health issues but it also greatly affects the quality of life, physical ability, mental strength and imposes a huge burden in terms of healthcare costs. Along with that, obesity is associated with the risk of mortality and has been shown to reduce the median survival rate. Obesity is basically when the body is not able to balance energy intake and output. When energy intake exceeds energy expenditure, excess calories will be stored as fat leading to weight gain and eventually obesity. The therapeutic market for treating obesity is composed of many different interventions from lifestyle intervention, surgical procedures to pharmacotherapeutic approaches. All of these interventions have their respective benefits and disadvantages and are specifically prescribed to a patient based on the severity of their obesity as well as the existence of other health conditions. This review discusses the genetic and environmental causes of obesity along with the recent developments in anti-obesity therapies."

abstract = "Aim
To assess the association between elevated waist circumference (WC) and high waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) with insulin resistance biomarkers.
Methods
We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study in normal-weight adults. Participants were divided in two groups according to WC or WHtR levels. We considered values of WC ≥ 90 in male participants and WC ≥ 80 in adult women as elevated, and values of WHtR≥0.50 as high, for both genders. Our outcomes were high triglycerides to HDL-cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio and elevated triglycerides and glucose index (TGI). We considered values of TG/HDL-C ratio ≥ 3 as high and TGI values ≥ 8.37 as elevated. We elaborated crude and adjusted Poisson generalized linear models to evaluate the proposed associations and explored the gender interaction using stratified models. We reported the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
We analyzed 355 participants. The prevalence of elevated WC and high WHtR was 17.2% (n = 61) and 33.2% (n = 118), respectively, while the prevalence of high TG/HDL-C ratio and elevated TGI was 24.8% (n = 88) and 12.7% (n = 45), respectively. In the adjusted regression model, elevated WC was associated with high TG/HDL-C ratio only in female participants (aPR = 3.61; 95%CI: 1.59–8.20). Similarly, high WHtR was associated with high TG/HDL-C ratio in women (aPR = 2.54; 95%CI:1.08–5.97). We found an association with statistically marginal significance between elevated WC and elevated TGI in women (aPR = 1.54; 95%CI: 0.95–2.50); as well as for the association between high WHtR and elevated TGI in male participants (aPR = 1.87; 95%CI: 1.00–3.50).
Conclusion
Elevated WC and high WHtR were associated with a high TG/HDL-C ratio in women. It is necessary to perform prospective follow-up studies in the Peruvian population in order to corroborate our results."

Physicians need to play a proactive role to combat obesity and its associated comorbidities. The present survey was conducted to assess the awareness, knowledge, practice and attitude of the physicians in Bangladesh in the prevention and management of obesity.
Methods
Three hundred physicians were randomly selected from a medical university, a government medical college and a private medical college in Bangladesh to be included in this survey. All of them voluntarily participated in the survey upon the assurance of anonymity. All the selected physicians were provided with a questionnaire consisting of nine questions for assessing their awareness, knowledge, practice and attitude regarding obesity.
Results
Out of 300 participants, about 77% claimed that they know their own BMI and BMI cut-off points for overweight and obesity. But 38% physicians were unable to write the cut-off points correctly. Near about 50% physicians claimed that they know the BMI cut-off points for Asian population. However, only 7% were able to correctly write the BMI cut-off points for Asian population. About 47% physicians agreed that they do not calculate BMI or evaluate other measures of body fatness during clinical practice. However, 99% of the physicians considered that measuring BMI during consultation or clinical practice is important.
Conclusions
It may be concluded that Bangladeshi physicians’ have positive attitude for managing obesity but their practice is grossly inadequate. Most importantly, knowledge and awareness of the physicians about diagnosis of obesity is very poor."

Life threatening macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes can be minimized by effective glycaemic control. Self monitoring of blood glucose with glucometers is recognized as a cost effective strategy to improve glycaemic control. However accuracy and precision of glucometers will determine the effectiveness of this strategy. We aimed to evaluate accuracy and precision of commonly used glucometers in Sri Lanka.
Materials and methods
An observational study was conducted in a tertiary care setting including patients with diabetes and healthy volunteers. Eight commonly used glucometers were used. Blood glucose was measured in 50 participants (16 healthy volunteers, 34 patients with diabetes) in finger prick capillary blood using glucometers and venous blood using standard laboratory methods, and were compared to determine accuracy. Repeated measurements from same glucometer with a single finger prick were made and compared to determine precision.
Results
Only one glucometer showed insignificant difference to venous plasma glucose values. Only one glucometer met ADA recommended bias of <5%. None of the glucometers fell within the ISO recommendations for accuracy.
Conclusion
Majority of commonly used glucometers in Sri Lanka do not meet the ADA recommendations and ISO standards for accuracy and precision. However their variations are unlikely to make significant adverse impact on patient management."

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a composite heterogeneous condition with multifactorial etiology like genetic, environmental factors and oxidative stress. The exact pro-oxidant and antioxidant status in PCOS patients has not yet been fully established. We designed prospective study aimed to explore the association of PCOS and oxidative stress and examine the relationship of oxidative stress biomarkers with insulin parameters.
Methods
Two groups were included: study group including 85 women with PCOS and control group of 85 healthy volunteers. Biochemical, Hormonal and insulin parameters were measured. Vitamin C, vitamin E, nitric oxide and activities of antioxidant enzymes were estimated using spectrophotometric methods.
Results
Subjects with PCOS had poor antioxidant status as reflected by significantly low levels of glutathione, vitamin C & E and considerably increased activities of antioxidant enzymes like glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione transferase as compared to those without PCOS. At the same time insulin levels were found to be significantly high and a positive correlation between oxidative stress and insulin parameters was observed in PCOS.
Conclusion
Low levels of antioxidants and increased oxidative stress with insulin resistance along with the observed correlation between these parameters suggest that women with PCOS are under oxidative stress which supports the concept that oxidative stress is involved in PCOS pathophysiology. Thus oxidative stress could be a contributory factor to future cardiovascular disease risk in these women in addition to known features like dyslipidemia, central obesity, etc."

Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study was carried out at private health care centre. A total of 300 diabetic patients aged 18 years and above attended the clinic from February 2018 to Dec 2018 were included. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained from the medical records of patients. Statistical analysis was carried out using (SPSS, version 23).
Results
out of the 300 diabetes patients recruited 42% of patients with type 2 diabetes had abnormal Creatinine Serum levels and 22.3% had abnormal glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Abnormal albumin urine levels were found in 28.3% and 11.3% had abnormal creatinine in urine. Abnormal Albumin: Creatinine Ratios (Alb/Cr), were found in 23%. Of the total, 77% (n = 231) had normal Alb: Cr Ratio, 20% had risk of nephropathy and 9% had nephropathy.
Conclusion
Current study revealed a high prevalence of abnormal renal parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes Mellitus. This necessitates the need for early and universal screening of renal functions. There is also an urgent demand for measures that target tight glycaemic, Vitamin D level and life style modifications is also required to all diabetic patients to achieve target value of HbA1C ≤ 7."

Methods
272 patients with NAFLD and cardio-metabolic risk factors were tested for HOMA-IR, mean platelet volume (MPV), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), uric acid, ferritin, lipid profile, liver stiffness measurement (LSM), controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) by fibroscan and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT). Liver biopsy was performed to validate the results.100 healthy controls were selected. A score was constructed and applied to a validation group (n = 61).
Results
Logistic regression revealed that significant fibrosis and cardiovascular risk in NAFLD were independently associated with AST/ALT ratio (p = 0.000), GGT (p = 0.000), CIMT (p = 0.001), uric acid (p = 0.000), VLDL (p = 0.000), HOMA-IR (p = 0.000), ferritin (p = 0.000) CAP (p = 0.000), LSM (p0.000).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrinopathy with unknown pathophysiology among women of reproductive age. Several studies have been conducted to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) among PCOS patients. However, the results were contradictory. The present study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of MetS in PCOS patients using the related published data.
Method
The present systematic review was perfumed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The search was done using MeSH keywords in databases of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and Google scholar search engine as well as the reference list of the retrieved papers without time limit until October 2018. We used Cochran's Q test and I2 Index to evaluate the heterogeneity among the studies and the random effects model was used to combine the results. Data analysis was performed using Stata ver. 11.1.
Results
Forty six studies including 8946 patients with PCOS were included in the final analysis. Total heterogeneity was high (I2: 91.43%, P < 0.001). The prevalence of MetS in PCOS patients was estimated to be 30% (95%CI: 27–33). Subgroup analysis based on MetS diagnostic criteria showed an estimated prevalence of 0.27% (95%CI: 0.18–0.37), 0.30% (95%CI: 0.27–0.34), 0.32 (95%CI: 0.25–0.39), 0.32 (95%CI: 0.27–0.37) and 0.24 (95%CI: 0.14–0.34) for IDF, NECP-ATPIII, AHA NHLBI, CDS, and unknown criteria, respectively.
Conclusion
Considering the prevalence of MetS in PCOS patients, diagnosis of MetS in PCOS patients is necessary to reduce the mortality and morbidity rates."

abstract = "Background
Hyperlipidemia can be caused by abnormal elevation of lipids and lipoproteins in the blood. This increased can lead to heart disease. Risks which can be controlled include alcohol intake, physical activity, smoking, high blood pressure and genetic factors. Markers of increased cardiovascular risk appear to be lower in regular blood donor compared with single time donors as reflected by significantly lower total cholesterol and LDL levels. And it has been thought that there will be a direct relationship between lower risks of Heart diseases with repeated blood donation.
Aim
The aim of the present study is to determine the effect of blood donation on single time and repeat donors by assessing their lipid levels and their family history of heart diseases.
Material & methods
This cross-sectional study was carried out on (n = 80) random blood donors from the department of Transfusion Medicine KGMU.
Results
A significant correlation was found amongst hyperlipidemic level in single time donor & repeat donors and in donors with family history of heart diseases (p < 0.05). A positive association was found between hyperlipidemia with donor's weight (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Screening random donor platelets for hyperlipidemia and correlating the condition with other donor criteria like family history of heart diseases, types of donors, donors weight age and gender will help in making the patients safe as well as the donor deferral criteria more stringent to improve the quality of blood supply and will enable blood bankers to supply safe blood and improve the guidelines for blood safety."

Stress is one of the most common and controllable risk factors for non-communicable diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between stress and biochemical factors and hematologic indices.
Methods
The data to conduct this cross-sectional study were obtained from Shahrekord Cohort Study (SCS). The sample size included 1000 people who were randomly selected from 7000 people enrolled in the SCS conducted in 2017–2018. To measure stress as well as blood biochemical factors and hematologic indices, the Questionnaire of Stressful Life Events and Glucose and Lipid profile were used, respectively.
Results
Among stress dimensions, job security was significantly associated with most biochemical factors and hematologic indices. Linear regression model showed that there was a significant correlation between stress and blood urea, liver enzymes (ALT and AST), education, marital status, and occupation.
Conclusion
This study reported that the level of exposure to stressors was higher than that of other studies, and the results of this study are recommended to be used for screening and early detection of the consequences of exposure to chronic stressors, especially for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases."

Dyslipidemia is an established marker for endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk in diabetes. So we aimed to explore the prevalence of dyslipidemia in patients with type2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and to determine the association between dyslipidemia and other health care and biochemical indicators.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study was carried out at private health care center. A total of 291 diabetic patients aged 18 years and above attended the clinic from August 2017 through April 2018 were included. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained from the medical records of patients. Statistical analysis was carried out using (SPSS, version 23).
Results
out of the 291 diabetes patients recruited 22.3% had hypercholesterolemia (TC ≥ 200) and 61.9% had hypertriglyceridemia. Abnormal LDL-C levels (≥130) were found in 8.9% of patients and HDL-C was less than 40 mg/dl in 54.3%. There was a statistically significant difference (P = 0.048) in abnormal HDL levels (˂ 40 mg/dl) among females (59.3%) and males (47.6). Patients with HbA1c values ≥ 7.0%had significantly higher values of total cholesterol (TC) and abnormal LDL-C compared with the patients who had HbA1c ˂ 7.0%.
Conclusion
dyslipidemia is highly prevalent among diabetic population particularly in those with poorly controlled diabetes. This calls for early and universal screening of lipid profile. There is also an urgent demand for measures that target tight glycemic, optimal lipid profile control and life style modifications is also required to all diabetic patients to achieve target value of HbA1C ≤ 7."

Metabolic syndrome (MS) increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other complications.
Aim
The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and biochemical parameters of MS and its complications (cerebrovascular accidents, cardiovascular accidents, DN or chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared with healthy controls especially among the younger population in Northern India.
Material and methods
A total of 245 (healthy, MS and it's complicated) aged 18–70 years participated in the Open-Label, Single Centered; hospital-based random selection case-control comparative study. All anthropometric and biochemical assessment was done after proper consent. The metabolic syndrome was determined by IDF criteria.
Results
The key risk parameters in three groups i.e. Control, Metabolic syndrome, and Complicated was TG (96.5 ± 46.9, 194.1 ± 87.8, 148.0 ± 102.2). LDL (91.2 ± 27.2, 114.0 ± 31.8, 69.1 ± 42.5, BP (120.1 ± 9.9, 139.3 ± 13.3, 132.1 ± 15.0) and high fasting glucose (81.1 ± 13.7, 164.5 ± 84.3, 138.0 ± 74.5). The hs-CRP is also significantly increased in the complicated group. The subanalysis of data also indicates that younger middle age (36–55 years) group both male and female is obese, hypertensive, diabetic with lipid abnormality according to IDF criteria. Conclusion: The risk factors like high TG, low HDL, high BP, and high fasting glucose were found higher particularly in younger population which may lead to diagnosis & complications of diabetes, hypertension and lipid abnormality. Due to changing physiology in young and middle age population these individuals are moving towards metabolic syndrome easily and needs frequent monitoring, preventive checkups, and lifestyle changes to prevent complications."

Diabetic foot disease has been considered as an important complication of diabetes mellitus. The main risk factor to cause diabetic foot disease is peripheral neuropathy. Diabetic foot disease usually started from diabetic foot ulceration, it would develop to diabetic foot infection and amputation even death when conducting the poor prognosis and management of diabetic foot ulceration. Despite this, incidence of diabetic foot disease is still increasing and is therefore potentially under-recognized, under-diagnosed and under-treated all over the word, especially in the US. The aim of this study is to clarify the needs of the adults at risk and health care providers in diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot disease in the US.
Methods
Cochrane library, bibliographic databases, American Diabetes Association website and DFS questionnaire website have been used to search the relevant literature of diabetic foot disease among adults in the US. Additionally, conducting subgroup analysis to review the relevant literature.
Results
The findings of this health needs assessment described that diabetic foot disease in the adults is higher in men than women in the US. American Indian achieved the highest prevalence of diabetic foot disease, in comparison to other ethnic groups. Meanwhile, age has been defined as an important factor to influence the diabetic foot disease rate. Diagnosing properly is important, in accordance with understanding the etiopathogenesis of diabetic foot disease for health professionals. A comprehensive Foot Examination has been established and developed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). It has been used widely with the characters of easy conducting and rapid performance.

Diabetes mellitus is a public health burden requiring a multi-sectorial approach including adequate population awareness to tackle this epidemic. The study was aimed to determine the level of diabetes awareness among a high-risk dysglycaemic population in relation to socio-demographic, lifestyle and family history of diabetes as well as to body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure measurements. Furthermore, the authors strived to explore any relationships between diabetes awareness and an oral glucose tolerance test dysglycaemia diagnosis.
Method
Participants obtaining impaired fasting blood glucose in a representative health examination survey were invited to undergo an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). During the OGTT session, participants were invited to take part in a diabetes awareness questionnaire as well as have their weight, height and blood pressure measured. Association between awareness scores and different parameters (age, gender, education, residential district, smoking, alcohol habit, family history, BMI and blood pressure) were explored.
Results
Being a female, ageing, non-smoker and having a family history of diabetes had a positive association with adequate diabetes awareness. Even though generally good awareness was present, the majority of the participants were obese, with an elevated blood pressure and obtained a dysglycaemic status post OGTT.
Conclusion
Diabetes awareness solely does not appear to engage individuals in preventive initiatives. Behavioural changes are required but these are only established after the motivational action gap has been overcome. Empowering community diabetes mellitus screening programs targeting the environment, social gradients and cultural norms while engaging in preventive interventions are recommended."

We searched multiple databases for the studies examining the nutritional approaches to manage postmeal glucose in patients with T2D. We included studies that involve human trials that were published in English for the past 10 years. Our review of the current literature indicates that the postmeal hyperglycemia can be improved with four nutritional approaches. These approaches include (i) utilizing the appropriate amount and selecting the right type of carbohydrates, (ii) using specific types of dietary protein, (iii) manipulating the meal timing and orders and (iv) others (promoting postmeal physical activity, incorporating diabetes-specific formula and certain functional foods). The potential mechanisms underlying these approaches are discussed and the identified gaps warranted further research. This array of nutritional strategies provide a set of options for healthcare professionals to facilitate patients with T2D in achieving the optimal level of postmeal glucose."

Besides of dietary fat and carbohydrate, amino acids(AAs), as constituent components of dietary protein have been related with serum lipid levels. This study aims to examine the association between dietary AAs and prospective changes in serum lipid profile in adults.
Methods
Analyses were conducted on 3881 participants aged, 18–75 years of Tehran lipid and Glucose study, at baseline (2008–2011) and were followed for 3 years (2011–2014) to ascertain serum lipid profile changes. Dietary intakes of AAs were collected at baseline using food frequency questionnaire. Multiple linear regression adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, physical activity, smoking and daily intakes of energy, total fat, and fiber were used.
Results
The median(IQR) changes in triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were 6.0(-19.0, −35.5), 9.0(7.0, −24.0), 1.0(-3.0, −6.0), and 5.2(-8.0, −18.6) mg/dl, respectively. Higher intakes of isoleucine, lysine, tyrosine, alanine, threonine, methionine, valine, histidine, aspartic acid, and branched chain, alkaline, and alcoholic AAs were positively associated with TGs-changes in the final adjusted model, whereas tryptophan, glutamic acid, and acidic AAs were negatively related to TG-changes. Alanine and tryptophan were associated with higher and lower LDL-C-changes, respectively. Lysine, alanine, methionine, aspartic acid, and alkaline AAs showed positive association with changes in TC, whereas tryptophan and glutamic acid had a negative association with TC-changes.
Conclusion
Our findings showed that some dietary amino acids have the potential to increase or decrease serum lipid profile."

Leukocytes and neutrophils count, main platelets volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) values revealed noticeable elevations in most treated T2DM groups, while a marked depletion was recorded in platelets count compared to healthy subjects. Glycemic control, most treated diabetic patients with metformin mono- and dual therapies showed an ameliorative effect in HbA1c, IFN-γ, MPV, and PDW values compared to recent diabetic ones.
Conclusion
Diabetes was correlated significantly with dyslipidemia and atherogenic risk in parallel with an increase in IFN-γ production and hematological inflammatory biomarkers; leukocytes, neutrophil/lymphocyte and platelet/lymphocyte ratios, MPV and PDW values. The amelioration in inflammatory biomarkers was associated with improvement in glycemic control."

Diabetes patients with renal impairment commonly have a degree of hematological abnormalities than those non-diabetics with chronic kidney disease. The present study aimed to clarify the association between oxidative stress and hematological abnormalities with the progression of diabetic nephropathy.
Methods
A total of 20 healthy subjects and 100 patients were enrolled in the study. Eligible renal dysfunction patients were classified according to biochemical markers into five groups (20 patients); diabetic patients, pre-renal failure patients, diabetic pre-renal failure patients, renal failure patients, and diabetic renal failure patients.
Results
Erythrocytes and platelets count, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels revealed a significant decrease in all renal dysfunction groups, while leukocytes count, red cell distribution width, platelet distribution width, and mean platelet volume showed significant increases in diabetic and renal dysfunction groups as compared to the healthy control. Nitric oxide level increased significantly, while reduced glutathione showed a marked decrease in diabetic and all renal dysfunction groups compared to the healthy control.
Conclusion
Nitric oxide and reduced glutathione were associated with the inflammatory status in diabetic renal dysfunction patients which reflected by elevation in leukocytes and neutrophils count, red cell distribution width as well as the reduction in values of erythrocytes, platelets count, hemoglobin and hematocrit. Therefore, hematological indices can play a role in predict the progression of diabetic nephropathy."

This systematic review aimed to explore whether combined diet and exercise interventions are associated with improved glycemic control and/or improved maternal and newborn outcomes in women with GDM when compared to dietary interventions. A search on combined diet and exercise interventions during pregnancy in women with GDM was performed in 3 electronic databases: PubMed (NCBI), ScienceDierct, and the Cochrane Library. Evaluated outcomes were fasting blood glucose levels, postprandial blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin percentages, total weight gain during pregnancy, proportion of caesarean delivery, proportion of patients needing insulin, neonatal birth weight, proportion of macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and preterm birth. This systematic review identified eight randomized, controlled trials involving 592 pregnant women and 350 infants. The risk of bias of the included trials ranged from high to low. The combined diet and exercise interventions reduced fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels when compared to dietary interventions. No significant differences were reported in the selected trials regarding total weight gain during pregnancy, cesarean section, neonatal birth weight, macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and preterm birth between diet plus exercise and diet groups. The combination of diet and exercise interventions help to control postprandial blood glucose concentration in women diagnosed with GDM, but did not change either maternal or newborn outcomes.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that melatonin has some effects on the serum lipid. However, these results are controversial. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the effect of melatonin supplement on dyslipidemia and anthropometric indices.
Methods
We searched electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library up to Des 2018 without any language restriction. To compare the effects of melatonin with placebo, differences in standardized means difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were pooled using random effects model.
Results
Twelve trials including 641 participants included in meta-analysis finally. The dose of melatonin was reported at 0.8–30 mg. Comparing with the control group, melatonin may improve low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (−0.31 mmol/L, 95% CI (−0.61, 0.01), P = 0.049, I2 = 42%) and triglyceride (TG) level (SMD = −0.45 mmol/L; 95% CI, −0.77, −0.13, P = 0.006, I2 = 47%). No significant effect of melatonin on high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and anthropometric indices was found.
Conclusions
The results of our systematic review and Meta-analyzes showed that supplementation of melatonin could be effective in improving lipid parameters and should be considered in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, although the effect of this supplement on anthropometric indices needs further investigation."

Metabolic syndrome is a collection of physiological and biochemical abnormalities about 20–25% of adult population in developing countries is suffering from metabolic syndrome. Previous research demonstrated that adipose tissue plays an important role in energy regulation via endocrine, paracrine and autocrine signals as results of obesity due to accumulation of adipose tissue to excess that by time affects negatively both physical and psychological health and well being, it has been found that adipose tissues produces a variety of factors known as “adipokines” which play a key role in the development and progression of the disease and also hypothesized that adipokines are a possible link between obesity and the other risk components of the Metabolic syndrome. Many of the adipokines exert multiple actions in a variety of cellular processes leading to a complex array of abnormal characteristic of Metabolic syndrome. Abnormal production of these adipokines by expanded visceral fat during Adiposity contributes to a pro-inflammatory state. Increasing evidence suggests that aberrant production/release of adipokine from adipocyte i.e. adiponectin, leptin and resistin etc, may contribute to the health problems associated with Adiposity such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. This study conclusively have shown a significant role of adipokines secreted by adipose tissue and various metabolic risk markers play a important role in the development of Metabolic syndrome."

Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) is a major chronic condition that also common in older people, and associated with an increased risk of falling. This study aimed to determine the risk factor of fall in elderly with DMT2.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, 220 elderly diabetic patients who had referred to diabetes center in Kerman were chosen via convenience sampling method. To collect data, Semi-structured Fall Risk questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used.
Findings
The mean age was estimated to be 69.82 (SD: 9.9) years. Among the participants, 38.5% suffered falls in the past one year. Good sleep quality (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.1–0.85) and appropriate environment (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.1–0.77) were significantly associated with a lesser odd of having recurrent falls. Gait problem (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1–4.9), balance difficulties (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.24–7.12), hypotension (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2–5.6), and medication above three medicine (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.12–6.34) were significantly associated with a greater odd of having recurrent falls.
Conclusion
It would therefore appear that older diabetic patients would be a suitable target group for a strategy aimed at preventing falls. Early recognition of the multiple causes of falls in the older diabetic patient and prompt referral of this group of patients to a specialist falls clinic is recommend."

In Indonesia, most of diabetic patients had periodontitis and 75.3% of them had severe periodontitis. Previous study found that hyperglycemia and or local inflammation (such as periodontitis) modulated systemic pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.
Aims
This study aimed to investigate the effect of DM and or periodontitis on systemic cytokines and adipocytokines levels.
Methods and materials
A total of 57 participants with age of 29–71 years were recruited for this study. We divided them into three groups; DM-periodontitis (n = 22), periodontitis without DM (n = 16) and control (n = 19). All participants underwent physical examinations (BMI, WC, periodontal status examination) and laboratory examinations (FBG, fasting insulin, CRP, adiponektin, leptin, TNF-α and IL-10).
Results
The proportion of severe periodontitis were higher in DM-periodontitis group compared to periodontitis without DM (77.3% vs 6.2%). DM-periodontitis group had lower adiponectin levels than that of periodontitis without DM group [5860.78 ± 4182.40 vs 9553.13 ± 6794.73; p = 0.046].

Conclusion
Local inflammation such as periodontitis, elevated systemic inflammatory markers (TNF-α/IL-10 ratio). Meanwhile chronic hyperglycemia alter adipocytokines level. The changes of systemic inflammation among diabetic group had not been shown yet in this study since some antidiabetic and antilipid drugs possess anti-inflammtory effect. Age, WC and FBG correlated with severe periodontitis. Adiponectin, leptin, TNF-α and IL-10 levels did not correlated with severe periodontitis."

Coronary artery disease (CAD), is one of the leading causes of death globally. CAD risk factors, such as smoking, dyslipidemia, and obesity, are mainly associated with increased oxidative stress. Heat Shock Protein-27 (HSP27) has a protective role in conditions of oxidative stress. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between HSP27 mRNA copy numbers in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) and the degree of CAD progression.
Methods
A total of 103 subjects aged 49–71 years were recruited; Patients with CAD were categorized into two groups: patients having <50% stenosis (Angio−) and ≥50% stenosis (Angio+). The mRNA copy numbers of HSP-27 in PBMCs, anthropometric-parameters, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and the fasted serum lipid profile were evaluated.
Results
Angio+ patients had a significantly higher level of TC and LDL-C values compared with Angio− patients and the control group (p < 0.05). The HSP27 expression in PBMCs was significantly increased in Angio+ and Angio− subjects, compared to the control group. Moreover, there was a significant association between the FBG, TC, LDL-C and TG among the groups (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
It was shown that the increased expression of HSP27 in PBMCs of CAD patients is significantly correlated with CAD severity in Angio+ subjects, which can be used as an early prognostic biomarker, indicating the degree of overall oxidative stress in patients. In order to verify this statement, it is suggested to measure Pro-oxidant- Antioxidant Balance (PAB) test by the same design in subsequent studies."

abstract = "Aims
To investigate the association of obesity phenotypes with non-obese components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) by considering the presence of general adiposity and central obesity.
Methods
We analyzed the data of population-based cross-sectional study of 981 adults’ individuals who were community dwelling in urban population of Babol, the north of Iran. The demographic characteristics and anthropometric measures and hypertension were collected with standard method by trained nurses. The fasting blood sugar, CHL, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C were measured by enzymatic method. The presence of cardiometabolic risk factors were analyzed according to the combination of obesity phenotypes either overweight/obese or central obese. The logistic regression model was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of obesity phenotypes in compared with normal weight not central obese in association of presence of metabolic abnormality.
Results
The 394 (40.6%) individuals were both overweight/obese and central obese and 295 (30.1%) persons were “normal weight not central obese” and the minority 28(2.9%) were normal weight but central obese and the remainder 260 (26.5%) were “overweight/obese not central obese”. Overweight/obese not central obese increased significantly the odds of presence of ≥2 non-obese components of metabolic abnormality by 2.17 times (95%CI OR: 1.51, 3.13) but the OR was elevated for the joint phenotypes of overweight/obese and central obese (OR = 4.16 (95%CI: 2.85, 6.06) as compare with normal weight not central obese.
Conclusions
Overweight/obese alone increased the risk of cardiometabolic abnormality but being overweight/obese and central obese a further elevated the risk compared with “normal weight not central obese”."

Diabetes is associated with Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) activation. Protective role of Angiotensin (1-7) has been recently identified. The study aims to identify associations between imbalance in RAAS components with vascular endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in diabetics with newly diagnosed hypertension.
Methods
Brachial Flow-mediated-dilation (FMD), Carotid Intima-media-thickness (CIMT), pulse-wave-velocity (PWV), Serum E-selectin, Vascular-Cell-Adhesion-Molecule-1 (VCAM-1), high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Renin, AngiotensinII, Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Angiotensin1-7 were measured in 60 diabetic patients with newly diagnosed hypertension. Patients with AngiotensinII/Angiotensin1-7 ratio <1 were classified as Favourable-Axis (FA) group (n = 22) and those with ratio >1 were classified as Unfavourable-Axis (UA) group (n = 38).
Results
hsCRP was higher [9.52 (4.64–16.19) vs 3.62 (1.77–13.09) (mg/l), p = 0.04], IL-10 was lower [2.26 (1.34–12.05) vs 10.98 (4.44–17.78) (pg/ml),p = 0.006], %FMD was lower [(5.51 ± 2.97) vs (7.66 ± 3.38) (%), p = 0.01] and CIMT was higher in UA compared to FA group [0.7 (0.55–0.79) vs 0.51 (0.49–0.65) (mm), p = 0.001]. Renin correlated positively with pressure, PWV, E-selectin and VCAM-1, opposing associations were obtained for Angiotensin1-7 and ACE2.
Conclusion
Imbalance between AngiotensinII – Angiotensin1-7 is associated with increased inflammation and vascular dysfunction in diabetics and can contribute to development of hypertension in these patients."

Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in fasting and postprandial reflect the metabolism of glucose by the human body and are useful in the diagnosis of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and insulin resistance. In this work, these concentrations are jointly analyzed in Venezuelan women and 28 classes that better specify each metabolic condition are generated.
Materials and methods
Each class comprises a combination of fasting and postprandial ranges of glucose and insulin concentrations defined in the literature as normal, impaired and diabetic. A hypothesis test was used to find statistically significant differences between the classes, and confidence intervals for age and glucose and insulin concentrations were defined for each class.
Results and conclusion
The process of deterioration of glucose metabolism advances with the age of the subject, more than half of the prediabetics have impaired glucose levels in fasting but normal in postprandial and normal insulin levels in fasting and postprandial, and one third of diabetics have diabetic glucose levels in fasting and postprandial and normal insulin levels in fasting and postprandial. This categorization of subjects would allow the application of a more specific treatment and the possibility of predicting the progress of the metabolic disorder."

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 214 individuals using purposive sampling method. Somatometric measurements were taken using the ISAK protocol. Correlation analysis and odds ratio were calculated to determine the best predictor of hypertension.
Results
41% of males and 42.1% of females were found to be in Stage-II hypertension. BMI and WC were found to have the highest correlation with SBP among males and females, respectively. WHR followed by WC and BMI, was found to be the strongest predictor of hypertension in males. In the case of females, WHtR Followed by, BMI and WHR were found to be the strongest predictors of hypertension.
Conclusion
Among the presently studied Muslim population of Lucknow, a high prevalence of hypertension was found among both males and females. Also, WHR among males and WC among females were found to be better predictors of hypertension. Thus, for better prediction of risk of hypertension, sex and ethnicity-specific adiposity indicator should be used in clinical practice."

Many preventative and therapeutic agents have been developed for normalizing glycemic profile in patients with diabetes. In addition to various pharmacologic strategies, many non-pharmacological agents have also been suggested to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Trehalose is a naturally occurring disaccharide which is not synthesized in human but is widely used in food industries. Some studies have provided evidence indicating that it can potentially modulate glucose metabolism and help to stabilize glucose homeostasis in patients with diabetes. Studies have shown that trehalose can significantly modulate insulin sensitivity via at least 7 molecular pathways leading to better control of hyperglycemia.

abstract = "Aim
Diabetes increases the odds of depression and depression is often associated with poor glycemic control and complications of diabetes. Vitamin D is also believed to improve glycemic control and ameliorate depressive symptoms. Therefore, we examined effects of vitamin D monotherapy (without antidepressant drugs) on depressive symptoms in Type 2 diabetic patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms.
Methods
We conducted 12 weeks, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial on 68 subjects with T2DM and mild to moderate depressive symptoms. Subjects received 100 μg (4000 IU) vitamin D (n = 32) or placebo (n = 34) daily. Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI–II–PERSIAN) was applied for assessment of the severity of depression. Depression scores and metabolic profiles were measured at the beginning and end of trail.
Results
after 3 months of vitamin D supplementation, mean values of 25(OH) D increased from 15.5 ± 8.8 to 32.2 ± 8.9 ng/ml (p-value <0.001) in the vitamin D group. Moreover, BDI-II scores decreased from 15.2 ± 9.6 to 9.8 ± 7.2 (p-value <0.001) in the vitamin D group and 15.5 ± 11.2 to 13.7 ± 11.5 (p-value = 0.03) in placebo group. This decrease in BDI-II scores were significant (27.6% vs 10.8%) compared with placebo (p-value = 0.02). In term of metabolic profiles, mean change in level of Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin and triglycerides (TG) were significantly higher in response to the treatment with vitamin D compared to placebo (p-value <0.02).
Conclusions
In conclusion, supplementation of vitamin D in T2DM patients may protect these patients against the onset of major depressive disorder (MDD), with noticeable favorable effects on measures of metabolic profiles.

No studies have evaluated the contribution of major dietary patterns to Sarcopenic Obesity (SO) in obese and overweight people based on quintile of skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and fat mass (FM). This study was conducted to examine the association between major dietary patterns and SO.
Method and material
A total of 301 overweight and obese women were included in the cross-sectional study. Body composition was measured by body composition analyzer. Resting metabolic rate was measured by indirect calorimetry. The usual food intake was evaluated by a semi-quantitative FFQ. Serum HDL-c, LDL-c, TG, FBS, total cholesterol and hs-CRP were measured.
Result
The prevalence of sarcopenia (is referred to as two lower quintiles of SMM) and obesity (is referred to as two highest quintiles of FM) and SO was 19.6%, 20.4% and 9.9% respectively. We used the principal component analysis and three major dietary patterns were determined: the DASH, western and unhealthy dietary pattern, they covering 30.63% of total dietary pattern of our population. Participants in the in the upper category of DASH dietary pattern had lower odds of SO (OR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.96, P = 0.04). After adjustment for age, physical activity and total energy intake, the association between the DASH and SO, was still significantly negative (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.77, P = 0.01) and the risk of sarcopenia reduced by 80%.

Insulin resistance is one of risk factors for sarcopenia and there is no specific equation for the measurement of muscle mass. The present study aimed to evaluate muscle mass in the patients with obesity, prediabetes (PDM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) by different equations for the measurement of muscle mass.
Methods
Obese patients aged 18–65 years old, who presented between 2013 and 2015 were reviewed and they were separated into three groups as obese, prediabetes (PDM) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), sum of the appendicular lean masses (ALM) were measured in all participants. Body muscle mass ratio was calculated as the total muscle mass divided by the body weight, and skeletal muscle index was calculated as the total muscle mass divided by the square of the height. In addition, ALM/weight, ALM/height2 and ALM/BMI ratios were also evaluated.
Results
A total of 1107 participants, of whom 666 (60.2%) were female, were enrolled into the study. Of the participants, 288 (%26.02) had obesity, 524 (%47.33) had PDM and 295 (26.65%) had DM. There was a significant difference in ALM/BMI ratio between the three groups for both genders (p = 0.003 for female and p = 0.003 for male). ALM/weight ratio and body muscle mass ratio were decreased between groups in female, whereas it was no difference in male (p = 0.003, p < 0.001 for females, respectively; p = 0.802, p = 0.840 for males, respectively).

Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test for blood glucose control in type-2 diabetic patients is recommended at least once annually under the guidelines of the Thai National Health Security Office (NHSO) benefits coverage. With limited resources and capability for HbA1c testing in most primary-care providers, this study explored patterns of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) tests for proper timing of HbA1c test would increase value of the money spent.
Methods
A retrospective review of laboratory findings of 4906 type-2 diabetic outpatients in two university hospitals in Thailand was conducted. Percentages of discordant results between the indexed FPG and HbA1c tests were compared between the patient groups with different FPG patterns before HbA1c testing and the control group of randomly selected cases.
Results
Having HbA1c tested after two and three consecutively normal FPG tests (OO and OOO patterns) were found to have significantly less discordance than the control group (−9.6% and −15.7%). HbA1c testing after two abnormal and one normal consecutive FPG tests (XXO pattern) gained the discordant results by 24.8%.
Conclusions
Some FPG patterns were more predictive of HbA1c findings than focusing on one-time FPG results. Reviewing and recognizing certain patterns of FPGs prior to taking HbA1c tests can lead to better HbA1c testing decision than randomly prescribing the tests."

The main of this study was to investigate the association between the rs566442 (V1119V) coding polymorphism of Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) with obesity and basal metabolic rate in Iranian postmenopausal women.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was performed on 350 postmenopausal women with a mean age of 57.8 years (SD ± 6.14). Body composition was analyzed by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) resistance. Obesity was defined based on Body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2. To determine the genotype of SNP (rs556442), PCR-RFLP assay was performed and confirmed by sequencing. DNA samples from participants were genotyped using the RFLP-PCR method.
Results
Among the study population 37.1% (130) were obese. G allele had minor-allele frequency of 0.38% in our population. The frequency of genotypes in our study population was 12.9% (45 person) GG, 35.7% (125 person) AA and 51.4% (180) GA. After adjusting age and menopausal age, only basal metabolic rate showed significantly higher in GG group compare to other groups (p = 0.02). Our data showed basal metabolic rate was higher in obese women with GG genotype in comparison to obese women with AG and AA genotypes.
Discussion
The findings of this study suggest that the GG genotype of SNP (rs556442) could protective role in obese women through the association with BMR."

Although, insulin plays a vital role in the treatment of diabetes, conventional basal insulins have certain limitations, which have led to the development of more stable and peak less analogues.
Objectives
To analyze the efficacy and safety of second generation vs. first generation basal insulins, and the efficacy and safety of second generation vs. second generation basal insulins, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, from the evidence provided by head-to-head randomized controlled trials.
Methods
The following electronic databases were searched: PubMed and MEDLINE, Scopus, BIOSIS, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar, and Springer Online Archives Collection, from January 1966 to October 2018. Articles resulting from these searches and relevant references cited in those articles were examined.
Results
The efficacy among insulins evaluated was similar, however, second generation insulins cause a lower risk of hypoglycemia compared to first generation insulins. A single study showed similar metabolic control with subtle differences in the risk of hypoglycemia among second generation insulins.
Conclusions
The second-generation basal insulins result in metabolic control similar to first generation insulins, with lower risk of hypoglycemia. Second-generation insulins have comparable efficacy, with some differences in the risk of hypoglycemia."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was considered one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease and is considered the hepatic manifestation of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The factors that lead to marked fibrosis and liver cell injury in NAFLD are still remaining undiscovered.
Patients and methods
This study included (40) type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD and (40) diabetic patients without NAFLD beside 15 healthy persons as a control group. All of them were subjected to full history taking, thorough clinical examination with especial stress on body weight (BW), height, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio, blood pressure. Laboratory tests included serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), fasting blood glucose (FBG) and 2-h postprandial blood glucose (PBG), serum Ferritin and urine microalbuminuria (MAU).
Results
Duration of diabetes, BW, BMI and blood pressure were significantly higher in NAFLD group (P = 0.001). FBG, PBG, TC, TG, LDL, serum Ferritin and MAU were significantly increased in NAFLD group with significant difference between two studied groups as regard HDL. There was a highly significant correlation between serum Ferritin with BW, BMI, duration of diabetes, TC, TG, LDL and MAU. There was a significant correlation between serum Ferritin with age, waist hip ratio, duration of diabetes, SBP, FBG, PBG and HDL. There was a significant correlation between MAU and age, weight, BMI, waist hip ratio, duration of diabetes, DBP, FBG TC, TG, LDL and HDL.
Conclusion
NAFLD is a common liver disorder in diabetic patients. NAFLD is significantly associated with microalbuminuria and elevated serum Ferritin."

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by a diverse collection of reproductive and metabolic abnormalities. kisspeptin (KISS) is novel peptides associated with regulation of metabolism, food intake, puberty and reproduction. The aim of the present study was to estimate KISS level in patients with PCOS, and to evaluate the possible relationship between KISS level with anthropometric measures as well as clinic-morphological features of PCOS.
Materials and methods
cross section control study enrolled 90 control group and 105 patients with PCOS and they were stratified according to their body mass index (BMI) to; underweight (n = 9, BMI ˂19), normal weight (n = 25, BMI = 19.1–25), over weight (n = 34,BMI = 25.1–30), obese grade I (n = 12, BMI = 30.1–35) , obese grade II (n = 13, BMI 35.1–40) and obese grade III (n = 12, BMI˃40).Circulating KISS levels were measured using ELISA.
Results
Our results revealed that, KISS levels were higher in PCOS patients compared to controls. Among PCOS group, there were significant lower level of KISS levels in underweight, overweight and obese compared to normal weight group. Even more importantly, KISS levels decreased with increasing of BMI as the following, grade I, grade II and grade III. Moreover, it was negatively correlated to anthropometric measures, glycemic, lipid profile and positively correlated the phenotype characteristics of PCOS. Linear regression test observed that hirsutism score, HOMA-IR and LH were the main predictors of KISS levels in PCOS. Conclusion: circulating KISS is an important regulator of body weight and reproduction especially in PCOS women."

Traditional journal level metrics, as the impact factor or Scimago journal ranking indicator (SJR) measure the impact of research on other researchers, but fail to assess the reach of these publications among wider audiences. This study aims to assess the correlation between SJR and metrics of presence on social networks of endocrinology journals.
Materials and methods
Journals within the area of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism were identified from the electronic portal Scimago Journal and Country Rank, and their metrics based on the number of citation collected. Different metrics of the presence on social networks, such as the number of followers and number of tweets, were assessed. The correlation between both metrics was evaluated by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient.
Results
Of the 232 journals evaluated, 28 (12.1%) had social networks. The median SJR (1.53 vs 0.60, p < 0.01), and H index (58.5 vs 22, p < 0.01) were significantly higher among journals with social networks. The correlation between the number of followers on twitter and the SJR was moderate (r = 0.60, p < 0.05), and it was better in journals with more than 500 publications in the last 3 years (r = 0.85, p < 0.05). The number of tweets also had a moderate correlation with the SJR (r = 0.59, p < 0.05)
Conclusions
Our results suggest that the dissemination of research on social networks is moderately related to the traditional metrics of impact. Both types of metrics offer complementary information: while metrics based on social media may not perfectly predict the impact a scientific journal, it does have the advantage of immediacy."

Physical activities of daily living (ADL) constitutes one of diabetes management options. This study aimed to assess the extent that ADL and BMI are evaluated among diabetes patients in hospital practice.
Method
This was a clinical observational baseline study in two hospitals. Audit of medical files was performed to assess if BMI and occupations were recorded (N = 112). Afterwards, ‘N = 38’ who consented to participate in prospective study were conveniently sampled to assess ADL in relation to accessible metabolic syndrome tests. A validated questionnaire was used to collect data, which were analysed using SPSS version 20.
Results
Audit shows 55/112 of clients’ occupation were taken, of which 31% has BMI record. Those with lipid profile results are without blood pressure and vice versa. In the cross-sectional assessment, 74% are in physically demanding ADL occupations, but affirmed inactivity is 98% on leisure exercise. Further, 47% have BMI >25 kg/m2 and were consistently less active on all leisure ADL relative to those with BMI <25 kg/m2 (p < 0.02).
Conclusion
This report highlights oversight in clinical practice, whereby accessible metabolic syndrome parameters and occupation of clients living with diabetes are being assessed inconsistently.

We aimed to retrospectively investigate the clinical and biochemical profile of Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) patients and various precipitating and prognostic factors.
Methods
This was a hospital-based retrospective observational study, conducted in a tertiary care hospital in north India, from March 2014 to March 2017.
Results
Among 50 patients who satisfied the study criteria, 10 (20%) had DKA as their first presentation. Most common symptoms were nausea and vomiting (74%). Noncompliance was the major precipitating cause in 26 cases (52%) followed by infections in 18 cases (36%). The mean value of blood sugar at presentation was 406.8 ± 130.4 mg/dl with serum ketone 5.38 ± 1.56 mmol/l and mean pH 7.128 ± 0.157 with severe DKA in 14 (28%) patients. Mean duration of hospital stay was 8.2.±5.0 days, and low hemoglobin (p = 0.019) and high pulse rate (p = 0.025) were independent predictors of a longer stay.
Conclusion
With intensive care, mortality did not occur; however, non-compliance remained the most common precipitating cause of DKA followed by infections."

Despite the critical status of obesity as an epidemic chronic illness in the United States contributing toward diabetic and cardiovascular disease as well as early preventable death, treatment approaches in primary care remain in conflict; providers lack evidence-based guidelines toward impactful disease management, particularly from dietary approaches. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of initiation of a 5–10% low-carbohydrate, 75–85% high-fat diet on specific clinical indicators of obesity, a metabolic disease associated with increased morbidity and mortality, at baseline and six months in an adult population.
Materials and methods
Utilizing a retrospective electronic medical record data collection protocol, one hundred patients with obesity in a wellness clinic in the Southwestern United States between 2017 and 2018 prescribed a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet were selected via simple random sampling. Measurements of body mass index, hemoglobin A1C, and lipid levels were extracted at baseline and six months after initiation.
Results
Mean differences of each biomarker at baseline and six months were analyzed utilizing paired samples t-testing in SPSS and demonstrated statistically-significant improvement across each category. Body mass index decreased, hemoglobin A1C decreased, and each of three clinically-relevant lipid level measurements moved numerically toward normal-value ranges.
Conclusion
Data from this sample of 100 patients with obesity suggest body weight, diabetic, and cardiovascular status improvement from a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet over six months, affording a prescriptive nutrition option for primary care providers to consider prior to or as a complement to pharmacologic management."

There has been an increasing number of reports regarding the correlation between obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Visceral fat thickness is thought to be a risk factor for GERD and its severity. Several studies have conflicting results, so this study aimed to determine visceral fat thickness difference between erosive and non-erosive reflux disease.
Methods
A cross-sectional study of 56 adult subjects with GERD symptoms was held at Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital between April and November 2018. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaires (GERDQ) were utilized to determine the presence of GERD. Ultrasonography was used to determine visceral fat thickness. Esophageal erosions were diagnosed using upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The difference in visceral fat thickness between esophagitis and non-esophagitis group was analysed using T-test.
Results
From 56 total subjects, 55.4% have erosive reflux disease (ERD), in which were dominated by subjects with grade A esophagitis (64.5%) based on Los Angeles Classification of Esophagitis (LA classifications). There was no significant difference of visceral fat thickness between non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) and ERD (p = 0,831). There was, however, an increasing trend of visceral fat thickness with the advancing severity of esophagitis, although statistical significance was not reached.
Conclusion
Visceral fat thickness as measured by ultrasonography has no significant difference between NERD and ERD."

To investigate which of two indexes (TyG or TG/HDL) are the best predictors for insulin resistance (IR) and to evaluate the magnitude of each cardiometabolic risk factor in Mexican schoolchildren of 5–9 years with overweight-obesity and normal weight.
Material and methods
We realized a comparative cross-sectional prospective study in accordance of STARD guidelines. Setting was Family Medicine Unit (FMU) No. 80 of Mexican Institute of Social Security(IMSS) of Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico. Children between 5 and 9 years, both genders, 104 with normal weight(NW), 97 with Overweight-Obesity(OO Group) were included. Once the informed consent was signed we obtained the BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure(BP) and 5 mL of blood collected for glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, uric acid and insulin. As main outcome measures TyG or TG/HDL, HOMA-IR, and Receiving Operating Curves(ROC), sensitivity, specificity by ROC were obtained.
Results
Cutoff point TyG: 8.5 by ROC had an area under curve (AUC):0.802 IC95% 0.77to0.893, P = 0.0001; diagnostic accuracy of 73%. TG/HDL: 2.22; AUC:0.729 IC95% 0.622to0.837, P = 0.014; diagnostic accuracy of 52%. TyG can identify cardiometabolic alterations more than HOMA and TG/HDL. Cardiometabolic alterations in the OO group were hypertriglyceridemia:49.5%, low HDL:63.9%, IR:39.2% and in NW group were hypertriglyceridemia:30.8%, low HDL:60.6%, IR:9.6%.
Conclusions
We reported high frequency of hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL in Mexican children. TyG and TG/HDL are good predictors for IR. TyG has a better diagnostic accuracy. We need implementing TyG for identifying alterations and intervening in a timely manner to delay the onset of chronic diseases in children."

Anthropometric measurements obtained included weight, height, waist, and hips circumferences. Blood pressure was also measured, and blood samples were collected for measurements of total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and other biochemical parameters.
Results
Around 17.7% of the students were at risk of developing MetS, with three or more risk factors detected, and 45% of the students had one or two risk factors. Increased BMI values were associated with an elevated risk of developing MetS, as 41.4% of the overweight students and 44.8% of the obese students had three or more risk factors.
Conclusion
The prevalence of MetS is increasing in Young female university in the KSA as a result of an unhealthy lifestyle, including a lack of physical activity, leading to increased weight and the possible development of chronic diseases."

Empagliflozin is a potent SGLT2 inhibitor used to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM. It has the highest SGLT2 specificity among all the clinically used or currently tested SGLT2 inhibitors. Low risk of hypoglycemia, absence of weight gain and demonstrated cardiovascular risk reduction support its consideration as a first line medication in addition to metformin for patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease. Mostly reported adverse events are genital mycotic infections, while urinary tract infections and events linked to volume depletion are rather rare.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized as a cluster of metabolic disorder including increased blood pressure, elevated blood glucose level, high cholesterol level and visceral fat obesity. Polypeptide hormones such as adiponectin and resistin play a significant role in glucose and lipids metabolism, liver and pancreas function. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum adiponectin and resistin with MetS criteria among Temiar subtribe in Kuala Betis.
Materials and methods
This cross sectional study involved 123 subjects from Temiar subtribe in Kuala Betis, Gua Musang, Kelantan. MetS criteria were measured according to standard protocol by modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) guideline. Anthropometric and biochemical measurements were performed including serum adiponectin and resistin for every study subjects.
Results
Serum adiponectin was significantly lower in MetS subjects (7.98 ± 5.65 ng/ml) but serum resistin was found to be significantly higher in MetS subjects (11.22 ± 6.34 ng/ml) compared to non-MetS subjects with p < 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively. Serum adiponectin was negatively correlated with most of the cardio-metabolic risk factors; BMI, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride and total cholesterol. Serum resistin was found to be positively correlated with BMI, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose and total cholesterol.
Conclusion
The difference in serum adiponectin and resistin level among MetS individuals indicated the potential of serum adiponectin and resistin to be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of MetS among Temiar subtribe."

Data to support the use of risk scores in screening programs to detect people with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes in low- and middle-income countries are limited. We evaluated a targeted screening program involving a diabetes risk score in a community setting in India in terms of its uptake, yield, and costs.
Methods
In the Kerala Diabetes Prevention Program, 2586 individuals (age 30–60 years) without known diabetes were screened using a two-step procedure. Step 1: screening with the Indian Diabetes Risk Score at participants’ homes by trained non-medical staff. Step 2: oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) among those with IDRS score ≥60 (“screen-positive”) at community-based clinics. Screening costs were expressed in 2013 US dollars.
Results
96.3% of those invited for the IDRS screening consented and 79.1% of screen-positives attended clinics for an OGTT. Older age and male gender were associated with higher IDRS uptake. Female gender, higher monthly household expenditure, and higher IDRS score were associated with higher OGTT uptake. The number needed to screen (yield) to detect one person with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes was two and six, respectively. The average screening cost of identifying one person with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes was $33.8 and $116.5, respectively.
Conclusion
This targeted screening program had a high uptake and high yield for prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes in a community setting in India. Alternative strategies are likely required to enhance the uptake of screening in certain groups."

Serum uric acid (SUA) has been shown to be a predictor of renal disease progression in most but not all studies. This study aims to test whether renal function-normalized SUA {i.e, SUA/creatinine (Cr) ratio} is a predictor of decreased renal function among diabetic patients.
Methods
The subjects comprised 185 men aged 72 ± 11 (mean ± standard deviation) years and 175 women aged 77 ± 10 years from a rural hospital. We examined the relationship between SUA/creatinine (Cr) ratio and renal function evaluated by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Group equation.
Results
Annual eGFR decline rate was significantly increased with increased tertile of baseline SUA/Cr ratio (p = 0.011), and prevalence of the rapid progression types (≥3.0 ml/min/1.73 m2/year) was significantly higher in the second and third tertile (≥7,21) of baseline SUA/Cr ratio than the first tertile (<5.86) (p = 0.032). Pearson‘s correlation coefficient showed that baseline SUA/Cr ratio (r = 0.136, p = 0.012) as well as systolic blood pressure (SBP) and SUA were significantly correlated with annual eGFR decline rate. Multiple regression analysis using annual eGFR decline rate as an objective variable, adjusted for confounding factors as explanatory variables, showed that baseline SUA/Cr ratio (β = 0.334, p < 0.001) as well as gender and SBP were significantly and independently associated with annual eGFR decline rate. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence interval) of the baseline tertile of the SUA/Cr ratio for rapid progression of annual eGFR decline rate were 1.0, 3.15 (1.66–5.95) and 3.19 (1.57–6.51), respectively.
Conclusion
Our data demonstrated that baseline SUA/Cr ratio was independently and significantly associated with future renal function decline among diabetic patients."

abstract = "Aim of the study
Bariatric surgery causes profound improvement in metabolic parameters by increasing plasma glucagon like peptide - 1 (GLP-1) level even few weeks after surgery. GLP-1 analogues can cause calcitonin secreting medullary thyroid carcinoma in animals. The studies relating to the mechanisms that underlie these changes are few. The objectives of the study were to measure the change in insulin resistance, beta cell function, GLP-1 and calcitonin levels before and 2 weeks after bariatric surgery.
Methods
Patients above 18 years of age who underwent either laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en Y gastric bypass were recruited into the study. Measured indices were homeostatic model assessment 2 for insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR), an index for hepatic insulin resistance; Matsuda index, an index of whole body insulin sensitivity; and insulin secretion and sensitivity index (ISSI-2), a marker of beta cell secretion.
Results
Twenty eight patients completed the study. HOMA2-IR was lower (2.72 ± 1.28 vs. 2.04 ± 0.9; P = 0.001) and ISSI-2 was higher (0.80 (0.51–1.26) vs. 1.04 (0.56–1.38); P = 0.019) at 2 weeks after surgery compared to baseline. Matsuda index also improved after surgery but was not statistically significant (2.02 (1.1–2.94) vs. 2.84 (1.56–4.12); P = 0.078). Fasting GLP-1 and calcitonin levels did not change while both peak GLP-1, and area under curve for GLP-1 were higher after surgery.
Conclusions
At 2 weeks following bariatric surgery, hepatic insulin resistance decreased while beta cell function improved due to increase in postprandial GLP-1 level without any change in fasting calcitonin levels."

abstract = "Patients with diabetes experience increased cardiovascular risk that is not fully explained by deficient glycemic control or traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking and hypercholesterolemia. Asymptomatic patients with diabetes show structural and functional vascular damage that includes impaired vasodilation, arterial stiffness, increased intima-media thickness and calcification of the arterial wall. Subclinical vascular injury associated with diabetes predicts subsequent manifestations of cardiovascular disease, such as ischemic heart disease, peripheral artery disease and stroke. Noninvasive detection of subclinical vascular disease is commonly used to estimate cardiovascular risk associated to diabetes. Longitudinal studies in normotensive subjects show that arterial stiffness at baseline is associated with a greater risk for future hypertension independently of established risk factors. In patients with type 2 diabetes, vascular disease begins to develop during the latent phase of insulin resistance, long before the clinical diagnosis of diabetes. In contrast, patients with type 1 diabetes do not manifest vascular injury when they are first diagnosed due to insulin deficiency, as they lack the preceding period of insulin resistance. These findings suggest that insulin resistance plays an important role in the development of early vascular disease associated with diabetes. Cross-sectional and prospective studies confirm that insulin resistance is associated with subclinical vascular injury in patients with diabetes, independently of standard cardiovascular risk factors. Asymptomatic vascular disease associated with diabetes begins to occur early in life having been documented in children and adolescents. Insulin resistance should be considered a therapeutic target in order to prevent the vascular complications associated with diabetes."

abstract = "Background
Adipolin and cathepsin S are intricately involved in pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and prediabetes (PreDM).
Aims & methods
This cross-sectional study aimed to compare and correlate between these metabolic biomarkers as well as between them and adiposity, atherogenicity and hematological indices in MetS patients. Our cross-sectional study involved recruiting 29 normoglycemic MetS, 30 newly diagnosed drug naïve PreDM-MetS patients versus 29 lean, healthy and normoglycemic controls.
Results
Adipolin and cathepsin S plasma levels were significantly higher in both MetS (normoglycemic and PreDM) groups vs. healthy controls. Evidently proportional adipolin-cathepsin S association was markedly signified in 59 MetS participants (normoglycemic and PreDM). Distinctively unlike adipolin, inverse cathepsin S-diastolic blood pressure (DBP) but direct cathepsin S-monocyte count and its monocyte -to- lymphocyte ratio cross-correlated were marked. Notably unlike cathepsin S, adipolin was positively associated with each of FPG, A1C and TG, visceral adiposity index, lipid accumulation product and atherogenic index of plsama in the MetS pool of participants (N = 59).
Conclusions
Given the intergroup discrepancies in adiposity, atherogenicity indices and their correlations (as well as hematological indices) with biomarkers; this cross-sectional study cannot rule out either biomarker as an associative predictor or as a surrogate indicator and putative prognostic tool for the prediction/prevention and treatment of metabolism dysregularities."

Obesity and overweight which are consequence of some interaction factor such as genetics and behavioral habit. Obesity as a metabolic disorder and chronic inflammation is a trigger to countless disease. The main goal of this study is to investigate the interaction of herbal diet on the levels of liver enzymes, inflammatory factors and adipocytes profile.
Materials and methods
A total of 240 adult women range of 18–48 years were included in the current comparative cross-sectional study. Body composition and dietary intake (using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) were assessed in all participants. In determining a plant based diet index (PDI), vegetarian foods were taken positive score and reverse points for animal foods. For determining a healthful plant based diet index (hPDI), healthy plant foods received positive scores, while less healthy plant foods and animal foods received reverse scores. To create an unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI), positive scores were assigned to less healthy plant foods and reverse scores to healthy plant foods and animal foods. For the measurement of serum liver enzymes and inflammatory factors, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was used.
Results
Healthy diet like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, cereals, and beverages such as tea and coffee, based on dietary guidelines, significantly reduced the amount of hs-CRP and TGF-β (P < 0.0001). Higher adhering to hPDI may as a result in higher intake of fiber intake, antioxidants, unsaturated fats, micronutrients, could reduce saturated fats and iron content, and finally weight loss, and reduce inflammation in the body.
Conclusion
Base on our finding, in those people who intake higher amounts of healthy plant foods, (vegetable types), instead of unhealthy herbal foods (sweets and desserts), might be useful to reduce inflammation factor like TGF-β and hs-CRP. Women with a higher compliance score in uPDI group (juices, refined grains, starches sweetened with sugar, sweets, and desserts) did not have significantly increase in inflammatory factors levels."

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is responsible for an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Economic and social vulnerability is not an easy concept to grasp, but some studies investigate the association between MetS and socioeconomic and demographic factors, deprivation (more often correlations rather than causal one due to data). This work aims to assess the association between MetS and socio-economic gradient (SEG) in the literature by performing a meta-analysis.
Design
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for systematic reviews were followed.
Setting
The raw list of studies extracted from PubMed as regard to the inclusion/exclusion criteria was imported in Word. Studies were filed with regard to our three definitions of SEG and their title.
Participants
Subgroup analysis were performed considering several definitions of Mets: NCEP-ATPIII and IDF2006.
Results
The overall multivariable-adjusted OR showed that the risk of MetS was significantly increased in association with SEG The results of the subgroup analysis showed an increased risk of MetS in association with SEG when IDF definition was considered.
Conclusions
Targeted interventions must be implemented in a specific way as prevention campaigns aimed at the general population are generally not adapted to this particular vulnerable population."

Many studies have been conducted on the treatment of NAFLD; nevertheless, there is still no approved drug treatment for this disease. Although the pathogenesis of NAFLD is not fully understood, but inflammation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, obesity and dyslipidemia are among the main causes. Epidemiological studies have shown that hypovitaminosis D is associated with these factors causing NAFLD. In addition, rate of Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be directly related to the severity of NAFLD. Accordingly, it is believed that vitamin D may help to treatment of NAFLD by improving the above-mentioned risk factors. The purpose of this review is to survey the recent advances in the field of Vitamin D efficacy on risk factors and the severity of NAFLD based on existing evidence, especially the clinical efficiency of vitamin D supplementation in patients with NAFLD."

GLP-1 analogues decrease food intake and have great promise for the fight against obesity. Little is known about their effects on food hedonic sensations and taste perception in poor controlled patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Materials and methods
Eighteen T2D patients with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 and poor controlled glycemia were studied before and after 3 months of treatment with Liraglutide. Detection thresholds for salty, sweet and bitter tastes, optimal preferences, olfactory liking, wanting and recalled liking for several food items were assessed. Subjects also answered questionnaires to measure their attitudes to food.
Results
T2D patients had a significant decrease in bodyweight and HbA1c after treatment with Liraglutide. Liraglutide improved gustative detection threshold of sweet flavors, and decreased wanting for sweet foods and recalled liking for fatty foods. It also led to a decrease in feelings of hunger.
Conclusions
Liraglutide increases sensitivity to sweet tastes and decreases pleasure responses for fatty foods in poor controlled T2D patients, and is of particular interest in the understanding of the mechanisms of weight loss.

C1q/TNF-related protein-3 or CTRP3 is a novel adipokine that is expressed and released by most types of human tissues including adipose tissue. This adipokine, considered as an adiponectin, can normalize blood glucose by several mechanisms. In addition, it can modulate the expression/secretion of other cytokine and adipokines leading to lower insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Beneficial effects of CTRP3 against hyperglycemia-induced complications in the kidney and eye have been reported.

Obesity is a major contributor to preventable disease and death across the globe. Obesity is complex. Although its risk factors are myriad and compounding, there is an urgent need for a deeper understanding of the way risk factors interact with each other. Leptin is a peptide regulates food intake and body weight. However, the notion of leptin as an anti-obesity hormone was called into question because obesity is typically associated with high leptin levels and not leptin deficiency thus, we aimed to measure leptin levels in obese female in correlation to anthropometric measures and to evaluate the impact of weight loss on its level and metabolic parameters.
Subject and methods
case-control study enrolled 40 control groups, 50 obese women. We measured anthropometric measures BMI, Waist/hip ratio (WHR). Fat mass index (FMI%) and free fat mass index (FFMI%) were assessed by dual energy X-Ray absorptiometry (DEXA) The serum levels of leptin were measured by ELISA.
Results
Our results revealed that serum leptin levels were higher in obese women compared to controls. Moreover, it was positively correlated to anthropometric measures, glycemic and lipid profile. Linear regression analysis revealed that BMI was the main independent studied parameters associated with serum leptin level among other clinical and laboratory biomarkers. Interestingly, after 12 weeks of following the Mediterranean diet (MD)–based weight loss program, serum leptin levels were decreased. Logistic regression analysis was performed to detect the main predictors' biomarkers associated with weight loss among obese women. We found that serum leptin and FMI% were an independent predictor of response with odds ratios of 1.69 and 1.64 respectively (P < 0.001), Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that the AUC of serum leptin in discriminating obese women from lean ones was 0.893 (95% CI = 0.815–0.917) with sensitivity = 90%, specificity = 96%, and the cutoff values was 36.32 ng/ml.
Conclusion
Serum leptin could be a valuable diagnostic marker of obesity and its comorbidities. Moreover, significant weight loss leads to decrease serum leptin levels and improvement of glycemic and lipid profiles."

abstract = "Aims
Glucose tolerance abnormalities are frequently observed in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Insulin resistance (IR) has been suggested to be a major factor responsible for these abnormalities in CLD. However studies relating IR with severity of CLD are scarce in Nigeria. This study assessed insulin resistance and glucose tolerance abnormalities in CLD and their relationship with the severity of CLD in a tertiary hospital in South-West, Nigeria.
Methods
This cross sectional study involved 100 subjects with CLD. Ethical clearance was obtained and informed consent was granted by participants. Participants were interviewed using a structured proforma; physical examination and relevant investigations were performed. Insulin resistance was measured using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) Data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20.0 and p value of <0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Mean age of the study participants was 51.9 ± 11.9 years, and mean duration of CLD was 15.9 ± 5.8 months. Glucose tolerance abnormalities were present in 66 subjects (66%) and increased from 16.1% in Child Pugh's class A to 90.0% in class C. HOMA-IR positively correlated with age, body mass index, serum blood glucose, duration and severity of CLD. Increasing age, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, Child Pugh's class B and class C were associated with glucose tolerance abnormalities.
Conclusion
Glucose tolerance abnormalities and insulin resistance were highly prevalent among chronic liver disease subjects studied and seemed to parallel the severity of CLD, determined by the Child Pugh's score."

Metabolic syndrome is cluster of abnormality related with increasing cardiovascular events. Hyperuricemia is level of uric acid more than 7 mg/dL for men. Some research have reported relation between metabolic syndrome mediated by insulin resistance with increasing of serum uric acid level.
Objective
Assess relationship between insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome components with the level of serum uric acid.
Method
Observational study with cross sectional approach conducted on 102 outpatient subjects at Dr. RSUP Wahidin Sudirohusodo (RSWS) hospital and Hasanuddin University Hospital in the period of July–September 2018.
Results
Subjects with IR were found to be significantly higher for having MetS (88.23% vs. 11.77% p = 0,000). In subjects with IR, the average serum uric acid level was higher compared to non-IR subjects, but this difference was not significant (6.63 vs 6.42 mg/dL; P = 0.325). In subjects with MetS, the average serum uric acid level was higher compared to subjects with non-MetS but this difference was not significant (6.62 vs. 6.28 mg/dL; P = 0.556). No significant relationship was found between IR and MetS with serum uric acid level.
Conclusion
Insulin resistance is related to the incidence of MetS and in both of these circumstances an independent tendency is found to increase uric acid levels. The role of insulin resistance in the relationship between metabolic syndrome and uric acid levels was not proven in this study."
