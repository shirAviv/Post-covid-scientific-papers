abstract = "Objective
Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of risk factors with increased predilection towards occurrence of cardiovascular diseases. Currently physical exercise and management with metformin are the prevailing treatment modalities for metabolic syndrome. Patients with metabolic syndrome have been found to have reduced exercise capacity over a period of time. Likewise metformin has been shown to decrease exercise capacity among healthy volunteers. Hence this study aims to evaluate the effect of metformin on the exercise capacity of patients with metabolic syndrome.
Design
Prospective study with 6 weeks follow up.
Methods
Newly diagnosed patients with metabolic syndrome and to be started on Table Metformin 500mg twice a day were recruited for the study after obtaining written informed consent. Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) was done at baseline before the subjects were started on metformin and after 6 weeks of treatment using cardiopulmonary exercise testing apparatus (ZAN600).
Results
Fifteen treatment naïve patients with metabolic syndrome completed six weeks of therapy with metformin. In these patients oxygen uptake [VO2] showed statistically significant decrease from 1.10±0.44 at baseline to 0.9±0.39 (l/min) after six weeks of treatment with metformin [mean difference of −0.20 (−0.31 to −0.09); P=0.001]. Similarly oxygen uptake/kg body weight [VO2/Kg] showed a significant decrease from 14.10±4.73 to 11.44±3.81 (mlkg−1min−1) at the end of six weeks of treatment [mean difference of −2.66 (−4.06 to −1.26); P=0.001].
Conclusion
Six weeks of treatment with metformin significantly decreases exercise capacity in newly diagnosed patients with metabolic syndrome."

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a public health epidemic, typically with female predominance. The aim was to analyse the effect of gender and age on MetS and its components; analyse effects of lifestyle, diabetes mellitus and identify predictors for MetS including TG/HDL ratio, on a national level in a Mediterranean island. Findings will provide evidence-based data for neighboring countries to aid in combat of this epidemic.
Method
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Malta (2014–2016) on a randomized adults population sample. Various components of MetS were measured along with lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol and physical activity) and family history (cardiovascular and diabetes). Both descriptive and statistical analyses were performed.
Results
A total of 80,788 Maltese adults estimated to suffer from MetS. Males were predominantly affected with significant difference from females. All MetS components were found to be significant predictors along with alcohol habits but not smoking. Neither physical inactivity nor family history of cardiovascular disease, showed any predictive ability for MetS even after adjustment. Elevated triglyceride levels exhibited highest predictive effect on MetS. TG/HDL ratio showed predictive ability in the Maltese population.
Conclusions
Males were at higher risk for MetS in Malta. A number of predictors were established but not sedentary lifestyle. TG/HDL ratio may provide to be a good indicator for development of MetS."

Chronic inflammation plays a central role in the development and progression of diabetes, and in the pathogenesis of its complications. The neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet–lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are indicators of subclinical inflammation. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is one of the platelet function indices. We investigated the association of NLR, PLR and MPV with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus and determine whether or not these are reliable markers for diagnosis.
Materials and methods
Participants were divided into four groups; 1: normal glucose tolerance, 2: impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetic), 3: newly diagnosed diabetic by OGTT. 4: group is previously diagnosed diabetic without complication. Outcomes were compared between groups.
Results
There are significant differences between all groups in NLR (p=0.004) and PLR (p=0.021) values. NLR values are significantly higher in prediabetic (1.60±0.85), firstly diagnosed diabetic (1.58±0.78) and clear diabetic (2.07±0.95) groups compared to normal group (1.37±0.69) (mean, SD). PLR values are significantly lower in prediabetic (90.35±44.34) and firstly diagnosed diabetic (86.38±45.24) groups compared to normal group (100.55±48.14) but significantly higher in clear diabetic group (122.45±37.43). There are no significant differences between all groups in MPV values.
Conclusion
Inflammation marker NLR significantly increases in prediabetic and diabetic patients. PLR significantly decreases in prediabetes and early stages of diabetes but increases in later stages. NLR and PLR values may be reliable predictive markers in prediabetes and diabetes mellitus."

Metabolic syndrome increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This review is on the associations between MetS and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF induces migration and proliferation of endothelial cells (ECs), increases vascular permeability and has a role in tumor growth, adipose tissue expansion, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Circulating levels of VEGFs are elevated in obese individuals and it has also been suggested that VEGF is secreted from adipose tissues, especially from intra-abdominal adipose tissue. There is abundant evidence to support that poor glycemic control in diabetic patients is associated with increased plasma VEGF, which in turn may cause hypertension and several vascular complications in diabetic patients. Circulating VEGF levels are increased in children and young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus and middle-aged diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy. It has been revealed that plasma VEGF increases in patients with hyperlipidemia and may trigger the development of atherosclerosis. It can be concluded that there is a positive association between VEGF and components of MetS. Because of the importance of this relationship, more investigations are needed in this field."

Understanding the metabolic syndrome has been the center of attention in recent years as a major risk factor of many diseases. Given the rising incidence of this disease and as the patient can compete against this disease with choosing healthy lifestyle, in the present study, we investigated the predictors of metabolic syndrome, based on Walker’s health-promoting lifestyle in two large cities in Iran, in 2016.
Methods
This cross-sectional study used two-stage cluster sampling to select 1128 patients, among patients who referred to health centers in Isfahan and Yazd. Data were gathered by Walker lifestyle questionnaire that evaluates health-promoting behavior (nutrition, physical activity, health responsibility, spiritual growth, interpersonal relations, and stress management) by self-report that were completed by interviews for illiterate and semi-literate individuals. Data analysis was performed by SPSS statistical software.
Results
In this study, 576 women and 454 men participated with mean age of 56.19±12.11years and mean weight of 73.90±14.45kg.
Results
showed that the highest mean score for different health-promoting behaviors was related to social responsibility (25.53±5.65) and the lowest was related to nutritional status (15.18±5.79). Regarding the strongest predictor of lifestyle, the results of regression analysis showed that the most direct impact was related to stress management (R2=0.343) and the least direct impact was related to social responsibility (R2=0.243). Among the structures, physical activity with overall effect of R2=0.621 was the strongest predictor of lifestyle based on Walker’s pattern.
Conclusion
Considering the results of this study, the greater emphasis in planning and interventions to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome should be spotted on physical activity and stress management in patients with the metabolic syndrome."

Raised blood pressure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide; improved nutritional approaches to population-wide prevention are required.We aimed to investigate the relationship between dietary intake and other cardiovascular risk factors with blood pressure in individuals without a history of a cardiovascular event in an Iranian cohort.
Material and method
A cross-sectional study of 5670 healthy subjects [approximately 40% (n=2179) males and 60% (n=3491) females] was undertaken in a sample from northeastern Iran. Subjects were recruited from an urban population, using a stratified-cluster method and derived from the Mashhad Stroke Heart Atherosclerosis Disorder (MASHAD) study, Mashhad, Iran. The age of the subjects was between 35 and 64 years. None of the subjects had a past history of major disease.
Results
The mean ages for the male and female subgroups were 50.1± 8.1years and 48.2 ±7.8 y respectively. Not unexpectedly, subjects without hypertension (HTN) were younger than those with established HTN. Individuals with HTN were significantly more adipose than those without (p<0.01). We found no significant differences in crude or total energy adjusted intake of nutrients between the three groups (p>0.05), except for crude and energy adjusted phosphorus intake (p<0.05) and crude intake of the cholesterol (p<0.05). There was a significant correlation between the dietary intake of total fatty acids, phosphorus and vitamin E with both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). PUFA (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)], 1.56 [1.05–1.06]; P<0.01), sodium (OR [95% CI], 1.00 [(1.00–1.01)]; P<0.01) and phosphorus (OR [95% CI], 1.00 [(1.00–1.01)]; P<0.01)were significant independent predictors of HTN after adjustment for energy intake.
Conclusion
In our representative population from North-Eastern Iran, it appears that in adults without a history of cardiovascular disease, crude or energy adjusted intake of phosphorus and total fatty acid intake were significant determinants of BP, however we found no association between sodium and potassium intake with BP."

Triacylglycerol/High density lipoprotein (TAG/HDL) ratio, a surrogate marker of LDL particle size (small dense) was included in our study to observe the link with insulin resistance and thyroid co-morbidity.
Methods
Ninety three patients with T2DM of both genders were enrolled from a tertiary health care unit in Puducherry, during the latter half of 2015. The cardio-metabolic risk factors were assessed through body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and lipid profile, glycated haemoglobin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Serum free T4, T3 and TSH were also measured to evaluate the thyroid co-morbidity as a function of insulin resistance.
Results
In addition to insulin resistance, results of our study were focussed on thyroid comorbidity. In overweight diabetic patients, the ROC curve analyses demonstrated that the best marker for insulin resistance was Triacylglycerol/High density lipoprotein (TAG/HDL), with the area under the ROC curve being 0.902. Thyroxine (T4) was less significant when compared to TAG/HDL with area under the ROC curve of 0.583. Triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 were more significant in obese group with areas under the curve being 0.842 and 0.816 respectively when compared against insulin resistance (cut-off value for HOMA-IR 2.69). The optimal cut-off points for overweight were: TAG≥101mg/dl; T4≥1.16ng/dl; TAG/HDL≥2.26 whereas for obese: TC≥163.5mg/dl; TAG≥141.5mg/dl; T3≥2.42pg/ml; T4≥0.96ng/ml.
Conclusions
In overweight type 2 diabetics, TAG/HDL ratio could be used as a reliable marker for insulin resistance with thyroid co-morbidity and T3, T4 were better objective markers in obese type 2 diabetics."

Metabolic syndrome increases cardiovascular risk, and causes damage to the vascular wall. Through this mechanism, it might increase arterial rigidity, leading to further complications and heart strain. The use of a device that measures arterial rigidity can help determine if metabolic syndrome is related to a higher vascular stiffness and changes in estimated arterial age.
Methodology
Cross-sectional study at Luis Vernaza hospital of Guayaquil, Ecuador. Inpatients and outpatients from the Department of Cardiology with a full blood panel and echocardiogram were included. We used the IDF criteria to diagnose metabolic syndrome and measured arterial rigidity parameters in all of them, including augmentation indexes, central blood pressure, pulse wave velocity and arterial age.
Results
95 patients were included for analysis, 44.2% were females and 55.8% were males. Mean age was 61.7 years (±13.1). Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed in 49.5% of our patients and it was significantly more prevalent in women. We found significant differences in PWV, augmentation indexes, and peripheral and central blood pressure between metabolic and non-metabolic syndrome patients. There was a non-significant relationship between estimated arterial age and metabolic syndrome (p=0.32).
Conclusion
Patients with metabolic syndrome have an increased arterial rigidity. This, added to the high prevalence of the disease we found in our sample, shows the high cardiovascular risk these patients are at. A multidisciplinary approach to management is needed, along with patient collaboration. The introduction of these devices to measure arterial stiffness in developing countries can improve diagnosis and therapy of patients with cardio-metabolic conditions."

abstract = "Background
The relationship between thyroid function and lipid profile has been documented in T2DM and healthy subjects. The aim of the current study was to assess the association between thyroid hormone parameters and dyslipidemia in T2DM and non-diabetic study participants.
Method and materials
In this comparative cross-sectional study, 214 type 2 diabetic and 214 non-diabetic study participants were enrolled. Clinical and anthropometric data were collected from all study participants. After overnight fasting, 10ml of whole blood samples were drawn for the measurement of serum TSH, free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3), serum reactive C-protein levels, as well as for lipid profile test and glucose.
Result
The burden of hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism among T2DM study participants were 73 (17.05%) and 13 (3.04%) respectively. Comparatively, T2DM study participants had significantly higher serum lipid level than non-diabetics. Stratified by TSH, hypothyroid T2DM study participants had increased lipid level than euthyroid subjects. T2DM serum TSH have shown a positive significant correlation with all lipid profile parameters except HDL-C. In the final model (multivariate linear regression), diabetics serum TSH significantly and positively associated with TG and BMI. Diabetic serum fT3 and fT4 negatively associated with body mass index. In addition, diabetics serum fT3 negatively and serum fT4 positively associated with TC and HDL-C respectively.
Conclusion
T2DM study subjects had significantly higher lipid level than nondiabetic and We identified that TSH was positively associated with serum TG and BMI among T2DM study participants."

The efficacy of insulin therapy in diabetes depends on proper storage and injection technique. The purpose of this study was to assess the practice of insulin administration among diabetes patients in a tertiary care center.
Materials and methods
This observational study was done in Endocrinology department of a tertiary care center during April–June 2015. The consecutive patients using insulin for at least three months by either syringe or pen were recruited. All of them underwent a survey by the questionnaire which focused on key insulin injection parameters.
Results
One hundred and sixty eight (74.67%) patients were storing insulin vials properly. The thigh was the most common site of insulin injection and 209(92.89%) study participants were rotating at the injection sites. Only 48.57% (34/70) subjects were mixing insulin properly before injection. The practice of hand washing and the cleaning of the injection site was practiced by 158(70%) & 171(76.44%) subjects respectively. One hundred and fifty six (69%) patients were injecting with the proper skin fold and 123(55%) subjects were injecting insulin at 90° angle. The majority of patients (91%) were throwing the needle and syringes directly into the garbage and public drainage system.
Conclusions
There was a significant gap between the insulin administration guidelines and current insulin injection practice. The diabetic education and counseling about proper insulin injection techniques should be provided to all diabetic subjects."

To examine the influence of ethnicity and glucose tolerance status on subjective sensations and food intake in overweight/obese Asian and European Australians.
Methods
18 Asians and 26 Europids were classified as normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) based on serial measures of finger-prick glucose following an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Subjective sensations of hunger and satiety were measured before and every 15min after the OGTT using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Food intake was measured covertly from consumption of a buffet style lunch and from self-maintained 24h food records. All serial measurements were converted into total area under the curve (TAUC) and comparisons adjusted for age, fat and fat-free mass.
Results
There was a significant difference interaction between ethnicity (ETH) and glucose tolerance (GTT) for subjective fullness, desire for food and prospective food intake. IGT Asians had significantly greater sensations of fullness, but lesser prospective food and desire to eat, as compared to other groups. However there were no differences in calorie and macronutrient intake at buffet lunch or over 24-h.
Conclusion
Interactions between ethnicity and glucose tolerance status in subjective sensations did not transcribe to differences in prospective food intake."

Diabetes is a common problem in older adults, as they increasingly comprise a larger proportion of patients newly diagnosed with diabetes. The evidence on the prevalence and distribution of type 2 diabetes (DT2) and its related factors among older adults in Iran is sparse. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of DT2 among Iranian older adults aged ≥60years.
Materials and methods
The study was part of a comprehensive survey (Urban HEART-2) which was a large population-based cross-sectional study. A multistage cluster random sampling method was used to select the participants in Tehran in 2011. All the participants were interviewed by trained personnel using a standard questionnaire on diabetes as well as a socio-demographic checklist. Logistic regression and chi-square were used to investigate the association between diabetes and the demographic characteristics.
Results
A total of 15069 older adults were included in this analysis. The mean age of the participants was 68.93±7.27years (SE: 0.059) and the mean of BMI was 26.21±4.40kg/m2 (SE: 0.036). Prevalence of DT2 was 14.4% among Iranian older adults. Factors such as age, being female, high BMI, and education were significantly associated with DT2.
Conclusion
Given the high prevalence of diabetes among older people, more population based research is needed to quantify the ramifications of diabetes, and to monitor the effects of prevention and health system strengthening strategies on the prevalence, treatment, and control of DT2."

The objective of the study was to compare the diagnosis of dysglycemic states by conventional oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) criteria (fasting and 2-h plasma glucose) with the 1-h post-load plasma glucose level.
Material and methods
34 individuals (mean age: 55±13years; BMI: 27.7±6.3kg/m2) at risk for prediabetes were administered a 75g OGTT. Individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) or prediabetes were identified according to fasting and/or 2-h plasma glucose (PG) concentrations. Subsequently, subjects were divided in 2 groups: group 1 (n=21) with a 1-h PG<155mg/dl and group 2 (n=13) with a 1-h PG≥155mg/dl. HOMA was performed to assess β-cell function and insulin sensitivity.
Results
NGT or prediabetes based on conventional criteria correlated with the 1-h PG<or≥155mg/dl (p<0.001). Moreover, the 1-h PG≥155mg/dl was associated with higher HbA1c levels (6.1±0.5 vs. 5.5±0.3%, p<0.001) and significantly impaired insulin secretion and hyperbolic product (BxS) on HOMA test vs. 1-h PG<155mg/dl.
Conclusion
The 1-h post-load plasma glucose value ≥155mg/dl is strongly associated with conventional criteria for (pre)diabetes and alterations of β-cell function."

This pilot study aimed to investigate and compare the perceived pain relief effectiveness of two different modes of TENS in people with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN).
Methods
A cross-over study was conducted at Charles Sturt University, Orange. Five participants with PDN were assessed with a McGill Pain Questionnaire before and after each of the two TENS treatments. Participants were randomly allocated to Traditional TENS (80Hz, 200ms) or Acupuncture-like TENS (2Hz, 200ms) and the treatments were applied daily for 30min over ten days. Following a seven day washout period, the alternate mode of TENS was carried out using the same method. Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were used to statistically analyse the results.
Results
All five participants reported personally meaningful pain relief during one or both of the TENS treatments. The Wilcoxon signed rank testing showed no statistical significance, p=1, likely due to the small sample size. Acupuncture-like TENS had a large effect size (z=−1.625, r=0.514), whilst Traditional TENS produced a medium effect size (z=−1.214, r=0.384). No adverse effects were reported.
Conclusion
Acupuncture-like TENS may be more effective for PDN than traditional TENS. A larger scale replication of this pilot study is warranted."

A specially designed anonymous questionnaire was used, including both open and multiple choice questions set to evaluate the participant's awareness to MetS. The study included 126 participants, 71% physicians and 29% nurses. Mean age was 36.2±3.8 years. Among physicians, 68.5% were residents and 45.5% were internists. 98% of the participants stated that they were familiar with the term MetS and that they treat MetS patients regularly. Most participants knew the correct number of criteria included in MetS definition and the number of criteria needed for MetS diagnosis (84% and 90%, respectively). However, only 12% were able to discriminate correctly all MetS cases from non-MetS ones. Physicians performed better than nurses (15.6% and 3.1%, respectively, P=0.003). Neither, field of practice nor seniority was found to have a significant influence on the results. The frequency of recommendation for MetS risk factor modulation in the discharge files was also analyzed.

The increasing availability of antiretroviral drugs has made HIV-positive patients to live longer, and conditions that are associated with longevity such as metabolic syndrome and other cardiovascular related conditions have become relevant in them. This is less well studied among African populations. Therefore the study aimed at estimating and comparing the prevalence of and associated risk factors for the metabolic syndrome (MS) among African HIV infected patients.
Method
In this comparative cross-sectional study, we analyzed the data of 300 participants matched for age and gender who satisfied the inclusion criteria with half of the subjects on HAART, while the other half was HAART naïve. The MS was diagnosed using ATP-III criteria.
Results
The mean age of the patients was 34.8±9.9years. The majority of the patients were females 64%. The prevalence of MS among HAART-exposed patients was found to be 19.3%, while it was 5.3% among HAART naïve patients (p=0.001). Raised triglyceride and elevated blood pressure were the criteria with the highest occurrence among HAART-exposed, 82.8% for each. Advanced age, longer duration of HIV diagnosis and HAART exposure, increased BMI, weight gain after HAART exposure, exposure to PIs and increased mean CD4 cell count were found to be significantly associated with MS (p<0.05). However, only age (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.6-11.8, p=0.005) and BMI (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.5-11.9, p=0.007) were found to be independently associated with the development of MS.
Conclusion

Due to the presence of insulin resistance, PCOS increases the risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, hypertension, lipid disorders, cardiovascular diseases and malignancies such as breast and endometrial cancer. The actual cause of this syndrome is unknown but environmental factors such as dietary habits play an important role in prevention and treatment and lifestyle modifications are the most important therapeutic strategies in these patients. The approach of the diet therapy in these patients must be to reach specific goals such as improving insulin resistance, metabolic and reproductive functions that will be possible through the design of low-calorie diet to achieve weight loss or maintaining a healthy weight, limit the intake of simple sugars and refined carbohydrates and intake foods with a low glycemic index, reduction of saturated and trans fatty acids and attention to possible deficiencies such as vitamin D, chromium and omega-3. Given the prevalence of overweight and obesity and insulin resistance, a relatively low reduction in weight, about 5%, can improve problems such as insulin resistance, high levels of androgens, reproductive system dysfunctions and fertility in these women."

Chitotriosidase, is a macrophage sourced enzyme which shows high activity during the course of various storage disorders such as Gaucher's Disease. The aforementioned macrophage sourced enzyme, which has a role in basic immune response, is also high in patients with diabetes. This study was designed to determine the chitotriosidase activities in patients with diabetes and the relationship between the complication of diabetes and chitotriosidase activity.
Materials methods
This study included 76 patients with type2 diabetes mellitus and 76 healthy subjects. The chitotriosidase activity of all serum samples were determined by fluorometric method.
Results and conclusion
The chitotriosidase activity of patients having complications (neuropathy or nephropathy) were statistically significantly higher (p<0.05) than those of the controls. When the chitotriosidase activity of patients was evaluated regarding their glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, a progressive increase in chitotriosidase activity was observed in patients. The chitotriosidase activity of patients having higher HbA1c>10% levels was statistically significant higher than those of the control group's (p<0.05). It is shown that chitotriosidase activity might be a marker for some complications and is closely related to HbA1c levels."

The aim was to investigate relationships of Vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) polymorphisms to the components of MetS among Arabs adult residing in the United Arab Emirates.
Methods
A cross-sectional study of 198 Arabs adult (50 males and 148 females). Serum levels of glucose, vitamin D, HDL-C, and TG, and blood pressure were measured. FokI, BsmI & TaqI genotyping of VDR were investigated using PCR-RFLP technique.
Results
Age of the participants was 21(9) years with a BMI of 26.8(7.8) kg/m2. About 15% had MetS with serum vitamin D levels of 25.5(18.2) nmol/L. VDR genotyping yielded: FokI: 57.1% FF and 38.9% Ff, BsmI: 29.8% bb and 51.5% Bb, while TaqI showed 39.4% TT and 43.4% Tt. The ff carriers had higher total cholesterol [174(12.4) mg/dl] than FF and Ff genotypes. Bb carriers showed higher BMI and LDL-C than BB and bb genotypes. In females, FokI VDR polymorphism showed significant association with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and F allele carriers were at higher risk of developing high SBP [x2=4.4, df1, OR=0.29 (95%CI: 0.087–0.98), p=0.035].
Conclusion
VDR gene polymorphisms were not associated with MetS, yet it may affect the severity of some of components of MetS, namely the association of BsmI with obesity, FokI and BsmI with dyslipidemia and FokI with SBP."

Metabolic syndrome is a combination of insulin resistance, impaired glucose regulation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, microalbuminuria and obesity and this increases the risk for diabetes, myocardial infarction and thus increases the risk of mortality. Substance dependence is considered as a prominent risk factor for metabolic syndrome, but not much work has been done in this field. Thus this study is aimed to know the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in drug naïve substance users.
Materials and methods
A total of 50 consecutive indoor drug naive patients with substance dependence (as per ICD 10) were included. Metabolic syndrome was assessed as per WHO criteria for metabolic syndrome. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 17.0 software and Chi square test was applied.
Results
Of the 50 subjects (46% used alcohol; 26% used opioid and 28% were multiple substance users), a total of 20% of the subjects met the WHO criteria for metabolic syndrome and all of them were only alcoholics. Commonest abnormalities were low HDL (48%), raised SBP/DBP (26%/22%) and TG’s (18%). Age, weight, height, DBP and BMI were significant predictors of metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
Metabolic syndrome is a common entity seen in patients with substance abuse, especially in patients with alcohol use disorder, as seen in our study."

The purpose of this study is to summarise the empirical evidence addressing diabetes microvascular complications and management. The effects of diabetes mellitus include long–term damage, dysfunction and failure of various organs. Microvascular disease tends to occur predominantly in tissues where glucose uptake is independent of insulin activity because these tissues are exposed to glucose levels that correlate very closely with blood glucose levels. These metabolic injuries cause altered blood flow and changes in endothelial permeability, extravascular protein deposition and coagulation resulting in organ dysfunction which in turn lead to microvascular complications.
Method
A systematic search of the literature from 2000 to 2016 was conducted using four databases (Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane central and Google scholar) using search terms such as diabetic microvascular complications’, pathogenesis, screening, risk factors, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions and management.
Results
The current evidence supports a direct relationship between blood pressure (BP) and glycaemic control and progression of nephropathy and retinopathy. These are now considered as independent risk factors for microvascular disease progression. New fields of research addressing new drugs as potential therapeutic targets of the future will be presented.
Conclusion
The prevention of microvascular disease involves paying attention to aggravating risk factors and implementing screening programmes to improve early detection."

The clustering of components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major concern in a transition population because of dramatic changing toward modern life styles. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of clustering of various combinations of MetS and its association with obesity.
Methods and subjects
In a population- based cross-sectional study, a representative samples of 1000 adults were recruited in Babol, the north of Iran. The demographic data, blood pressure, body mass index and waist circumference (WC) were measured with standard method. Fasting blood sugar, serum levels of triglycerides, high density lipoprotein were measured with enzymatic method.
Results
A quarter of population had only one component of MetS. The prevalence of just two components was 30.7% and 26.2% in men and women respectively and about 67.1% of men and 73.3% of women had ≥2 risk factors (P=0.001). While the joint prevalence of three and four components was 22.0% and 12.0% in male and 27.3% and 16.5% in female respectively. The combination of high WC with any of other four components of MetS were significantly higher compared with any other joint combinations in particularly among women (P=0.001). The adjusted odds ratio for having clustering (≥2 risk factors) increased 5.6 times (95%CI: 2.15, 6.04) in obese subjects and remained at significant level after adjustment for age, sex, level of education.
Conclusion
An emerging high rate of clustering of joint combination of cardio metabolic risk factors highlights an urgent intervention for life style modification in public health management."

Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases among the elderly and is also a very serious health problem. Adopting theory-based self-care behaviors is an effective means in managing such diseases. This study aimed to determine the predictors of diabetes self-care in the elderly in Kerman based on a social cognitive theory.
Material and methods
In this cross-sectional study, 384 elderly diabetic patients who had referred to health screening centers in Kerman were chosen via cluster sampling. To collect information about self-care and its predictors, Toobert Glasgow's diabetes self-efficacy scale as well as a questionnaire was used which was based on social cognitive theory constructs. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire was confirmed. The data were analyzed using Pearson correlation and linear regression analysis in SPSS software 17.
Findings
Among the subjects, 67.37% (252) had poor self-care ability; 29.14% (109) had average ability, and 3.40% (13) enjoyed a proper level of self- care ability. There was a significant relationship between the constructs of the social cognitive theory (knowledge, self- efficacy, social support, outcome expectations, outcome expectancy and self-regulation) and the self-care score. Furthermore, the mentioned constructs could predict 0.47% of the variance of the self-care behaviors.
Conclusion
self-care behaviors in this study were poor. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an educational intervention based on cognitive theory constructs with the goal of properly managing diabetes in the elderly patients."

Numerous studies have assessed the association between Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, results have been conflicting due to variability in definitions of NAFLD and ascertainment of CVD, often combining clinical and surrogate endpoints. We therefore systematically reviewed published literature to assess the association between NAFLD and clinical cardiovascular events (CVE) and performed a meta-analysis.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases using terms “nonalcoholic fatty liver disease”, “nonalcoholic steatohepatitis”, “cardiovascular disease”, and their combinations to identify prospective studies published from inception through March 2016. Data from selected studies was extracted and meta-analysis was then performed using random effects model.
Results
A total of six studies with 25,837 patients (NAFLD: 5953; controls: 19,884) were included in the final analysis. Patients with NAFLD had a significantly higher risk of clinical CVE compared to controls (RR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.26–2.48, p<0.001). Exclusion sensitivity analysis did not alter the above results. The association remained consistent for subgroups with clinical coronary artery disease (RR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.04–4.92, p<0.001) and ischemic stroke (RR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.46–2.98, p<0.001). The risk of cardiovascular mortality was also increased in the NAFLD group (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.31–1.64, p<0.001).
Conclusion
NAFLD patients have a significantly higher risk for clinical CVE compared to those without. These results need to be confirmed in large prospective studies."

abstract = "Aim
As diabetes mellitus is multi-factorial disease, use of several oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) is the main stay of pharmacological treatment. The treatment has become more challenging and controversial as OHAs are heterogeneous in their mode of action that causes unwanted side effects. Complementary approaches such as use of medicinal plants and dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activities are therefore imperative. A vast literature has independently documented the effects of OHAs, medicinal plants and PUFA for management of diabetes. In the present article, we have reviewed the current literature to describe the effects of commonly used OHAs, their mechanisms of action and reported controversies. The antidiabetic potential of herbs and/or formulations and omega-3 PUFA with its potential benefits and mode of action is also discussed.
Methods
PUBMED, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library etc., were searched for relevant articles using appropriate terms (until February 2015). Human and animal studies were selected for the review. Data extraction was carried out by one author and checked by second author.
Results
There is still controversy over the safety profile of OHAs. Medicinal herbs with hypoglycemic activities are increasingly sought because of its natural origin, active constituents and minimal side effects. The current literature suggests that supplementation with PUFA improves macro- and microvascular complications.
Conclusion
There is a need for best possible individualized treatment based on variations in biochemical parameters with combinational therapy of nutritional/herbal supplementations. Such a combination may be helpful for better management of diabetes and its complications."

There is no consensus as to which Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) definition to use for South-American populations. The aim of this study is to compare the prevalence of MetS and abdominal obesity using different criteria in Andean adults aged 40 and older living permanently at high altitude.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study in Chivay (Andean highlands). 237 participants were included. Anthropometric measurements, glucose and lipid assessments were done in all subjects. Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria for MetS were used. Abdominal obesity prevalence was determined using the American Diabetes Association (ADA), IDF, and PREVENCION Study criteria. Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (κ) was analyzed to assess agreement level between different criteria. Multiple regression analyses were performed to find predictors for waist circumference.
Results
MetS was identified in 28.7% (95%CI=23.8–33.5) using ATPIII criteria, and 37.9% (95%CI=32.7–43.0) using IDF criteria, with higher prevalence in women. The κ statistics for agreement between both criteria was 0.775 (95%CI=0.690–0.859). Abdominal obesity prevalence according to ADA, IDF, and PREVENCION criteria was 35.9% (95%CI=29.7–42.0), 75.9% (95%CI=70.5–81.4), and 42.6% (95%CI=36.3–49.0), respectively. Agreement between ADA and PREVENCION criteria was highest (κ=0.859, 95%CI=0.792–0.925). The strongest predictors for higher waist circumference values were triglycerides and BMI in women, and systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, and HDL-cholesterol in men.
Conclusions
MetS according to ATP III and IDF criteria was highly prevalent. IDF criteria identified a larger number of subjects with MetS. Different abdominal obesity criteria tended to show variation when applied to our sample population."

Occurrence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is rising steadily, with subsequent increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent studies have shown that PCSK9 plays a substantial role in atherogenic dyslipidemia. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess level of PCSK9 and its relationship with MetS components among young adult females.
Methods
This study was carried out on 137 adult females over 18 years of age residing in the UAE. Subjects were categorized into two groups according to waist circumferences (WC): normal (<80cm; n=41) and large (≥80cm; n=96). Anthropometric and biochemical parameters in the fasting state (glucose, insulin, lipid profile, and PCSK9) were determined using conventional techniques. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and MetS scores were calculated as appropriate.
Results
PCSK9 was lower in subjects with large WC compared to normal WC (p=0.016). PCSK9 correlated negatively with measures of obesity (p<0.05), and positively with IR (r=0.425, p<0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the strongest predictor of PCSK9 was IR (B=6.213; p<0.001), followed by WC (B=−2.488; p<0.001) and triglycerides (B=0.897; p=0.013).
Conclusion
Results from this study demonstrate that PCSK9 correlates with some components of metabolic syndrome and central obesity in young females. Such findings support the suggestion of using PCSK9 inhibitors in the management of MetS to modify risk for development of CVD."

In order to better clarify the epidemiological risk related to HDL of different size/density, without resorting to direct measures, it would seem appropriate to adjust HDL-C to the level of its main apolipoprotein (apoA-I), thereby providing an [HDL-C/apoA-I] ratio. The latter allows not only to estimate an average size for HDLs, but also to derive indices on particle number, cholesterol load, and density. So far, the potential usefulness of this ratio in diabetes is barely addressed. To this end, we sorted 488 male patients with T2DM according to [HDL-C/apoA-I] quartiles (Q), to determine how the ratio relates to cardiometabolic risk, β-cell function, glycaemic control, and micro- and macrovascular complications. Five lipid parameters were derived from the combined determination of HDL-C and apoA-I, namely HDL size; particle number; cholesterol load/particle; apoA-I/particle; and particle density. An unfavorable cardiometabolic profile characterized patients from QI and QII, in which HDLs were pro-atherogenic, denser and apoA-I-depleted. By contrast, QIII patients had an [HDL-C/apoA-I] ratio close to that of non-diabetic controls. QIV patients had better than average HDL size and composition, and in those patients whose [HDL-C/apoA-I] ratio was above normal, a more favorable phenotype was observed regarding lifestyle, anthropometry, metabolic comorbidities, insulin sensitivity, MetS score/severity, glycaemic control, and target-organ damage pregalence in small or large vessels. In conclusion, [HDL-C/apoA-I] and the resulting indices of HDL composition and functionality predict macrovascular risk and β-cell function decline, as well as overall microangiopathic risk, suggesting that this ratio could serve both in cardiometabolic assessment and as biomarker of vascular complications."

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus develop many complications including osteopenia, which is associated with high fracture risk. Osteocalcin is a non collagenous protein derived from the osteoblasts. Recently, it was found that osteocalcin enhances the pancreatic beta cell proliferation, insulin secretion and protection against type 2 diabetes.
Objective
Investigation of the association of serum osteocalcin and other bone turnover markers with blood glucose level and diabetes mellitus duration in type 2 diabetic patients.
Subjects and methods
Twenty diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients together with 20 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Serum osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium concentrations were measured by commercial ELISA kits.
Results
The results showed that type 2 diabetic patients exhibited a significantly lower serum osteocalcin and calcium (p=0.0001 and 0.002 respectively) and a higher alkaline phosphatase (p=0.008) compared to the controls. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that serum osteocalcin was inversely associated with fasting blood glucose and Diabetes Mellitus duration (β=− 0.018; p=0.007 and β=− 0.085; p=0.014 respectively) in Type 2 diabetic patients. In addition, alkaline phosphatase was positively associated (β=0.828; p=0.015) while serum calcium was negatively associated (β=− 0.046; p=0.048) with Diabetes Mellitus duration.
Conclusion
These results refer to the strong association between diabetes and bone turnover markers and call for monitoring of diabetes-associated osteopenia in type 2 diabetic patients."

Blood samples were collected for HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FBG), 2-h after breakfast (2-hBG), total cholesterol (chol), triglyceride (TG), LDL, HDL, Hb% and serum creatinine. All the complications were taken from the medical record books which was diagnosed by physician.
Results
A total of 400 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients were investigated in this study. The mean and SD of age was 50.05±7.54. The male and female subjects were 41.5% and 58.5% respectively. The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy was 12.3%, 21.3% and 16.8% respectively. Logistic regression model estimated that increasing age (age>50y; OR=3.04; p=<0.001), female participants (OR=1.35; p=<0.04), rural patients (OR=3.75; p=<0.001), housewife (OR=1.89; p=<0.01) and retired patients (2.50; p=<0.03), lack of physical exercise, increasing HbA1c (p=<0.001), FBG (p=<0.001), 2-hBG (<0.001) and blood pressure (p=0.000) had independent significant risk factors for any of three microvascular complications.
Conclusion
This study observed that about all the microvascular complications were developed from first three years after registration at BIRDEM. Increasing age, HbA1c, FBG, 2-hBG and blood pressure had significant risk factors for any type of microvascular complications."

To investigate the association between overweight and obesity (in terms of BMI) and diabetes, HBP and diabetes-HBP comorbidity among adult women non-pregnant in Bangladesh.
Methods
Information about demographics, socioeconomic, blood pressure and blood glucose levels were collected for 2022 women ageing above 35 years were collected from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS 2011). The primary outcome variables were diabetes and high blood pressure. Diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose value ≥7.0mmol/L and HBP as systolic blood pressure ≥140mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90mmHg. Blood pressure and plasma glucose measurement were performed by standard clinical procedures. Data were analysed using cross-tabulation, chi-square tests and logistic regression methods.
Results
Mean age of the participants was 41.42 (SD=4.37). 38.7% of the women had BMI values ≥25. The prevalence of HBP, diabetes, and diabetes-HBP comorbidity was respectively 18% and 5.1%, and 2%. The adjusted odds of having diabetes, HBP and Diabetes-HBP comorbidity were respectively 2.14 (p=0.002; 95%CI=1.31–3.48), 2.3 (p=<0.0001; 95%CI=1.70–2.98), and 3.4 (p=0.004; 95%CI=1.47–7.81) times higher among overweight/obese women compared to those with normal weight.
Conclusions
Overweight and obesity account for a major proportion of diabetes, HBP and the comorbidity of these two among non-pregnant women. There remains a considerable risk for future expansion of diabetes and HBP as the prevalence of overweight/obesity is rising constantly. Maintaining a healthy BMI needs to be regarded as among the most important diabetes and HBP preventive strategies among Bangladeshi women."

In kidney, renal pathological changes leading to diabetic nephropathy are mainly secondary to atherosclerosis of the intra and extra renal arteries together with microangiopathy of the glomerular capillaries, afferent arterioles and efferent arterioles. Renal resistive index (RRI) is defined as a ratio of the difference between maximum and minimum (end-diastolic) flow velocity to maximum flow velocity derived from the Doppler measurements of main renal and intrarenal (segmental/interlobar) arteries. Renal resistive index is tightly related to renal arteriolosclerosis, and represents an integrated index of arterial compliance, pulsatility and downstream microvascular impedance. In meantime, growing suggest that RRI has also been closely related with atherosclerosis. Most studies performed in type 2 diabetes showed RRI is increased in type 2 diabetes. In this review, we summarize the data regarding RRI with regard to performed studies, pathogenesis and prognosis, especially focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D). We also review the data regarding the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and RRI."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus has assumed pandemic proportions worldwide. Aggressive management of hyperglycemia in diabetics is a primary goal of treatment. We have previously reported favorable effects of oral hypoglycemic agents on adipocytokines. Aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship of adipocytokines with anthropometric measures and biochemical parameters in type 2 diabetics.
Methods
Clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetics and age, gender matched healthy volunteers were recruited for study. Anthropometric measurements like height, weight, waist-circumference, hip-circumference were recorded and BMI, waist-hip ratio were calculated. Fasting blood samples were collected from participants and sera were analyzed for glucose, glycated haemoglobin, total cholesterol, SGOT, SGPT, insulin, adiponectin and leptin. Correlation of adipocytokines with anthropometric and biochemical parameters was assessed in healthy and diabetic individuals.
Results
BMI and WHR in diabetics were significantly higher than healthy population. BMI did not show significant association with adipocytokines. Diabetic males with WHR≥0.9 showed negative association with adiponectin and positive association with leptin. WC did not show significant association with adipocytokines in males. Irrespective of WC, healthy females exhibited positive association with leptin. Diabetic females with WC≥88cm showed leptin to be positively associated with WC. Such association of adipocytokines with WHR was not detected in females.
Conclusions
Body fat distribution can be considered as a parameter in assessing adipokine imbalance. Central adiposity is a better measure of adipokine imbalance than BMI. Abdominal obesity in diabetics correlates with altered levels of adipocytokines indicating its importance in diabetic individuals."

To determine the levels of plasma osteocalcin (OC) in Nigerians with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and compare these to levels in non-diabetic controls (NDM). To assess the relationship of OC to glycaemic control and parameters of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and compare its levels in Nigerians with and without MetS.
Methods
The waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure of 200 study participants were taken. Plasma osteocalcin, fasting glucose (FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and triglyceride (TG) levels were determined. Metabolic syndrome was defined by the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Statistical significance was set at 0.05.
Results
Osteocalcin levels were lower in the DM group (p=0.002) and inversely related to FPG (r=−0.198, p=0.003), HbA1c (r=−0.313, p<0.001), BMI (r=−0.331, p<0.001), WC (r=−0.339, p<0.001) and TG (r=−0.145, p=0.040), but directly related to HDL-c levels (r=0.166, p=0.019). Osteocalcin was higher in participants without MetS (Median 8.75ng/mL IQR[5.48-12.68]ng/mL) than in those with MetS (Median 4.74ng/Ml, IQR[2.80–9.12]ng/mL), p<0.001.
Conclusions
Plasma osteocalcin levels are inversely associated with good glycaemic control and components of MetS and are lower in individuals with DM and in those with MetS. These findings support a vital role of the bone, in the regulation of glucose and energy metabolism, in Nigerians. Further extensive studies are required to explore the potentials of OC in the management of DM and MetS."

Aim of the study was to detect the level of comprehensive diabetes control among the diabetic patients of Kerala, India.
Method
Patients (1200) were randomly selected from a diabetes care center. Their blood sugar and other biochemical and anthropometric measurements were done and statistically analyzed.
Result
Only 28.3% had their A1C at or below 7% and 45% above 9%. 1/3rd of the female and 1/5th of the male patients had CAD. The prevalence of hypertension was almost equal in both sexes. However, there was a statistically significant higher systolic BP (mean 162.12mm Hg vs 147.49mm Hg, p=0.01044) among females. The total Cholesterol was above 200mg/dl in 42.1% of males and 45.61% of females. The triglyceride was >150mg/dl in 38.6% males and 50.88% females. Low HDL cholesterol levels were found in 20.07% of males and 41.12% of females (p=0.0445). The mean LDL was 121.75 (±32.29247)
Discussion
The mean blood sugar values are found to be high which will lead to a predictable increase in vascular disease, which in turn will affect the quality of health and productivity of the individual and the economic growth of the society as a whole. Studies suggest that therapeutic interventions to improve glycemic control may reduce the risk of CVD and microvascular disease.
Conclusion
This study shows that the level of diabetes control in Kerala is unsatisfactory. We need more medications, better strategies, and more emphasis on glycemic management than we are currently able to apply."

The impact of fasting blood glucose levels (FBG) and disease duration on type 2 diabetes in Indian population is still unclear. The present study examines gender-dependent effects of FBG and disease duration on lipid profile, adipocytokines and related biochemical parameters in diabetic individuals.
Methods
Type 2 diabetic individuals (n=100) were classified depending on FBG: patients with normal FBG (Glucose<126mg/dl) and patients with high FBG (Glucose≥126mg/dl); and disease duration: ≥0–≤3yr, >3–≤7yr, >7yr.
Results
Males with high FBG had significantly higher serum glucose, triglycerides, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and waist hip ratio (WHR) than males with normal FBG. Females with high FBG had significant increase in serum glucose, adiponectin and creatinine while decrease in leptin levels than females with normal FBG. Males with high FBG had higher WHR, superoxide dismutase, SGOT, SGPT and lower adiponectin, leptin than females with high FBG. Significant positive association was observed between glucose and cholesterol, triglyceride, VLDL and urea in males with high FBG. With chronic diabetes for >7yr, males had increased systolic blood pressure, glucose, LDL, urea and low catalase activity as compared to other disease duration groups. However, females had higher adiponectin, creatinine and lower body mass index and cholesterol.
Conclusions
High FBG in males adversely affects lipid profile, adipocytokines and liver function. Some of these effects exacerbate as disease progresses. Higher adiponectin may have desirable effects on metabolic markers in females."

The use of pharmacological therapy is often limited in some patients due to a loss of effect over time or development of adverse effects such as weight gain or hypoglycaemia. This has prompted searches into the role of non-pharmacological therapies in T2DM. The availability and use of vitamin supplements in developed countries have increased significantly and there is evidence that certain vitamins may have roles in the management of T2DM. This review examines the literature assessing the use of vitamins A, C, E, D, K and the B group vitamins (B1, B3, B7, B6, B9, B12) in the management of T2DM. No clear evidence supporting the beneficial role of any specific vitamin in the treatment of T2DM was found.

The sodium glucose co-transporters 2 inhibitors are a new class of glucose-lowering agents, which act through a novel mechanism by producing a decline in glucose re-absorption in the kidney, thereby increasing glycosuria and decreasing serum glucose levels. Data suggest that apart from lowering HbA1c, they produce a small but significant weight loss and a small decrease in blood pressure. Also, they possess nephro-protective potential. These drugs are demonstrated to restore intra-glomerular pressure by increasing angiotensin (1–7), which exerts vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Their profile on cardiovascular events is still under investigation. In this review, the pleiotropic potential of this novel class of glucose-lowering levels will be discussed. Further research is warranted to determine their safety in the long term."

The aim of this study was to detect any association of fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) rs9939609 variant to metabolic and anthropometric parameters and resistin level as adipokines in Iranian obese women with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Material and Methods
Totally, 42 diabetic and 36 non-diabetic women were selected. The PCR amplicons of FTO gene were sequenced and metabolic, anthropometric parameters and resistin level were measured.
Results
Serum resistin concentrations were not different between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects (p>0.05), while resistin level in diabetic group with AA genotype was lower than that with other genotypes in the same group. In rs9939609 SNP adjusted analysis, insulin and HOMA levels were high in AA genotype. While levels of FBS and HbA1c were higher in AA and AT genotypes. In diabetic group, only TG showed significant difference among three genotypes and mean of TG was higher in TA genotype. No significant correlation between resistin and anthropometric and metabolic parameters was found except for DBP in diabetic patients.
Conclusion
There was no significant association between rs9939609 and resistin serum level in type 2 obese diabetic women while percentile ranges (25th, 50th and 75th) of resistin concentrations was high in diabetic group."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major health problem in Sudan and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of glycaemic control among individuals with type 2 diabetes across different cities in Sudan.
Methods
Individuals with type 2 diabetes attending selected diabetes centres in Sudan, who had been on treatment for DM for at least one year and volunteered to participate were included. Participants were interviewed using standardized pretested questionnaire to record medical history, sociodemographic and life style characteristics. Lipid profile and glycosylated hemoglobin were tested by calibrated laboratory methods. Blood pressure, Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were measured. Chi squared and logistic regression were used as statistical methods.
Results
A total of 387 individuals with T2DM were included in this study (50.4% males and 49.6% females). The glycemic control indicator (HbAIc>7) was poor in 85% of patients. Factors associated with poor glycemic control were prolonged duration of diabetes (p=0.03), high plasma triglyceride (p=0.02), low high density lipoprotein (HDL) level (p=0.04) and low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (P=0.01). Logistic regression analysis showed that low GFR is independent factor with poor diabetes control.
Conclusion
High prevalence of uncontrolled diabetes (85%) is noted in Sudanese individuals with type 2 diabetes."

The aim of this study
The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between metabolic syndrome and its components with bone mineral density in post menopausal women referred for bone mineral density (BMD) test.
Methods
A total of 143 postmenopausal women with at least one year of menopause experience participated in this cross-sectional study. Demographic and anthropometric characteristics for all participants were collected. Also, biochemical parameters including fasting blood sugar, Cholesterol (HDL and LDL), triglyceride were measured. Association between the components of metabolic syndrome and bone densitometry were analyzed by statistical methods.
Results
In this study, 72% of participants did not have metabolic syndrome. Among them, 43.4% and 28.7% had osteoporosis and normal density, respectively. Of remaining participants with metabolic syndrome, 12.6% and 15.4% had osteoporosis and normal density, respectively. Among the metabolic syndrome components, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, and waist to hip ratio were significantly associated with bone mass (P<0.05). Osteoporotic women had lower waist circumference and waist to hip ratio and higher HDL than women without osteoporosis. On the other hand, women with metabolic syndrome did not have significant differences than women without metabolic syndrome in terms of lumbar and femoral neck density (P>0.05).
Conclusion
Results from this study showed that metabolic syndrome and its components did not induce bone mass loss. The discrepancies of the studies in this area call for more large scale studies in population so as to prevent women problems in this area."

Recent studies indicate that modulation of post prandial blood sugar (PPBS) plays an important role in the long term glycemic control. Measurement of PPBS is more convenient for patients attending outpatient clinics than fasting blood sugar (FBS) as the former needs only two hours of fasting from the last meal.
Objective
To assess the value of PPBS monitoring in optimization of long term glycemic control among diabetic patients attending an outpatient clinic.
Methods
A total of 240 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) attending an out-patient medical clinic were randomized to either PPBS or FBS monitoring. Those who selected to PPBS-group underwent blood sugar measurement 2-h after last meal on the day of their clinic visits and those in the FBS group underwent blood sugar measurement after fasting overnight (8–10h) in the morning of their clinic visits. Treating team was asked to optimize the anti-diabetic medications based on the available PPBS or FBS results. All patients were followed up monthly for six months. Glycemic control was assessed with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline and six months later.
Results
Baseline characteristics of the two arms including age, gender, and duration of T2DM were not significantly different. Mean HbA1c (SD) of FBS and PPBS arms at baseline were 7.20 (0.45), and 7.33 (0.43) and were not significantly different (P=0.115). During the study period, HbA1c dropped by 0.20 in FBS arm compared to 0.25 drop in PPBS arm (p=0.59). Incidence of hypoglycemia was similar in FBS (2.42%) and PPBS arms (2.70%).
Conclusion
Monitoring of PPBS is a safe and effective alternative to FBS to optimize glycemic control in managing patients with T2DM attending outpatient clinics."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) among chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients increases risks for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and more rapid progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aim to evaluate the prevalence of DM and MetSyn among HCV patients, focusing on age-specific and race/ethnicity-specific disparities.
Methods
We retrospectively evaluated 2003–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data for age and race disparities in concurrent DM and MetSyn among HCV patients. Multivariate logistic regression models evaluated for independent predictors of DM and MetSyn among HCV patients.
Results
Overall U.S. prevalence of HCV was 1.29% from 2003 to 2012 and prevalence of DM and MetSyn among HCV patients was 17.5% and 35.0%, respectively. Higher rates of DM (36.9% vs. 3.3%, p<0.001) and MetSyn (50.5% vs. 11.7%, p<0.001) were seen among HCV patients ≥60 compared to <40years. The highest rates of DM and MetSyn were seen among African Americans (AA) (DM: 39.1%, MetSyn: 29.2%) and the lowest in non-Hispanic whites (DM: 9.4%, MetSyn: 33.0%). On multivariate regression, patients ≥60 were significantly more likely to have DM compared to patients <40 years (OR 11.90, 95% CI 2.73–52.60, p=0.001); AA were significantly more likely to have DM compared to non-Hispanic whites (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.53–5.20, p=0.001).
Conclusion
Among chronic HCV patients, the highest risk of DM and MetSyn was seen among older patients, African Americans, and women. These groups are at higher risk of cirrhosis and HCC due to concurrent NAFLD."

abstract = "Aims
Basal insulin has been shown to effectively reduce fasting blood glucose (FBG), but postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) excursions may remain higher than normal. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists such as the short-acting lixisenatide are able to control such excursions by slowing gastric emptying. However, data regarding its use in a real world clinical setting are scarce.
Methods
24 week, prospective, multicentre, non-interventional study in 1437 patients with type-2 diabetes receiving 20μg lixisenatide once daily in combination with basal insulin. The per-protocol set (PPS) comprised 540 patients.
Results
HbA1c levels were found to decrease significantly over 24 weeks of treatment in the PPS (0.94±0.99% [7.9±8.5]; p≤0.001). An HbA1c of <7% (53mmol/mol) was achieved in 26.9% of patients, with 9.8% reaching <6.5% (48mmol/mol) and 30.0% reaching their individual treatment goal. There was a slight decrease in FBG (2.84±30.4mg/dl; p≤0.001), and a significant reduction in PPG, with levels decreasing by between 35mg/dl (1.9mmol/l) and 38mg/dl (2.1mmol/l), respectively on average after all main meals in basal optimised patients (PPS; ≤140mg/dl). Body weight decreased from 101 to 98kg with a mean difference of 3.10±4.10kg (p≤0.001). There were few reports of hypoglycaemia and no reports of serious hypoglycaemia and need for external help. AEs were infrequent, and were in line with previous studies.
Conclusions
Lixisenatide in combination with basal insulin was shown to be an effective treatment strategy for patients with type 2 diabetes, controlling HbA1c levels by reduction of PPG excursions during the whole day."

Introduction
Diabetic nephropathy is responsible for nearly third of the world cases of end stage renal disease; it becomes a major public health problem with social and economic burden. The aim of this study is to explore if there is an association between retinopathy and nephropathy.
Material and Methods
In a cross sectional hospital based study a total of 316 individuals with diabetes were recruited from Makkah eye complex retina clinic. Demographic data, medical history and life style characteristics were taken through standard questionnaire. In addition, urine samples were collected to check for presence of albuminuria, blood samples were taken to measure HbA1c, lipid profile and renal function test.
Results
The mean age of participants was 58±10 years old. Only 39.8 and 40.2% of females were diagnosed with retinopathy and nephropathy, respectively. In addition, 60.2 and 59.8% of males were diagnosed with retinopathy and nephropathy, respectively. Hypertension was identified as risk factors for both retinopathy and nephropathy (P<0.001 and P<0.07). Serum creatinine and blood urea are significantly associated with retinopathy (P<0.01 and P<0.01). Body mass index (BMI) and HbA1c are not significantly associated with retinopathy and nephropathy. The prevalence of nephropathy among individuals with retinopathy was 35.6%. There was significant association between nephropathy and development of retinopathy (P<0.01). Logistic regression showed that two absolute risk factors are: nephropathy and having hypertension with P value of 0.009 and 0.003, respectively.

The number of diabetic patients is increasing in the world. Peripheral neuropathy is the most important problem of diabetes. Neuropathy eventually leads to balance impairment which is the main cause of falling down in these patients However, not sufficient evidences available to compare different protocols for improving balance in diabetic patients.
Objective
This study aimed to compare the effects of two therapeutic exercises on clinical balance measures in patients with type II diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
Methods
The study was performed on 60 patients with diabetes categorized randomly into three groups: an intervention group (N=20) that received ball training exercise, another intervention group (N=20) that received Frenkel exercise and a control group (N=20) that received no interventions. Exercise training session was performed for 3 weeks. Then, clinical balance measures were computed in the three groups. Paired t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the collected data.
Results
Both types of therapeutic exercise programs significantly improved balance in single leg stance, star excursion test, and Berg balance scale test (P˂0.05) compared to the control group. Besides, this was more significant in the ball training group (P˂0.05).

abstract = "Aims
To determine occupational association with metabolic syndrome among auto technicians and school teachers.
Methods
One hundred and sixty six subjects were selected for this study. Clinical data was obtained while laboratory investigations including plasma glucose and lipid profile were performed. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS 20.0. P<0.05 was taken as statistically significant.
Results
School teachers had significantly higher mean total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol compared to auto technicians. Mean serum triglycerides was significantly higher among auto-technicians compared to school teachers in this study. The prevalence of some conventional cardiovascular risk factors was significantly higher among auto-technicians compared to school teachers: Impaired blood glucose (9.6% vs. 1.2%, p<0.05), hypertriglyceridaemia (18.1% vs. 7.2%, p<0.05) and low HDL-Cholesterol (47.0% vs. 37.3%, p<0.05) respectively. However elevated LDL-cholesterol (56.6% vs. 32.5%, p<0.05) was significantly more common among school teachers compared to auto-technicians. Based on the WHO and the Harmonized criteria, metabolic syndrome was more frequent among auto-technicians compared to school teachers. (8.4% vs. 1.2% and 19.3% vs. 7.2% respectively, p<0.05)
Conclusion
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome appears to be significantly higher among auto technicians despite their high level of physical activity, exertion and education compared to teachers. This may be related to the increased occupational exposure to organic and inorganic materials from dust particles, oil and oil related matter and particulate matter among auto technicians. Prompt definitive evaluation of this concept and appropriate health education to encourage safety mechanism can reduce this burden of metabolic syndrome among auto technicians in Nigeria."

To analyze the lipid profile of older people aged ≥80 years according to body composition (high fat mass, low muscle mass and both).
Material and method
: The sample consisted of 113 older people aged ≥80 years. The assessment of body composition was made using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and the lipid profile analysis using an enzymatic colorimetric kit. We used Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test to compare the mean of lipid profile according to body composition and were constructed logistic regression models to verify the association between these two variables.
Results
It was found that older people with high fat had higher mean values of TG compared to normal and low muscle mass group. Older people with low muscle mass showed mean values of LDL-c lower than other groups. It was observed that older people with high fat is more likely to have (OR 2.70; 95%CI 1.14-6.37) high blood concentration of TG.
Conclusion
Thus, it appears that high fat is related to the high blood concentration of TG in older people aged ≥80 years, especially those with Asian origin and diabetes besides those with low muscle mass shows lower mean values of LDL-c."

abstract = "Aims
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) increases atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) is a diagnostic criterion of MetS and a major ASCVD risk factor. HDL particle concentration (HDL-P) associates with incident ASCVD independent of HDL-C, but its association with incident MetS has not been studied. We hypothesized that HDL-P would be inversely associated with incident metabolic syndrome independent of HDL-C and markers of adiposity and insulin resistance.
Materials and methods
HDL-P was measured by NMR and visceral fat by MRI in participants of the Dallas Heart Study, a probability-based population sample of adults age 30–65. Participants with prevalent MetS, DM, CVD, and any systemic illlness were excluded. Incident MetS as defined by NCEP ATPIII criteria was determined in all participants after median follow-up period of 7.0 years.
Results
Among 1120 participants without DM or MetS at baseline (57% women, 45% Black, mean age 43), 22.8% had incident MetS at follow-up. HDL-P and HDL-C were modestly correlated (r=0.54, p<0.0001). In models adjusted for traditional risk factors and MetS risk factors including visceral fat, HS-CRP, triglyceride to HDL-C ratio, and HOMA-IR, the lowest quartile of HDL-P was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of incident MetS (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.4–3.1; p=0.0003).
Conclusions
Low HDL-P is independently associated with incident MetS after adjustment for traditional risk factors, lipid parameters, adiposity, inflammation, and markers of insulin resistance. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and elucidate the mechanisms underpinning this association."

To describe the prevalence of abdominal obesity and its association with cardio metabolic risk factors among older adults in Ecuador.
Materials and methods
The present study used data from the National Survey of Health, Wellbeing, and Aging survey to examine the prevalence of abdominal obesity according to certain demographic, behavioral, and health characteristics of the participants. Logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to evaluate the association of abdominal obesity with cardio metabolic risk factors.
Results
Of 2053 participants aged 60 years and older, the prevalence of abdominal obesity was 65.9% (95% CI; 62.2%, 69.4%) in women and 16.3% (95% CI; 13.8%, 19.2%) in men. Notably, a higher prevalence of abdominal obesity was seen among residents in the urban areas of the country, those who reported their race as black or mulatto, individuals with sedentary lifestyle and obesity, and older adults with greater number of comorbidities. Moreover, after adjustment for potential confounders, women with abdominal obesity were 2.0, 2.8, and 1.6 times more likely to have diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and hypertriglyceridemia as compared with those without, respectively. Likewise, men with abdominal obesity had 51% and 22% higher rates of hypertension and diabetes than their non-obese counterparts, respectively.
Conclusions
the prevalence of abdominal obesity is high among older adults in Ecuador. Moreover, abdominal obesity is significantly associated with cardio metabolic risk factors. Therefore, further research is needed to evaluate sociodemographic and nutritional determinants of this emerging public health burden among older Ecuadorians."

Pregnant mothers with diabetes, especially in developing countries, are particularly prone to suffer from dietary imbalances due to superstitions and irrational beliefs and practices. The study aimed to explore the existing beliefs and practices related to food intake among Bangladeshi diabetic pregnant mothers.
Material & methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 200 diabetic pregnant mothers (age in yrs, M±SD, 30±4), selected purposively from outpatient department of Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation in Diabetes, Endocrine & Metabolic Disorders. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. SPSS 16.0 were used for data analysis.
Results
About 40% mothers had uncontrolled glycaemic status. 43% mothers believed that food should not be taken during the ‘call for prayer’ and 91% of them practiced it. For ‘eclipse’ the percentage of such kind of belief was much higher (80%) and 90% of them practiced it. With varying proportion for particular fishes 44–58% respondents believed that some fishes should be avoided due to the increased movement of child, fetal malformation and disease. 93% actually practiced it. 28% had adverse beliefs about duck meat, 78% pineapple and 8% had about coconut. The corresponding percentages for practice were 82%, 99% and 50% respectively. Mentally and physically abnormal child, different kinds of child illness and threat of abortion were among the reasons for misbeliefs about those foods.
Conclusion
There are a number of nonscientific beliefs and prejudices among this pregnant mother regarding the intake of food."

Material and methods
In this study a questionnaire to assess general population awareness about type II diabetes disease and its complications was Design, developing and validation based on 10 experts’ panel and statistical inferences.
Results
Initially 67 questions designed and according to the experts’ panel 16 questions were removed and 11 questions were edited. Finally, content validity of 51 questions has been approved by the experts’ panel. According to Lawshe’s score if CVRs were at least 0.8, items will be has content validity. The results show that both internal consistency and intra-class-correlation were good (>0.75). Cronbach’s alpha and ICC were 0.84 and 0.82, respectively for all questions. To confirm structure of conceptual model, confirmatory factor analysis and Amos software was used. Goodness of Fit Index was RMSEA=0.027, GFI=0.95, AGFI=0.91, CFI=0.97; and showed that the hypothesized model is approved.
Conclusion
In general, we can say that the questionnaire is approximately comprehensive and complete. It is suggested that to assess awareness of diabetes type 2 in seven dominants (e.g. fundamentals, common symptoms, early and late complications, diet, control methods, and source of information of DMT2) this questionnaire should be used in general population."

Gestational diabetes is the most prevalent metabolic disorder being firstly diagnosed during pregnancy. The relationship between the family history of diabetes and the gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has been investigated in several primary studies with a number of contradictions in the results. Hence, the purpose of the present study is to determine the relationship between the GDM and the family history of diabetes using the meta-analysis method.
Method
All published papers in main national and international databases were systematically searched with some specific keywords to find the related studies between 2000 and 2016. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) in analysis for each study using a random-effect and Mantel-Haenzel method. We also determined heterogeneity among these 33 articles and their publication bias.
Results
We entered 33 relevant studies of 2516 articles into the meta-analysis process including 2697 women with family history of diabetes mellitus as well as 29134 women without. Of them, 954 and 4372 subjects developed GDM respectively. Combining the results of the primary studies using the meta-analysis method, the overall odds ratio of family history for developing GDM was estimated as of 3.46 (95% CI: 2.80–4.27).
Conclusion
This meta-analysis study revealed that the family history of diabetes is an important risk factor for the gestational diabetes mellitus."

To assess the efficacy of a unified hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) insulin infusion protocol (IIP), based on an Excel algorithm and implemented as an electronic order set, in achieving glycemic targets and minimizing hypoglycemia.
Methods
An IIP was instituted in medical and surgical intensive care units for post-cardiac surgery (PCS) and other stress hyperglycemia (SH), diabetes hyperglycemia (DH), and DKA. The IIP initiated therapeutic insulin rates at elevated blood glucose (BG), and decreased insulin when target range was achieved. A convenience sample (n=62) was studied; 20 PCS, 15 with DH, 9 with SH, 8 with diabetes on vasopressors, 7 with diabetes on glucocorticoids and 3 with DKA were assessed.
Results
The protocol maintained BG at 144±24.7mg/dL for PCS and 167±36mg/dL for patients with diabetes mellitus. It maintained acceptable target range (ATR) (100mg/dL–180mg/dL) 89% of the time for PCS and 67% of the time for patients with diabetes mellitus. There were no measurements of BG<70mg/dL. The protocol lowered the BG at a similar rate and time period in those with diabetes, DKA and those with or without vasopressors or glucocorticoids. To determine long-term efficacy, a retrospective review of Point of Care (POC) RALS (Remote Automated Data System) BG data 2 years post implementation demonstrated fewer episodes of hypoglycemia<70mg/dL and hyperglycemia>240mg/dL and more BG values within ATR.
Conclusions
This IIP maintained ATR without hypoglycemia for patients in the ICU setting without requiring complex nursing calculations."

Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is defined as the combination of a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors. The use of cardiovascular indices such as the ratios TC/HDL-c, LDL-c/HDL-c and TG/HDL-c may help in the assessment of cardiovascular risk. Investigation of cardio-metabolic risks in the pre-adolescent stage is essential to characterize possible patterns for MS in the earliest stages of the life avoiding further irreversible consequences.
Aims
This work aimed to investigate the presence of MS and cardiovascular indices in a group of children aged 6–10 years.
Methods
We included 150 children from a city in Brazil. Anthropometric (Body Mass Index and Waist Circumference) and biochemical parameters (glycaemia, total cholesterol, LDL-c, HDL-c, and triglycerides) were evaluated in order to identify the presence of MS. Atherogenic Indices were also calculated (TC/HDL-c, LDL-c/HDL-c and TG/HDL-c).
Results
Our results showed that there are high percentages of children with altered values for biochemical and anthropometric parameters and in the atherogenic indices. MS was identified in 17.8% of the children. The main parameters related to alterations in the atherogenic indices were waist circumference, body mass index and the presence of MS.
Conclusion
The high prevalence of MS and alterations in the atherogenic indices in schoolchildren is a worrying panorama. We suggest the performance of more studies focusing on identification, intervention and prevention programs in order to reduce the risk factors of this syndrome in childhood and to reduce future cardiovascular deaths."

These subjects were investigated for fasting blood sugar (FBS), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), total triiodothyronine (T3), total thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
Results
Prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in T2DM was found in 16.2%. Gender-specific prevalence found higher in females (25%) compared to males (10.1%) (P<0.001). Age-specific prevalence found higher in the age group ≥50 yrs. (19%) Compared to other age groups (P=0.036). Subjects with poor glycaemic control demonstrated higher prevalence (27.9%) (P=0.012). Subjects with long-standing T2DM had an increased risk for thyroid dysfunction (19.8%) though findings were not statistically significant. (P=0.42).
Conclusion
The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction with T2DM (16.2%) was high in females compared to males and especially hypothyroidism being more typical. Failure to recognise the presence of thyroid dysfunction among T2DM patients may be a primary cause of poor management of diabetes. We recommend universal screening and regular monitoring of thyroid dysfunction in T2DM patients."

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hearing loss and its association with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a highly endogamous population.
Design
This is a cross-sectional study.
Setting
The present study is carried out in Ear Nose Throat (ENT) and Endocrinology outpatient clinics of the Hamad General and Rumeilah Hospitals, Hamad Medical Corporation.
Subjects
All subjects aged between 20 and 59 years who visited the Endocrinology and ENT outpatient clinics of the Hamad Medical Corporation with hearing difficulty were included in this study during the period from January 2013 to July 2014.
Method
During the study period, prevalence, hearing, audiological test, family history and medical problems associated with hearing impairment in middle aged patients were recorded. Two audiometers Grason Stadler GSI 61 and Madsen Orbiter 922 were used to evaluate the hearing loss.
Result
Majority of the hearing loss observed at the age above 45 years old, (44.8% vs 51.7%, p=0.05). The prevalence of hearing impairment was higher in Qataris than in non-Qataris (59.7% vs 46.6%, p<0.001). The consanguineous marriages were observed higher in Hearing loss (32.1%) than in normal hearing (21.8%) (p=0.028). The mean of diabetes onset duration (7.8±4.12years), sleeping disorder (5.81±1.29h), obese subjects (38% vs 27.4%); family history of diabetes (30.6 vs 23.1%) were higher among hearing impairment. The associated risk factors were significantly higher in T2DM with hearing loss, hypoglycemia (32.8% vs 27.4%), retinopathy (313% vs 18.5%), Nephropathy (17.9% vs 9.8%), Neuropathy (17.9% vs 10.2%), macro-vascular disease (11.9% vs 6.2%), diabetic foot ulcer (20.9% vs 12.6%), Tinnitus (68.7% vs 51.3%), and Vertigo (25.4% vs 16.9%) than in normal hearing diabetes. There was a statistically significant differences between hearing impairment and normal hearing among T2DM regarding hearing assessment frequency (p=0.041). There were statistically significant differences between hearing impairment versus normal hearing for vitamin D [18.91±7.65ng/mL vs 22.85±9.00ng/mL; p<0.001], calcium [1.80±0.12ng/mL vs 1.96±0.14mmol/L; p<0.001], magnesium [0.80±0.09mmol/L vs 0.8±0.14mmol/L; p<0.001], phosphorous [1.42±0.30mmol/L vs 1.56±0.26mmol/L; p<0.001], ceatinine [1.42±0.30mmol/L vs 1.56±0.26mmol/L; p<0.001], cholesterol [4.92±1.08mmol/L vs 4.40±1.01mmol/L; p=0.035], LDL [1.92±0.88mmol/L vs 2.09±0.92mmol/L; p=0.024], albumin [43.1±6.10mmol/L vs 39.8±7.93mmol/L; p=0.010], systolic blood pressure [135.8±16.6Hg vs 130.2±12.5Hg; p=0.017] and, diastolic blood pressure [85.1±9.2mmHg vs 83.0±7.9mmHg; p=0.012]. There were highly statistically significant differences between hearing impairment versus normal for both side right and left ear frequency in Db unit (p<0.001). The multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that head ache (p<0.001), family history of DM (p<0.001), sleep disturbance (p<0.001), high blood pressure (p=0.006), consanguinity (p=0.010), nationality (p=0.014), age in years (p=0.025), and sheesha smokers (p=0.045) were considered at higher risk as a predictors of hearing loss among diabetic patients.
Conclusion
The current study results confirm previous reports that adults with DM and hypertension associated showed greater hearing impairment in highly endogamous population… Diabetic patients with hearing loss were likely to have high blood glucose and other risk factors like hypertension, retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy."

Chronic undernutrition across a lifetime may be an imperative stimulator of diabetes in an individual either by progressively reducing beta cell function alongside islet cell volume and increasing the individual predisposition to other genetic or environmental diabetogenic influences with modifying influence on the course of clinical syndrome. Ketosis resistant insulinopenia is irreversible to the sustained vigorous nutritional convalescence in a substantial fraction of malnourished subjects. It also debunks a latent diabetic stage with insulin resistance reflected by greater insulin requirement in comparison to the patients with type I diabetes with the same beta cell failure fraction and obese type II diabetic patients with equivalent glycemic control gauged by HbA1c levels.

Although T2DM patients have higher incidence of macrovascular and microvascular CV complications than the general population, whether cardiac biomarkers would be effective to risk stratification of the T2DM is not fully understood. The role of natriuretic peptides, galectin-3, interleukins, growth differentiation factor-15, as well as biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction are widely discussed.

abstract = "Background
The importance of dyslipidemia is well recognized in the context of both risk factor for acute pancreatitis and prognostic factor for its in-hospital outcomes. With a growing appreciation of post-pancreatitis diabetes mellitus, there is a need to catalogue changes in lipid metabolism after hospitalization due to an acute pancreatitis attack and their associations with glucose metabolism.
Objective
To investigate lipid metabolism in patients with impaired glucose homeostasis following acute pancreatitis.
Methods
There were two study groups: newly diagnosed chronic hyperglycemia or normoglycemia after acute pancreatitis. During the fasting state, venous blood samples were collected to analyse markers of lipid metabolism (triglycerides, glycerol, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, free fatty acids, and apolipoprotein-B) and glucose metabolism (HbA1c, insulin, index of adipose tissue insulin resistance (Adipo-IR), and HOMA-IR). Binary logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted, and potential confounders were adjusted for in multivariate analyses.
Results
The study included 64 patients with normoglycemia and 19 - with chronic hyperglycemia. Glycerol was significantly associated with the development of chronic hyperglycemia in both unadjusted (p=0.02) and adjusted (p=0.006) models. Triglycerides were significantly associated with the development of chronic hyperglycemia in adjusted (p=0.019) model. Other markers of lipid metabolism did not differ significantly between the two groups. None of the markers of lipid metabolism was significantly associated with Adipo-IR or HOMA-IR.
Conclusion
Overall, patients with chronic hyperglycemia after acute pancreatitis appear to have a lipid profile indicative of an up-regulation of lipolysis, which is not significantly affected by either general or adipose tissue-specific insulin resistance."

The aim was to explore the association between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus [T2DM] treatment satisfactions of patients regarding their socio-economic, life-style, history medication and clinical outcome in a Turkish population
Subject and methods
A cross-sectional study conducted from February 2016 to September 2016. Of the total 1500 diabetic patients approached, 1094 (72.9%) gave their consent. Data analysis included, sociodemographic, serum lipid profiles (LDL, HDL), calcium, uric acid, blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline and after six months. The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) tools were used to measure the patient satisfaction.
Results
The mean and standard deviation of age among gender, there were significant differences between males (51.81±14.40) and females (49.76±13.99) (p=0.024). There were statistically significant differences between males and females regarding place of living (city 76% vs town 26%) p<0.001) and consanguinity (p=0.040). Almost of the patients with diabetes were overweight (males 44.5% vs females 41.8%) while more than a quarter (31.2%) males were obese. Among patients with diabetes, significantly larger proportion were treated for DM with insulin (females 28.8% vs males 22.5%) and ‘insulin & oral anti diabetic drugs’ (females 21.6% vs males 18.4%%; p<0.001) in comparison. Reported average sleeping haours was significantly more among males (6.5±1.1 vs. 6.1±1.2; p<0.001) than females. Males and females reported significantly greater improvements in mean values of blood glucose (−2.07 p<0.001; vs. −2.36; p=0.007), HbA1c (−1.72 p<0.001; vs. −1.47 p=0.038), potassium (+0.98 p<0.001; vs. +0.93 p<0.005); albumin (−3.38 p<0.001; vs. −3.60; p<0.001); billirubin (−0.69 p=0.049; vs. −0.98; p<0.001); uric acid (+11.9 p=0.017; vs. +14.3; p<0.001); systolic blood pressure (−3.86 p<0.001; vs. −3.2 p<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (−3.17 p<0.001; vs. −3.2 p<0.001) in comparison to 6 months before. Multivariate stepwise regression analysis showed that the satisfaction DTSQ scores for HbA1c (p<0.001), h of sleep (p<0.001), neuropathy (p=0.007), diabetic education (p=0.014), SBP (mmHg) (p=0.021) DBP (mmHg) (p=0.028) were identified as significantly associated with higher treatment satisfaction.
Conclusion
The study confirms a positive correlation between diabetes patient’s satisfaction with care and treatment. Females DM patients compared to males had a better satisfaction score with current treatment, unacceptably low blood glucose level, flexibility in treatment and understanding of DM."

Asymptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) in symptom-free subjects, and people with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a significant correlate of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, little is known about their relationship and whether this is mediated through central obesity as one of the defining components of the MetS.
Materials and methods
In a cross-sectional setting, 150 asymptomatic healthy premenopausal women without previously diagnosed hypertension, diabetes or known history cardiovascular diseases were consecutively enrolled. Ankle-brachial index (ABI), various parameters of general and central body fat distribution, and MetS were assessed.
Results
The prevalence rates for asymptomatic PAD and MetS within the study population were calculated at 6% and 44%, respectively. Following the rigorous adjustment made by the components of MetS and clincial variables of age and serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterols (LDL-C), several indicators of general and central body fat distribution, including total, truncal and visceral body fats were found to have significantly positive correlations with log-ABI values. Moreover, log-ABI was significantly and negatively associated with the presence of MetS in both crude and multivariate models of logistic regression analysis, as adjusted by age, LDL-C and several indices of general and central fat deposition (OR [95% CI]: 0.016 [0.001 to 0.424], P value=0.013 in the multivariate adjusted model).
Conclusion
ABI had positive and negative associations with central obesity and MetS, respectively. Our findings strongly suggest the inverse correlation between ABI and the MetS is likely not mediated through central obesity as one the key components of MetS."

Metabolic syndrome is highly prevalent among patients with type II diabetes and is reported as a strong risk factor for cardiovascular diseases as well as carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The aim of the current study was to compare median nerve indices among diabetic patients with and without metabolic syndrome.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 105 patients with type II diabetes whom participated in the coronary artery disease risk factor study in Kerman, Iran (KERCARDS). Patients with type II diabetes were called and those with clinical symptoms of CTS were included in the study, and median nerve indices were measured according to standard electro diagnosis tests. GEE statistical model was used to compare median nerve indices among diabetic patients with and without metabolic syndrome. All statistical analysis was done using SPSS 20.0.
Results
The mean age of participants was 57.57±9.53. There was no significant difference between the left and right hand regarding median nerve indices except median nerve motor amplitude (MA). Furthermore, components of metabolic syndrome including BMI and LDL were determined as risk factors for CTS according to several indices.
Conclusion
Components of metabolic syndrome had more influence on sensory indices than motor indices and primary control of these components might prevent dysfunction of sensory neurons and also motor neurons in advanced stages among diabetic patients."

Unhealthy eating behavior is a serious health concern among secondary school students in Inner Mongolia. To predict their healthy food choices and devise methods of correcting unhealthy choices, we sought to confirm the cross-cultural validity of the theory of planned behavior among Inner Mongolian students.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study, conducted between November and December 2014. Overall, 3047 students were enrolled. We devised a questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior to measure its components (intentions, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control) in relation to healthy food choices; we also assessed their current engagement in healthy food choices.
Results
A principal component analysis revealed high contribution rates for the components (69.32%–88.77%). A confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the components of the questionnaire had adequate model fit (goodness of fit index=0.997, adjusted goodness of fit index=0.984, comparative fit index=0.998, and root mean square error of approximation=0.049). Notably, data from participants within the suburbs did not support the theory of planned behavior construction. Several paths did not predict the hypothesis variables. However, attitudes toward healthy food choices strongly predicted behavioral intention (path coefficients 0.49–0.77, p<0.01), regardless of demographic characteristics.
Conclusion
Our results support that the theory of planned behavior can apply to secondary school students in urban areas. Furthermore, attitudes towards healthy food choices were the best predictor of behavioral intentions to engage in such choices in Inner Mongolian students."

This was the retrospective study conducted at the urology clinic of NCRHA and SWRHA, in Trinidad. Data was obtained from 85 patients with high PSA values (>4.0ng/mL). The data collected were age, ethnicity, weight, height, lifestyle and their most recent blood sugar levels were recorded. Ultrasound reports of patients diagnosed with BPH were also analyzed to gather data on whether their hyperplasia was benign or malignant.
Results
The majority of the sample population was of Afro-Trinidadian descent (41) followed by East Indian descent (26) and then of mixed ethnicity (18). Individuals in the sample population with a normal BMI had a mean PSA value of 23.66ng/mL, while those with a BMI in the overweight range had a mean PSA value of 28.1ng/mL, and those with a BMI in the obese range had a mean PSA value of 18.5ng/mL. There were no statistically significant differences in the mean values of PSA levels between diabetics and non-diabetics, between the 3 major ethnic groups in our sample population and between the 3 different groupings based on BMI ranges. However it was found that the average mean age of patients of East Indian descent (62.96±2.23) was significantly lower than that of patients of African descent (70.15±2.02).

Foot ulcer is also a clinical marker for limb amputation and for death in diabetic patients. The purpose of this study was to determine amputation and mortality rates and its associated factors in patients with diabetic foot ulcerations in a tertiary hospital in Brazil.
Methods
Retrospective medical records from 654 diabetic foot patients were reviewed. The risk factors were determined using the conditional logistic regression model analysis.
Results
The mean patient age was 63.1 years (SD 12.20). Peripheral arterial disease was present in 160 patients (24.5%). Major amputations were performed in 135 (21%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 12% and the mortality rate of the amputees was 22.2%. The lowest hemoglobin level, the median value was 9.50g/dL, (4.0–17.0). Anemia was detected in 89.6% of patients submitted to amputation and in 82,1% of those who died. Hemoglobin <11g/dL was the most significant risk factor for major amputation (odds ratio 5.57, p<0.0001). The presence of peripheral arterial disease and old age were also a risk for major amputation (odds ratio 1.84, p=0.007 and 1.02, p=0.028, respectively). Factors associated with increased risk for death were hemoglobin <11g/dL (odds ratio 4.04, p<0.001), major amputation (1.79, p=0.03) and old age (1.05, p<0,001).
Conclusions
Diabetic foot ulcer is associated with high amputation and mortality rates. Old age, peripheral arterial disease and low hemoglobin level are risk factor for major amputation. Old age, major amputation and low hemoglobin level are risk factors for death."

Genetic variation of disease susceptible genes is different in different ethnic groups and there is an evidence of association of polymorphisms of Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This research analyses the association of PPARs in early and late onset of T2DM in North Indian Population (NIP).
Methods
Total of 703 subjects were recruited from north of India and subjects were further divided into subjects of early onset (less than 25 years of onset, 26 T2DM and 26 controls) and late onset (more than 25 years of onset, 326 T2DM and 325 controls).
Result
The onset of T2DM begins from 15 years and continues further to maximum T2DM subjects to the age of 50 (76% of T2DM). High BMI and WHR, high blood pressure leading to early onset of hypertension, early mortality due to T2DM (7% of T2DM is above 75 years and 3% of T2DM has 20 years duration of onset) and high hyperglycemic NIP were the few outcomes of this research.
Conclusion
There is a strong association of PPAR γ, PPAR α and PPAR δ genes on the susceptibility of T2DM in late onset but not with the early onset of T2DM subjects in North Indian Population: Dual association of PPAR γ was observed with its genotype G/G (Ala/Ala) favoring protection against T2DM and genotype C/C (Pro/Pro) favoring susceptibility to T2DM. Association of intron7 polymorphism of PPAR α and +T294C polymorphism of PPAR δ on the susceptibility to T2DM requires further analysis."

abstract = "Objectives
The goal of our study was to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and all its components, in a population of postmenopausal women aged over 45 years, consecutively accessed to our Heart Station, during 2014, for their first cardiac examination,furthermore to estimate their cardiovascular risk and the achievement of target blood values of main risk factors, according to current Guidelines.
Methods
We screened 1257 postmenopausal women. MetS was assessed according to the National-Cholesterol-Education-Program-Adult-Treatment-Panel III definition. Cardiovascular risk was calculated by the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (<65 years).
Results
MetS was assessed on 834 women (66.4%). Prevalence of each component was: hypertension on 767 women (91.9%), central obesity 758 women (90.9%), low high-density lipoproteins cholesterol (HDLc) increased levels 612 women (73.3%), high triglyceride levels 428 women (51.3%), glucose levels higher than 110mg/dl or diabetes 404 women (48.5%). Cardiovascular risk was moderate until 65 years, but it increases after. Metabolic control in postmenopausal women was poor for glucose, only 82 women (9.8%) presented glucose levels lower than 110mg/dl, it was better for systolic blood pressure, that was normal in 564 women (67.6%) and worse for lipid levels.
Conclusion
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in our population of postmenopausal women is high. Hypertension and central obesity are the more common components. The cardiovascular risk is moderate-high, the achievement of target values for glycemic and lipid levels is unsatisfactory, while systolic blood pressure is enough well controlled but however it is mandatory to improve this goal. An early MetS diagnosis and an early educational intervention are useful to decrease cardiovascular risk of postmenopausal women affected by metabolic syndrome."

The study was conducted at the Genetic and metabolic outpatient department of Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman. The parents of children with metabolic diseases who were accompanying their children to the outpatient clinics were the samples. An explorative descriptive survey design and Convenient sampling technique were used to select the sample. Study included 72 parents of children with metabolic diseases aged between 20 and 55 years. The RAND 36-Item Health Survey version was used to assess the health related quality of life of parents. The results shows lower mean scores in subscales of ‘general health’ and vitality. Parents with higher educational levels showed higher levels of PCS and MCS scores than parents with lower educational levels. Parents with higher monthly income and younger age showed higher quality of life. A significant association was found between supporting persons and HQoL in the dimensions of the “role limitations due to physical” (p<0.03), and social functioning (p<0.04). Empowering the parents by helping them to actively seek and maintain social support is an important step in improving the health related quality of life."

Use of drugs has its own drawbacks and in recent days the use of non-medical measures were reported not only to manage T2DM, but also to prevent its complications. Through there are various review articles that are dealing with the effect of Yoga on risk profiles, management along with the mechanisms of action of yoga in T2DM separately, there is a lack of comprehensive review on the effect of Yoga in combination with all the above mentioned including the effect of Yoga in the management of T2DM complications. Hence, we performed a narrative review in Medline/PubMed using keyword “Yoga and diabetes”. All the relevant articles published till 08th November 2016 were included. Based on the available literature, it could be concluded that Yoga plays a vital role as an adjuvant in the management of risk factors, disease progression and the complications of the T2DM. Further studies are warranted using standard research designs and variables to find out the various mechanisms of effects of Yoga in detail."

Diabetes is one of the biggest problems in healthcare systems and kills many people every year. Diabetes management is impossible when only utilizing medication. So, patients must be educated to manage their diabetes. This study aims to assess the effect of education by telephone and short message service on empowering patients with type 2 diabetes (primary outcome).
Materials and methods
A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Urmia diabetes association in Iran. Sixty six participants with definitive diagnosis of type 2 diabetes entered into the study. Patients with secondary health problems were excluded. Patients were selected by simple random sampling then allocated into intervention (n=33) and control (n=33) groups. The intervention group received an educational text message daily and instructive phone calls three days a week for three months along with usual care. The Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES) with confirmed validity and reliability was used for collecting data. Data was analyzed using SPSS V6.1. Independent t-test, paired t-test and chi-square were used to analyze the data.
Results
The empowerment of the intervention group compared with the control group significantly improved after three months of distance education (p<0.00, EF=1. 16).
Conclusions
The study findings show that the distance education has a significant effect on empowering patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, using distance education along with other diabetes management intervention is highly effective and should be part of the care in diabetes treatment."

abstract = "Colorectal carcinoma is one of the most prevalent cancer types for both men and women. Prognosis of the disease is mostly defined by the stage. Localized disease has a better prognosis especially in earlier stages I and II. In addition most patients with more advanced localized stage III disease are expected to survive with a combination of surgery and adjuvant treatments. Progress in treatment of metastatic disease has led to median survivals exceeding 2 years and a minority of oligometastatic patients may survive even longer or be cured with multimodality therapy. Besides stage of the disease few prognostic factors are available to guide informative discussions with patients or guide therapeutic decisions. One area of research that may provide information in this direction is comorbidity conditions of the metabolic syndrome spectrum. Despite a significant body of literature investigating elements of the metabolic syndrome such as obesity and diabetes in isolation as risk and prognostic factors in colorectal cancer, a more restricted amount of research is dealing with the combination of these two factors as prognosticators of colorectal cancer. This paper will discuss published data on these factors and specifically their combination in the prognosis of colorectal cancer and will address some of their pathogenesis and therapy implications."

abstract = "Background
Type 2 diabetes is a global problem with significant morbidity and healthcare costs. In this study, we aimed to determine the 10-year trend of diabetes, prediabetes and their risk factors in the adult urban population of Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS).
Materials and methods
In this cross-sectional study, we included all patients above 20 years of age who were registered in phases 1 and 4 of TLGS. Each phase had a 3-year duration. 4580 patients were recruited in each phase (916 patients in each age-group, including 3772 males and 5145 females). Random cluster sampling was used in phase 1 and convenience sampling was used in phase 4. Diabetes and glucose tolerance status were determined according to the 1991 criteria of the American Diabetes Association. In our five age groups, risk factors were compared, which included physical activity, waist circumference, body mass index, education, smoking, lipid profile and family history. Exclusion criteria were placement of an individual in the same age-group in the two phases and pregnancy. We calculated the prevalence of diabetes and dysglycemia in each age-group. Age-specific prevalence rates were determined. Prevalence of risk factors in the two phases were compared using chi-square test and Student t-test. Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the variables with non-normal distribution.
Results
In this study, 3976 individuals were recruited in phase 1 (2308 women and 1668 men; female to male ratio 1.38) and 4941 individuals were recruited in phase 4 (2837 women and 2104 men; female to male ratio 1.35). Prevalence of prediabetes in all age groups (except for the 30–39 years age-group) were increased in phase 4 compared to phase 1. Prevalence of known diabetes in all age groups were increased in phase 4 compared to phase 1, yet, the increase was significant only in the 30–39 and 60–69 years age groups (1.8% vs. 0.7% and 19.0% vs. 10.2%, respectively). Newly diagnosed diabetes was decreased in all age groups in phase 4, except for the 60–69 years age-group. The incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes in the 60–69 years age-group was significantly higher in phase 4 compared to the similar age-group of phase 1 (15.2% vs. 11.8%; p<0.001). Physical activity, body mass index, waist circumference (central obesity), general obesity, smoking (except for the 30–39 and 40–49 years age groups), and level of education were significantly higher in phase 4 compared to phase 1. Marriage rates were significantly lower in phase 4 compared to phase 1 across all studied age groups.
Conclusion
We observed an increasing trend in the prevalence of diabetes over a 10-year period in TLGS. This is an accordance with estimates ​​in this field and highlights the need for education, prevention, treatment and control of diabetes. We also found increased rates of central and general obesity, smoking and divorce along with decreased marriage rates, which should be considered by the healthcare policymakers and state health officials as significant risk factors of diabetes."

Insulin pathway is very important for the regulation of glucose, lipid, and energy homeostasis, growth and mitogenic. Proinflammatory mediators can be related to obesity and induce insulin- resistance in adipose tissue. Signaling pathways of transcription factors, particularly NF-κB signaling, are involved in insulin-sensitivity. In addition, the crosstalk between M1-M2 macrophage polarizing plays an essential role in insulin resistance by switching from an M1 to an M2 phenotype and also activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP1. Here, we focus on the roles of transcription factors in inflammation-induced insulin resistance and their involvement in pathogenesis of insulin resistance."
