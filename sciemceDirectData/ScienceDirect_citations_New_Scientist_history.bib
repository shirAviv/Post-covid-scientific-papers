Recycling rates have been rising since the 1970s, and in some places, including Germany, the Netherlands and California, more than half of all domestic waste is recycled. But now some people are challenging the received wisdom with difficult questions. How do non-recyclable styrofoam coffee cups compare with paper or ceramic ones, when all the costs of manufacturing are included? Is it worth recycling materials such as glass and plastic that yield only small environmental benefits? Might landfill be a greener option for plastic, much of which is trucked to seaports and shipped to China for recycling? If you've been left wondering whether it's worth it, here's what you need to know to make up your mind. Words by Bob Holmes"
