abstract = "Aim
The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of sleep disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) among Taif University students and to explore the precipitating factors of these disorders.
Methods
This study was carried out on 1066 students in Taif University of both sexes aging from 18 to 25 years. All included individuals were subjected to full history taking and thorough clinical examination, with special concern on anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist-to-hip ratio and body mass index). Also, fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index and blood hemoglobin levels were measured. Sleep disorders were assessed using sleep disturbances scale and the Epworth sleepiness scale.
Results
The overall incidence of sleep disorders and EDS was 31.33% and 15.29% respectively with statistically significant prevalence in females than males. There was significant positive correlation between sleep disturbances scale and Epworth sleepiness scale on one hand and body weight, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, the height of the residence place above the sea level, fasting and post-prandial blood glucose, fasting serum insulin and HOMA index on the other hand. Also, there was significant negative correlation between sleep disturbances scale and Epworth sleepiness scale on one hand and blood hemoglobin levels on the other hand.
Conclusion
Sleep disorders and EDS in Taif University students were precipitated by high altitude, anemia, obesity and glucose intolerance. Control of these factors may have a positive impact on the incidence of sleep disorders and EDS in this age group."

abstract = "Background
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major health burden worldwide with many patients encountering thyroid dysfunction later in their life. Various studies have found that diabetes and thyroid disorders mutually influence each other and both disorders tend to coexists. However, the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and associated clinical variables in these patients has not been investigated.
Objectives
The study aimed at determining the incidence and prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with T2DM in relation to age, sex, metabolic syndrome and other co-morbid conditions.
Research designs & methods
In this cross-sectional study, 250 Type 2 DM patients were enrolled aged between 40 and 75 years. All the patients were evaluated for thyroid dysfunction by testing thyroid profile (T3, T4 and TSH. These subjects were also investigated for fasting blood sugar (FBS), post prandial glucose (PPG) glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein(LDL), very low density lipoprotein(VLDL), blood urea, serum creatinine and presence of other co-morbid conditions. The observations and interpretations were recorded and results obtained were statistically analyzed.
Results
A high prevalence of thyroid dysfunction (28%) was observed in type 2 diabetic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (18.8%) as the commonest thyroid disorder. Thyroid dysfunction was more prevalent in females, with presence of dyslipidemia, retinopathy, poor glycemic state (HbA1c ≥7) and longer duration of diabetes as significant contributing factors associated.
Conclusions
In addition to glycemic status, screening of thyroid disorder should be routinely done in type 2 diabetic subjects along with other comorbid conditions."

Obligatory Ramadan fasting is challenging in the management of Muslims with diabetes due to increased risk of complications from altered meals and activities. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, perception and practice of healthcare professionals in diabetes management during fasting and the outcome of education on management.
Materials and methods
We surveyed healthcare professionals enrolled in pre-Ramadan education involving an endocrinologist, diabetes specialized nurse and dietician. The survey incorporated a knowledge test on fasting and safe practices of Diabetes management during Ramadan, and collected demographic data.
Results
Eighty-eight participants were enrolled. Mean age was 41.8 ± 14.5 years, 14.9% males with a racial distribution of 44.8% Malays, 34.5% Chinese and 13.8% Indians. Fifty-two percent were Muslims. Eight percent were assistant nurses, 46% registered nurses, 5.7% advanced practice nurses, 17.2% specialist nurses, 14.9% general practitioners and 5% allied health professionals. Fifty-one percent practised in primary care setting. Mean knowledge score was 81.1%. Eighty-four percent would counsel people with diabetes for fasting, increasing to 96.7% after education. Those who would not cited a lack of knowledge or experience. During the past Ramadan, 75.9% provided counselling or adjusted medication whilst 51.1% managed diabetes complications, with 63.8% predominantly hypoglycaemia, 11.6% predominant hyperglycaemia and 24.6% only hypoglycaemia.
Conclusions
The healthcare professionals had good knowledge and were capable in managing Muslims with diabetes during fasting themselves. They identified pre-Ramadan education by an experienced multidisciplinary team as a platform to prepare and support healthcare professionals for managing this challenging annual practice."

The goal of this study was to determine insulin sensitivity in a fasted state and during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), in normoglycemic (NGT), lean (L) (n = 35) and, for comparison, overweight/obese (OW/O) (n = 9) college-aged subjects.
Materials and Methods
Insulin sensitivity for 44 NGT, normotensive subjects, age 18–26 yrs., was determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) and from Matsuda index (ISI Matsuda).
Results
Subjects were normoglycemic fasted (4.59 + 0.35 mmol/L) and at two hours post OGTT (4.52  + 1.35 mmol/L). Besides anthropometric measures, there were significant differences between OW/O and L for fasting insulin (P < 0.001) and both measures of insulin sensitivity (P < 0.05). All subjects exhibited a 9-fold range in HOMA-IR (0.88 + 0.51, range 0.3–2.7) and an 8-fold range in ISI Matsuda (11.9 + 4.7, range 3.0–24.2). The latter was inversely correlated with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.35, P = 0.04) even though subjects were normotensive. In lean subjects, 2.3% were IR by HOMA-IR > 2.1, 5.7% by ISI Matsuda < 5.9, and 22.9% had >one criteria for metabolic syndrome (MetS); 28.6% had some negative metabolic biomarker.
Conclusions
Insulin resistance is present in lean, NGT college-age subjects even without MetS criteria and is discernable with an easily applicable OGTT-derived index."

Foot disease is a common complication of type 2 diabetes that can have tragic consequences. Abnormal plantar pressures are considered to play a major role in the pathologies of neuropathic ulcers in the diabetic foot.
Aim
To examine Relationship of Planter Pressure and Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetic Patients with and without Neuropathy.
Materials and methods
The study was conducted on 50 type 2 diabetic patients and 30 healthy volunteers. BMI calculation, disease duration, Hemoglobin A1c and presence of neuropathy (by history, foot examination and DN4 questionnaire) were recorded. Plantar pressure was recorded for all patients using the Mat-scan (Tekscan, Inc.vers. 6.34 Boston USA) in static conditions (standing) and dynamic conditions (taking a step on the Mat-scan). Plantar pressures (kPa) were determined at the five metatarsal areas, mid foot area, medial and lateral heel areas and medial three toes.
Results
Static and dynamic plantar pressures in both right and left feet were significantly higher in diabetic with neuropathy group than in control group in measured areas (P<0.05). Static and dynamic pressures in right and left feet were significantly higher in diabetic with neuropathy group than in diabetic without neuropathy group in measured areas (P<0.05). On comparison between controls and diabetic without neuropathy group there was a significant difference in plantar pressures especially in metatarsal areas (P<0.05). No significant correlations were present between the studied variables age, disease duration, BMI and HbA1c and plantar pressures in all studied areas.
Conclusion
Persons with diabetic neuropathy have elevated peak plantar pressure (PPP) compared to patients without neuropathy and control group. HbA1c% as a surrogate for glycemic control had no direct impact on peak planter pressure, yet it indirectly impacts neuropathy evolution through out disease duration eventually leading to the drastic planter pressure and gait biomechanics changes."

Diabetic foot is one of the most serious and costly complications of diabetes. Empowerment is an important indicator in promoting foot care behaviors that helps patients to use their maximum abilities. This study was carried out with the aim of empowering patients with type 2 diabetes to prevent diabetic foot in the city of Fuladshahr, Isfahan, Iran.
Methods
This is a quasi-experimental study. 104 eligible patients were randomly assigned to two groups: intervention group and control group. The data were collected through a form of profile, empowerment questionnaire, and foot care behavior checklist. The questionnaires were completed by the two groups in the pre-intervention, 1 and 3 months after the end of the intervention. Data were analyzed in SPSS22 using independent t-test, paired t-test, Chi-square, ANOVA, LSD post hoc test and repeated data analysis.
Results
The results showed that there was no significant difference between two groups in terms of demographic variables. Independent t-test showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of mean score of empowerment and foot care behavior before intervention. However, the mean score of empowerment and foot care behavior of the experiment group was significantly higher than that of the control group in 1 and 3 months after the intervention (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
The empowerment of diabetic patients is effective in promoting foot care behavior, and implementation of empowerment programs in diabetes clinics in this city is recommended."

Electronic databases (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PEDro, Scopus and Web of science) were systematically searched to retrieve relevant evidence. Clinical trials administering exercise training for at least 4 weeks and examining either heart rate variability (HRV), baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), heart rate recovery (HRR) as outcome measures were eligible. Eighteen articles were found to be relevant and were then assessed for characteristics and quality. Fifteen studies out of 18 found that exercise training leads to positive improvements in autonomic function of T2DM patients. Exercise participation enhances cardiac autonomic function of type 2 diabetics and therefore should be implemented in their management programs."

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the major chronic vascular complication of T2DM and leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Inflammation is one of the proposed pathway which explains microvascular complications in T2DM but exact mechanism is still unclear. Omentin-1 is an anti-inﬂammatory adipokine which promotes insulin signaling. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine having role in immune and inflammatory responses. The present study was conducted to elucidate the role of omentin-1 and IL-6 in the pathogenesis of DN and its association with insulin resistance. We aimed to assess and compare the serum levels of omentin-1 and IL-6 in T2DM patients with and without DN.
Materials & Methods
Our study comprised of 2 groups of 41 each. Group A (controls) included T2DM without nephropathy patients and group B (cases) included T2DM nephropathy patients. Parameters studied were serum omentin-1, insulin, IL-6, fasting blood glucose, urea, creatinine, lipid profile, HOMA-IR, eGFR and BMI.
Results & Conclusion
Omentin-1 (p=0.03) was significantly decreased; concomitantly, significant increase in levels of insulin (p=0.004), IL-6 (p=0.023) and HOMA-IR (p=0.0004) were found in cases compared to controls. Bivariate analysis showed eGFR correlating positively with omentin-1 and negatively with insulin in the study population. Our study results, based on serum omentin-1 and IL-6 data suggest important role played by inflammatory mechanism and insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients."

Methods
A total of 80 cases from type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy controls were enrolled in the present case control study. Human serum PON1 concentration was measured by ELISA and western blotting and it activity was determined spectrophotometrically using 4-nitrophenyle acetate. Diagnostic accuracy of serum PON1 to identify type 2 Diabetes mellitus was calculated with ROC analysis.
Result
Serum concentration of LDL, VLDL, TG, A1C, FBS and TC levels showed significantly higher levels in type 2 diabetes patients as compared to healthy controls, however there were no significant differences found in the level of HDL. Serum PON1 concentration and activity monitored in patients with >1 year diabetes showed higher level (75.1 ± 6.8 ng/mL) as compared to patients with >3 years diabetes (65.24 ± 1.6 ng/mL), its level was further decreased in patients with >5 (53.8 ± 2.6 ng/mL) and >7 years (48.1 ± 2.7 ng/mL) of diabetes. PON1 concentration decreased as the duration of diabetes increased. PON1 level was further decreased due to habits like smoking and alcohol consumption.
Conclusion
Serum PON1 levels decrease in states of high oxidative stress like metabolic syndrome, obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, and dyslipidemia. It can be used as diagnostic marker for diabetes mellitus along with increased TG, LDL, VLDL and FBG."

Strict glycemic control reduces the development and progression of diabetes-related complications, and there is evidence that improved metabolic control improves outcomes in subjects having diabetes mellitus with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Glycemic control in people with kidney disease is complex. Changes in glucose and insulin homoeostasis may occur as a consequence of loss of kidney function and dialysis. The reliability of measures of long-term glycemic control is affected by CKD and the accuracy of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the setting of CKD and ESKD is questioned. Despite the altered character of diabetes in CKD, current guidelines for diabetes management are not specifically adjusted for this patient group. The validity of indicators of long-term glycemic control has been the focus of increased recent research.

we aimed to investigate the changes in thyroid hormones, lipid profile and anthropometric measures after programmed weight loss in Palestinian obese adult females
Materials and methods
This prospective study included 94 obese female (20–50 years old) as cases and 94 Non-obese of same age as controls for baseline comparisons. Obese female were assigned for low calorie diet (1200–1500 Kcal/day) in addition to a daily program of therapeutic exercise for six month. Parameters were measured, statistically analyzed and compared with control before and after study.
Results
baseline measurements showed significant differences between cases and control regarding BMI, TG, TC, LDL-C, TSH, T3 and T4. After six months of low calorie diet and exercise there was a significant decrease in BMI, TC, TG and LDL-C in cases as compared to their levels before the study (P ≤ 0.05). TSH was significantly increased, while, T3 and T4 were significantly decreased in the cases as compared to their levels before the study. Statistically significant correlations were reported between different parameters of the study.
Conclusions
Low calorie diet and moderate intensity therapeutic exercise significantly improved the deteriorated health indicators in the cases which justifies the necessity for introducing such low calorie diet coupled with moderate exercise"

abstract = "Aim
Insulin and uric acid were shown affect the prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), but no studies examine their interaction. Therefore, we conducted this study to determine their biological interaction in subjects from central Mexico.
Methods
433 subjects were enrolled for a cross-sectional study. MetS was defined according to the Harmonizing Definition. Hyperuricemia was defined as ≥7.0 mg/dL in males and ≥5.8 mg/dL in females. Hyperinsulinemia was defined as ≥11.0 μU/mL. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was calculated to determine the association between uric acid or insulin and MetS. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk (odds ratio) of developing MetS. Biological interactions were determined by the PROCESS Macro and Anderson’s method.
Results
Insulin and uric acid levels were elevated in MetS positive group (p < .05) and correlated with the number of MetS components (r = 0.276 and r = 0.166, p < .001, respectively). The interaction between uric acid and insulin was associated with the number of MetS components (PROCESS Model 1, interaction coefficient = −0.009, 95%CI: −0.017 to −0.001, p = .036). Johnson-Neyman analysis suggests the interaction is lost when uric acid concentration increased >7.0 mg/dL. When the cohort was separated by hyperinsulinemia and hyperuricemia, there was a significant risk of developing MetS for subjects with hyperuricemia (odds ratio = 2.3; 95%CI: 1.1–4.8, p < .05), hyperinsulinemia (odds ratio = 3.1; 95%CI: 1.9–4.9, p < .05), or both (odds ratio = 7.4; 95%CI: 3.2–17.2, p < .05); however, there was no multiplicative or additive interaction.
Conclusion
Here, we show that uric acid and insulin augments the prevalence of MetS; however, no biological interaction was determined for hyperuricemia and hyperinsulinemia."

This study aimed to introduce and apply modern statistical techniques for assessing association and predictive value of risk factors in first-degree relatives (FDR) of patients with diabetes from repeatedly measured diabetes data.
Methods
We used data from 1319 FDR’s of patients with diabetes followed for 8 years. Association and predictive performance of weight (Wt), body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumferences (WC and HC) and their ratio (WHR), waist-height ratio (WHtR) and a body shape index (ABSI) in relation to future diabetes were evaluated by using Cox regression and joint longitudinal-survival modeling.
Results
According to Cox regression, in total sample, WC, HC, Wt, WHtR and BMI had significant direct association with diabetes (all p < 0.01) with the best predictive ability for WHtR (concordance probability estimate = 0.575). Joint modeling suggested direct associations between diabetes and WC, WHR, Wt, WHtR and BMI in total sample (all p < 0.05). According to LPML criterion, WHtR was the best predictor in both total sample and females with LPML of −2666.27 and −2185.67, respectively. However, according to AUC criteria, BMI had the best predictive performance with AUC-JM = 0.7629 and dAUC-JM = 0.5883 in total sample. In females, both AUC criteria indicated that WC was the best predictor followed by WHtR.
Conclusion
WC, WHR, Wt, WHtR and BMI are among candidate anthropometric measures to be monitored in diabetes prevention programs. Larger multi-ethnic and multivariate research are warranted to assess interactions and identify the best predictors in subgroups."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of DM2 patients with nephropathy when they are under surveillance of a joined clinic run by endocrinologists & nephrologists.
Patients and methods
A cohort of 106 patients with DM2, 42–83 years of age, and eGFR < 60 ml/min/m2 were included. Age, sex, duration of diabetes, duration of attending our clinic, smoking habits, BMI, data regarding ischemic heart disease and induction of hemodialysis, urine albumin excretion (UAE) levels, eGFR (MDRD equation) and values of various biochemical parameters were recorded too. Follow-up period ranged from one to 25 years. Paired samples t-test and non-parametrical Kruskal–Wallis test were used for the analyses of the data.
Results
Fifty percent of patients had no further progression, 25.9% improvement, while 24.1% had worsening of the UAE levels. During the follow-up in the joined clinic, there was a smaller than the expected from the medical literature decrease in median eGFR, i.e. 2,3 ml/min/m2 and a statistically significant improvement in glycosylated hemoglobin levels from 8.0% to 7.4% (p = 0.016). Time in years of follow-up in the joined clinic of our hospital appeared to be the most significant factor in the improvement or stabilization against deterioration of the UAE levels (p = 0.018).
Conclusions
Close follow-up of DM2 patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min/m2 has resulted in a minor annual eGFR decrease. Monitoring of these patients in a specialized diabetic nephropathy clinic is beneficial for this group of patients for delaying the occurrence of end-stage renal disease."

The first cardiovascular risk prediction model in the Arab world was recently developed for Omanis with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study aims to validate the newly developed model.
Materials and methods
A retrospective cohort study design was applied in this study. The model was validated in two samples; the model derivation sample and a separate validation sample, consisting of 1314 and 405 diabetics respectively. All patients were free of cardiovascular disease at the baseline (2009–2010) and were followed up until: the first cardiovascular event occurred; the patient died; or up to December 2015. All data were retrieved from the patients’ medical records in a primary care setting.
Results
In both the derivation and validation samples, the model showed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.73 (95% CI; 0.69–0.77) and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.59–0.75) respectively. Calibration of the model was satisfactory and the actual difference between the mean predicted and observed risk in different risk groups ranged from 0.7%–3.1% and 0.1%–4.2% in the derivation and validation samples respectively.
Conclusion
The recently developed cardiovascular disease risk assessment model for Omanis with type 2 diabetes achieved adequate overall validity. The model showed good discrimination and acceptable calibration; it therefore has the potential to be used in local clinical settings. However, further validation and comparison studies are needed to judge the generalizability and superiority of the model over other tools currently used in Oman."

Aims
To measure the level of leptin in volunteers and correlate it with several anthropometric, biochemical variables and abdominal fat volumes.
Methods
The level of leptin was investigated in 167 disease-free volunteers. Serum levels of IL-6, adiponectin, and resistin, blood lipid profile (cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride (TG) were determined. Waist circumference (WC) was measured using tape and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images.
Results
All measured anthropometric (BMI, WC measured by tape and MRI) and biochemical variables (adiponectin, resistin, cholesterol, HDL, LDL and TG); and abdominal fats showed a significant (p<0.05) difference between participants with abnormal serum leptin levels and those with normal leptin levels. A higher percentage of participants with abnormal serum leptin were obese males while participants with normal leptin levels were either overweight or normal weight females. A significant (p <0.05) positive correlation was detected between serum leptin concentration and WC, BMI, subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, total abdominal fat, and resistin. A moderate association was found between serum leptin concentration and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6.
Conclusion
Abnormal serum leptin, was detected in obese male individuals which may be considered as an important indicator for the development of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes."

To investigate effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coexisting hypovitaminosis D.
Settings and design
Randomized, Parallel Group, Placebo Controlled Trial carried out in a tertiary care hospital of Indian Armed Forces.
Methods and material
Sixty patients with coexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypovitaminosis D were randomized into cases and controls and were supplemented with oral Vitamin D and microcrystalline cellulose respectively for six months. Subjects' HbA1c and vitamin D levels were monitored at the beginning and end of the study, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) & post prandial plasma glucose (PPPG) during monthly OPD visits.
Statistical analysis used
Intra-group comparison was made by paired t test & unpaired t test was used for inter-group (A v/s B) comparisons. Repeated measures ANOVA was undertaken to compare values over time.
Results
The two groups were comparable for all parameters at baseline. Case group showed significant decrease in mean HbA1c levels (7.29% to 7.02%; P = 0.01), mean FPG levels (131.4 to 102.6 mg/dl; P = 0.04) and mean PPPG levels (196.2 to 135.0 mg/dl; P < 0.001). Incidentally, significant improvement in systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure and total cholesterol was also noted in the cases, while for LDL cholesterol improvement tended towards significance (p = 0.05).
Conclusions
We found that oral vitamin D supplementation was associated with improved glycemic control and other metabolic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Supplementation to achieve normal levels of vitamin D can be a promising adjuvant therapy for T2DM patients & coexisting hypovitaminosis D."

Large-scale clinical trials and translational studies have demonstrated that weight loss achieved through diet and physical activity reduced the development of diabetes in overweight individuals with prediabetes. These interventions also reduced the occurrence of metabolic syndrome and risk factors linked to other chronic conditions including obesity-driven cancers and cardiovascular disease. The Healthy Living Partnerships to Prevent Diabetes (HELP PD) was a clinical trial in which participants were randomized to receive a community-based lifestyle intervention translated from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) or an enhanced usual care condition. The objective of this study is to compare the 12 and 24 month prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the two treatment arms of HELP PD.
Materials and methods
The intervention involved a group-based, behavioral weight-loss program led by community health workers monitored by personnel from a local diabetes education program. The enhanced usual care condition included dietary counseling and written materials.
Results
HELP PD included 301 overweight or obese participants (BMI 25–39.9kg/m2) with elevated fasting glucose levels (95–125mg/dl). At 12 and 24 months of follow-up there were significant improvements in individual components of the metabolic syndrome: fasting blood glucose, waist circumference, HDL, triglycerides and blood pressure and the occurrence of the metabolic syndrome in the intervention group compared to the usual care group.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that a community diabetes prevention program in participants with prediabetes results in metabolic benefits and a reduction in the occurrence of the metabolic syndrome in the intervention group compared to the enhanced usual care group."

Research in the last decade tried to focus on natural and unnatural causes of death in schizophrenic patients, but recent few years has focussed on emerging cardio-metabolic risk factors, as a cause of mortality in such patients.
Aim of the study
To assess the determinant of metabolic syndrome in drug naïve schizophrenic patients.
Methodology
It was a cross sectional study; 30 indoor patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia were included. Height, weight, waist circumference and Blood pressure assessment was done by using standard protocol. Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG), Triglyceride (TGs), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) total cholesterol were measured. International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria was considered for establishing metabolic syndrome. Statistical analysis was done by using chi square and ANOVA.
Results
Majority of the patients were females; hailing from rural area; unskilled professional; educated up to below primary level; were single and Hindu by religion. Most common metabolic abnormality was low HDL in 76.6%; High TGs in 26.6%; High SBP ≥130mm Hg in 16.67%; DBP>85mm Hg in 13.33%; High FBS 10% of the patients. In risk assessment strongest risk factors for metabolic syndrome were high waist circumference, FBS and TGs. BMI, total cholesterol, LDL and VLDL were also observed as a risk factors in drug naïve schizophrenic patients.
Conclusion
HDL, FBS, TGs, waist circumference and BMI are all the strong risk factors for development of metabolic syndrome in drug naïve schizophrenia patients."

The correlation between subclinical hypothyroidism and some of cardiovascular disease risk factors such as serum lipids, homocysteine levels and also insulin resistance index is not well established and the current study was conducted to clarify this issue.
Methods and materials
Seventy four patients with mild elevation in levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) along with normal levels of T3 and T4 were selected as patients group and 74 age and sex matched individuals were selected as healthy control group. Serum insulin, triglyceride, glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and homocysteine levels were measured. Obtained data compared between groups with independent sample t-test. For evaluation of the correlation between mentioned parameters Pearson correlation coefficient method was used.
Results
Serum levels of LDL-C and total cholesterol significantly increased in SCH group compared to healthy control group. Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOM-IR) and serum homocysteine level significantly elevated in patients with SCH compared to control group. There was a significant direct correlation between HOM-IR and serum homocysteine levels in SCH patients.
Conclusion
Subclinical hypothyroidism likely have significant effect on insulin resistance as major diabetes risk factors and also cardiovascular disease risk factors such as homocysteine. The direct correlation between HOM-IR with serum homocysteine level indicate the possible role of insulin resistance in elevation of serum homocysteine in SCH patient group."

The data about the incidence of diabetes is scarce from developing countries. We studied the incidence of type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 DM (T2DM) in a cohort of young military personnel followed for a long duration.
Methods
The data for this descriptive epidemiologic study was derived from the electronic medical records (EMR) of the male service personnel enrolled between 1990 and 2015. All subjects were recruited before 18 years of age in good health and the onset of DM was derived from the EMR. We calculated the incidence rates as per person years using appropriate statistical methods.
Results
Our study population includes 51,217 participants (median age 33 years, range 17–54) with a mean follow up of 12.5 years, giving a cumulative follow up duration of 613,925 person-years (py). A total of 251 patients developed T2DM and 15 patients developed T1DM during the study period. The incidence rate of T2DM was 0.41 per 1000 py and that of T1DM was 2.44 per 100,000 py.
Conclusion
Our cohort had low incidence rates of diabetes when compared with other studies from India and abroad. Active military service with good life style measures may offer protection from the DM."

The liver plays an important role in glucose homeostasis, and various chronic liver diseases have a negative effect on glucose metabolism with the consequent emergence of diabetes. Some aspects related to chronic liver disease can affect diagnostic tools and the monitoring of diabetes and other glucose metabolism disorders, and clinicians must be aware of these limitations in their daily practice. In cirrhotic patients, fasting glucose may be normal in up until 23% of diabetes cases, and glycated hemoglobin provides falsely low results, especially in advanced cirrhosis. Similarly, the performance of alternative glucose monitoring tests, such as fructosamine, glycated albumin and 1,5-anhydroglucitol, also appears to be suboptimal in chronic liver disease. This review will examine the association between changes in glucose metabolism and various liver diseases as well as the particularities associated with the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes in liver disease patients.

In conclusion, although social capital seems to be related to DM, more studies are necessary to understand which dimensions are more important in this association, if the association is the same at the individual or neighborhood level, and what kind of population in terms of education, poverty and culture would be more influenced by social capital in DM control."

abstract = "Background
Nephropathy is a major complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is heralded by the insidious development of microalbuminuria (MA). It is suggested that the serum levels of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is correlated with diabetic nephropathy. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated serum ICAM-1 level in diabetic patients with and without MA.
Methods
A total of 187 participants were enrolled and were classified into three groups including 40 healthy controls and 2 diabetic groups with (n = 59) or without MA (n = 88). Serum levels of ICAM-1, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in all three groups. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Serum levels of ICAM-1 were significantly higher in diabetic patients irrespective of MA. Moreover, ICAM-1 levels in patients with MA were significantly higher than patients without MA. Patients with MA had significantly higher age and blood pressure compared to those without MA (P = 0.001). Serum levels of ICAM-1 were significantly correlated with age and HbA1c.
Conclusions
Overall, serum ICAM-1 levels were significantly higher in T2DM patients with MA and it may be associated with the severity of diabetic kidney disease."

abstract = "Aims
This study aimed to determine the prevalence rate of metabolic syndrome and its potential risk factors, 6–12 weeks postpartum in women with GDM compared to women with normal glucose tolerance.
Methods
LAGAs is an ongoing population-based prospective cohort study that started in March 2015 in Ahvaz, Iran. During 11 months of study progression, 176 women with GDM pregnancy and 86 healthy women underwent a fasting glucose test, 75-g OGTT and fasting lipid tests at 6–12 weeks postpartum. GDM was defined based on IADPSG criteria. Postpartum glucose intolerance was defined according to ADA criteria and metabolic syndrome using 2 sets of criteria.
Results
The overall rate of metabolic syndrome at 6–12 weeks postpartum was 16% by NCEP-ATP III criteria (18.2% in women with GDM and 11.6% in controls) and 19.1% by IDF criteria (21% in women with gestational diabetes and 15.1% in controls). Pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity, (OR 1.89, 95% CI: 1.05-3.38, P = .03), pregnancy systolic blood pressure (OR 1.03, 95% CI: 1.008–1.52, P = .006) and requiring insulin or metformin (OR 3.08, 95% CI: 1.25–7.60, P = 0.01), were associated risk factors for the presence of MetS in GDM-exposed women. In women with normal glucose during pregnancy, pre-pregnancy BMI ≥25 kg/m2 was a risk factor of metabolic syndrome (OR 2.82, 95% CI: 1.11–7.15, P = .02).
Conclusion
The rate of metabolic syndrome in women with or without GDM at 6–12 weeks postpartum is high particularly in women with high BMI. An early postpartum prevention and screening program for cardiovascular risk factors is important for women with GDM."

The concern with the incidence of chronic-degenerative diseases is increasing worldwide, and many studies have shown that insufficiency of vitamin D (VD) can be linked to several metabolic disorders.
Aims
Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the association of the metabolic syndrome risk factors, atherogenic indices and VD in a group of patients attended at a Cardiology Center.
Methods
For this study, we invited 200 patients of both sexes attended in a Cardiology Center (Medical School of Marilia – São Paulo – Brazil). Most were female (n = 111) and aged between 41 and 70 years (from march to august, 2017).
Results
Our results showed that only 20.0% of the patients presented normal levels of VD. Patients with altered values for this vitamin presented significantly higher values for glycemia, HbA1c, Total cholesterol, LDL-c, triglycerides, Castelli Index I, Castelli Index II, Body Mass Index, waist circumference, non-HDL-c and the estimative of the size of the LDL-c particle. Vitamin D correlated negatively with glycemia, HbA1C, triglycerides, atherogenic indices, Body Mass Index, and blood pressure. Multiple Regression Model showed that for an individual to maintain metabolic parameters, at least at borderline values, the levels of VD should be 37.64 that is not in accordance with the reference values.

Diabetes is a growing public health problem in India which is soon going to become the ‘diabetes capital’ of the world. It requires regular care and follow up. We aimed to estimate the household out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure and catastrophic expenditure due to hospitalization and outpatient care as a result of diabetes.
Materials and methods
Secondary analysis of nationally representative data for India collected by National Sample Survey Organization in 2014, reporting on health service utilization and health care related OOP expenditure by income quintiles and by type of health facility (public or private).
Results
The median household OOP expenditure from hospitalization due to diabetes was USD 151, and was 3 times higher among the richest quintile compared to the poorest quintile (p<0.001). There was a significantly higher prevalence (p<0.001) of catastrophic expenditure among the poorest quintile (36%) compared to the richest (14%). Median private sector OOP hospitalization expenditure was four times higher than the public sector (p<0.001). Medicines accounted for 41% and 69% of public sector hospitalization and outpatient care respectively. Concentration indices show gross inequity in hospitalization expenditure, prevalence of catastrophic expenditure and utilization of public health facility.
Conclusion
Households with diabetic patients incur a high risk of catastrophic expenditure, particularly for those in the lowest income quintiles and those seeking care in the private sector. Increased availability and access to essential drugs and strengthening of public facilities will significantly reduce OOP expenditure."

To determine the association between the thyroid hormones(FT3, FT4 and TSH) and the lipid profile markers(HDL-c, LDL-c and triglycerides) values in middle-aged women with no metabolic disorders and recurrent chronic symptomatology.
Materials and Methods
We carried out an analytical cross-sectional study in euthyroid women with recurrent chronic symptoms of at least six months with no apparent diagnosis who attended the endocrinological gynaecology outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru during 2012–2014. Participants who met the eligibility criteria were evaluated according to their thyroid hormones(FT3, FT4 and TSH) and lipid profile markers(HDL-c, LDL-c and triglycerides) values. We elaborated univariate/multivariate linear regression models to evaluate the association between the thyroid markers and the lipid profile levels. The reported association measure was the beta coefficient(β) with its respective p-value.
Results
We analyzed 211 participants, the average age was 44.9 ± 14.0(SD) years, the FT3 and FT4 mean levels were 3.2 ± 0.4 pg/mL and 1.2 ± 0.2 ng/dL respectively, while the TSH median was 2.8(IQR:1.9–4.0) μU/mL. The mean or median levels of LDL-c, HDL-c and triglycerides were of 137.5 ± 37.9 mg/dL, 54.0 ± 15.0 mg/dL and 118.5(IQR:79.5–169.5) mg/dL respectively. In the multivariate linear regression model between the FT3 and LDL-c levels, we found that for each increase in a FT3 unit, the LDL-c values decreased on average 30.85 mg/dL(p < 0.01). We found no statistically significant associations in the other multivariate models of linear regression, among the other thyroid hormones and lipid markers.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscular disease characterized by progressive loss of functional muscle mass followed by changes in body composition.
Aim
To describe body composition, resting energy expenditure (REE), and metabolic disorders in DMD patients followed-up at a tertiary care center. To analyze the association with type of steroid and ambulatory status, and to compare obese DMD patients with patients with multifactorial obesity.
Population and methods
A prospective, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted. Anthropometric measurements were taken, evaluating body composition with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), REE with indirect calorimetry, and biochemical parameters in all DMD patients seen between June 2013 and April 2014.
Results
63 boys between 5.4 and 18.7years of age were evaluated. Diagnosis of obesity ranged from 28% measuring body mass indexZ-score (BMIZ-score) to 70% using percentage of fat mass (%FM). Patients who had lost gait had a significantly higher %FM than those in whom gait was preserved (72% vs 46%, p<0.05). Insulin resistance was present in 29% associated with BMI Z-score and waist circumference and 40% had dyslipidemia associated with %FM, both of which were steroid independent. In obese DMD patients REE was lower than predicted and also lower than controls, and persist when dividing the patients into ambulators and non-ambulators.
Conclusions
A high prevalence of obesity was observed. BMI-Z-score underestimates the degree of FM. No correlation was found between steroid type and body composition or metabolic disorders. No differences were found in REE between ambulators and non-ambulators. Obese DMD patients have a lower REE than controls."

The aim of our study was to determine whether prediabetes increases cardiovascular (CV) risk compared to the non-prediabetic patients in our hypertensive population. Once this was achieved, the objective was to identify relevant CV prognostic features among prediabetic individuals.
Methods
We included hypertensive 1652 patients. The primary outcome was a composite of incident CV events: cardiovascular death, stroke, heart failure and myocardial infarction. We performed a Cox proportional hazard regression to assess the CV risk of prediabetic patients compared to non-prediabetic and to produce a survival model in the prediabetic cohort.
Results
The risk of developing a CV event was higher in the prediabetic cohort than in the non-prediabetic cohort, with a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.61, 95% CI 1.01–2.54, p = 0.04. Our Cox proportional hazard model selected age (HR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.07, p < 0.001) and cystatin C (HR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.26–4.22, p = 0.01) as the most relevant prognostic features in our prediabetic patients.
Conclusions
Prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of CV events, when compared with the non-prediabetic patients. Age and cystatin C were found as significant risk factors for CV events in the prediabetic cohort."

abstract = "Purpose
Overweight and underweight are one of the leading risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), but little research on this area has been undertaken in Cambodia. Therefore, this study aimed to measure underweight and overweight and their associated risk behaviors among Cambodian high school students.
Methods
3806 students (mean ag = 15.65 years, SD = 1.80, age range = 11–18 years) from the 2013 Cambodia-Global School-based Student Health Survey were used to yield representative samples of the Cambodian students. Body Mass Index (BMI) was assessed by students’ self-reported height and weight. The substance use, depression, eating behaviors, suicidal ideation, and violence were examined as risk factors. The Chi-square and multinomial regressions were performed to assess the relationships between risk factors and BMI.
Results
The prevalence of underweight was 47.4% (N = 1805, Male = 23.3%vs.24.1%) and overweight was 2.3% (N = 89, Male = 1.0%vs.1.3%). The BMI was significantly controlled by age, gender, and body height. Both underweight and overweight students were significantly vulnerable to substance use, feeling depressed, and violent behaviors. Of the risk factors, shortest sleep was prevalent for underweight students while feeling lonely and suicide attempts were the critical risks for overweight students. The daily fruit/vegetable consumption and physical activity were good preventive factors of both underweight and overweight epidemics.
Conclusions
The risk behaviors of students appear to be strongly associated with underweight and overweight. Interventions targeting these risk behaviors may have the potential to reduce risks. Meanwhile, the preventive strategies should focus on vulnerable students who have poor academic performance, mental health issues and a history of violent experiences."

abstract = "Background
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the commonest reproductive disorder in women and is closely associated with the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS). The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to describe the risk of MetS in adolescent with PCOS to help diagnosing and preventing of morbidity and mortality later in life.
Methods
Pubmed, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and other sources were searched for metabolic syndrome in adolescents with polycystic ovarian syndrome using PRISMA guidelines (Moher et al., 2009). All type of study design of women aged 10–20 reported association of PCOS with metabolic syndrome was included in this study. Meta-analysis was conducted for MetS and its individual component using bias adjusted quality effect model and we compare the results from quality effects with random effects and IVhet model. Data were presented as prevalence, odds ratio (95% confidence interval and mean difference (95% confidence interval).
Results
This systematic review included 9 studies while the meta-analysis included 7 studies. Meta-analysis showed that the odds of being experiencing MetS in PCOS groups was 2.69 (1.29, 5.60) times than girls without PCOS. The mean difference between girls with PCOS and without PCOS for systolic blood pressure was 5.00 (1.28, 8.72), diastolic blood pressure was 3.50 (0.48, 6.56), triglycerides level was 4.20 (−3.99, 12.45), glucose level was 1.30 (−0.46, 3.05), HDL level was −1.40 (−4.85, 2.00).
Conclusion
This systematic review and meta-analysis support the hypothesis that the risk of MetS is much greater in adolescents with PCOS compared to the normal population. It is important to screen PCOS in early age to prevent MetS and its complications which lead to morbidity and mortality later in life."

The present study aimed to assess the behavioral and familial predictors of diabetes mellitus as well as their interaction in the risk of diabetes mellitus type2.
Methods
The present cross-sectional study was conducted using the Yazd health study (YaHS) data which was collected in 2013–14. Statistical population of this study consisted of all 9340 individuals aged between 20 and 69 in Yazd City. Logistic regression was used to determine behavioral factors and family history of diabetes and their interaction in the risk of diabetes.
Results
In the present study, age, family history of type 2 diabetes, waist-to-hip ratio, BMI, educational level, physical activity and smoking were considered as the risk factors for type 2 diabetes.There was a significant interaction(negative interaction) between family history of diabetes and other risk factors only for BMI, so that the risk of developing type-2 diabetes was lower in the presence of two risk factors- family history of diabetes and BMI- than the risk of diabetes in the presence of each of these factors.
Conclusion
Results of the present study suggested that despite the consideration of family history as an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes, if it was used as a tool to raise the awareness and sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes, it would reduce the risk of developing this type of diabetes in people who had other risk factors for type 2 diabetes."

abstract = "Introduction and objective
The role of metformin in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is also increasing. However, almost half of metformin-treated women required additional insulin. Therefore, identifying the characteristics of these women may help define optimal therapeutic strategy.
Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study done in a District General Hospital, UK. GDM was diagnosed by 75 g OGTT test between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation with fasting levels of ≥6.1 mmol/l and/or 2 h postprandial (PP) level of ≥7.8 mmol/l. Logistic regression and receiver operator curves (ROC) were performed to identify the predictors of metformin failure.
Results
Out of 228 women with GDM included, 46/228 (20.2%) and 151/228 (66.2%) received insulin and metformin as first-line medication respectively. Among the metformin-treated, 13 stopped treatment and were excluded from analysis. Of the included 138 metformin-treated women, 77 (55.8%) required supplementary insulin (metformin failure). Metformin failure group had higher maternal age and fasting glucose level at OGTT, HbA1c at OGTT and earlier gestational age (GA) at medication initiation. Metformin failure was predicted if fasting OGTT level >4.8 mmol/l (69% sensitivity and 62% specificity). If the fasting levels of IADPSG (International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups) criteria and NICE (National Institute of Health and Care Excellence) were used, the positive predictive value was 78% and 77% respectively.
Conclusion
As women with higher fasting glucose levels have higher chance of necessitating insulin in later pregnancies, appropriate addition of insulin at metformin initiation for these women could help better glycaemic control throughout pregnancy."

To determine the association between free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and free-triiodothyronine-to-free-thyroxine ratio (FT3/FT4) levels and Metabolic Syndrome (MetS).
Materials and methods
We carried out an analytical cross-sectional study in euthyroid adults of both sexes, who attended the outpatient service of a private clinic in Lima-Peru during the 2014–2016 period. Participants were divided into tertiles (low, intermediate and high) according to their FT3, FT4, and FT3/FT4 ratio values. MetS was defined when three or more metabolic criteria were met by the participants. ROC curves were constructed, and Youden’s Index were used to identify the optimal cut-points of each thyroid marker. We elaborated crude/adjusted Poisson regression models to evaluate the association between the thyroid markers and the presence of MetS. The reported association measure was the prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Results
We analyzed 245 participants, the average age was 38.5 ± 10.3 years, 29.8% were males, and the prevalence of MetS was 31%. In the adjusted Poisson regression models, the prevalence of MetS was higher among the high FT3 tertile compared to the low tertile (aPR = 2.01; 95% CI: 1.22–3.34). The prevalence of MetS was higher among the intermediate FT3/FT4 ratio tertile and the high FT3/FT4 ratio tertile compared to the low tertile, (aPR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.02–3.10) and (aPR = 2.80; 95% CI: 1.67–4.72); respectively.

Methods
64 newly diagnosed antihyperglycemic treatment-naïve prediabetic and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients were randomly assigned using block design to either metformin combined with therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) or TLC alone. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting lipid profile, plasma oxidative status and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured at baseline, after 3 months and after 6 months from baseline.
Results
Except for HbA1c, baseline values did not differ significantly between the two groups. The post 3-months relative reductions in BMI (P=0.014) and HbA1c (P=0.037) in metformin combined with TLC intervention were significantly greater than those in TLC alone group. TNFα plasma levels were decreased significantly vs. baseline by metformin combined with TLC intervention (−22.90±46.76%, P=0.01). Conversely, TLC alone basically worsened proinflammatory status (42.40±40.82 %), P<0.001. Metformin with TLC treatment effected a therapeutic decrement of the oxidative stress (−15.44±35.32%, P=0.029 vs. baseline) unlike TLC alone (61.49±122.66%, P=0.01 vs. baseline). Both interventions' effects were sustained in the 6-month follow up periods.

Aim
The objective of the study was to find out the prevalence of DD in youth onset diabetes patients from east Delhi and neighboring NCR region.
Methods
A total of 200 patients with youth onset diabetes below 25 years of age were recruited from a tertiary care hospital in East Delhi. Clinical history, family history of diabetes and anthropometry of patients were recorded. Fasting serum C-peptide, Anti-IA2-antibody and Anti-GAD-antibody were measured in all patients. Patients positive for Anti-GAD-antibody (>1.05U/ml) and C-peptide level >0.3nmol/l were characterized as DD patients. Patients negative for Anti-GAD-antibody and C-peptide >0.3nmol/l were kept under the category of T2DM. Patients with low C-peptide level along with one of the following, positive Anti-GAD-antibody, positive Anti-IA2-antibody and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were considered as T1DM. Remaining patients were kept under the unknown category.
Results
Mean age of study subjects was 18.2±7.1years. Seven percent (7%) of the subjects were classified as DD, 51% as T1DM, 13% as T2DM and 29% were kept under the unknown category. Mean age of subjects with 22.2±9.7, 16.9±6.7, 20.6±7.7 and 19.4±7.4 years in DD, T1DM, T2DM and unknown category respectively.

abstract = "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a 30 amino acid long peptide hormone derived from the proglucagon gene and secreted in the distal small intestine when food enters the duodenum. GLP-1 is also produced in the central nervous system (CNS), predominantly in the brainstem, and subsequently transported to a large number of regions in the CNS. Neuronal cells in nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) can synthesize GLP-1 and extends to hypothalamus, some thalamic and cortical areas. A G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) provides the majority of GLP-1 actions. GLP-1 receptor activation triggers some in vivo signaling pathways. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are used in the treatment diabetes and obesity. GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion, inhibits glucagon secretion, decreases food intake, reduces appetite, delays gastric emptying, provides weight reduction, and protects β cells from apoptosis. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. It is characterized by cognitive insufficiencies and behavioral changes that impact memory and learning abilities, daily functioning and quality of life. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, which are known as pathophysiological features of the T2DM, have also been demonstrated to have significant impact on cognitive impairment. It is thought that GLP-1 affects neurological and cognitive functions, as well as its regulatory effect on glucose metabolism. The pathophysiological relationship between GLP-1 and AD is discussed in this review."

Hypercholesterolemia and hyper LDL-C are associated with the atherosclerosis (AS). The current study was performed to evaluate the implication of the others lipoproteins (HDL, LDL, VLDL) and apolipoproteins (ApoA1, ApoB100) with subclinical atherosclerosis (carotid plaque) in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) free from cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Methods
Prospective transversal study was conducted in patients with MetS free from cardiovascular disease (CVD). The lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins were measured. The lipoproteins (HDL, LDL, VLDL) were obtained by the precipitation method. The carotid plaque (CP) was evaluated by ultrasonography, method for assessing AS. Logistic regression and analysis tree were used to look for the association and the incrimination of the lipoproteins with the presence of CP.
Results
The CP incidence was 60% among the participants, 34.29% on the right and the left plaque against 25.71% for only one plaque. The HDL-C was the only lipoprotein associated with the CP after adjustment of the age, the sex and BMI (OR: 0.007 P: 0.046) with the logistic regression analysis, HDL-C (<0.35 g/l), ApoA1 (<1.43 g/l) and VLDL-TG (>0.656 g/l) are implicated in the presence of CP with the analysis tree analysis.
Conclusion
Lower level of HDL-C is associated with CP, HDL-C, ApoA1, and high level VLDL-TG but not total cholesterol, and LDL-Care useful parameters in the assessment of initial atherosclerosis in metabolic syndrome."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 12 weeks of aerobic training on serum levels of high sensitivity C- reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), lipid profile and anthropometric characteristics in middle-aged women patients with type-2 diabetes.
Methods
A quasi-experimental study, 20 women patients with type-2 diabetes (mean age, 50.25 ± 4.36 years, Body mass index, 25.51 ± 2.91 kg/m2, and body fat percentage 23.67 ± 3.05%) were randomly categorized into two experimental and control groups. The protocol aerobic training included eight-minute jogging and eight-minute running with 75–85 percent maximum heart rate reserve in the first session. Per both sessions, one minute added to running time and it increased up to 32 min after 12 weeks. Blood sampling and anthropometric measurements, 24 h before and 48 h after the last training session were conducted.
Result
The result showed a significant reduction in hs-CRP and TNF-α in the experimental than control group (P = 0.01). Exercise training-treated patients showed a significant decrease in TG, LDL and increase HDL in comparison with baseline and the control group (P < .05). The results also showed a significant decrease in weight, body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist–hip ratio (P values 0.02, 0.03, 001, 0.04 respectively) following the 12 weeks aerobic training.
Conclusion
It seems that long-term aerobic training, improved some important anthropometric and biochemical parameters in patients with type-2 diabetes. These observations give a new insight into the mechanisms by which aerobic training can reduce the cardiovascular risk in diabetes."

A descriptive, observational study was completed in a tertiary care hospital between November 2014 and March 2016. Fifty consecutive patients of Type 2-Diabetes Mellitus who had been on metformin therapy for at least three months were included in our study. Several Parameters were compared with vitamin B12 levels and severity of peripheral neuropathy (using Toronto Clinical Scoring System (TCSS) and Nerve Conduction Velocity). These included the duration of diabetes, duration of metformin usage, dietary history, and HbA1c levels. Definite B12 deficiency was defined as B12<150pg/ml and possible B12 deficiency as <220pg/ml.
Results
In our study, we found a negative correlation between duration of metformin use and Vitamin B12 levels(r=−0.40). The mean Vitamin B12 levels seen in our study was 212.3pg/mL. There is a positive correlation between the duration of metformin therapy and peripheral neuropathy (r=0.40). The mean TCSS score was 6.8. The percentage of patients with mild neuropathy was 28%, with moderate neuropathy was 20% and severe neuropathy in 12% of the patients. The average duration of metformin use in patients without peripheral neuropathy was 5.5yrs whereas the average length of metformin use in patients with peripheral neuropathy was 10.4 yrs.
Conclusion
Patients on long-term metformin therapy are at a high risk for Vitamin B12 deficiency and peripheral neuropathy. Interval Screening for peripheral neuropathy is recommended for patients on metformin even if Vitamin B12 levels appear to be normal."

The study population comprised 220 children who underwent annual health checkups. Plasma Interleukin-10 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We divided the subjects into 4 groups according to Interleukin-10 levels. A reduction of plasma interleukin-10 levels significantly correlated with an increase in the mean number of metabolic risk factors such as increased waist circumference, BMI, dyslipidaemia, high blood pressure and glucose intolerance.
Conclusions
Circulating Interleukin-10 levels negatively correlated with the multiplicity of metabolic risk factors, suggesting that IL-10 acts as a biomarker of metabolic disorders."

Besides its role in calcium homeostasis, vitamin D (VD) has an important immuno-mudulation effect. However, its role in autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes is under discussion. This study designed to investigate serum VD status in children and adolescents with and without diabetes.
Materials and methods
In a case-control study, 85 diabetic and 85 non-diabetic control (total 170) aged 1–15 yr. were enrolled. History of breast feeding and vitamin supplementation was obtained; growth indices and serum levels of Calcium, phosphorous, Alkaline-Phosphatase (ALP), Hemoglobin-A1c and VD were measured and analyzed.
Results
The mean values for VD in case and control groups were 12.80 ± 10.59 and 15.85 ± 9.92 nmol/L, respectively (p = 0.057). Serum VD status in these two groups was sufficient in 5.88% and 9.41%, insufficient in 18% and 14%, and deficient in 75.29% and 76.74%, respectively. Compared to the controls, diabetics had more history of breast-feeding (62.35% vs. 42.35%; p = 0.017) and higher serum ALP levels (772.34 ± 309.89 vs. 657.99 ± 395.11 U/L; p = 0.032).
Conclusion
More frequency of breast-feeding, higher serum ALP and mildly lower serum level of VD in diabetics suggests a significant difference in VD status in diabetics compared to the healthy peers indicating a potential role of this deficiency in the disease process."

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and the associated factors of metabolically unhealthy in normal-weight and metabolically healthy in obese.
Methods
We analyzed the data of a representative sample of 986 participants recruited among adult population of north of Iran. Data were collected regarding demographic characteristics, lifestyle, body mass index, abdominal obesity measures, blood pressure, and lipid profiles. The participants were classified as metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy normal-weight (MUNW). Metabolically unhealthy was defined as the presence of  ≥2 non-obese components of metabolic syndrome based on ATP III criteria.
Results
The prevalence rate of MUNW and MHO accounted for 17.2% and 15.1% respectively. Mean age of participants with metabolically unhealthy was significantly greater than metabolically healthy in both normal weight and overweight/obese (P=0.001). The results of multiple logistic regression analysis showed in normal-weight individuals, a significant association of MUNW was found with age group of 50–59 years(OR=3.83, 95%CI: 1.71-8.57) and 60–70 years by OR=4.74(95%CI:1.79-12.54) as compared with age group of 20–29 years. It was also associated with current smoking. While metabolically healthy state in overweight/obese was inversely associated with age 50–59 years by OR=0.26 (95%CI:0.13-0.54) and age 60–70 years by OR=0.15 (95%CI:0.05- 0.39) and higher WC by OR=0.47 (95%CI:0.31-0.72) but positively associated with female-sex by OR=1.74 (95%CI:1.07-2.82).

Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most prevalent and progressive metabolic conditions affecting approximately 8.5% of the global population. Individuals with T2DM have a significantly increased risk of developing chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated complications, therefore, it is of great importance to establish strategies for combatting T2DM and its associated chronic conditions. Current literature has identified several biomarkers that are known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of CVD. Many of these biomarkers affecting CVD are influenced by an increase in oxidative stress as seen in T2DM. The purpose of this review is to analyse and correlate the oxidative stress-related biomarkers that have been identified in the literature to provide an updated summary of their significance in CVD risk factors.
Data synthesis
This review has analysed current research on T2DM, CVD, and oxidative stress. Four key cardiovascular risk factors: thrombosis, inflammation, vascular homeostasis and cellular proliferation were searched to identify potential biomarkers for this review. These biomarkers stem from seven major cellular pathways; NF-κB, Keap1-Nrf2, protein kinase-C, macrophage activation, arachidonic acid mobilisation, endothelial dysfunction and advanced glycation end products.
Conclusions
The pathways and biomarkers were analysed to show their role as contributing factors to CVD development and a summary is made regarding the assessment of cardiovascular risk in T2DM individuals."

A sample of 2039 patients with type 2 diabetes selected from primary care settings in the Aldakhiliyah Province of Oman were involved in a retrospective cohort study. All patients were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline (in 2009–2010) and were followed up until: 1) their first cardiovascular event occurred; 2) the patient died, or 3) the end of the data collection in December 2015.
Results
Among the total sample, 192 cardiovascular disease events were recorded within a mean follow-up period of 5.3-year. The 5-year probability of a cardiovascular event was given as 1−0.9991Exp∑XiBi, where Exp ∑XiBi (hazard ratio)=Exp (0.038 age+0.052 DM duration+0.102 HbA1c+0.201 total cholesterol+0.912 albuminuria [1 if present]+0.166 hypertension [1 if present]+0.005 BMI).

Total 172 adolescents having exogenous obesity aged 10–18 years were included. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) were defined as per WHO criteria.The adolescents having Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥95th centile were classified as obese.Waist circumference was measured at the level midway between the lower rib margin & the iliac crest, at the level of umbilicus with the person breathing out gently in centimeter. Hip circumference was measured at the maximum width over the buttocks at the level of the greater trochanters in centimeter.
Result
Among 172 obese adolescents, metabolic syndrome was found in 66 patients (38.4%). The commonest metabolic abnormality among those having metabolic syndrome was low HDL level (77.3%) followed by high triglyceride level(71.2%). Glucose intolerance (IFG and/or IGT) was found in 16.7%, Type 2 DM in 10.6%, systolic hypertension in 10.7% and diastolic hypertension in 12.1%. Triglyceride (p = 0.042) and Cholesterol level (p = 0.016) were significantly higher and HDL-cholesterol level (p = 0.000) was significantly lower among obese adolescents having metabolic syndrome. Less physical activity (p = 0.04) was significantly related to the development of metabolic syndrome.

In addition, the economic burden of OW and OB will be discussed. Abundant evidence is found to support the associations between obesity and other diseases. In general, the odd ratios, risk ratios or hazard ratios are often higher in OW and OB people than in the normal-weight ones. However, the molecular mechanism of how OW and OB induce the development of other diseases has not been fully understood. Figures also showed that obesity and its-related disorders exert enormous pressure on the economy which is projected to increase.

In this cross-sectional study, 352 faculty members with age of 35 years or more, belong to Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, were recruited during 2016 and 2017. Fasting blood samples were obtained to quantify serum 25(OH)D concentrations, glycemic indicators and lipid profile. Metabolic syndrome was defined based on the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III). Multivariate logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders was used to evaluate the association between vitamin D status and metabolic syndrome.
Result
Metabolic syndrome and vitamin D insufficiency were prevalent among 26% and 60.2% of subjects, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome across quartiles of 25(OH)D levels either before or after adjusting for potential confounders (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.43–1.95). In terms of metabolic syndrome components, subjects in the highest quartile of vitamin D levels had 59% decreased risk of abdominal obesity compared with those in the lowest quartile (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.17–0.99), after adjusting for potential confounders. Such inverse relationship was also seen for elevated blood pressure (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.14–0.99), and abnormal glucose homeostasis (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.19–0.85).
Conclusion
Serum levels of 25(OH)D was inversely associated with the risk of abdominal obesity, hypertension, and abnormal glucose homeostasis. However, no significant relationship was seen for metabolic syndrome."

abstract = "Background
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. The two main documented pathogenic mechanisms are hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenemia but there is growing evidence for increased predisposition to cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our study aims to analyze the association of PCOS with cardiovascular risk factors.
Methods
This is a prospective study which targeted 100 PCOS patients from Civil Hospital Karachi over a period of one year (July 2016 to July 2017). An equal number of age-matched healthy control participants were also included in the study. The student’s t-test was used to assess the significance of differences using SPSS version (19). The statistical significance was set at a p-value of <.05.
Results
The most frequently presented feature associated with PCOS was primary infertility seen in 72% of the patients. Mean arterial pressure, fasting glucose and insulin levels and insulin resistance was found to be significantly different in PCOS patients as compared to their controls. A classic atherosclerotic lipid profile demonstrating elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C) levels and decreased serum high density lipoprotein-C(HDL-C) was observed in our study.
Conclusion
This study established a significant yet independent association of PCOS with major cardiovascular risk factors. This association can effectively progress into CVD outcomes which necessitates early intervention programs and preventative strategies to reduce mortality from cardiovascular events. This study lays out the framework for conducting further researches on the PCOS women while exploring novel cardiovascular risk factors."

Some studies have demonstrated that metabolic syndrome is associated with hematological parameters. The present study explores the relationship between hematological parameters and numbers of metabolic syndrome conditions in Iranian men.
Methods
This cross-sectional study included 11,114 participants who were professional drivers of commercial motor vehicles, and were enrolled in the Iranian Health Surveys between 2014 and 2016. Diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was made according to International Diabetes Federation criteria. Clinical data, including anthropometric measurements and serum parameters, were collected. Odds ratios for hematological parameters and metabolic syndrome were calculated using binary logistic regression models.
Results
We found that hemoglobin; platelet, and white blood cell counts increased with increasing numbers of metabolic syndrome components (p<0.05 for all). The odds ratio of metabolic syndrome significantly increased across successive quartiles of platelet (1.00, 1.25, 1.29, and 1.51) and white blood cell counts (1.00, 1.51, 1.79, and 2.11) with the lowest quartile as the referent group. Similar associations for hemoglobin and hematocrit in the top quartile were also observed. We did not observe any significant difference in the mean of neutrophil count, mean platelet volume (MPV), red cell distribution width, or platelet distribution width among participants with or without metabolic syndrome.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that high levels of major hematological parameters such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, as well as platelet and white blood cell counts could be novel indicators for the development of metabolic syndrome."

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the influence of antioxidant vitamins on the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic therapy in type 2 diabetic patients (T2DM). This single-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin C and/or E supplementation on the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic therapy in T2DM Palestinian male patients from the Gaza Strip.
Methods
Forty T2DM male patients aged 40–60 years on metformin treatment were randomly divided into four groups, each group received an additional one of the following daily oral supplements for 90 days: placebo; vitamin C; vitamin E and vitamin C plus vitamin E. After overnight fasting, venous blood specimens were collected from all individuals into K3-EDTA tubes and serum tubes for measuring the biochemical and hematological parameters of the study at baseline and after 90 days of vitamins supplementation.
Results
The results revealed that vitamin C and/or E improve fasting blood sugar (FBS), HbA1c, lipid profile, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), reduced glutathione (GSH); and Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QISCI) compared with diabetic patients group that received placebo.
Conclusion
This study provided additional evidence on the beneficial effects of supplementing antioxidant vitamins in T2DM which could improve the clinical condition and attenuate or prevent diabetic pathogenesis and complications that, secondly to poor glycemic control, could attribute to the imbalance between the decline in the endogenous antioxidants and increasing production of the reactive oxygen species leading to the oxidant-mediated damage present in the diabetic context."

Metabolic Syndrome “MetS” is characterized by the presence of several factors that play a major role in the development of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. This study was conducted to establish the prevalence of MetS and its individual components among the overweight and obese students at An-Najah National University (ANU) using IDF and modified NCEP ATP III definition and to identify conditions associated with it.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2016. Data were collected in two stages: first stage included anthropometric and blood pressure measurements for 850 participants. Second stage included a self-administered questionnaire and biochemical analysis for only overweight or obese (154) participants.
Results
The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 26.2%, with significant increase among males (36.4%) compared with females (19.1%). The prevalence of MetS among obese and overweight was (28.6%) according to IDF with no significant increase compared to NCEP ATP criteria (24%). Reduced HDL- cholesterol was the most prevalent component (74.7%) in obese and overweight participants followed by central obesity (72.1%), raised blood pressure (29.9%), elevated fasting blood sugar (24%), and lastly increased triglycerides (18.2%). No significant differences were found between males and females according to both criteria. Moreover, no significant associations with geographic locality, house-hold income, smoking, physical activity, or family history were determined.
Conclusions
The prevalence of MetS among overweight and obese young adult Palestinians was high and demands immediate intervention, given the potential for these adults to develop chronic diseases."

Patient and methods
One hundred and one adult patients with end stage renal disease on maintenance haemodialysis who are met with the exclusion criteria were enrolled in this cross sectional study from haemodialysis unit of Baghdad teaching hospital over the period of July/2015 − June 2016. All patients were thoroughly examined and many variables were evaluated (age, gender, blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, serum lipid profile, smoking habits, serum albumin, CRP, calcium, Phosphate, Parathyroid hormone and haemoglobin measurements). All patients underwent a carotid Doppler ultrasound study.
Results
Atherosclerosis was present in 65.3%: 58.4% of patients had malnutrition and 43.6% had inflammation. The association for atherosclerosis and high CRP and low serum albumin is strong and independent of other atherosclerosis risk factors. There is significant inverse and independent correlation between CRP and albumin.
Conclusion
Inflammation (high serum CRP) and malnutrition (low serum albumin) in patients on haemodialysis are significantly associated with carotid atherosclerosis. Inflammation was more prevalent in the malnourished patients than in those with normal nutritional status."

Expeditious and precise discerning of bacterial pathogens is a fundamental grail, of clinical diagnostic microbiology. Genotypic detection is a budding substitute to recognize phenotypic culture based processes in bacterial identification.
Aims
We report a comparative evaluation of biochemical and genomic-based assays for exploring the commonest bacterial flora of infected diabetic foot ulcers along with clinical variables of subjects enrolled.
Methods
The pathogens selected (i) Staphylococcus aureus ii) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, iii) Escherichia coli and iv) Klebsiella pneumonia, stood for the most frequent isolates of diabetic foot infection in previous studies from Northern India. Identification of these pathogens were done by conventional assays and polymerase chain reaction.
Results
Of 50 specimens obtained from infected DFUs, 74% of cases were affirmative by bacteriological assays and 90% showed positivity via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among processed samples 44 isolates were detectable through phenotypic analysis and 65 bacteria by species-specific PCR. Thirteen samples and 21 isolates could not be scrutinized by phenotypic identification systems. The most prevalent pathogens identifiable were Klebsiella pneumonia, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.
Conclusions
We have shown that PCR-based diagnostic methods improved the identification compared to conventional methods and highlight the incorporation of PCR due to shorten turnaround time translating into improved clinical outcomes."

To study the effect of parental history of diabetes on markers of inflammation, insulin resistance, adiposity indices and carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) in first degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Materials and methods
Normal glucose tolerant (NGT) first degree relatives of T2DM patients of age group 20–40 years designated as FHpositive were enrolled in the cross sectional study. Depending on the parental history of diabetes they were divided into three groups: family history positive in father (FHfather), family history positive in mother (FHmother) and family history positive in both (FHboth). Age, sex and BMI matched controls without any history of diabetes in their parents designated as FHnegative were taken for comparison. All subjects underwent detailed clinical evaluation and biochemical investigations. cIMT and adiposity indices like visceral adipose tissue thickness (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness (SAT) were assessed using ultrasonography.
Results
No difference existed with regards to BMI, hsCRP, degree of insulin resistance, adiposity markers and cIMT between FHmother and FHfather group. Subjects in FHboth group had significantly higher degree of insulin resistance, subclinical inflammation, increased atherosclerosis and adiposity indices in contrast to those who have a single parent T2DM family history.
Conclusions
hsCRP and cIMT are significantly higher in the first degree relatives of type2 diabetes mellitus patients than controls. Individuals with history of T2DM in both parents have significantly worse glycemic status, increased cIMT and adverse cardiovascular risk profile than those with T2DM history in only single parent."

Results
The prevalence of diabetic foot ulcer was 6.4% (95% CI: 4.64–8.73). Seventeen cases of them were female (4.9%). In univariate analysis, the following variables had statistically significant relationship with DFU prevalence: diabetes duration, educational level, 10 g monofilament sensation, Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) and Body Mass Index (BMI). Patients' age, glycemic control and smoking did not show any significant relationship with DFU. After logistic regression analysis, the patients with decreased 10 g monofilament sensation had DFU more than patients with normal sensation (OR = 8.84, 95% CI: 3.5–22.3). Abnormal ABI increased the odds of DFU (OR = 5.6, 95% CI: 1.3–24.18). The DFU prevalence in patients with diabetes duration of 11–20 years, was more than patients with ≤5 years (OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.33–10.8).The odds of DFU development in educated patients compared with illiterate patients was 0.27(95% CI: 0.12–0.57).

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are some of the leading causes of death in the world, and diet has roles in their etiology. This research study therefore investigates the glycemic index (GI) of soy flour fortified whole wheat meal (SFFWWM) consumed with Talinum triangulare (gbure) soup and the effects of the meal on the lipid profiles of the test human subjects.
Methods
The control human subjects and test human subjects were fed D-glucose (DG) and whole wheat meal (WWM) with Talinum triangulare soup respectively on the first day of the experiment, and SFFWWM with the same soup the next day (for test subjects only) after 10–12h overnight fasting. Blood glucose levels of the subjects were taken before and 2h after meals’ consumption at 30min interval and blood samples collected for lipid profiles evaluations.
Results
The result of the study showed that; SFFWWM consumed with Talinum trianguilare soup has a non-significant lower GI than WWM consumed with the same soup, but a significant lower GI than DG at (P<0.05). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in lipid profiles of the test human subjects between when they consumed WWM and SFFWWM with the soup however, SFFWWM reduced TC, TG, LDL-C and VDL-C and increased HDL-C and TP than WMM at (P<0.05). In addition, GI is positively correlated with TC, TG, LDL-C and VLDL-C, but is negatively correlated with TP and HDL-C.
Conclusion
It can therefore be concluded that; fortifying WWM with soy flour would reduce the risk factors of CVDs and DM, the diseases recently claiming thousands of today."

Elevated cardiac troponin I, Creatine kinase (CK-MB) and Myoglobin levels are observed in the setting of acute myocardial damage. However sub-clinical elevations occur in patients with diabetes mellitus. This study was carried out to determine the relationship between the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors and the metabolic syndrome and elevations in cardiac markers in patients with type2 diabetes mellitus.
Subjects and methods
Consecutive stable out-patients with type2 diabetes mellitus at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Nigeria were recruited. Non-diabetic individuals such as hospital staff and the general public acted as controls. Baseline demographic data collection was done and waist circumference, weight, height and blood pressure were measured. Venous samples were assayed for CTnI, CK-MB and Myoglobin levels using ELISA. Data was analysed using SPSS v 20.
Results
There were 188 DM patients, who were older than the 200 control subjects (56.1 ± 13.1 years and 42.7 ± 5.7 years, p < 0.001). Mean duration of diabetes was 7.1(5.7) years.

The presence of hypertension or dyslipidaemia was not significantly associated with the cardiac markers (p > 0.05 for all), however the DM patients with metabolic syndrome had higher levels of CK-MB and myoglobin but not CTnI than those without.
Conclusion
Diabetes mellitus is associated with chronic sub-clinical elevation of cardiac markers and this is more in those with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and/or the metabolic syndrome."

Patients of diabetes mellitus experience psychological difficulties associated with their disease which remains unrecognized involving several states related to coping with diabetes. Diabetes distress is a distinct condition which is often mistaken for depression and is related to adverse disease outcomes.
Aims and objective
To study the prevalence and predictors of diabetes distress in patients of Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a tertiary care centre.
Materials and methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of one year at Endocrine OPD of Pt. B.D. Sharma PGIMS, Rohtak, a tertiary care centre in northern India. 410 consecutive patients having T2DM attending the endocrine OPD were screened for psychiatric disorders and 189 diabetic patients with no underlying psychiatric disorders were included in the study. Their socio-demographic and relevant clinical variables were recorded. Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) was used to measure distress due to the disease in these patients.
Results
It was found that the prevalence of diabetes distress was 18.0%; among them 16.1% had emotion related distress, 5.6% regimen related distress, 1.5% interpersonal related distress and 1.2% physician related diabetes distress. The major predictors for high diabetes distress scores among diabetic cases were low education level, retinopathy, neuropathy and hypertension.
Conclusion
The present study suggests that emotion related diabetes distress was more prevalent among diabetic patients. Lower education level and the presence of diabetic complications contribute as risk factors for high diabetes distress."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a wide spectrum of liver disease that ranges from hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Obesity and diabetes mellitus are the prime risk factors for NAFLD. The aim of this study was to find out the prevalence of NAFLD among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to detect the association of NAFLD with cardiovascular disease in them.
Study design
Prospective observational study.
Material and methods
The study was conducted on 300 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus attending the outpatient department of a tertiary care teaching hospital. All patients underwent hepatic ultrasonography to look for hepatic steatosis. Among the 300 patients, 124 were divided into NAFLD and non-NAFLD groups based on the ultrasound findings. These patients were subjected to electrocardiogram, 2D echocardiogram, carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) measurement and ankle brachial pressure index measurement along with measurement of markers of oxidative stress.
Results
Hepatic steatosis was present in 61% of diabetic patients in this study. Cardiovascular disease was not found to be significantly associated in diabetic patients with NAFLD. However, cardiovascular risk factors like CIMT, high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were elevated in these patients. hs-CRP and MDA levels were found to be significantly associated with the severity of NAFLD.
Conclusion
There is a high prevalence of NAFLD in type 2 diabetic patients. No correlation was detected between the presence of NAFLD and cardiovascular disease in them; although there was an association between cardiovascular risk factors and NAFLD."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in type 2 diabetes and limits the treatment choices for glycaemic control. Our aim was to examine real-world prescribing for managing hyperglycaemia in the presence of CKD.
Methods
The SAIL (Secure Anonymised Information Linkage) databank was used to examine prescribing during the period from the 1st of January to 30th December 2014. CKD was defined as:- none or mild CKD, eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73m2; moderate CKD eGFR <60mL/min/1.73m2; and severe CKD eGFR <30mL/min/1.73m2 or requiring dialysis.
Results
We identified 9585 subjects who received any form of glucose lowering therapy (8363 had no/mild CKD; 1137 moderate CKD; 85 severe CKD). There was a linear association between insulin use and CKD severity with approximately 54% of those with severe CKD receiving insulin. Sulphonylureas use did not differ among the CKD groups and was approximately 40%. Metformin showed a linear decrease across the groups, however approximately 21% in the severe CKD group received metformin. The use of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) was approximately 20% and did not differ among groups. The DPP-4 inhibitor choice was:- 1% vildagliptin, 9% saxagliptin, 58% sitagliptin, and 32% linaglitpin. With respect to sitagliptin and saxagliptin, 72% and 62% received an inappropriately high dose in the setting of CKD.
Conclusions
We observed that a considerable proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD were receiving metformin and non dose-adjusted DPP-4 inhibitors. Careful consideration of medication use and dosaging is required in the setting of CKD and type 2 diabetes."

To examine the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes among subjects aged 60 years and older in Ecuador.
Materials and methods
The present study used data from the National Survey of Health, Wellbeing, and Aging to describe the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes among older adults. Logistic regression models were assembled to examine the association between certain demographic and health characteristics of participants and prediabetes and diabetes prevalence rates.
Results
Of 2298 participants, the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes was 36.9% (95% CI: 34.2%–39.6%) and 16.7% (95% CI: 14.9%–18.7%) among older adults in Ecuador, respectively. Notably, higher diabetes prevalence rates were seen among women, black subjects, residents in the urban coastal region, and obese participants than those without. In general, the prevalence of diabetes widely varied across provinces of the country, with higher rates seen in provinces along the coastal region of the country. After adjustment for age, gender, and BMI, residents in the urban coast, subjects with greater number of comorbidities, and those classified as having hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia had significantly higher odds of having diabetes than those without.
Conclusions
Prediabetes and diabetes are prevalent among older adults in Ecuador. The increased prevalence of these metabolic disorders was particularly associated with obesity. Thus, the present findings may assist health care authorities to implement healthy lifestyle interventions among older Ecuadorians at risk for diabetes."

Peripheral neuropathy is one of the main complications of diabetes mellitus. One of the features of diabetic nerve damage is abnormality of sensory and motor nerve conduction study. An electrophysiological examination can be reproduced and is also a non-invasive approach in the assessment of peripheral nerve function. Population-based and clinical studies have been conducted to validate the sensitivity of these methods. When the diagnosis was based on clinical electrophysiological examination, abnormalities were observed in all patients.
Method
In this research, using a review design, we reviewed the issue of clinical electrophysiological examination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in articles from 2008 to 2017. For this purpose, PubMed, Scopus and Embase databases of journals were used for searching articles.
Results/findings
The researchers indicated that diabetes (both types) is a very disturbing health issue in the modern world and should be given serious attention. Based on conducted studies, it was demonstrated that there are different procedures for prevention and treatment of diabetes-related health problems such as diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN). The first objective quantitative indication of the peripheral neuropathy is abnormality of sensory and motor nerve conduction tests. Electrophysiology is accurate, reliable and sensitive. It can be reproduced and also is a noninvasive approach in the assessment of peripheral nerve function.
Conclusion
The methodological review has found that the best method for quantitative indication of the peripheral neuropathy compared with all other methods is clinical electrophysiological examination. For best results, standard protocols such as temperature control and equipment calibration are recommended."

Glycated albumin (GA) suggested being alternative glycemic marker than haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD). We investigated the association between GA and the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in T2DM subjects.
Methods
We recruited T2DM subjects with different stages of CKD who had regularly measured serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) according to Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, HbA1c consecutively every 3 months along with GA levels and other anthropometric and demographic measurements. We grouped age and sex matched subjects into the CKD progression, Group I healthy subjects (n = 100, M: F;50:50). Group II T2DM subjects with eGFR ≥90 mL/min (n = 167, M:F; 76:91). Group III of T2DM patients with eGFR 60–89 mL/min (n = 91, M:F; 44:47). Group IV T2DM subjects with eGFR 30–59 mL/min (n = 68, M:F;31:37). Group V T2DM with eGFR ≤ 29 mL/min (n = 21, M:F; 13:8).
Results
Pearson’s correlation analysis between glycated albumin and biochemical parameters were established in all subjects. GA/HbA1c ratio increases with poor glycemic control except for nephrosis state.
Conclusion
Mean GA levels were more closely associated with DN progression than mean HbA1c in subjects with T2DM and can be implemented as an alternative diagnostic marker in nephropathy."

It is characterized by the degeneration of the myelin sheath around axons, referred to as demyelination. Such demyelinations are often caused by reduced lipid component of the myelin sheath. Since, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) provides the lipid for myelin sheath by hydrolysing the triglyceride rich lipoproteins, and also helps in the uptake of lipids by the Schwann cells (SCs) for its utilization, LPL is considered as the important factor in the regeneration of myelin sheath during diabetic neuropathy. Earlier reports from our laboratory have provided the insights of insulin and its receptor in SCs during diabetic neuropathy. In order to evaluate the long term effect of insulin on lipid metabolism during diabetic neuropathy, in this study, we analyzed the expression of LPL in SCs under normal, high glucose and insulin treated conditions. A decrease in the expression of LPL was observed in SCs of high glucose condition and it was reversed upon insulin treatment. Histochemical observations of sciatic nerve of insulin treated neuropathy subjects showed the improved nerve morphology, signifying the importance of insulin in restoring the pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy."

abstract = "Objective
Several methods are available to calculate glycemic variability (GV), quality of glycemic control (QGC) and glycemic risk (GR). However, clinicians do not easily interpret these data. This study evaluates whether the results of the different methods can be interpreted as equivalent.
Methods
A prospective study was performed including outpatients with DMT2 evaluated at the San Ignacio Hospital and the Colombian Diabetes Association in Bogotá, Colombia. From six-day continuous glucose monitoring data, GV (SD, CV, IQR, MODD, MAGE), QGC (M-value, J-index) and GR (LBGI, HBGI) were calculated. Reference values ​​were generated, classifying the patients according to GV control quartiles (excellent, good, fair or poor). The concordance between the different indices was evaluated.
Results
In total, 140 patients (68.9 ± 11.2 years) were included. The agreement levels (Kappa) between GV indices were moderate, 0.40 (CI 95%:0.29–0.51), 0.42 (CI 95%:0.31–0.53) and 0.39 (CI 95%:0.28–0.50), for CV versus SD, IQR and CONGA respectively. The levels of agreement between GV and QGC indices were minimal (Kappa CV vs. M-value, 0.15CI 95%:0.046–0.26) and weak between the GV and GR indices (Kappa CVvs.LBGI 0.37CI95%:0.26–0.48). The estimators did not improve significantly when the analysis was performed with linearly weighted or quadratic weighted Kappa.
Conclusions
The present study demonstrates that the concordance between the clinical interpretation of the different GV, QGC and GR indices is poor, suggesting that they cannot be assumed as equivalent, so different indices evaluating different concepts, must be evaluated simultaneously to analyze adequately each patient. New studies are needed to evaluate which of the methods better predicts hypoglycemia and microvascular or macrovascular complications."

Demographic and anthropometric data, as well as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (serum 25(OH)D), blood glucose, and lipid concentrations were obtained for 508 urban residents aged 19–70 years. After grouping into tertiles according to their serum 25(OH)D concentrations, linear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations between serum 25(OH)D concentration and risk factors for MS across tertiles.
Results
A 1 ng/mL increase in 25(OH)D was associated with a significant decrease in total cholesterol by 0.25 mmol/L [95% CI: (−0.44, −0.05); P = 0.014] for the third tertile, with reference to the first tertile. Also, 1 ng/mL increase in 25(OH)D was associated with a significant decrease in LDL by 0.18 mmol/L [95% CI: (−0.35, −0.02); P = 0.026] for the third tertile. In addition, participants in the third tertile had a 54% reduction in the OR for MS [95% CI: (−1.10,− 0.02), P = 0.041]. Lastly, while there was no gender difference in vitamin D deficiency status, the non-MS women had significantly higher 25(OH)D level than those with MS (30.1 ± 5.8 vs. 28.5 ± 5.9 ng/mL, P = 0.035), while no such difference was observed for men.
Conclusions
Higher serum 25(OH)D concentration was associated with a better metabolic profile and thus a lower risk for developing MS in urban Shanghai residents of China."

abstract = "Aim
Among the most common metabolic disorders during pregnancy is gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This research was conducted to examine the dietary pattern in women with GDM.
Material and methods
In this case-study, 204 pregnant women (104 cases and 100 control women) were chosen through convenient sampling and random sampling. The subjects' food intakes were assessed using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, while their activities evaluated by physical activity questionnaire. Anthropometric indices were measured based on standard instructions, and the body mass index was calculated. The dietary patterns were determined using principal component analysis and its relationship with preeclampsia was tested using logistic regression method.
Results
Unhealthy and healthy dietary patterns were found among the pregnant women. In the unhealthy group, after modifying the effect of confounding variables, a significant relationship was observed between dietary pattern and having gestational diabetes (OR = 2.838,95% CI:1.039–7.751). In the healthy group, on the other hand, the people in the fourth quartile had 149% and 184% higher chance not to catch gestational diabetes before and after modification with confounders, respectively (OR = 0.284,95% CI:0.096–0.838), when compared with people in the first quartile.
Conclusion
The findings indicated that selection of foods including fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairies, etc. as healthy dietary pattern is associated with diminished risk of GDM among pregnant women. Determining healthy dietary pattern during pregnancy, considering the foods consumed among pregnant women, as a useful and practical guide during this period can be publicized for training and nutritional interventions."

abstract = "Aim
The aim of this study was to assess the level of sugar intake among Sudanese individuals.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study with 323 participants. Respondents were grouped by the total intake of added sugars into two groups, one group with sugar intake more than 200 calories per day and other group with sugar intake less than 200 calories per day. Demographic data were collected with anthropometric measurements like body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Chi square, T-Tests and stepwise logistic regression were used (a p-value <0.05 was considered significant).
Results
High sugar intake was noted among 74.6% participants and among overweight, normal weight, followed by obese (p<0.015) and then individuals with diabetes and hypertension (p <0.000 and 0.038 respectively).High sugar intake was also associated with abdominal obesity (p<0.016), mean age of 33 years old (p<0.00) and being married and single(p<0.003). Stepwise logistic regression showed diabetes and BMI<25 were absolute predictors for sugar consumption with p value of 0.001 and 0.039 respectively. Individuals with diabetes have more than five times probability to consume large amount of sugar (Odd ratio 5.6), while those with BMI<25 have two times risk of consuming more sugar compared to those with BMI>25 group (Odd ratio 2.1).
Conclusion
A large percentage of Sudanese population uses a high amount of sugar. High sugar intake was associated with normal weight, overweight, abdominal obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Absolute predictors of high sugar intake were diabetes and normal body weight."

abstract = "Background
Studies reported that lipid-lowering treatment may increase the risk of diabetes, support the hypothesis that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) may be associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Objective
The aim of this study was to assess the association between the LDLC levels and the incidence of T2D in an Iranian high-risk population not treated with lipid-lowering medications.
Methods
Mean 10-year follow-up data (1819) in non-diabetic first-degree relatives (FDR) of consecutive patients with T2D 30–70 years old, who were not treated with lipid-lowering drugs at baseline were examined. The diagnosis of T2D based on serial oral glucose tolerance test was the primary outcome. Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for the incidence of T2D within tertiles of LDLC.
Results
A higher LDLC concentration was significantly associated with higher risk of T2D. Compared with the first tertile, the adjusted risk of T2D increased for the second (HR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.35, P < 0.01) and third (HR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.37, P < 0.01), tertiles of LDLC.
Conclusions
While these results await confirmation, a higher LDLC level was significantly associated with higher risk of T2D, independent of age, gender, fasting plasma glucose, waist circumference or blood pressure, in high-risk individuals in Iran."

abstract = "Background
Diabetes emerges out to be a major epidemic in recent years that engulfs both developed and developing countries across the globe. India, a country witnessing rapid socioeconomic progress and urbanization carries a considerable share of the global diabetes burden. There has been an incongruity between disease burden and the technical capacity to make use of existing knowledge or to generate new knowledge to combat diabetes in India.
Aim
This paper examines the role of different actors, organizations & institutions in shaping diabetology research in India using arrays of scientific indicators such as research output (publications and patents), research finance and role of policy-making bodies. This paper also identifies research gaps and challenges pertinent to this sector.
Methodology
A combination of three methods patent data analysis, publication data analysis and primary survey corroborated with secondary data to obtain desire objectives. We made an in-depth study of the patent and publication data (2000–2016) to know the research output and direction of Indian actors, institutions and organizations in the area of diabetes research.
Results
This paper identifies some key structural barriers and institutional challenges pertinent to diabetology research in India that will help in canvassing and formulating science, technology and policy guidelines for diabetology research in India
Conclusion
Multilevel intervention requires bridging the gap between knowledge and action hence policy-making should align to balance resources with innovation capabilities."
