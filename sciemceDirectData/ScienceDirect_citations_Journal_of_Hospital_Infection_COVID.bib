abstract = "Summary
Background
Global pandemic outbreaks often have people fear. Healthcare personnel (HCP), especially those fighting the pathogens at the front lines, encounter a higher risk of being infected, while they treat patients. In addition, a variety of environmental fomites in hospitals, which may contain infectious agents, can post a high risk of getting infectious diseases.
Aim
Making HCP feel safe from infectious diseases is critical to delivering the best healthcare practice. Therefore, this study aims provide a better understanding of HCP’s HH behaviours and perceptions of infectious diseases from psychological perspectives.
Method
Observations measured different environmental features at three different departments and questionnaires asked HCP’s perception of safety from infectious diseases and coping behaviors (e.g., avoidance and disinfection).
Findings
This study has implications for potential interventions that enough HH stations at convenient locations would increase HH compliance rate from psychological perspectives, perception of safety from infectious diseases. In response to the current research gap in psychological aspects associated with HH, this study also presents HCP’s coping behaviours (e.g., avoidance and disinfection) would be predicted by their perceived contamination likelihoods and their perceived vulnerability enhanced the associations.
Conclusions
Nonetheless, due to several limitations, those findings should be carefully interpreted and further studies must be conducted with more solid academic rigor."

Background
Viral respiratory illnesses are common causes of outbreaks and can be fatal to some patients.
Aim
To investigate the association between laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections and potential sources of exposure during the previous 7 days.
Methods
In this nested case–control analysis, healthcare personnel from nine Canadian hospitals who developed acute respiratory illnesses during the winters of 2010/11–2013/14 submitted swabs that were tested for viral pathogens. Associated illness diaries and the weekly diaries of non-ill participants provided information on contact with people displaying symptoms of acute respiratory illness in the previous week. Conditional logistic regression assessed the association between cases, who were matched by study week and site with controls with no respiratory symptoms.
Findings
There were 814 laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory illnesses. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of a viral illness was higher for healthcare personnel reporting exposures to ill household members [7.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.4–9.1], co-workers (3.4, 95% CI 2.4–4.7) or other social contacts (5.1, 95% CI 3.6–7.1). Exposures to patients with respiratory illness were not associated with infection (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7–1.2); however, healthcare personnel with direct patient contact did have higher odds (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1–1.6). The aORs for exposure and for direct patient contact were similar for illnesses caused by influenza.
Conclusion
Community and co-worker contacts are important sources of viral respiratory illness in healthcare personnel, while exposure to patients with recognized respiratory infections is not associated. The comparatively low risk associated with direct patient contact may reflect transmission related to asymptomatic patients or unrecognized infections."

abstract = "Summary
Background
An exceptionally high demand for surgical masks and N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) during the COVID-19 pandemic has considerably exceeded their supply. These disposable devices are generally not approved for routine decontamination and re-use as a standard of care, while this practice has widely occurred in hospitals. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allowed it “as a crisis capacity strategy”. However, limited testing was conducted on the impact of specific decontamination methods on the performance of N95 FFRs and no data was presented for surgical masks.
Aim
We evaluated common surgical masks and N95 respirators with respect to the changes in their performance and integrity resulting from autoclave sterilization and a 70% ethanol treatment; these methods are frequently utilized for re-used filtering facepieces in hospitals.
Methods
The filter collection efficiency and pressure drop were determined for unused masks and N95 FFRs, and for those subjected to the treatments in a variety of ways. The collection efficiency was measured for particles of approximately 0.037–3.2 μm to represent aerosolized single viruses, their agglomerates, bacteria and larger particle carriers.
Findings
The initial collection efficiency and the filter breathability may be compromised by sterilization in an autoclave and ethanol treatment. The effect depends on a protective device, particle size, breathing flow rate, type of treatment and other factors. Additionally, physical damages were observed in N95 respirators after autoclaving.
Conclusion
Strategies advocating decontamination and re-use of filtering facepieces in hospitals should be re-assessed considering the data obtained in this study."

Background
Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a shortage of respirators is occurring worldwide; more specifically, Conformité Européene (CE)-certified Filtering Face-Piece (FFP2) respirators. This has resulted in an increased supply to hospitals of alternative respirators of uncertain quality. Nevertheless, the quality of the respirators used by our healthcare workers must be ensured.
Aim
To develop a protocol to ensure the quality of respiratory protective devices for healthcare workers nursing and treating patients with possible or confirmed COVID-19 in the Catharina Hospital.
Methods
A protocol and criteria based on applicable standards were developed to ensure the quality of respirators. The protocol has been implemented at the Catharina Hospital and includes verification of the documents accompanying the respirator, visual inspection of the respirator, and a test for total inward leak of particles into respirators.
Findings
Sixty-seven percent of the respirator brands and types received in the Catharina Hospital did not meet quality criteria.
Conclusion
With a simple verification protocol the quality of the respirators can be checked and guaranteed while there is a shortage of the CE-approved respirators that are normally used. With this in-hospital protocol, healthcare workers can be equipped with safe-to-use respirators."

Aim
The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) between February 24th to April 30th, 2020 in a hospital in Madrid, Spain.
Methods
We designed a retrospective cohort study. Cumulative COVID-19 incidence was calculated for all HCWs and categorized according to presumed level of COVID-19 exposure (high, medium and low).
Results
Among 1,911 HCW, 213 (11.1%) had COVID-19 during the study period. Cases increased gradually from March 8th, peaking in March 17th and declining thereafter. The peak of cases among HCWs was reached 14 days before the peak in admitted COVID-19 cases in the hospital. There were no significant differences in the proportion of COVID-19 cases according to level of occupational exposure (p=0.123). There were 5 departments and 2 professions in which more than 20% of the workers had confirmed COVID-19. We identified temporal clusters in three of these departments and one profession, with most of the cases occurring over a period of less than 5 days. The prevalence of comorbidities was low and 91.5% of patients had mild or moderate symptoms. Eleven patients were admitted to the hospital and 1 patient needed intensive care. None of the patients died. The median time of sick leave was 20 (IQR: 15 – 26) days.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that HCW-to-HCW transmission accounted for part of the cases. In spite of a low prevalence of comorbidities and a mild clinical course in most cases, COVID-19 caused long periods of sick leave."

abstract = "Summary
Single-use filtering face respirators (FFRs) are critical pieces of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers treating patients with suspected upper respiratory tract pathogens. Experiences during pandemics in the 2000s, as well as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-2-CoV-2, have highlighted concerns over the pressures that sustained respiratory virus pandemics may have on supplies of FFRs globally. Decontamination of FFRs has been posited as one solution to support the re-use of FFRs with a growing body of literature over the last 10+ years beginning to examine both the efficacy of disinfection of contaminated FFRs but also the impact of the decontamination process on the FFR's performance. Physical and chemical methods of decontamination have been tested for treatment of FFRs with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, sterilization by steam, ethylene oxide and vaporous hydrogen peroxide, demonstrating the most promising results thus far. Many of these methods utilize existing equipment that may already be available in hospitals and could be re-purposed for FFR decontamination. Importantly, some methods may also be replicated on household equipment, broadening the utility of FFR decontamination across a range of healthcare settings. Utilizing techniques to experimentally contaminate FFRs with a range of microorganisms, most decontamination methods appear to reduce the risk of the mask as a source of infection to the wearer and others to negligible levels. The performance of the filter, especially the efficiency of particle penetration following treatment, varied greatly depending on the processing method as well as the model of the filter itself, however. Urgent regulatory body-supported research is required to endorse the routine decontamination of FFRs. In emergency settings, these methods should nevertheless be carefully considered as one strategy to address potential shortfalls in supplies of FFRs for healthcare workers."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan in December 2019 and has rapidly spread across different cities within and outside China. Hong Kong started to prepare for COVID-19 on 31st December 2019 and infection control measures in public hospitals were tightened to limit nosocomial transmission within healthcare facilities. However, the recommendations on the transmission-based precautions required for COVID-19 in hospital settings vary from droplet and contact precautions, to contact and airborne precautions with placement of patients in airborne infection isolation rooms.
Aim
To describe an outbreak investigation of a patient with COVID-19 who was nursed in an open cubicle of a general ward before the diagnosis was made.
Method
Contacts were identified and risk categorized as ‘close’ or ‘casual’ for decisions on quarantine and/or medical surveillance. Respiratory specimens were collected from contacts who developed fever, and/or respiratory symptoms during the surveillance period and were tested for SARS-CoV-2.
Findings
A total of 71 staff and 49 patients were identified from contact tracing, seven staff and 10 patients fulfilled the criteria of ‘close contact’. At the end of 28-day surveillance, 76 tests were performed on 52 contacts and all were negative, including all patient close contacts and six of the seven staff close contacts. The remaining contacts were asymptomatic throughout the surveillance period.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not spread by an airborne route, and nosocomial transmissions can be prevented through vigilant basic infection control measures, including wearing of surgical masks, hand and environmental hygiene."

abstract = "Summary
Background
Nosocomial or healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are associated with a financial burden that affects both patients and healthcare institutions worldwide. The clinical best care practices (CBPs) of hand hygiene, hygiene and sanitation, screening, and basic and additional precautions aim to reduce this burden. The COVID-19 pandemic has confirmed these four CBPs are critically important prevention practices that limit the spread of HCAIs.
Aim
This paper conducted a systematic review of economic evaluations related to these four CBPs using a discounting approach.
Methods
We searched for articles published between 2000 and 2019. We included economic evaluations of infection prevention and control of Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. Results were analyzed with: cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit and cost-consequence analyses. Articles were assessed for quality.
Results
A total of 11 898 articles were screened and seven were included. Most studies (4/7) were of overall moderate quality. All studies demonstrated cost effectiveness of CBPs. The average yearly net cost savings from the CBPs ranged from $252 847 (2019 $CAD) to $1 691 823 depending on the rate of discount (3% and 8%). The average incremental benefit cost ratio of CBPs varied from 2.48 to 7.66.
Conclusion
In order to make efficient use of resources and maximize health benefits, ongoing research in the economic evaluation of infection control should be carried out to support evidence-based healthcare policy decisions."

abstract = "SUMMARY
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic presents a significant infection prevention and control challenge. The admission of large numbers of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease risks overwhelming the capacity to protect other patients from exposure. The delay between clinical suspicion and confirmatory testing adds to the complexity of the problem.
Methods
We implemented a triage tool aimed at minimizing hospital-acquired COVID-19 particularly in patients at risk of severe disease. Patients were allocated to triage categories defined by likelihood of COVID-19 and risk of a poor outcome. Category A (low-likelihood; high-risk), B (high-likelihood; high-risk), C (high-likelihood; low-risk) and D (low-likelihood; low-risk). This determined the order of priority for isolation in single-occupancy rooms with Category A the highest. Patients in other groups were cohorted when isolation capacity was limited with additional interventions to reduce transmission.
Results
Ninety-three patients were evaluated with 79 (85%) receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis during their admission. Of those without a COVID-19 diagnosis: 10 were initially triaged to Category A; 0 to B; 1 to C and 4 to D. All high-risk patients requiring isolation were, therefore, admitted to single-occupancy rooms and protected from exposure. Twenty-eight (30%) suspected COVID-19 patients were evaluated to be low risk (groups C and D) and eligible for cohorting. No symptomatic hospital-acquired infections were detected in the cohorted patients.
Discussion
Application of a clinical triage tool to guide isolation and cohorting decisions may reduce the risk of hospital-acquired transmission of COVID-19 especially to individuals at the greatest of risk of severe disease."

abstract = "Introduction
Hospital admissions for non-COVID-19 pathology have significantly reduced. It is believed that this may be due to public anxiety about acquiring COVID-19 infection in hospital and the subsequent risk of mortality. There is an urgent need for clarity regarding patients who acquire COVID-19 in hospital (nosocomial COVID-19 infection [NC]), their risk of mortality, compared to those with community acquired COVID-19 (CAC) infection.
Methods
The COPE-Nosocomial Study was an observational cohort study. The primary outcome was the time to all-cause mortality (estimated with an adjusted hazards ratio [aHR]), and secondary outcomes were Day-7 mortality and the time-to-discharge. A mixed-effects multivariable Cox’s proportional hazards model was used, adjusted for demographics and comorbidities.
Results
Our study included 1564 patients from 10 hospital sites throughout the UK, and one in Italy, and collected outcomes on patients admitted up to 28th April, 2020. 12.5% of COVID-19 infections were acquired in hospital. 425 (27.2%) patients with COVID died. The median survival time in NC patients was 14 days, which compared to 10 days in CAC patients. In the primary analysis, NC infection was associated with reduced mortality (aHR=0.71, 95%CI 0.51-0.99). Secondary outcomes found no difference in Day-7 mortality (aOR=0.79, 95%CI 0.47-1.31), but NC patients required longer time in hospital during convalescence (aHR=0.49, 95%CI 0.37-0.66).
Conclusion
The minority of COVID-19 cases were the result of NC transmission. Whilst no COVID-19 infection comes without risk, patients with NC had a reduced risk of mortality compared to CAC infection, however, caution should be taken when interpreting this finding. In the United Kingdom, authority to conduct the study was granted by the Health Research Authority (20/HRA/1898), and in Italy by the Ethics Committee of Policlinico Hospital Modena (Reference 369/2020/OSS/AOUMO). Cardiff University was the study sponsor."

abstract = "Summary
Background
In late 2019, a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China. This virus has caused a global pandemic involving more than 200 countries. SARS-CoV-2 is highly adapted to humans and readily transmits from person-to-person.
Aim
The aim of this study was to investigate the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 under various environmental factors, disinfectants and different pH conditions. The efficacy of a variety of laboratory virus inactivation methods and home disinfectants against SARS-CoV-2 were investigated.
Methods
The residual virus in dried form or in solution was titrated on Vero E6 cell line at day 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 after incubation at different temperatures. The viability of virus was determined after treatment with different disinfectants and pH solutions at room temperature (20∼25oC).
Findings
SARS-CoV-2 was able to retain viability for 3-5 days in dried form or 7 days in solution at room temperature. SARS-CoV-2 could be detected under a wide range of pH conditions from pH4 to pH11 for several days and 1 to 2 days in stool at room temperature but lost 5 logs of infectivity. A variety of commonly used disinfectants and laboratory inactivation procedures were found to reduce viral viability effectively.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on environmental surfaces and raises the possibility of faecal-oral transmission. Commonly used fixatives, nucleic acid extraction methods and heat inactivation were found to significantly reduce viral infectivity that could ensure hospital and laboratory safety during the COVID-19 pandemic."

Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread."

Background
Globally, there have been many cases of COVID-2019 cases among medical staff, however, the main factors associated with the infection are not well understood.
Aim
To identify the super-factors causing COVID-19 infection in medical staff in China.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted between Jan. 1st, and Feb. 30th, 2020, where front line members of medical staff that took part in the care and treatment of patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Epidemiological and demographic data between infected and uninfected groups were collected and compared. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to establish socio-metric social links between influencing factors.
Findings
A total of 92 medical staff were enrolled. In all participant groups, the super-factor identified by the network was wearing a medical protective mask or surgical mask correctly (degree = 572; closeness =25; betweenness centrality = 3·23). Touching the cheek, nose, and mouth while working was the super-factor in the infected group. This was the biggest node in the network and had the strongest influence (degree = 370; closeness = 29; betweenness centrality = 0·37). Self-protection score was the super-factor in the uninfected group but was the isolated factor in the infected group (degree = 201; closeness = 28; betweenness centrality = 5·64). For family members, the exposure history to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and the contact history to wild animals were two isolated nodes.
Conclusion
High self-protection score was the main factor that prevented medical staff from contracting COVID-19 infection. The main factor that contributed to COVID-19 infections among medical staff was touching the cheek, nose and mouth while working."

abstract = "Background
The high demand for personal protective equipment during the novel coronavirus outbreak has prompted the need to develop strategies to conserve supply. Little is known regarding decontamination interventions to allow for surgical mask reuse.
Aim
Identify and synthesize data from original research evaluating interventions to decontaminate surgical masks for the purpose of reuse.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Global Health, the WHO COVID-19 database, Google Scholar, DisasterLit, preprint servers, and prominent journals from inception to April 8, 2020 for prospective original research on decontamination interventions for surgical masks. Citation screening was conducted independently in duplicate. Study characteristics, interventions, and outcomes were extracted from included studies by two independent reviewers. Outcomes of interest included impact of decontamination interventions on surgical mask performance and germicidal effects.
Findings
Seven studies met eligibility criteria: one evaluated the effects of heat and chemical interventions applied after mask use on mask performance, and six evaluated interventions applied prior to mask use to enhance antimicrobial properties and/or mask performance. Mask performance and germicidal effects were evaluated with heterogenous test conditions. Safety outcomes were infrequently evaluated. Mask performance was best preserved with dry heat decontamination. Good germicidal effects were observed in salt-, N-halamine-, and nanoparticle-coated masks.
Conclusion
There is limited evidence on the safety or efficacy of surgical mask decontamination. Given the heterogenous methods used in studies to date, we are unable to draw conclusions on the most efficacious and safe intervention for decontaminating surgical masks."

Inadequate supply of filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) for healthcare workers during a pandemic such as the novel coronavirus outbreak (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious public health issue.
Aim
To synthesize existing data on the effectiveness of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) for N95 FFR decontamination.
Methods
Systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020176156) on UVGI in N95 FFRs using Embase, Medline, Global Health, Google Scholar, WHO feed, and MedRxiv. Two reviewers independently determined eligibility and extracted predefined variables. Original research reporting on function, decontamination, or mask fit following UVGI were included.
Findings and Conclusions
Thirteen studies were identified, comprising 54 UVGI intervention arms and 58 N95 models. FFRs consistently maintained certification standards following UVGI. Aerosol penetration averaged 1.19% (0.70-2.48%) and 1.14% (0.57-2.63%) for control and UVGI arms respectively. Airflow resistance for the control arms averaged 9.79 mm H2O (7.97-11.70 mm H2O) vs 9.85 mm H2O (8.33-11.44 mm H2O) for UVGI arms. UVGI protocols employing a cumulative dose >20,000 J/m2 resulted in a 2 log reduction in viral load. A >3 log reduction was observed in seven UVGI arms using >40,000 J/m2. Impact of UVGI on fit was evaluated in two studies (16,200; 32,400 J/m2) and did not find evidence of compromise. Our findings suggest that further work in this area (or translation to a clinical setting) should use a cumulative UV-C dose of 40,000 J/m2 or greater, and confirm appropriate mask fit following decontamination."

The rapid growth of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, limited availability of personal protective equipment, and uncertainties regarding transmission modes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have heightened concerns for the safety of healthcare workers (HCWs). Systematic studies of occupational risks for COVID-19 in the context of community risks are difficult and have only recently started to be reported. Ongoing quality improvement studies in various locales and within many affected healthcare institutions are needed. A template design for small-scale quality improvement surveys is proposed. Such surveys have the potential for rapid implementation and completion, are cost-effective, impose little administrative or workforce burden, can reveal occupational risks while taking community risks into account, and can be repeated easily with short time intervals between repetitions. This article describes a template design and proposes a survey instrument that is easily modifiable to fit the particular needs of various healthcare institutions in the hope of beginning a collaborative effort to refine the design and instrument. These methods, along with data management and analytic techniques, can be widely useful and shared globally. The authors' goal is to facilitate quality improvement surveys aimed at reducing the risk of occupational infection of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic."

Background
Given the scarce therapeutic options for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE), aggressive interventions are implemented to limit its spread among hospitalized patients. One such option is contact isolation by cohorting patients in designated units.
Aim
To describe the experiences in cohort isolation units (CIUs) due to CPE from the perspectives of patients admitted to these units and their families, and those of health care workers (HCWs) who served in the same units.
Methods
A qualitative study. Face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were conducted in a large tertiary hospital. Twenty-four participants were interviewed, including 15 HCWs, 3 patients, and 6 family members. Data was coded using thematic analysis.
Findings
The CIU provoked negative feelings such as fear, risk, loneliness, distrust and unfairness. It also created a sense of conflict with the curative assumptions of hospital care. The poor CIU infrastructure was echoed in perceptions of crowdedness in the site. Moreover, family members described HCWs’ inconsistent protective behaviours that led them to a state of vigilance. The hospital infection control unit imparted and refreshed HCWs’ knowledge and expected behaviours regarding the CIU. However, patients and families expressed dissatisfaction with the information, guidance and education regarding the ‘why and how’ of the CIU. They were not guided consistently about recommended behaviours after discharge. In retrospective, HCWs found that the CIU took a psychological, physical and professional toll.
Conclusion
The CIU was planned as a temporary containment mechanism. It needs to develop into a permanent system, capable of addressing the various needs of all involved."

Background
In the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and unprecedented global demand, clinicians are struggling to source adequate access to personal protective equipment. Respirators can be in short supply, though are necessary to protect workers from SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Rapid decontamination and reuse of respirators may provide relief for the strained procurement situation.
Method
In this study, we investigated the suitability of 70°C dry heat and microwave-generated steam (MGS) for reprocessing of FFP2/N95-type respirators, and Type-II surgical face masks. Staphylococcus aureus was used as a surrogate as it is less susceptible than enveloped viruses to chemical and physical processes.
Results
We observed >4 log10 reductions in the viability of dry S. aureus treated by dry heat for 90 min at 70°C and >6 log10 reductions by MGS for 90 s. After 3 reprocessing cycles, neither process was found to negatively impact the bacterial or NaCl filtration efficiency of the respirators that were tested. However, MGS was incompatible with Type-II surgical masks tested, as we confirmed that bacterial filtration capacity was completely lost following reprocessing. MGS was observed to be incompatible with some respirator types due to arcing observed around some types of metal nose clips and by loss of adhesion of clips to the mask.
Conclusion
Considering the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, we propose a reprocessing personal protective equipment/face mask workflow for use in medical areas."

abstract = "SUMMARY
The transmission behaviour of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still being defined. It is likely that it is transmitted predominantly by droplets and direct contact and it is possible that there is at least opportunistic airborne transmission. In order to protect healthcare staff adequately it is necessary that we establish whether aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) increase the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Where we do not have evidence relating to SARS-CoV-2, guidelines for safely conducting these procedures should consider the risk of transmitting related pathogens. Currently there is very little evidence detailing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 associated with any specific procedures. Regarding AGPs and respiratory pathogens in general, there is still a large knowledge gap that will leave clinicians unsure of the risk to themselves when offering these procedures. This review aimed to summarize the evidence (and gaps in evidence) around AGPs and SARS-CoV-2."
